employer-provided accommodation. The proposals follow an extensive review and consultation, including an officials’ issues paper published in November 2012. The main changes are in relation to the treatment of employer-provided accommodation and accommodation payments, particularly when employees are on secondment or involved in a capital project. The accommodation will be tax-free up to certain time limits. The time limits are extended for Canterbury earthquake recovery projects. Other changes include better aligning the legislative treatment of meal payments with employer practice, which is to treat them as non-taxable in many cases, where they are not a salary substitute. Twenty five written submissions (from 20 submitters) addressed the employee allowances proposals. Generally submitters were supportive of the overall aims of the proposals, subject to areas where clarifications or amendments were sought. The majority of submissions were in relation to the proposed accommodation rules, including the rules regarding valuation of accommodation. 4 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION Issue: Support for accommodation framework Clauses 11, 12 and 20 Submissions (Business New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Business New Zealand submitted that the proposed changes were a positive and flexible step forward and should proceed. The remaining submitters also expressed support for the proposed reforms, subject to areas where they considered clarifications or amendments would be appropriate (captured below in specific submission points). Deloitte noted that this has been an area of uncertainty for taxpayers and any move to codify sensible rules that minimise compliance costs was appreciated. Ernst & Young noted its appreciation that the changes represented the outcome of a considerable amount of consultation. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants noted its support of the key policy objectives of improving clarity, certainty, fairness and efficiency. Comment The proposals in the bill take into account three key policy objectives:  to improve clarity and certainty, thereby improving compliance;  to improve fairness by ensuring employees pay their fair share of tax and that social assistance payments are targeted at those in genuine need; and  to enhance economic efficiency by ensuring that the tax rules in this area are not an impediment to business decision-making. Officials note the support for the general approach taken in the proposals and that, as mentioned by a number of submitters in written and oral submissions, the proposals have been developed following extensive consultation. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 5 Issue: “Net benefit” test Submission (KPMG) The submitter agrees with the guiding principle that accommodation, accommodation payments, and meal and clothing payments should be taxed as they provide a private or domestic benefit, but that in many cases this private benefit is either incidental to the business objective or is minimal or hard to measure and apportionment is not practical. In such cases the private benefit should be ignored. The historical approach taken by many taxpayers and their advisers has been to tax employer- provided accommodation only when there is a tangible benefit to the employee (that is, when the employee does not incur a cost from maintaining a home in their normal workplace). This ―net benefit‖ approach has been used to tax the private benefit, if any, enjoyed by the employee from receipt of accommodation. The submitter considers the net benefit approach gives the correct outcome and that the new rules appear to give much the same outcomes as this approach, and so it is not clear why the new rules are necessary. Instead, changes recommended by the 2010 Rewrite Advisory Panel should be retrospectively legislated so that the Commissioner’s Statement of December 2012 no longer has application. Comment The guiding principles that underlie the proposed changes are that where the payments or accommodation provide a private benefit they should generally be taxable except when they are low in value or hard to measure, and are not provided as a substitute for salary or wages. However, drafting legislation specifically on these principles would provide too much interpretative uncertainty and therefore potential inconsistency of application. For example, should ―low in value‖ be some absolute amount or vary depending on the circumstances, and ―hard to measure‖ is a subjective judgement. The proposed accommodation rules instead include a range of pragmatic tests to determine the boundary between when an accommodation benefit is private (taxable), and work-related (not subject to tax). As noted in the Regulatory Impact Statement, in coming to the approach proposed in the bill, other options were considered. One of those options was the ―net benefit test‖. Under this approach, when an employee maintains a home elsewhere for their use, it is argued there is no benefit from accommodation provided by the employer and, therefore, no tax should arise. Officials did not recommend this approach for several reasons, including:  If applied properly, it would require an ongoing subjective evaluation of an employee’s personal affairs to determine the correct tax outcome, involving additional administration and compliance costs. Likewise, determining the correct tax outcome may not be possible at the time of payment so a retrospective assessment could often be necessary, with attendant compliance and administrative costs. 6  It has no upper time limit so accommodation could potentially be tax-free for many years. Ultimately, there is a private benefit associated with the employer-paid or provided accommodation and the longer the payment/provision continues, the argument that the retention of the other property is an extra cost created by the secondment is less tenable, and more likely to be a personal choice of the employee.  It would present significant fairness and equity issues, with the potential for employees working side-by-side and incurring similar expenses having different tax and social assistance outcomes, depending on personal circumstances and how these are assessed in determining the taxable element of any accommodation payments.  The tax base risk as, whether or not provided as cash allowances, the accommodation is equivalent to cash. As the submitter has noted, for a number of years, many practitioners have applied a kind of net benefit test but, as the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s statement on accommodation of 6 December 2012 indicated, the test has no foundation in law. Officials remain of the view that the approach proposed in the bill is more appropriate and have noted that many submitters have welcomed the increased certainty and clarity this approach provides. The submitter has referred to the recommendations of the Rewrite Panel in 2010. Inland Revenue’s view is that the amendment made through the Rewrite process merely sought to restore a pre-existing ambiguity. Officials have also undertaken considerable policy work since this recommendation was made, resulting in the proposals contained in this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxable accommodation benefits and definition of “accommodation” Clause 11 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) The bill proposes amending section CE 1, which sets out what amounts of accommodation benefits are to be included in employment income. As drafted it arguably limits the amounts included in income. We suggest revising the amendment to include in a person’s income the value of accommodation, accommodation allowances or other payments or expenditure incurred on account of accommodation to the extent to which such items are included in income under sections CE 1B to CE 1D. (Ernst & Young) Clause 11 of the bill should be amended to clarify that ―accommodation‖ remains employment income under section CE 1, by retaining the current wording of section CE 1. (New Zealand Law Society) 7 The words ―board or lodging should be removed from clause 11 and replaced with ―accommodation‖. ―Board or lodging‖ is inconsistent with the rest of the Act. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The section YA 1 definition of ―accommodation‖ should be revised to include a reference to ―board or lodging‖ rather than that term being used on an apparently isolated basis in section CE 1(1)(bb). This would mean that the clause 32 amendment to section CX 28 would be unnecessary. (Ernst & Young) ―Market value‖ and ―board or lodging‖ should be removed from section CE 1(1)(bb) and replaced with ―the value of accommodation‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New section CE 1(1)(bb) is redundant as new section CE 1B will treat the market value of employment-related accommodation as income. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree there should be some clarification of the linkage between these taxing and valuation provisions. Officials recommend accepting the submission to remove ―market value‖ and ―board and lodging‖ from section CE 1(1)(bb) and replacing it with ―accommodation‖ and adding ―board and lodging‖ into the definition of ―accommodation‖. This means the provision for taxing accommodation would be section CE 1(1)(bb) with the various rules to value the accommodation in section CE 1B to CE 1E. The reference to ―benefit‖ in the current law should not be reinstated however. This is because the current reference to the ―benefit‖ of accommodation being taxable has led to confusion about what exactly is taxable, including arguments that the ―net benefit‖ test should be applied. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application of exemptions to payments Clauses 20, 33 and 34 Submission (Ernst & Young) The exemptions contained in proposed sections CW 16B to 16F (secondments and projects, conferences and overnight stays, and multiple workplaces) should also apply when employers make payments to enable the employee to obtain accommodation in these same circumstances. The same applies in respect of the Canterbury earthquake provisions in proposed sections CZ 29 and 30. 8 Comment No change is necessary as the situations raised in the submission are already covered in the draft legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Lump sum reimbursements Clause 20 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Some employers pay allowances as regular lump sum reimbursements based on estimates. Assuming the other criteria apply, confirmation is needed that this will be covered by proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(ii). We also suggest the inclusion in section CW 16B of a similar provision to the existing estimation provision in section CW 17(3). Comment As worded, the proposed provision in section CW 16B(1)(c)(ii) does not preclude the payment of a reasonable allowance or lump sum, rather than the actual amount incurred by the employee on accommodation. However we do agree that any allowance should be reasonable and therefore applying the criteria currently in section CW 17(3) that allow the employer to make a reasonable estimate of expenditure should be paralleled in section CW 16B. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “workplace” Clause 20 Submissions (Council of Trade Unions) ―Workplace‖ should be more clearly defined to fit all circumstances, including mobile workplaces. The definition in section 5 of the Employment Relations Act 2000 could be appropriate – ―a place where an employee works from time to time; and includes a place where an employee goes to work‖. 9 Alternatively, a more expansive definition from section 2 of the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992 could be considered, which defines ―place of work‖ as: A place (whether or not within or forming part of a building, structure, or vehicle) where any person is to work, is working, for the time being works, or customarily works, for gain or reward; and, in relation to an employee, includes a place, or part of a place, under the control of the employer (not being domestic accommodation provided for the employee), – (a) where the employee comes or may come to eat, rest, or get first-aid or pay; or (b) where the employee comes or may come as part of the employee’s duties to report in or out, get instructions, or deliver goods or vehicles; or (c) through which the employee may or must pass to reach a place of work. Comment Officials consider that the Employment Relations Act 2000 definition is no clearer than the one proposed in the bill. The second definition (from the Health and Safety in Employment Act 1992) is too constrained as it refers to places under the control of the employer. While that constraint may be appropriate for health and safety matters, the proposed amendments in the bill are intended to also cover situations when employees are working at places not under the control of the employer, such as the premises of a client of the employer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Accommodation subject to sections CW 16B to 16F Clause 11 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It should be made clear that treating ―accommodation‖ as employment income is subject to proposed new sections CW 16B to 16F. Comment Officials do not consider it necessary to expressly state that the treatment of accommodation as employment income is subject to sections CW 16B to 16F. Having a general rule with subsequent exemptions, as proposed in the bill, is consistent with the rest of the structure of the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 Issue: “Office or position” Clause 11 Submission (Ernst & Young) There should be clarification of any distinction between the terms ―office or position‖ and ―employment or service‖ in the context of section CE 1. Comment For the accommodation to be treated as employment income, the draft bill requires it to be provided to the person in relation to their employment or service. The current legislation requires accommodation to be provided in relation to the person’s office or position. The intention of using ―employment or service‖ is to update the provision to be consistent with the rest of the Income Tax Act. However we note that this may mean that accommodation provided by non-resident employers would inadvertently not be covered. Officials propose ensuring this does not occur by extending the definitions of ―employer‖ and ―employee‖ for the purposes of the allowances provisions. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that an extension to the definitions of ―employer‖ and ―employee‖ be included to ensure that accommodation provided by non-resident employers is not inadvertently excluded. Issue: Meaning of “living premises” Clause 11 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is unclear what ―living premises‖ in the definition of ―accommodation‖ refers to and what features would be required for something to be considered ―living premises‖. The meaning should be clarified. Comment The wording ―living premises‖ is contained in the existing definition of ―accommodation‖ and has therefore been included in the proposed revised definition for consistency. Officials are not aware of any issues with ―living premises‖ in the existing definition. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 Issue: Guidance on “reasonable daily travelling distance” Clause 20 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) Additional guidance should be provided on the scope of the term ―reasonable daily travelling distance‖ through examples provided in proposed new section CW 16B or in a determination issued by the Commissioner. Comment The concept of reasonable daily travelling distance is already contained in the Income Tax Act in relation to relocation payments (section CW 17B). Guidance was requested by taxpayers at the time this provision was introduced and was subsequently published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009). Officials will cross-reference to this Tax Information Bulletin in the edition that will be issued subsequent to the employee payments changes being enacted. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that officials will provide guidance on where to find information on ―reasonable travelling distance‖. Issue: Out-of-town secondment accommodation payments made by company employee is seconded to Clause 20 Submission (BDO Wellington Ltd) Proposed sections CW 16B and 16C provide time-limited exemptions for accommodation when an employee is working away from home on a secondment or capital project. In order to qualify, the accommodation must be provided or paid for by the employer. In situations when an employee is seconded by their employer, Company A, to another company (Company B) and the accommodation is provided by Company B, but the employee remains employed by and paid by Company A, the exemption would not be available. Comment Officials agree that, on the proposed wording, this situation would not receive the accommodation exemption contained in proposed section CW 16B. There does not appear to be any reason why the exemption should not apply in these circumstances and therefore officials recommend an amendment to include this situation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 12 Issue: Extension of two-year rule to new employees Clause 20 Submission (KPMG, Russell McVeagh) As currently drafted, the two-year exemption rule for out-of-town secondments does not apply to new employees of an employer. The exclusion of new employees is not warranted. Employers should not be penalised based on how they decide to resource a project (transferring an existing employee or hiring a new one). We understand the rule is aimed at avoiding salary sacrifice arrangements, but believe the conditions attached to the rule are sufficient to deal with abuse. It is unclear what a ―new employee‖ is – how long do they need to have been employed before they are no longer ―new‖? There is no such distinction in relation to the three-year exemption for capital projects, or the five-year exemption for the Canterbury rebuild. We see no reason to treat the two-year rule differently. Alternatively, proposed section CW 16E should be amended so that it contemplates a scenario where an individual is employed with a specific out-of-town secondment in mind, followed by the possibility of a period of work at a workplace that is not a distant workplace. Comment The exclusion of new employees from the out-of-town secondments rule was deliberate. As the submitter has noted, this is due to the potential for salary substitution arrangements in what can be a wide range of situations. While, as the submitter has stated, the exclusion of new employees does not apply in respect of the three-year exemption for capital projects and the up to five-year exemption for the Canterbury rebuild, this is to ensure that there is no disparity of treatment for new and existing employees working on the same project in what is considered to be more limited situations. Officials consider the more restrictive approach in relation to secondments is valid due to the risk of behavioural changes in the way new employees are remunerated – for example, contracts with new employees that would normally be for three years could be changed to two-year contracts to take advantage of the exemption. We note that new employees will qualify for the two-year exemption in some limited situations including when:  The employee is newly recruited to work at a particular work location but is then sent to work at another work location temporarily – for example, an individual is recruited to work in Auckland but is then sent to work in Dunedin for a month before returning to Auckland.  An employee working for one employer is seconded to work for another employer on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the employee will return to work for the original employer – for example, an individual working for an Australian accountancy firm is sent to work for an affiliated New Zealand firm in Auckland for 18 months. 13 Russell McVeagh has proposed amending proposed section CW 16E so that where an employee is hired for a specific out-of-town secondment but there is the possibility that a period of work will follow at a workplace that is not a distant workplace, then the two-year secondment exemption should apply. Officials consider this to be too low a threshold. As noted in the first of the above examples, when the new employee has been employed to work in a local workplace and is immediately sent to a distant workplace for a period with the expectation that they will return to the local workplace, the exemption will apply. There needs, however, to be a greater degree of certainty than the possibility that an employee may subsequently work at the local workplace in order to mitigate the salary substitution concerns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Distant workplace Clause 20 Submission (Council of Trade Unions, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of a ―distant workplace‖ that requires there to be a new workplace is problematic (proposed new section CW 16B(4)). We do not see that the word ―new‖ in this section serves a useful function and recommend it is removed, or replaced. We consider that this will potentially result in the exemptions not applying in situations where it is intended they apply. (Council of Trade Unions) The definition of ―distant workplace‖ refers to a new workplace not within reasonable daily travelling distance of the employee’s residence. This has the potential to create confusion – for example, if the employee temporarily relocates to the distance workplace, their residence is likely to be within reasonable travelling distance. (KPMG) Further guidance should be given on what constitutes an employee’s ―residence‖ for the purposes of the allowances rules. It will be clear in many circumstances – for example, when the employee’s family remain in their home location and the employee returns home at weekends. It is less clear if the employee’s spouse accompanies them to the secondment location, they rent out their family home and do not return there for the duration of the secondment. It is not clear in what situations, if any, an employee’s residence may be deemed to shift to the secondment location and therefore the exemptions become unavailable. There is real uncertainty as Inland Revenue has asserted, in relation to tax residency, that a home rented out to others can still constitute ―an abode available to the taxpayer‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The inclusion of the word ―new‖ was intended to emphasise that the employee needed to be going to a workplace other than their usual workplace. Officials agree that the use of the word ―new‖ may cause some confusion as suggested by the submitter, particularly in the context of the multiple workplace rule where some employees may go to the same places on a regular basis. We recommend that the word ―another‖ be used instead. 14 The employee’s residence being referred to is their residence before the secondment and the distance test is assessed at the time immediately before the commencement of the secondment, not after. This concept of ―residence‖ is also used in existing provisions in relation to relocation payments (section CW 17B) and officials are not aware that any issues have arisen in that context. Some guidance on this point can be included in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission regarding the word ―new‖ be partly accepted and that ―another‖ be used in its place. That the submission regarding residence be noted. Issue: Multiple workplace rule should apply to those with a home office Clause 20 Submission (Tax Team) Proposed section CW 16F(2)(b) should not preclude the application of the multiple workplace exemption if an employee has a workplace which is a home office, but that home office is not the ―distant workplace‖. Comment Proposed section CW 16F (multiple workplace rule) excludes employees who have two workplaces, one of which is a home office. This is to protect the revenue base from situations – for example, when an employee takes a permanent job that is located at a workplace that is distant from their home and, by virtue of working a small portion of time from home, gains tax- free accommodation (with no upper time limit) whenever they are working at their workplace rather than their home. This is contrasted with the intended coverage of the exemption, where an employee has a workplace near their home and is also required to work at other, distant, workplaces on either an ad hoc or regular basis. We note that in situations when an employee works from home and has two or more distant workplaces, accommodation at the second and subsequent distant workplaces would be exempt under section CW 16F. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Issue: Capital project exemption should be extended Clause 20 Submission (Council of Trade Unions) It is not clear why the extension to three years is only for capital projects. There could well be projects of substantial length that do not have the principal purpose to ―create, build, develop, restore, replace or demolish a capital asset‖. Employees could be required to move to work on other large projects lasting more than three years, such as to design and then implement major organisational change. The longer time limit should apply to any defined project. Comment The two and three-year time limits were set following extensive consultation. The November 2012 officials’ issues paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, proposed a time limit of one year for all secondments. Feedback suggested this would be too short for a significant proportion of temporary shifts such as work- related secondments. Consultation indicated that a two-year limit should cover the vast majority of cases. However there were still concerns in relation to longer-term projects particularly in the construction industry. The three-year extension for capital projects (and transitional five-year extension for Canterbury rebuild projects) was therefore proposed. Officials do not consider it is warranted to extend the proposed capital projects exemption to cover a wider group of projects. The extended exemption was developed in response to feedback from consultation and is intended to deal with situations such as large infrastructure projects in remote areas. Extending the three-year exemption to any project would effectively turn the proposed two-year secondment limit into a three-year limit, which in some cases would seem to be more than a temporary shift. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Associated person restriction should be removed from “project of limited duration” Clause 20 Submission (Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A ―project of limited duration‖ (three-year accommodation exemption) will exclude a project carried out under a contract between an employer and one or more persons associated with the employer. This restriction is not warranted and is not applied for out-of-town secondments (the two-year accommodation exemption). It is not uncommon to have transfers of personnel between related parties for project work, particularly trans-Tasman. Accommodation should be able to be exempted for up to three years provided all the other criteria are met. Paragraph (b) of the definition of ―project of limited duration‖ should therefore be removed. If there is an anti-abuse rationale for this provision, such concerns should be dealt with by way of a more targeted provision. 16 Comment The three-year exemption for projects of limited duration is designed for situations when employees are sent to work on large projects that their employer is contracted to deliver, or deliver aspects of, for an unrelated third party. In contrast, the two-year exemption contemplates secondments to another location carrying out their employment duties more generally – this could be work on internal or external projects. The three-year exemption is intended to be more limited than the two-year exemption, covering only the delivery of external projects. Extending the exemption to cover projects for associated parties would increase the fiscal risk of the proposal. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Change of expectation from over- to under-time limits Clause 20 Submissions (Ernst & Young, Council of Trade Unions) There should be express clarification of the intended treatment of secondments under proposed section CW 16B in relation to situations when initial employer expectations may have been for a secondment longer than two years (and therefore accommodation would be taxable) but those expectations subsequently change to a less than two-year secondment, or a change in circumstances causes the secondment to be cut short before its intended end, inside the two-year period. (Ernst & Young) In these situations the exemption on accommodation should become available, backdated to the start of the project or secondment. (Council of Trade Unions) Comment Officials agree that clarification is required on the treatment of secondments when the initial expectation is for a secondment of longer than two years but the expectation subsequently changes to less than two years. We recommend an amendment to the proposed definitions of ―out of town secondment‖ and ―project of limited duration‖ in section CW 16B(4) to clarify that to qualify for the exemption there must be an expectation, at the outset, that the period of the secondment or project will be within the respective two or three-year time limits. This means that if, during the course of the secondment the expectation changes from being over the time limits to within the time limits, the accommodation will still remain taxable. Accordingly, officials do not agree with the Council of Trade Unions’ submission that a retrospective exemption for the full period of accommodation should be available when an expectation subsequently falls within the time thresholds. If this approach were taken, taxpayers could potentially be switching backwards and forwards between taxable and non-taxable throughout the life of the secondment or project. This would add significant administrative and compliance costs which is inconsistent with a key aim of the proposed rules to improve certainty. 17 Recommendation That the submission be accepted in respect of clarifying that the expectation needs to be determined at the outset of the secondment or project, but declined in terms of being able to retrospectively revisit qualification for the exemption. Issue: Change of expectation from under to over time limits Clause 20 Submission (Council of Trade Unions) When an employer re-estimates the length of the project from being under the relevant two, three or five-year limit, to over the limit, the exemption for accommodation should continue to apply for the original two, three or five years. Comment A change in expectation will trigger a change in the prospective treatment of the accommodation, from the date of that change in expectation. The time limits are intended to be a maximum time limit, not a safe harbour, and therefore it is not appropriate to continue to receive an exemption when the expectation has changed. We note that the legislation ensures the exemption is not clawed back for the period before the change in expectation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of status of time limits Clause 20 Submission (KPMG) Proposed sections CW 16B and 16C should be reviewed to more clearly reflect the policy intent of the proposed exemption. It is not clear currently that the tests are a maximum threshold rather than a safe harbour. Comment Officials do not consider that the proposed rules require amendment as submitted. The legislation requires the exemption to be read in conjunction with the defined terms, in particular ―out-of-town secondment‖ or ―project of limited duration‖. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 18 Issue: Timing of change in expectation Clause 20 Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The point in time a change in expectation will be treated as having occurred (for the purpose of exemption time-limits) should be clarified as when the employer and employee have modified the terms of their employment in a way that binds both parties. (KPMG) Further guidance should be given in the legislation as to determining when a change in expectation occurs. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The point in time at which an expectation is treated as having changed is when the employer has a firm expectation that the secondment or project will last longer than initially expected. This may be evidenced by modification in the employee’s terms of employment, but in many cases there may not be such a written agreement. Rather there may be other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents, correspondence with the third party for whom the employer is undertaking the capital project and so on, that will suffice to demonstrate that the expectation has changed. Officials agree that further guidance might be helpful but do not consider that legislative change is necessary. It is not practical or appropriate to try and capture all the possible ways in which the expectation may be evidenced in the legislation. Rather, more detail can be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to noting officials will provide further guidance in the Tax Information Bulletin. Issue: Travel to distant workplace Clause 20 Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) It is not clear why proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii) has been included. Examples and further explanation would be helpful. Comment Proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii) is intended to cover accommodation provided while an employee is undertaking necessary travel to and from a distant workplace. This is in contrast to proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(ii) which covers the accommodation at the distant workplace. 19 Examples of accommodation covered by proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii) are:  where an employee is required to travel to London for work and it is necessary to stay a night in Hong Kong between flights; or  where an employee from Auckland is required to attend a meeting in Canberra that starts early in the morning. No direct flights are available from Auckland to Canberra and the first flight from Auckland on the day of the meeting would not reach Sydney in time to catch the necessary connecting flight to Canberra. The employee could either fly to Canberra the day before (in which case the accommodation would be covered under proposed section CW 16B(1)(c)(ii) or stay the night in Sydney and then take the first morning flight from Sydney to Canberra, in which case section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii) would apply. Officials have noted the submission and will include an example in the Tax Information Bulletin. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Application date Clause 34 Submission (Business New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The application date of the accommodation proposals should be backdated to 6 December 2008 at the election of the employer (four years before the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s Statement of 6 December 2012). Comment The general proposition put forward by a submitter in oral evidence was that taxpayer- favourable changes codifying existing practice should generally be applied retrospectively back four years (Corporate Taxpayers Group). The bill effectively achieves this as the proposed application date of the accommodation provisions is 1 April 2015, with employers being able to elect to apply the rules back to 1 January 2011 (provided they have not taken a tax position that the accommodation was taxable before 6 December 2012, the date of the Commissioner’s Statement outlining Inland Revenue’s interpretation of the law). Submitters expressed concern that the Commissioner’s Statement of 6 December 2012 altered what they considered to be current practice in relation to the treatment of allowances. They therefore submit the application of the new rules should be backdated to four years before the Commissioner’s Statement (6 December 2008). This is because the Statement required any voluntary disclosure in relation to expenditure on account (for example, when the employee entered into a tenancy agreement in their own name for the accommodation and the employer then paid the landlord directly) to be taken back four years. Disclosure in relation to actual accommodation and allowances need only go back two years from the date of the Commissioner’s Statement. 20 Officials do not consider that the application of the proposed changes should be backdated to 2008. The proposed optional retrospective application is designed to give employers the option of applying the new rules in place of the Commissioner’s Statement in the period between the issuing of that Statement and the application date of 1 April 2015, and to allow a further two years backdating to create some equivalence with the rule for the Canterbury earthquake rebuild. Allowing application back to 6 December 2008 would be a retrospective application of more than eight years which officials consider would potentially give rise to significant administrative costs and undermine the finality of tax positions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Retrospective application should apply regardless of pre-December 2012 position Clause 34 Submission (Tax Team) Proposed section CZ 30 should allow the application of the proposed sections CE 1B and CW 16B to CW 16F (the accommodation provisions) to taxpayers who have paid tax in relation to the provision of accommodation before 6 December 2012. Accordingly, proposed section CZ 30(2) should be deleted. Comment This submission is a variant of the preceding submission on the retrospective application date. Taxpayers have submitted that there was uncertainty about the treatment of accommodation following the Commissioner’s Statement of 6 December 2012 as, in their view, this changed Inland Revenue’s previous position. The transitional provision takes account of this view taken by taxpayers by allowing the employer to elect to apply the proposed new rules rather than those outlined in the Commissioner’s Statement, so long as a tax position has not been taken before the Statement that the accommodation was taxable. This means anyone having taken a position after 6 December 2012 generally will not be disadvantaged by having treated the accommodation as either taxable or non-taxable. We consider that people should be bound by their tax positions before 6 December 2012 as these positions are based on the particular facts in each case and are likely to be appropriately based on the law as it was being interpreted and applied at that time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 21 Issue: Amendments to proposed section CZ 30 Clause 34 Submission (Tax Team) Proposed section CZ 30 should make it clear that proposed sections CE 1B and CW 16B to CW 16F apply to a taxpayer’s provision of accommodation (or incurring of related expenditure) from 1 January 2011, notwithstanding that the provision of such accommodation may have begun before 1 January 2011. Comment Officials agree that accommodation or accommodation expenditure provided or incurred from 1 January 2011 should fall within the proposed new rules. We consider that the legislation does allow for the portion provided or incurred on or after 1 January 2011 to be covered by the rules (but not the portion provided or incurred before 1 January 2011) provided the other relevant criteria, such as the expectation test, are met. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that the proposed legislation should already allow some portion of accommodation straddling the 1 January 2011 application date to be treated as non- taxable provided the other criteria, such as the expectation test, are met. Issue: Choice to backdate application Clause 34 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The bill allows employers to elect to apply the new accommodation provisions retrospectively, but does not cover the employee’s ultimate obligation to pay tax on all taxable income. The provision should either be extended to cover this obligation or it should be clarified that there is no obligation on the employee to account for any unpaid tax. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Employees should also be able to elect to apply the rules retrospectively. In situations when the amount was treated as taxable, but would not be under the new rules, employees may want to apply the new rules but there is no guarantee employers will want to re-file past returns. Employees should therefore also have the option to apply the transitional provisions to reopen past tax assessments and receive a refund of PAYE deducted. (KPMG) 22 Comment The bill proposes allowing the accommodation provisions to be applied retrospectively by the employer as it is the employer that has the obligation to deduct PAYE in respect of the employee’s taxable employment income. We do not consider it necessary to also provide an option for the employee as the employer and employee ought, as necessary, to discuss what option should be taken by the employer. Legislating for the employee to take a position could lead to considerable confusion and complexity if the employer and employee take different tax positions. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Treatment of applications to re-file before bill passed Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Taxpayers require certainty over how Inland Revenue will treat applications to re-file PAYE and individual income tax returns before the passage of the bill. In addition, the recovery of PAYE could result in the reassessment of an employee’s tax returns. If there is a reassessment of an employee’s tax returns that increases their residual income tax liability, confirmation is sought that the use-of-money interest rules will not apply. Comment The proposed rules are not planned to come into effect until the bill has been enacted. Applications to re-file in order to take advantage of the retrospective election to apply the new rules therefore cannot take place until the new rules are in effect. If a reassessment results in tax being payable, the use-of-money interest rules will apply, as usual. For example, if a taxpayer has taken a net benefit approach, and is not covered by the proposed exemptions, they will be taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 23 Issue: Canterbury earthquake measures application date Clauses 33 and 34 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clauses 33 and 34 propose new transitional rules providing specific periods for accommodation exemptions in relation to employees working in the Canterbury area following the 2010–11 earthquakes. The exemptions would apply from 4 September 2010 unless the accommodation has been treated as taxable before 6 December 2012. These exemptions should not be excluded from applying if the accommodation was treated as taxable before 6 December 2012. Comment The restriction on backdated application where accommodation has been treated as taxable before 6 December 2012 does not apply in respect of proposed section CZ 29 which contains the Canterbury accommodation transitional rules. Officials note, however, that this could be made clearer by expressly stating that the restriction does not apply to section CZ 29. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that officials will ensure the section is clarified to reflect the position that the Canterbury earthquake accommodation rules will apply back to 4 September 2010 regardless of the tax position taken before 6 December 2012. Issue: Generic rule should be added for adverse events Clause 33 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We support the specific Canterbury rules but consider it appropriate to add generic rules for accommodation provided or paid for by employers carrying out rebuild work after an event in the nature of an ―adverse event‖ or other event declared by the Governor-General by Order in Council. Comment While officials appreciate that there might be some administrative case in having generic rules for adverse events, we consider that there are too many variables to have a set of generic rules for adverse events. Events of the magnitude of the Canterbury earthquakes clearly require significant rebuild projects that justify extended timeframes, but this may not be true of all adverse events. As the general rules regarding two and three-year exemptions will apply in the first instance, officials consider it preferable to deal with adverse events on a case-by-case basis. If more time is needed, this can be assessed and legislated for at the time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 24 Issue: Exceptional circumstances – Canterbury provisions Clause 33 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) An ―exceptional circumstances‖ provision is included in proposed new section CW 16C. The Canterbury provision (proposed section CZ 29) effectively mirrors, with more concessionary time limits, the exempt income rules in proposed section CW 16B and 16C but does not contain an ―exceptional circumstances‖ provision. This should be included. Comment As the submitter has noted, there is an ―exceptional circumstances‖ provision included in proposed section CW 16C. This provision also applies for Canterbury accommodation. Proposed section CZ 29 alters the time limits in section CW 16C in respect of Canterbury rebuild-related accommodation, but the remainder of the rules in that section continue to apply, including the ―exceptional circumstances‖ provision. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Increased monitoring requirements resulting from the new rules Submission (Business New Zealand) The proposed changes mean that businesses’ payroll and finance teams will need to be extra vigilant about any changes in circumstances that often occur with projects as they progress. Changes in expectations, meaning a secondment will last more than two or three years will affect the tax treatment of accommodation payments. It is important therefore that businesses are provided with sufficient information about when Inland Revenue believes expectations are changed (how probable does the expectation need to be) and how this should be documented, particularly over the next few years, to minimise tax compliance errors. Comment Officials note the submitter’s comments regarding additional monitoring regarding expectations. The new rules are designed to increase certainty, thereby reducing compliance costs compared with other options. However, we acknowledge that there will still be some compliance costs involved in ensuring employers meet the rules. We note also that the proposed time limits for exempt accommodation are more generous than those currently applicable following the Commissioner’s Statement on accommodation of 6 December 2012. 25 As noted in comments on earlier submissions, officials also propose including some comment regarding expectations in relation to time limits in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 26 EMPLOYEE ACCOMMODATION – DETERMINING TAXABLE VALUE Issue: Accommodation provided where the employee normally works shifts at a distant workplace for regular periods from which they cannot return home on a daily basis Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Seaworks) Submitters have raised concerns about particular situations when an employee is required to stay at their workplace because they are unable to return home to their normal residence at the end of their working shift. It should be made clear how to treat these situations when accommodation is provided where no alternative is available – for example, oil rigs or overnight ferries. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Confirmation is sought that shift workers accommodated on drilling rigs or offshore platforms for the length of their shifts (which are often multi-week) are not taxable under the new rules, or if they are then a change to the bill is sought. (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of NZ) Clarification is sought over whether unusual situations such as oil rig workers are going to be addressed via legislation or determinations issued by Inland Revenue. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A specific exemption is required for workers when it is not possible to return to their normal residence at the end of the shift – for example, employees who work on ships. (Seaworks) Comment Officials agree that accommodation in these types of situations should be exempted on the basis that the accommodation does not constitute normal long-term living premises. Other examples might include double-cab trucks which may be used occasionally for sleeping in, and accommodation provided for workers in Antarctica. The private benefit in such cases is likely to be small or hard to measure. We therefore consider accommodation provided for employees on oil rigs, ships, trucks or other similar workplaces or at Scott Base should be excluded from the definition of ―accommodation‖ if, because of the requirements of their employment, the employee is unable to return home during the period of the performance of their duties. Similarly, such things as beds provided at a fire or ambulance station should not be considered accommodation (and therefore exempted) as their use by an employee is confined to the employee’s shift and therefore not available as a normal residence. While we have endeavoured to identify all such cases, there may be some identified after the legislation is passed. To deal with specific cases, we recommend the Governor-General having a regulatory power to exempt on a case-by-case basis through an Order in Council. 27 Recommendation That the submission be generally accepted. Officials recommend a specific exemption of identified cases and an exemption mechanism via an Order in Council be used to deal with any similar cases that are subsequently identified. Issue: FIFO workers’ accommodation Clause 20 Submission (KPMG) Related to the above submission, concerns arise in respect of fly-in fly-out (FIFO) workers where an employee is flown to the work site for a number of days and is then flown back to their home base/country for a number of days of rest. This is common in mining industries. FIFOs should be included in the multiple workplace rule. Comment Officials note there will be a range of situations that could be described as FIFO. There will be some FIFO workers who fall within one of the proposed accommodation exemptions, in which case they can apply those rules. For example, an employee who is sent to work on a roading project in the Pacific Islands for a period of 18 months and who works two weeks on and one week off, and flies home for that one week off. This situation would be covered by the ―project of limited duration‖ exemption and therefore the Pacific Island accommodation would be exempt. The issue of FIFO workers is likely to be confined to those who are either employed directly in a FIFO role (rather than a secondment or project situation) and/or those undertaking long-term FIFO work. The issue for FIFO workers working at overseas locations is more one of compliance costs given there will be no PAYE deduction as their employers are non-resident) and therefore the employee will need to include the accommodation in their tax return and establish its value. However, this is arguably a result of the employee’s decision to reside well away from their place of employment. As a general rule, therefore, their accommodation should be taxed at market value. We do not consider it appropriate to extend the multiple workplace rule as suggested. As we understand the submission, it would involve extending the rule to cover workers who have only one workplace and that workplace is distant from their home. While the submission refers to workers in mines overseas, we do not consider this situation is any different to a worker who lives in Wellington and accepts a permanent job in Auckland but chooses to keep their family in Wellington and commute. In these situations, accommodation should be taxable as the employee has chosen to work well away from their place of residence. We note also however, that in situations when the accommodation provided to the FIFO worker is of the type discussed in the preceding submission (for example, oil rigs) they will be exempt on that basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Issue: Mobile workers and multiple workplace rule Clause 20 Submission (Council of Trade Unions) The circumstances of mobile workers (workers on passenger or freight road, rail, ships and aeroplanes) should be more clearly addressed with respect to the exemption of accommodation. For these workers it is not their place of work that changes as they drive, sail or fly from place to place, but rather their position relative to their usual residence. It is not clear from the current wording that these workers could access the multiple workplace exemption. We suggest expressing the entitlement in terms of changes in ―accommodation base‖ or similar, rather than ―workplace‖. Comment This submission also relates to the earlier submission regarding workers who cannot return home at the end of their shift. The multiple workplace rule is intended to cover situations when an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an on-going basis. In some of the cases referred to it is possible the multiple workplace rule as drafted will apply – for example, if they have duties at the location they travel to, as well as on the vehicle they travel on. In other cases, for example, if all their employment duties are carried out on the vessel, the multiple workplace rule would not apply. Officials agree these situations should be exempt as the accommodation provided is not what would be considered to be normal/long-term living accommodation. As discussed above, we consider accommodation at workplaces provided when the employee is unable to leave at the end of their shift should be exempted. This exemption should deal with the situations raised in this submission. Recommendation That the submission accepted in part, in terms of agreeing that these types of accommodation should be exempt. Issue: Valuation of accommodation when the employer requires the employee to live “on the job” Submission (Dilworth Trust Board, Ernst & Young, Independent Schools of New Zealand, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Certain employees, such as boarding school staff, are required to live in particular accommodation on their employer’s premises as part of their employment. In many cases these premises are located in high-value areas. Obligations placed on these staff, such as health and safety requirements, and the location of the accommodation (for example, in close proximity to, or within, boarding schools) hinder the ―quiet enjoyment‖ of the accommodation. Submitters consider that such accommodation has only an incidental private benefit, and therefore taxation on the full market rental value is not appropriate. 29 Submitters’ preference is for a legislative exemption from taxation in circumstances when:  the employee is required to live in particular employer-provided accommodation in order to perform their employment duties;  there are health and safety rules and regulations imposed on an employer in conducting its business which require the employee to live in employer-provided accommodation;  the employee has significant restrictions imposed which restrict their freedom and enjoyment in occupying the employer-provided accommodation; and  there is no salary sacrifice arrangement. (Dilworth, Independent Schools, KPMG) If a total exemption is not provided, submitters alternatively seek (in order of preference) and in the above circumstances:  a cap on the taxable benefit – capped at a percentage of the employee’s salary, similar to the approach proposed in the bill for ministers of religion; or  a discount to the market rental value. (Dilworth, Independent Schools) Dilworth Trust Board, in supplementary submissions, has made clear that it considers the only appropriate option to be a complete exemption. Ernst & Young suggests the issue should be dealt with by way of providing an additional adjustment when accommodation is ―on the job‖ and does not provide full, uninterrupted possession, use and enjoyment because the employee is on call or needs to be available to attend to others’ needs. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants also submitted that a discount should be applied when the employee did not have ―quiet enjoyment‖, citing examples of Department of Conservation workers in a DOC hut, wardens in student hostels, caretakers or live-in managers of a lodge, hotel, or motel, and live-in care providers in care facilities and rest homes. ―Quiet enjoyment‖ is a key factor in determining market value – it would be normal commercial practice to reduce rents if quiet enjoyment cannot be provided or is impaired. If the primary submission regarding an exemption or special valuation rule for ―on the job‖ accommodation is not accepted, there should be a power for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine the taxable value of employer-provided accommodation. Alternatively, or additionally, the Commissioner should issue guidance on the factors to be taken into account in determining market rental valuations to provide practical guidance to taxpayers. There will be cases when it is impractical to use or ascertain market value in some situations – for example, when an employer provides accommodation to a large number of employees across a wide geographic area or when accommodation provided is in excess of the employee’s everyday needs. In such cases, taxpayers should be able to seek a determination of the taxable value from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 30 Comment The general issue of accommodation for employees that is situated at their place of work was considered in the course of the allowances review. Officials considered that taxing the accommodation benefit in these situations at its market value would be appropriate, on the basis that even though there may be some significant drawbacks to ―living on the job‖, an employee for whom the work premises are their permanent residence may still obtain a substantial private benefit, even if there is a work need for them to live on the property. Other options that were considered for the treatment of such accommodation were:  taxing the full market value adjusted for a range of factors;  capping the taxable element at a benchmark value; and  capping the taxable element as a proportion of salary. These three options were not preferred because they risked not capturing the full private benefit, leading to risks of salary substitution. Each also had administrative and compliance cost issues – for example, benchmark values require appropriate reference properties to be identified and agreed, and capping at a proportion of salary would mean that employees with variable reward structures (such as overtime or performance pay) would likely need an end-of-year adjustment to the taxable amount. The preferred option, and that contained in the bill, is to tax the market rental value. While this type of accommodation may be affected by a number of factors that make it less attractive than a similar property nearby, factors that are specific to the property would affect the market rental value and should be able to be factored in by a valuer. There may also be factors linked to the employee and their job, such as the obligation to live in a particular property not of their choosing. These factors are unlikely to be reflected in the market value of the property as they can vary between individuals, depending on their perceptions and personal circumstances. However, an employee will often take into account the provided accommodation in their decision to take a job. An employer will also often factor this in when setting the overall remuneration package. One of the policy criteria for the treatment of allowances is ensuring the overall private benefit to the employee is recognised. A market rental value should take account of the value of the particular property (including factors specific to that property) and the wider remuneration package should reflect any disadvantages particular to the employee. Therefore, no further adjustment should be necessary to the market value of the property or to the taxable amount of any accommodation payment. For these reasons, officials do not consider it necessary to include a special rule to deal with employees who are provided with accommodation on or near the workplace, as a result of a business need of the employer. If the property is subject to particular factors or restrictions on the employee’s use or enjoyment of the property, these factors and restrictions should affect the market rental value and be able to be factored in by valuers. With regard to the submissions on providing a determination-making power or guidelines, officials note that Inland Revenue is intending to issue guidelines on the factors to be taken into account when undertaking a market rental valuation. 31 Officials do not consider a power to determine the taxable value, or approve taxpayers’ determinations of the taxable value is appropriate. This would potentially involve significant administrative costs. Recommendation That the submission regarding special legislative treatment of ―on the job‖ accommodation be declined. However, to help taxpayers understand what sorts of factors and restrictions might affect market rental value assessments, Inland Revenue is intending to issue operational guidance in this area. Issue: Total exemption should be granted for ministers of religion Clause 24 Submission (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) The proposal in clause 24, inserting a new section CW 25B, continues with some adjustments the administrative position regarding accommodation for ministers of religion that has been in place since 1957. This position caps the taxable value of such accommodation at 10 percent of the minister’s remuneration. A total exemption is sought, consistent with the position in Australia, the USA, Canada and the United Kingdom. This would avoid administrative complexity with little revenue effect. Comment Officials’ preference regarding valuation is for a market rental value approach to be applied generally. In relation to ministers of religion however, as the submission indicates, there has been a longstanding administrative practice that has capped the benefit of church-owned accommodation at 10 percent of stipend. This practice has been codified in proposed section CW 25B, on the basis that removing the existing practice would place significant additional cost at relatively short notice on individual churches at a time when they have other significant financial obligations, such as making earthquake strengthening repairs. Ministers’ social assistance entitlements (such as Working for Families tax credits) and obligations (such as the repayment of student loans) would also be affected. Continuation of this practice would be subject to the tax-exempt amount being capped at a reasonable rental value to reflect the original expectation inherent in the administrative practice that the accommodation provided to ministers would be modest. This proposal was not intended to be a general tax exemption for ministers of religion. By simply codifying current practice, compliance costs should not be materially changed and the 10 percent of stipend rule represents a significant discount to market value in most cases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 Issue: Simplification of proposed section CW 25B Clause 24 Submission (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) If a total exemption is not provided to ministers of religion, proposed new section CW 25B could be simplified. The formula approach is unnecessarily complex and reference to rental value is not required. Rather, it is possible to just calculate the deemed income that is liable to tax. Comment Officials agree that the same outcome can be achieved by including a simplified formula in the taxing provision without reference to market value. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Adjustment for work use of church-provided accommodation Clause 24 Submission (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) The adjustment component of the valuation formula for accommodation provided to ministers of religion gives rise to unnecessary administrative costs. Past practice has been to use a 15 percent adjustment where a study or office is provided in the house. The new rules will require measurements to be taken in every property to apportion the floor area between private and work use. Continuation of the 15 percent approach would be appropriate. In addition, the adjustment as drafted applies only to areas used ―exclusively‖ for work purposes. We submit that this should be ―predominantly‖ as areas used for work will also have some element of private use. Comment Officials consider that the ―adjustment for work‖ use should apply only when such use occurs rather than as a uniform 15 percent across all properties. We do, however, agree that requiring the area to be used exclusively for work purposes is too restrictive. We note that other submitters have also raised the issue of the word ―exclusively‖ in the general accommodation taxing provision (discussed later in this section). We agree that the word ―exclusively‖ should be replaced, but recommend using ―wholly‖ or ―mainly‖ as ―predominantly‖ is not a commonly used term in the Income Tax Act. 33 Recommendation That the submission regarding a 15 percent adjustment be declined, but that the submission in relation to ―exclusively‖ be partly accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Adjustment for employee contribution to church-provided accommodation Clause 24 Submission (KPMG) New section CW 25B(4) should include an adjustment to market rental value if there is a contribution towards rent by the employee (that is, an adjustment that would otherwise be made under section CW 16B(4)(b)). Comment The 10 percent of stipend rule is generous relative to market value and reducing the taxable amount further for any contribution from the minister does not seem appropriate. Furthermore, the recommended drafting will not refer to market value. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Ministers of religion employed by charities Clause 24 Submission (KPMG, The Selwyn Foundation) As drafted, the rule regarding valuation of accommodation provided to ministers of religion will not be applicable when the accommodation is provided directly by a charitable organisation. This means some hospices and rest homes run by charitable organisations with in-house chaplains will not qualify. Proposed section CW 25B should be amended to ensure these situations are covered. (KPMG) Proposed section CW 25B relates to accommodation provided by a religious body or organisation, however, this is not defined. Certain charities affiliated with churches engage ministers to work with residents of retirement villages, and similar situations arise in regard to hospices and rest homes with in-house chaplains. A definition of ―religious society or organisation‖ should be included in the bill to ensure these situations are covered. (The Selwyn Foundation) 34 Comment The focus of the 10 percent rule is those situations previously covered by the longstanding administrative practice, which is accommodation provided by the churches. The specific provision is for reasons of the financial disruption that might arise in relation to the housing already provided if market value was suddenly applied. While there may arguably be some equity issues relative to chaplains in hospices, schools and rest homes, there is also a counter equity argument in relation to other employees who do not receive discounted housing. Including these affiliated groups would widen the coverage beyond the longstanding practice and open up scope for additional housing benefits to be provided to employees in the charitable sector, instead of salary increases. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definition of “minister of religion” Clause 24 Submission (Inter-Church Working Party on Taxation) The definition has been broadened from traditional definitions to incorporate ministers of non- Christian religions, as it should be. However, the new wording has the potential to create uncertainties and departs from that which has been accepted since 1993. The 1993 definition should continue in the legislation, with references to ―church‖ replaced with ―religion‖, and restricted to charities registered under the Charities Act. Comment Officials agree that the definition could be further refined, but consider that the definition proposed by the submitter can be simplified. Recommendation That the submission be partly accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 35 Issue: Meaning of “market rental value commensurate with duties” Clause 24 Submission (KPMG) Clarification is needed on the meaning of a market rental value that is ―reasonably commensurate with the duties of the person as a minister and for the location in which they perform their duties‖ in proposed section CW 25B(3)(a)(iii). Comment The intention of the provision is to ensure that the accommodation provided to a minister of religion that is subject to the special valuation rule of limiting taxable value to 10 percent of stipend is of a standard and in a location that is appropriate for the minister’s role. As noted earlier, this reflects the original expectation inherent in the administrative practice that the accommodation would be modest. For example, it would be expected that the accommodation is located within or close to the area in which the minister’s congregation resides, rather than in an expensive suburb some distance away. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Adjustment for use of accommodation for business purposes Clause 12 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The legislation as drafted allows an adjustment to the taxable market rental value of accommodation where part of the accommodation is used ―exclusively‖ for business purposes. The standard of ―exclusively‖ is too high and should be changed to ―predominantly‖. Comment Officials agree that there may be problems with the use of ―exclusively‖. However we recommend using the words ―wholly or mainly‖ instead as ―predominantly‖ is not a commonly used term in the Income Tax Act. Recommendation That the submission be partly accepted, with the word ―exclusively‖ being replaced by ―wholly or mainly‖. 36 Issue: Adjustments to taxable value of accommodation and accommodation payments Clause 12 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed new section CE 1B(4) allows adjustments to reduce the taxable value where employees are sharing the accommodation, employees make a contribution towards the accommodation, or when part of the premises is used exclusively for work purposes. Similar adjustments should be able to be made, as appropriate, when allowances or other payments are made – for example, when part of the premises is used for work. (Ernst & Young) Section CE 1B(4)(b) as currently worded implies an adjustment for an employee contribution would only be made when an employer incurred external costs in providing accommodation and seems to assume these costs would equate to a market rental value. All employee contributions or payments should be taken into account when determining the taxable income amount. (Ernst & Young) Apportionments under section CE 1B(4)(a) for employees sharing the premises should be allowed to be made on an alternative reasonable basis. As drafted the bill requires equal apportionment between employees. This may not always produce the most appropriate result. Allowing an alternative approach would allow appropriate distinctions to be made – for example, when there is not equal sharing in terms of space, facilities or time used. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment As the submissions note, proposed section CE 1B(4) specifically provides for adjustments to reduce the taxable amount to take into account employees sharing accommodation, employee contributions and use of the property for work purposes. These adjustments are already available under existing law but are not stated in the provisions determining the value of the accommodation benefit. Accordingly, section CE 1B(4) is intended to provide greater certainty for taxpayers. It is not the intention to tighten the adjustments that are currently available. These adjustments are primarily relevant when accommodation is directly provided by the employer. However, as the Ernst & Young submission notes, it may be appropriate to take into account business use of the premises even when the employer provides an allowance or reimbursement. Ernst & Young have also indicated that an employee may also make a contribution when they receive an allowance. Accordingly, we recommend these situations be reflected in the proposed legislation. With regard to section CE 1B(4)(b) (employee contributions), the intention is that all employee contributions should be recognised. With regard to section CE 1B(4)(a) (shared accommodation), officials initially considered allowing apportionment between employees on an equal or unequal basis. However, for simplicity, an approach of equal apportionment is preferred. 37 Recommendation That the submission in relation to employee contributions and business use be accepted. That the submission regarding allowing unequal apportionment be declined. Issue: Valuation of overseas accommodation Clause 12 Submissions (Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As currently worded, proposed section CE 1C appears to give employers the choice of median or average market rental values. These may differ significantly. The rules need to be made clearer. (Ernst & Young, KPMG) One of these terms should be removed or, if the intention is to give a choice, an explanation should be given. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Inland Revenue should provide guidance on acceptable New Zealand market rental benchmarks. (KPMG) The current drafting is unclear about whether the New Zealand equivalent value can be determined with reference to just one of the three factors set out in the proposed section, rather than all three. It is also unclear whether the New Zealand value to be considered is to be a proxy for the employee living within a reasonable travelling distance of their place of employment and for comparable accommodation. The wording needs to be amended to clarify the policy intention. (KPMG) Comment The section is intended to give employers the choice of median or average market values. Officials understand that some employers use the average market rental but there are also employers who use the median, hence the choice. The fact that there is a choice could be made clearer in the legislation. We agree the proposed section is unclear about whether one or all of the three factors set out in the provision must apply and recommend amending the section to make clear that it is intended all three factors are applied. The cap on the value is the median or average value where the employee would be living if they were working for their employer in New Zealand – for example, if the employer is based in Wellington, the New Zealand value to be used would be a Wellington value, unless the value of the overseas accommodation is less. Officials do not consider that clarification is needed in the legislation but will include some discussion in the Tax Information Bulletin, including sources such as the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s data on market rental values. 38 Recommendation That the submissions be noted and that section CE 1C be made clearer that there is a choice of using average or median values. Officials also recommend amending proposed section CE 1C to make clear that the three factors set out in the section must all be met, rather than just any one of the three. Issue: Defence valuation rule should be extended to cover police housing Clause 12 Submission (Police Association) Proposed section CE 1D provides an exception to the general rule that the taxable value of accommodation is the market rental value of that accommodation. This exception applies to housing provided by the New Zealand Defence Force. We submit that police housing, particularly in hard-to-fill, remote locations, should also be covered by the specific Defence rule in proposed section CE 1D. There are around 250 houses in hard-to-fill locations. Comment As a general rule officials consider all accommodation should be valued on a market rental value basis, which under normal circumstances should take into account any factors specific to the property. However, given the compulsion on New Zealand Defence Force personnel to accept a posting anywhere in New Zealand, the New Zealand Defence Force has historically considered it appropriate to take a national approach to considering market rental value of New Zealand Defence Force accommodation. Additionally, the New Zealand Defence Force had an historic administrative arrangement with Inland Revenue over how market value was to be discounted to take into account the range of specific restrictions applying to their housing. The Government agreed that these arrangements should be reflected in the proposed legislation given the unique nature of the accommodation arrangements. While, as the submitter has noted, there are a number of similarities between the Police and the Defence Force, we consider there are sufficient differences given the historical positions and the level of compulsion associated with accepting postings to different locations. We do not therefore consider that the exemption should be extended to police housing. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 39 MEALS Issue: Support for proposed meal exemptions Clause 22 Submissions (Business New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Council of Trade Unions, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters were generally supportive of the proposed meal exemption, subject to various comments which are captured in specific submissions below. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Inclusion of allowance, daily allowance and reimbursement in exempt income Clause 22 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young) Based on a literal reading of proposed section CW 17CB(1) allowances, daily allowances and reimbursement payments may not be included, as the section applies to ―expenditure the employer incurs for or on behalf of an employee for a meal‖. We suggest including a statement along the lines of, ―This includes a reimbursement payment or an allowance to an employee for a meal‖. Comment The focus of the provision is payments in relation to meals. This could be made a little clearer in section CW 17CB(1). For example, meals provided by the employer on the employer’s premises are not intended to be covered as they will remain fringe benefits and subject to any exemptions under the FBT rules. This point is discussed in the next submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that the legislation be clarified so that the proposed coverage of the provision includes meal reimbursement payments and meal allowances. 40 Issue: Provision to clarify relationship with FBT rules Clause 22 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The FBT rules are intended to take precedence over proposed section CW 17CB, meaning that meals provided directly by an employer to an employee would continue to be potentially subject to the FBT rules. We submit that clause 22 should be amended to clarify that the direct provision of a meal by an employer is subject to the FBT rules. Comment As the submitter has noted, this matter was discussed with officials before the introduction of the bill but could not be included in time for the bill’s introduction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ensure clarity between allowances, FBT and entertainment tax rules for on- premises meals Clause 22 Submissions (Business New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Further analysis should be undertaken to ensure there are no gaps between the interactions of the proposals in the bill, the FBT rules and the entertainment tax rules. (Business New Zealand) A legislative gap remains in section CW 17CB as it is not clear how meals and refreshments provided to employees on-premises – for example, a staff meeting held over lunchtime with lunch provided. Section CW 17CB does not apply as it operates only when the employee is working away from their normal workplace. We consider there are limited circumstances when food and drink should result in taxable income to an employee, and the existing entertainment and FBT rules should be left to deal with such benefits. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Comment This issue should be addressed by the proposed clarification of the interaction of proposed section CW 17CB with the FBT rules. The FBT rules in turn contain a provision in section CX 29 that clarifies when on and off-premises meals are fringe benefits, by reference to the entertainment tax rules. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 41 Issue: Extend section CX 19 to cover benefits that if paid as an allowance would be exempt Clause 31 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) Clause 31 proposes amending section CX 19 in relation to benefits provided instead of allowances that would be exempt from income under a number of specified provisions, but not including the proposed new section CW 17CB (work-related meals). Section CX 19 should also expressly include benefits that are provided instead of allowances paid, which are exempt under proposed new section CW 17CB. Comment Officials agree that proposed section CX 19 should also include a reference to section CW 17CB. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification: two exemptions are provided Clause 22 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should be redrafted to reflect more clearly that two exemptions are being introduced – an exemption of up to three months for meals when an employee is required to work away from their normal work location, and a general exemption for working meals and light refreshments when an employee is working off the employer’s premises. The current drafting is confusing and does not clearly reflect there are two separate exemptions. Comment Officials do not consider that the provision needs redrafting as submitted, but note that explanation of the two exemptions was included in the Commentary to the bill and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin to be published following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 Issue: Light refreshments on premises should also be available to part-time employees Clause 22 Submission (Ernst & Young, Council of Trade Unions, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The seven hours a day requirement appears to discriminate unfairly against part-time employees who may still be entitled to light refreshments during their working hours and whose employment duties may also require them to be away from their employment base for most of their working hours. Comment The time limit was designed to limit the risk of salary substitution. This risk is already partly reduced by the provision that precludes arrangements when the employee would be entitled to additional salary if the meal benefits were not provided, although it does not cover indirect salary substitution. In these circumstances the seven hours limit can be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Light refreshments should be extended Clause 22 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The concept of light refreshments in proposed section CW 17CB(2)(c) should be extended to cover snack food items such as biscuits and fruit as well as fluids such as tea and coffee. Comment It is intended that such small snacks be exempted so specifying this in the legislation would be useful. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 43 Issue: Scope of working meal exemption too narrow Clause 22 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) Proposed section CW 17CB(2)(a) exempts meals that are arranged as an alternative to a formal meeting. This section should be amended to include meals provided as part of a formal meeting. This could be achieved by inserting the words ―or part of‖ after ―alternative to‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The criteria for a working meal to be exempt income should be broadened to capture all working meals that take place as part of an employer’s business activities when an employee’s duties require them to attend and participate. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials agree that the words ―or part of‖ could be added to the section as suggested in the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants’ submission. With regards to the New Zealand Law Society submission, officials do not consider such amendment is necessary as these situations will be covered by the legislation as drafted. Recommendation That the submission to insert the words ―or part of‖ be accepted. That the New Zealand Law Society submission be declined. Issue: Meal provision drafting issues Clause 22 Submission (KPMG) The reference to ―employer’s workplace‖ in new section CW 17CB should be replaced with ―workplace‖ (as that term is defined in new section CW 16B) for clarity. Similarly the reference to ―employment base‖ should also be replaced with workplace or alternatively ―employment base‖ should be defined. ―Accommodation base‖ should also be defined. Comment The reference to ―employer’s workplace‖ in new section CW 17CB is necessary as otherwise employees who are working at a client’s workplace (for example, an auditor working at the client’s workplace) would not qualify for the exemption. ―Employment base‖ is consistent with use elsewhere in the Income Tax Act, in particular in relation to sustenance allowances. 44 Officials do not consider it necessary to define the terms as suggested – the ordinary dictionary meaning is sufficient. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Meal exemption time limit Clause 22 Submission (KPMG) We support the intention of the new rule, however, see no reason why the meal exemption time limits should not match the accommodation periods. They should be aligned for consistency. Comment Providing an exemption for an employee’s meal costs when they are travelling away from home for work recognises that employees may have to spend more on their food and drink than they would otherwise. When an employer reimburses the cost of a work-related meal, the amount saved by the employee (in other words their normal expenditure on the meal) is arguably taxable. However, it would not be practical to carry out an apportionment each time a meal payment is made. The bill seeks to find a practical solution. Any comparison between meal costs when travelling on a work trip and normal day-to-day meal costs is likely to be between the costs of dining out and self-catering. On short term trips an employee usually stays in a hotel, or similar accommodation, without self-catering facilities, and therefore has to buy catered food. When undertaking a longer journey or secondment, this is likely to change after a period of time. An employer is likely to be reluctant to fund restaurant meals on a long-term basis and the employee will often move to self-catering accommodation. At that point the meal costs are not likely to be significantly greater than the normal day-to-day costs at home and the case for allowing tax-free treatment diminishes. Therefore, the rule proposed in the bill exempts meal payments linked to work-related travel for a period of up to three months. This time limit is designed to recognise that when an employee is away from their normal work location for a short period they are likely to incur significantly higher costs for meals but that these costs are likely to normalise after a period of time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 45 Issue: Restarting of time period for exemption Clause 22 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation should clarify that the three-month exemption period will begin again in situations when an employee is carrying out consecutive out-of-town secondments (in different locations). Comment Officials consider that the proposed provision is sufficiently clear, but propose that examples be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Flexibility of time limits Clause 22 Submissions (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If the submission regarding matching the meal exemption time limits with those for accommodation is not accepted, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should have a legislative discretion to extend the period for exempt meals. (KPMG) In addition, the Commissioner should have the flexibility to extend the time limit in exceptional circumstances. This ability exists in relation to accommodation and should be mirrored for meals. (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The accommodation extension is designed to ensure that if some serious adverse event occurs that prevents the employee from leaving the accommodation as expected and within the statutory time limits, there is no taxable impact as a result. Officials agree that this ―exceptional circumstances‖ rule should be mirrored for meals. Officials do not agree, however, that a more general discretion to extend the time period should be permitted. The ―exceptional circumstances‖ provision is a very restricted ability to extend, in order to ensure clarity and consistency in the rules, and a more general discretion would undermine that consistency and clarity. 46 Recommendation That the submission regarding a general discretion to extend time limits be declined. That the submission in respect of the exceptional circumstances flexibility be accepted. Issue: Application date of meal allowance provisions Clauses 2 and 22 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Before the release of the officials’ issues paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments in November 2012, a number of employers were treating meals as tax-exempt when related to work travel, on the basis that very little private benefit arose to the employee as the meals were required for work. The issues paper determined that work-related meal payments are taxable on the basis that meal payments have an inherent private value because people need to eat. This has been subject to debate between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The proposed application date of 1 April 2015 creates significant uncertainty about how meal payments should be treated before that date and creates a risk that earlier positions will be challenged by Inland Revenue. The application of the meals provision should therefore be backdated to, at a minimum, the November 2012 issue of the officials’ issues paper (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants); or preferably the statute bar, using a similar transitional provision to that for accommodation (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte). Comment Officials agree the provision should be backdated to 1 April 2011, subject to the employer not having a tax position that the payments were taxable. Employers will have taken different tax positions and providing the ability to elect to retrospectively apply the rules would allow the status quo to continue without the risk of audit or the need to re-open positions provided they fall within the proposed new rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 47 DISTINCTIVE WORK CLOTHING Issue: Clothing proposal should proceed Clause 23 Submissions (Business New Zealand, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) Extending the existing definition of ―distinctive work clothing‖ outlined in section CX 30(2) for clothing allowances should provide greater clarity to businesses and therefore should proceed. (Business New Zealand) The proposals ensure neutrality between the FBT treatment of distinctive work clothing and the allowance/reimbursement rules regarding the same. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The provision is welcomed subject to one wording suggestion (see subsequent submission regarding section CW 17CC(3)(c)(ii)). (Ernst & Young) Comment Officials welcome submitters’ comments that the proposed changes will provide greater clarity. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Exemption should be extended Clause 23 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Waikato District Health Board) Other employers have historically provided plain clothes that were partly exempt from tax. The submitter accepts the conditions of the exemption in proposed section CW 17CC but it should be widened to include employers who treated such allowances as partly exempt and partly taxable as a matter of practice (rather than limiting to those who specified the treatment in employment terms and conditions). (New Zealand Law Society) The exemption should be extended to allow it to deal with other circumstances, in particular mental health clinicians. The requirement that a uniform is provided, that the allowance was in place on 1 July 2013 and reference to a portion of it having been treated as taxable should be removed from the conditions of the exemption. (Waikato District Health Board) 48 Comment Although the proposed change is intended primarily to clarify the tax treatment of allowances provided to plain clothes police, it is open to other employees provided they meet the criteria set out in the provision. As many employees are required to wear their own clothing for work, the general position is that allowances for such clothing should be taxable. The proposed exemption is only intended to apply in very limited circumstances, being those where an employee is supplied with a uniform, but because of the nature of their current duties their employer requires them to wear plain clothes. Proposed section CW 17CC deals only with ―distinctive work clothing‖. The proposed change does not alter the tax treatment of other clothing allowances under the general rule in section CW 17 that provides for a payment to be exempt if it can be shown that it is not a private benefit. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption requires amendments to ensure plain clothes police covered Clause 23 Submission (Police Association) We welcome the decision to provide an exemption that covers the police plain clothes allowance, however as currently drafted it will not necessarily achieve this objective. The requirements relating to an allowance having been treated as partially taxable and partially exempt, and the requirement that these portions retain a constant ratio are problematic. Comment Officials have discussed the exemption with officials from Police and representatives from the Police Association. The concerns regarding the current drafting chiefly relate to the requirement in proposed section CW 17CC(3)(c)(ii) that the allowance has been treated as partly taxable and partly exempt. Police historically treated the plain clothes allowance in this way, however in 1998 the taxable component was brought into salary. There are therefore concerns about whether this condition would be met. The exemption in section CW 17CC is intended to cover police plain clothes allowances and therefore officials recommend some minor drafting changes, which have been discussed with the submitter and will be incorporated into the revised tracked version of the bill, to ensure these allowances do indeed fall within the definition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 49 Issue: Wording of proposed section CW 17CC(3)(c)(ii) should be revised Clause 23 Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section CW 17CC(3)(c)(ii) refers to general terms and conditions of employment providing for part of a payment to be treated as exempt income of the employee. Technically it may be argued that no contractual agreement or general terms and conditions can determine the tax characterisation of any particular payment. To avoid uncertainty the submitter suggests it would be preferable to refer to the allowances as ―tax-free‖ or as being receivable by employees on a net basis. Comment As noted above, officials are recommending some changes to section CW 17CC to ensure police plain clothes allowances fall within the exemption. As a result the wording identified by the submitter is being altered. Recommendation That the submission be noted and that the provision is being redrafted as a result of the previous submission. 50 DETERMINATIONS Issue: Drafting clarifications in clause 21 Clause 21 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Proposed section CW 17(2B) would require that the expenditure in question is incurred, or an amount paid, because the employee is ―performing an obligation‖ required by their employment or service. This may cause some concerns in the absence of very clear commentary. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed paragraphs (b) and (c) should be deleted from proposed new section CW 17(2B) on the basis they would be superfluous to any income nexus requirements which already exist by way of sections DA 1 and DA 2. They could also create uncertainty and possible dispute over whether employees are deriving any or all employment income ―through the performance of the obligation‖ and who should judge the ―necessity‖ of performing the obligation. (Ernst & Young) Comment Officials note that while there is some cross-over between the general permissions and limitations on deductibility in sections DA 1 and DA 2 of the Income Tax Act and proposed paragraphs (b) and (c) of proposed new section CW 17(2B), these paragraphs are included for clarity. The drafting of the proposed section is intended to codify the principles from case law in this area, namely that the expense must be connected with the employee carrying out their job. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Determinations for a “wide” group of employees Clause 21 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As drafted, a determination can only be made when the payment is made to or on behalf of a ―wide group‖ of employees. We consider this to be an ambiguous term requiring clarification – either by removing the word ―wide‖ or by way of commentary that gives clarity to the meaning of ―wide‖. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 51 ―Wide‖ should be removed as it is uncertain. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The determination-making power is proposed to be available only in respect of payments made to a wide group of employees to ensure that issues on which the Commissioner is asked to make a determination are of sufficient importance to the wider business community. Officials do not consider this to be an issue that requires amendment to the draft legislation, but some clarification could be included in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined subject to officials’ comments regarding the inclusion of some further clarification in the Tax Information Bulletin. Issue: Determination on communication payments Clause 21 Submission (Deloitte) Given the general uncertainty we recommend that a determination is issued as soon as the bill is enacted clarifying how communication costs (including phone lines, mobile phones and internet connections) should be taxed. Comment This submission is noted by officials. The merits of issuing a determination on this issue will be considered on enactment of the legislation and provided an application is made for a determination on this matter. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Consultation on determinations Clause 21 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) We welcome the ability for the Commissioner to issue determinations and expect there will be a desire for these to be issued shortly after enactment. We would welcome consultation on which determination would be of most benefit to the tax community. 52 Comment Officials note the submission. As discussed above, the merits of issuing a particular determination will be considered on enactment and following taxpayer application for a determination on a given payment. Officials are also willing to consult with interested parties on which issues deserve priority. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Determination power should not be limited as proposed Clause 21 Submission (Ernst & Young) The power to make determinations in this area should not be limited as proposed but rather generalised to cover all employer-provided items, including accommodation, meals and work clothing as well as other matters. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue would then be able to consider and deal expeditiously with various employer and employee situations and issues that may arise from time to time, but which do not fit appropriately within the boundaries already provided by the statutory provisions. Comment Before 1994, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue approved whether allowances and other employer payments could be treated as tax-exempt. This process created inconsistencies and was resource-intensive so instead a principles-based approach was included in the Income Tax Act. That approach was based on whether there was a nexus between the payment and the employee’s earning their employment income. This principles-based approach has raised some issues in particular areas and it was considered greater certainty was needed, so various ―bright lines‖ and other rules have been introduced in this bill, dealing with accommodation, meals and clothing. These cover off all the main issues that were of concern. There is also still the general fall-back rule for other situations. Too wide a discretion could take us back to the pre-1994 approach however, and risk inconsistencies. Therefore a narrow discretion is preferred. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Extension of FBT health and safety exemption to reimbursing payments made by employers Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Tax Team) Currently benefits provided to employees related to their health and safety are exempt from FBT under section CX 24. This would include the provision of safety equipment and clothing. However, if the employer were to provide the employee with an allowance to purchase their own safety gear, this amount could be taxable on the basis that it would not meet the definition of ―distinctive work clothing‖. The lack of neutrality between the FBT and allowances treatment is not desirable. Other items raised by submitters as falling under the FBT exemption but not exempt under the allowances/reimbursements treatment are eye and hearing tests, and associated aids, and influenza vaccinations. Comment Submitters note there is a disparity between the FBT rules and the allowance/reimbursement rules in relation to the treatment of health and safety-related benefits. Officials recommend further consideration of whether there should be greater alignment of the two sets of rules. However we do not recommend making any changes in this bill. This is because further analysis and consultation will be required to determine the potential effect of any such changes, and as noted below in relation to a submission regarding eye care, consideration may need to be given to whether certain items should continue to fall within the FBT exemption. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Eye care payments Submissions (Police Association, Tax Team) There should be an exemption for reimbursement payments for eye tests for employees who spend at least half their working day on VDU duties. (Police Association) There should be a rule in both the FBT and PAYE (allowances) rules to exempt from tax a portion of vision aid (glasses or lenses) costs. This could be done by either inserting specific eye care provisions or a general health and safety exemption which includes eye care. Any such provision should have retrospective application. (Tax Team) 54 Comment Submitters note there is currently a disparity between the FBT and reimbursement (PAYE) rules regarding the treatment of costs of eye examinations. The FBT rules contain an exemption from FBT for benefits related to health and safety, irrespective of whether these benefits are provided on or off the employer’s premises. This FBT exemption came about because various health and safety benefits were exempt if provided on the employer’s premises but not if they were provided off-premises. When this amendment was introduced in the Taxation (Depreciation, Payment Dates Alignment, FBT and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, the Commentary to the bill and the subsequent Tax Information Bulletin (Vol 18, No 5, June 2006) made it clear that eye examinations were something that was contemplated as covered in appropriate circumstances. This was largely in relation to employees working for periods at VDU computer monitors. We note that the most recent advice from the (then) Department of Labour (Guidelines for using computers, November 2010) states that several long-term scientific studies comparing computer users and non-computer users have shown that natural eyesight deterioration is not necessarily increased through computer use. The Guidelines also state that it is not a legal requirement for an employer to pay for an eye examination, although it may be good staff relations in circumstances where an employee is required to spend a significant amount of time at computers and/or monitors. The cost of eye examinations and corrective lenses are not considered exempt when paid to the employee by way of reimbursement rather than paid directly by the employer. As noted above, when paid directly by the employer, they fall within the FBT rules, which contain an exemption from FBT for health and safety benefits. If paid by the employee and then reimbursed by the employer, the question of whether they are taxable is determined by reference to section CW 17. The key determining factor is whether the expenditure would be deductible to the employee (if it were not for the limitation on claiming employment expenditure). What is deductible is determined by referring to the general deductibility rules in section DA 1 and the limitations contained in section DA 2. The issue for eye examinations and corrective lenses is the private limitation, which essentially means payments of a private or domestic nature will not be exempt income because they arise from the employee’s personal circumstances rather than from their employment. It is therefore possible that consideration needs to be given about whether, in fact, eye examinations and payments for corrective lenses should fall within the health and safety FBT exemption. As noted in relation to the general submission on the extension of the FBT health and safety exemption to allowances and reimbursements, this is something that requires further consideration and therefore officials do not recommend proceeding with this matter in this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 55 Issue: Travel costs for FIFO workers Submission (KPMG) At present it is unclear whether an FBT liability is created when an employer transports a fly-in fly-out worker to and from the workplace. We consider many employers would be guided by the accommodation treatment and apply the net benefit test. Such travel should be treated as non-taxable if there is no private benefit to the employee. This is a cost to a business from locating employees to carry out their duties in typically high risk areas. This can be contrasted with the arguments for taxing accommodation, which is a necessity of life. Comment The intention of the review and the proposed legislation is to deal with the rules regarding the treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, not fringe benefits. The FBT rules are not being altered so, to the extent to which the costs referred to by the submitter give rise to a fringe benefit, which may or may not be taxable, the position remains unchanged. The submission is therefore outside the scope of this bill but this does not preclude it being considered at a later time if there is sufficient concern from affected parties. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Minor drafting matters Clause 20 Submission (Ernst & Young) The word ―on‖ should be removed from the opening words of proposed section CW 17CB(5)(a) as it is duplicated in the following subparagraphs. There appears to be a duplicated reference to ―distant workplace‖ in the proposed section YA 1 definition of that term. Comment Officials agree that these references are duplicated and can therefore be removed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 56 Issue: Other minor drafting matters Clauses 12 and 20 Submission (KPMG) The reference in new section CE 1C(1) should be to new section CE 1B(1). The reference to ―for 1 or more nights‖ in the definition of ―period of continuous work‖ appears to be redundant. New section CW 16E(b)(ii) appears to be redundant as the two-year time limit is already explicit in the definition of out-of-town secondment in new section CW 16B(4). Comment Officials agree that the reference in CE 1C(1) should be amended as suggested. Officials do not consider the remaining suggested changes are necessary. Recommendation That the submission regarding CE 1C(1) be accepted. That the remaining aspect of the submission be declined. 57 Thin capitalisation rules 58 59 OVERVIEW The thin capitalisation rules form part of New Zealand’s international tax rules and are designed to protect our tax base. The thin capitalisation rules have generally been operating effectively. However, Inland Revenue’s investigators, through their normal audit work, have come across some situations where the rules appear deficient. The bill proposes changes to the rules that will address these deficiencies. Two primary changes are proposed in the bill. The first expands the thin capitalisation rules so they apply when a group of non-residents appear to be acting as a group and own 50 percent or more of a New Zealand investment. This will address the fact that the rules currently only apply when a single non-resident controls a New Zealand investment, even though groups of investors can often act together in a way that mimics control by a single investor. The second change proposed is to ignore shareholder-linked debt when taxpayers are calculating their allowable level of New Zealand debt under the rules. This will prevent non-residents from excessively gearing their New Zealand investments when they have excessively geared their worldwide operations with shareholder debt. The bill also proposes three further changes:  expanding the rules so they apply more broadly to trusts that have been settled by non- residents;  ignoring revaluations in asset values where the revaluation is generally not permitted under accounting standards; and  requiring individuals and trustees to exclude their indirect interests in offshore companies if their interest is held through a company they are associated with. Ten submissions were received in relation to the thin capitalisation proposals included in the bill. Most generally supported the changes but raised a number of issues. As a result, officials are recommending changes to clarify when the rules apply and to reduce the compliance costs of the proposed amendments. Officials are also recommending a number of drafting and technical changes. 60 GENERAL COMMENTS Issue: General comments on the changes Clauses 2(25), 87 to 98 and 123(32) Submissions (PricewaterhouseCoopers, KPMG, Ernst & Young, Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Staples Rodway, New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) Several submitters supported the proposed changes to the thin capitalisation rules in principle. They noted there were gaps in the current rules and that it was appropriate for these to be closed. Some submitters, however, expressed concern with certain elements of the changes, such as a lack of certainty over when the rules will apply. Others did not support all aspects of the proposed changes such as the proposal to disregard certain uplifts in asset values. One submitter suggested the changes should not proceed: the thin capitalisation rules play a role when non-residents decide to invest in New Zealand. Extending the thin capitalisation rules to cover non-residents that act together may therefore deter investment in New Zealand. Further, the thin capitalisation rules discriminate against non-resident investors since they do not apply to domestic investment. (Staples Rodway) Another submitter said the proposed changes are too cautious and that more work should be done to prevent tax avoidance by overseas investors. Consideration should be been given to further lowering of the safe harbour level of allowable debt (currently 60 percent of assets). Further, the burden of proof on whether overseas investors are ―acting together‖ should be placed on taxpayers – any company where 50 percent or more of its shares are owned by non- residents should be subject to the thin capitalisation rules unless the shareholders can demonstrate they are not acting together. (New Zealand Council of Trade Unions) Comment Officials note the comments supporting the broad direction of reforms and suggest changes recommended in this report will address many submitters’ concerns. These changes should, for example, increase certainty over when and how the rules will apply. Officials do not agree that the changes should not proceed. Most submitters acknowledged there are weaknesses in the current rules and that these need to be dealt with. Officials consider it appropriate that the thin capitalisation rules apply only to non-resident- controlled companies. This is the international norm. Officials also do not agree that the reforms are too cautious. Throughout the policy development process submitters have stressed the importance of certainty when taxpayers are making decisions about large investment projects. Placing a strong burden of proof on taxpayers that they are not acting together would create significant uncertainty. The rules have been designed to be as certain as possible while still providing appropriate base protection. 61 Changes to the ―safe harbour‖ were not considered as part of the review of the thin capitalisation rules. This was because the safe harbour was only recently lowered (as was recommended by the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group). Recommendation That the submissions supporting the reforms be noted and that the other submissions be declined. Issue: Treatment of look-through entities Submission (KPMG) If an entity is treated as look-through for New Zealand tax purposes, such as a limited partnership, and is used as an investment vehicle in New Zealand, the tested entity for thin capitalisation purposes will be the individual partners, not the partnership. This is illogical. The tested entity should be the limited partnership, not the partners in the partnership. Were this change made, the partnership itself would be subject to the thin capitalisation rules on the basis that it is owned by non-residents who are acting together. This has significant implications for large infrastructure projects such as Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). These projects typically have high levels of third-party gearing, but it is unlikely that such high gearing would be allowed under the current treatment of limited partnerships. If, however, limited partnerships were treated as the tested entity, the modified rules for entities that are controlled by non-residents acting together would apply. This would mean any third-party debt would (in essence) no longer be counted for the thin capitalisation rules. Comment Limited partnerships are transparent for New Zealand tax purposes. This means the partnership is disregarded; instead, the partners are treated as carrying on the business of the partnership. A consequence is that each non-resident partner is considered a single non-resident controller of a New Zealand investment. Officials do not believe changes should be made to the thin capitalisation treatment of limited partnerships without reviewing the rules for those entities more generally. Treating limited partnerships as opaque for thin capitalisation but transparent for other purposes may provide taxpayers with avoidance opportunities. We also note that changing the tax treatment of limited partnerships, even if such a change were isolated to the thin capitalisation rules, would be a significant shift in policy. It would be important to consult fully on any such change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 62 Issue: Allowable debt test for single non-resident controllers Submission (KPMG) The current thin capitalisation rules, where all debt is counted when determining if a company has too much debt, will continue to apply where a single non-resident investor holds a 50 percent or greater interest in a New Zealand investment. For companies controlled by non- residents acting together, however, only related-party debt will be counted. This puts single non-resident investors at a disadvantage. The proposed rules for non-residents acting together should be extended to single non-resident controllers. This issue is particularly pertinent for Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) projects. It puts a potential investor in a PPP who is a non-resident acting alone at a disadvantage compared with a group of non-residents acting together. The submitter did note that the change could potentially allow non-residents to allocate debt that truly belongs elsewhere to New Zealand but contended that other changes to the rules, such as the exclusion of shareholder guaranteed debt from the worldwide group debt test, will limit this ability. Comment The proposed changes will deem the worldwide group of a New Zealand company owned by non-resident shareholders who are ―acting together‖ to be just its New Zealand group. In effect, this means these companies will be unrestricted in how much they can borrow from genuine third-parties. This was done for practical reasons. Applying the standard worldwide group test to shareholders acting together is not feasible. It would be extremely difficult to meaningfully consolidate the debts and assets of the company’s shareholders (who are presumably unrelated parties) to construct a worldwide group as it relates to their New Zealand investments. Companies controlled by single non-residents do not face this problem. They can use the worldwide group debt test as it currently stands. This means if the parent company’s worldwide operations are highly geared, the New Zealand operation can use the worldwide group debt test to justify a high level of gearing in New Zealand. The suggested change would also provide companies controlled by a single non-resident with two methods for applying the worldwide group debt test: the existing test (based on the debt-to- asset ratio of the worldwide debt), and the new modified test for those ―acting together‖ (that allows unlimited borrowing from third-parties). The companies could pick and choose the method that would best suit them. Officials therefore do not support changing the worldwide group debt test for companies controlled by single non-residents at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 63 Issue: Complexity of the proposed amendments Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendments to the thin capitalisation rules are complex. Given this, the amendments to the thin capitalisation rules should be separated from the rest of the bill and progressed at a slower pace. This would allow sufficient time to ensure all of the amendments are appropriately drafted. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendments are complex and will impose additional compliance costs on taxpayers, yet the expected fiscal gain, as reported in the regulatory impact statement, is only $20 million over three years. It is not clear the appropriate balance between complexity and revenue protection has been achieved. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Given the complexity of the rules, a mechanism should be introduced that allows taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a thin capitalisation determination. This would cover whether, and how, the rules apply to the taxpayer – for example, what its New Zealand and worldwide groups are, and its relevant debt-to-asset ratios. (Ernst & Young) Comment The changes being recommended in this report should address many of submitters’ concerns about the complexity and uncertainty in the rules. Officials do not consider the changes should be broken out from the bill as the next available omnibus tax bill is unlikely to have passed before the beginning of the 2015–16 income year for many taxpayers. Delaying enactment of these provisions could create uncertainty. We also do not agree than the changes are too complex given the forecast revenue impact. The thin capitalisation rules are an important part of New Zealand’s international tax rules, helping ensure non-resident investors pay an appropriate amount of tax in New Zealand. It is important that the rules work effectively. Without the proposed changes the revenue lost could grow over time as the global economy recovers, increasing non-residents’ demand for investment opportunities. In terms of providing a determination mechanism, we note that taxpayers can request binding rulings on elements of the thin capitalisation rules. While binding rulings are restricted to questions of law, such a ruling could cover questions such as whether the rules apply to an entity based on the facts described. There are also numerous complex regimes in the Income Tax Act yet almost all of these do not feature a special determination mechanism. We do not recommend a determination mechanism for thin capitalisation be inserted through this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 64 Issue: Introduction of a de minimis threshold Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Consideration should be given to the introduction of a de minimis threshold for the inbound thin capitalisation rules. The rules are complex and these changes make them even more so. A de minimis threshold would reduce compliance requirements for smaller non-resident owned companies. Comment A de minimis of $1 million of interest deductions would generally allow each company under that threshold to have an additional $400,000 of interest deductions taken in New Zealand compared with if the thin capitalisation rules applied. This could have a moderate fiscal cost. The question of a de minimis was not raised during the two rounds of consultation while the changes were being developed. Little is known about the type and number of firms that would be covered by a de minimis, their difficulties in complying with the legislation, or whether a de minimis would be the best response. Given these factors, officials do not recommend a de minimis threshold for the inbound thin capitalisation rules at this time. The submitter raised the fact that the outbound thin capitalisation rules have a de minimis of $1 million of interest deductions. The rules do not apply below this threshold. Australia similarly has a de minimis, applying to both its outbound and inbound thin capitalisation rules. This will be increasing to $2 million of interest deductions from 1 July 2014. In terms of providing a de minimis, officials note there are different considerations that need to be borne in mind when comparing the inbound and outbound rules. Given New Zealand’s imputation system, New Zealand-owned companies have a natural incentive to pay tax in New Zealand and therefore place their debt offshore. The New Zealand tax base is therefore protected somewhat even for companies that fall below the de minimis threshold of the outbound rules. The same considerations do not apply for non-resident owned companies, who normally do not face the same incentives to pay tax in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 65 Issue: Revised guidance on the rules Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) A comprehensive Tax Information Bulletin article explaining the thin capitalisation rules was released when they were first introduced. Given the significant changes to the rules in this bill, together with other changes to the rules (such as the introduction of the outbound and banking thin capitalisation regimes), it is timely that Inland Revenue issue revised guidance on the rules in their entirety. Comment Officials will prepare a Tax Information Bulletin once the bill is enacted, setting out how the new rules are intended to operate. Officials will pass the request for guidance on the rules in their entirety to the relevant areas of Inland Revenue for consideration alongside their other priorities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Grandparenting Submission (Staples Rodway) Grandparenting provisions should be provided so existing investments are not affected by these proposals. Without grandparenting, some existing investments will likely breach their thin capitalisation limits. They will start having interest deductions denied unless they restructure their debt – this restructuring may be costly. Comment The application date for these changes is the beginning of the 2015–16 income year (for most taxpayers this will be 1 April 2015). This is a long lead time given the changes were first announced in January 2013. Officials believe this gives taxpayers sufficient time to change their financing arrangements if that is necessary. Grandparenting would favour existing investments over new investments. It would also create boundary issues in distinguishing whether some funding was the continuation of an existing investment or a new investment. This would require complex or potentially arbitrary rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 Issue: Changes to the introductory section Clause 87 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed changes to section FE 1 refer to adjustments of interest deductions if the level of interest expenditure incurred in New Zealand is too high. This wording is inappropriate as the thin capitalisation rules look only at the amount of debt in New Zealand, not the amount of interest expenditure in New Zealand. Comment Officials agree. The introduction to the rules should reflect that they operate based on levels of debt, not levels of interest deductions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date Clause 2(25) Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date of the 2015–16 year is appropriate. Comment Officials agree. This application date will ensure taxpayers have the opportunity to consider how the new rules will affect them before they take effect. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 67 PERSONS THE RULES APPLY TO Issue: Use of the term “acting as a group” Clause 88 Submissions (Ernst & Young, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Staples Rodway, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The proposed changes refer to persons ―acting together as a group‖ in several places, such as in determining whether the rules apply to a company that is owned by a trustee and other persons acting together with the trustee. The phrase ―acting together as a group‖ is expressed without any limitation, context or purpose. It is not used elsewhere in the legislation. This creates undue uncertainty as to whether the thin capitalisation rules will apply. A more certain test should be provided. The phrase ―acting in concert‖ should be used instead of ―acting as a group‖. That phrase has an established meaning in both case law and other legislation. (Staples Rodway) Comment Officials agree that referring to persons that are ―acting together as a group‖ is not necessary in proposed section FE 2(1)(cc). This section is intended to catch, among other things, companies that are controlled by a group comprising a trustee (or trustees) and other persons where both the trustee and the other persons are subject to the thin capitalisation rules. In defining whether a company controlled by a group of trustees and other persons should be subject to the rules, officials consider that the same concepts employed in the definition of a non-resident owning body could be used instead. This would mean, for example, the company would be subject to the rules if the group holds debt in proportion to equity in the company. This should provide more certainty about when the thin capitalisation rules apply when a company’s shareholders include a trust. Proposed section FE 2(1)(d)(iii) also refers to ―a group of persons who act together as a group‖ to settle a trust. In the case of settling a trust it is not possible to use the concepts used for a non-resident owning body. It does not make sense, for example, to refer to proportionality of settlements and debt lent to a trust as there is no link between settlements on a trust and entitlement to income from the trust. Officials do not think it possible to provide a more certain rule for when the rules should apply to a trust settled by a group of people. During the policy development process, officials asked several submitters if they had any suggestions for a more certain rule. None were received. Officials consider it important that the rules apply to trusts settled by a group of non-residents acting together. This will ensure a group of investors cannot easily circumvent the rules through the use of a trust. 68 We note the rule is unlikely to create much uncertainty in practice as trusts are not a common part of a commercial company structure. Further, greater certainty can be achieved by channelling an investment through a company. In terms of the specific wording of when people are acting together, officials consider that ―acting in concert‖ and ―acting together as a group‖ have much the same meaning. Officials recommend the specific wording used be changed in section FE 2(1)(d)(iii) to ―acting in concert‖ on the basis it is used elsewhere in New Zealand legislation. Recommendation That the submission in relation to the wording in proposed section FE 2(1)(cc) be accepted. That the submission in relation to section FE 2(1)(d)(iii) be declined except in relation to the phrase ―acting in concert‖. Issue: The meaning of “control by any other means” is unclear Clause 88 Submission (Ernst & Young) The bill proposes that the thin capitalisation rules will apply to a company if a non-resident owning body has control of that company ―by any other means‖. While this phrase is used in the existing rules, its intended meaning has never been clear. Inland Revenue should provide guidance on the meaning of this phrase. Comment The proposed extensions of whom the thin capitulation rules apply to are designed to mirror the existing rules. This includes the paragraph that provides the rules apply where a company is controlled by ―any other means‖. Officials will convey the request for more guidance on the phrase to the relevant areas of Inland Revenue for consideration alongside other priorities. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 69 Issue: Meaning of “settlements” on a trust Clause 88 Submission (Ernst & Young) A trust will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if 50 percent or more of the settlements on the trust are made by a non-resident. Whether a settlor is non-resident should be tested at the time the settlement is made. A trust should not be subject to the rules if, say, it is settled by a person who is a resident but later becomes a non-resident. Further, the definition of ―settlement‖ for tax purposes is very wide. It includes the provision of services for below market value, for example. There can be difficulties in determining the value of these types of settlements. For thin capitalisation purposes, a settlement should include only dispositions of property. Comment The definition of ―settlement‖ for tax purposes is intentionally very wide, designed to capture all transfers of value to a trust. This is to ensure the rules operate robustly. Officials do not see a strong case for using a narrower definition of settlement only in the thin capitalisation rules. Officials do not agree that the residence of a settlor should only be tested at the time of settlement. If a resident owner of a New Zealand company moves offshore, the thin capitalisation rules will begin applying to the company. It seems reasonable for settlors of a trust to be treated in a similar manner. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 NON-RESIDENT OWNING BODY Issue: General comment on the definition Clause 90 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Corporate Taxpayers Group) Whether a company owned by several non-residents will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules will turn on the definition of a ―non-resident owning body‖. This definition is too vague. A significant degree of uncertainty exists about how the tests will apply in practice to the various forms of investment vehicles and commercial arrangements that are commonly used by international investors. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) If appropriate clarity cannot be provided in the definition of ―non-resident owning body‖, the concept should be removed and replaced with a rule that specifies that the thin capitalisation rules would apply to all companies where non-residents in aggregate hold greater than 50 percent of a company (with carve-outs for widely held companies). (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Officials have recommended several amendments to the definition of a ―non-resident owning body‖. These changes should increase certainty over when a group of non-residents will form a non-resident owning body. Based on this, officials do not believe it necessary (at this stage) to replace the concept with a broader rule as suggested by the Corporate Taxpayers Group. However, we will continue to monitor the application of these rules to ensure they are working appropriately. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 71 Issue: Use of “ownership interests” and “direct ownership interests” Clause 90 Submission (Ernst & Young) The definition of ―non-resident owning body‖ currently refers to members that have debt in a company in proportion to either their ownership interests or direct ownership interests in the company. This could potentially create confusion as the definition of ―ownership interests‖ includes direct ownership interests. Comment The reference to both ownership interests and direct ownership interests is intentional. The provision is intended to catch situations when, for example, a non-resident has debt and equity in the same proportion as other shareholders when considering their direct ownership interests, but not their indirect ownership interests. This might arise if, say, the non-resident also had a minor shareholding through a subsidiary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of the term “approximately” Clause 90 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The definition of ―non-resident owning body‖ includes non-residents that hold debt in a New Zealand company that is approximately in the same proportion to the equity they have in the company. While it is clear that the drafting is trying to catch situations where taxpayers have structured their affairs to intentionally avoid the application of the section, the language is too vague and provides no real guidance on what constitutes ―approximate proportionality‖. The wording should be made more certain. Comment As submitters have correctly noted, the purpose of the word ―approximately‖ was to capture situations where taxpayers have structured their affairs intentionally to avoid having proportionate debt and equity, such as having debt and equity that are very close, but not exactly, in proportion. 72 Officials consider more certainty could be provided by omitting the word ―approximately‖ and changing the rule so that:  it works off proportionality of any of the four kinds of ownership interest, so non-residents cannot say, have proportionate rights to receive income from the company but slightly different voting rights; and  a specific anti-avoidance provision is included, providing that an arrangement that has the purpose or effect of defeating the intention of the proportionality rule can be disregarded. This type of wording proposed for the specific anti-avoidance provision is found in several places throughout the Income Tax Act – including elsewhere in the thin capitalisation rules (section FE 11). This similarity in wording should help provide guidance on when the rule might apply. The modified test is also more certain as it invokes the purpose of the proportionality rule. That is, to target situations where taxpayers are entitled, in substance, either directly or indirectly, to the same proportion of dividend income and interest income from a company. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Proportionality does not imply acting together Clause 90 Submission (Staples Rodway) The issues paper on the thin capitalisation changes in the bill stated that a key issue was non- residents who can ―collectively act in the same way as an individual controlling shareholder‖. This concept is not reflected in the definition of ―non-resident owning body‖. One of the key tests in that definition is whether shareholders hold debt and equity in the same proportion. This is not an indication of acting together. There could be many situations where shareholders hold debt in proportion to their equity but have no effective interaction with each other. Comment The thin capitalisation rules are designed to apply to companies with shareholders who have the ability to easily manipulate its debt levels or use debt funding in place of equity funding. When there is proportionality, the level of debt in a company does not change shareholders’ exposure to the risk of holding equity in the company or shareholders’ overall return. As debt levels increase, the makeup of the return will change (fewer dividends and higher interest payments) but the sum of interest and dividends will be unchanged. Proportionality is therefore a key situation where shareholders have the ability to replace equity with debt. 73 It is also arguable that at least some degree of coordination among shareholders is required in order to arrive at proportionate debt and equity. Indeed, many of the investment structures looked at by Inland Revenue involving non-residents that appear to be acting together have involved proportionate debt and equity. Accordingly, officials consider proportionality to be a reasonable indicator of when non- residents are acting together, albeit an objective test rather than a subjective one. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Shareholder agreement clause is too wide Clause 90 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Russell McVeagh, Staples Rodway) A non-resident owning body includes a group of shareholders in a company who fund the company under an agreement amongst themselves (such as a shareholder agreement). The provision should be changed to refer explicitly to debt funding and exclude provisions relating to borrowing from third parties or equity funding. The provision should be targeted at agreements that set out how the shareholders will act together to fund the entity with related- party debt. It is common for investors to enter into a shareholder agreement. Doing so should therefore not be an indication of shareholders acting together. The rule will also have high compliance costs. Determining whether the words used in a shareholders’ agreement constitutes an agreement of how an investment is to be funded may be difficult. This in turn may lead to taxpayers explicitly avoiding clauses on funding in their agreements to circumvent the test. (Staples Rodway) The bill Commentary states that an agreement that sets out how an investment should be funded in the case of a specified event will not constitute meeting this provision if or until that event happens. This is not clear in the proposed legislation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials agree that the shareholders’ agreement clause in the definition of ―non-resident owning body‖ could be tightened along the lines suggested by submitters. The area of greatest concern is when non-residents have acted together when deciding how to fund the entity with related- party debt or guaranteed debt. Such an agreement would allow the shareholders to easily use debt in place of equity to fund the New Zealand company, or to put debt that truly belonged elsewhere into the company. 74 Officials recommend that an agreement between shareholders should create a non-resident owning body only if the agreement sets out how a company will be funded with owner-linked debt (as defined by proposed section FE 18(3B)). Officials disagree with the submitter than a shareholders’ agreement should not be an indication of shareholders acting together. The presence of an agreement between shareholders demonstrates that they are coordinated. This submitter also raised the possibility that taxpayers may structure arrangements to intentionally avoid the application of this rule. Officials will monitor this and will strengthen the rule if necessary to prevent taxpayers structuring to avoid its application. Finally, officials agree that the exclusion for contingent funding clauses in a shareholder agreement is not clear in the current drafting. This should be made more explicit. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Rights exercised as recommended by a person Clause 90 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) A non-resident owning body also includes a group of non-residents who exercise their ownership rights in a New Zealand investment in a way recommended by a person, or where a person acts on the group members’ behalf to exercise their ownership rights. These provisions are uncertain and potentially excessive. Arguably the provisions could apply if the ownership rights were exercised as recommended by a person on only one occasion in relation to any matter, no matter how insignificant or immaterial. (Ernst & Young) At the least, guidance needs to be provided on what ―in a way recommended by a person‖ means. (KPMG) The provisions could be satisfied if shareholders exercised their rights consistent with recommendations of a company’s board of directors, or if several shareholders appointed the same proxy for the purposes of a given resolution. (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh). Our understanding is that all members of a non-resident owning body would need to be taking recommendations from the same person. This is not clear in the legislation. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) 75 Would a private equity firm promoting a particular investment to a group of non-resident investors be caught under these provisions? Similarly, a private equity manager may manage an underlying investment vehicle but this should not be taken as managing the underlying business. These provisions should be changed to apply only when a group of non-resident investors are required to act on the instructions of a person. (Ernst & Young) These provisions should be changed to refer to situations when a company is ―effectively coordinated by a person or group of people‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials believe these provisions could be amended in a similar manner to those relating to shareholders’ agreements. The provisions would only apply if shareholders exercise their rights on the recommendations of a person, or a person acts on shareholders’ behalf, in relation to owner-linked debt. This would significantly increase certainty over when the provisions apply and ensure they do not apply in relation to small or trivial matters. This amendment should also ensure that an investment manager managing their fund will not be misconstrued as managing an underlying business they own, unless the investment manager directs their members on how to debt-fund the underlying business. Officials do not agree that the provision should be changed to refer to when a group of non- resident investors are required to act on the instructions of a person. This would make the provision too narrow. It is the intention of this section that all members of a non-resident owning body need to be taking recommendations from the same person in order for the provision apply. The submitter’s comment to clarify this will be passed to the bill drafters. Officials do not believe it necessary to change the specific wording of the section to where investors are ―effectively coordinated‖. The current wording, together with the other changes to these provisions, should clearly encapsulate when the provisions should apply. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 76 Issue: Exclusion for security interests is appropriate Clause 90 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill proposes that a trust will be subject to the thin capitalisation rules if a person who is themselves subject to the rules has the power to appoint or remove the trustees of that trust. However, there is an exclusion to this rule if the person holds the power to change trustees as a security interest over a loan. This exclusion is appropriate. Comment Officials agree. Having the thin capitalisation rules apply to trusts where a person has the power to appoint trustees as a security interest could result in overreach. We understand it is common for banks to request this type of security when lending to a trust. Without the exclusion, a trust that is wholly settled by a New Zealand resident may become subject to the rules if it borrowed from a non-resident owned bank. That would be inappropriate. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 77 ASSET UPLIFTS Issue: Asset uplift proposal should not proceed Clause 93 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposal to exclude increases in asset values following company restructures from the asset base for thin capitalisation should not proceed. If accounting allows for an increase in asset values, and the taxpayer can justify that value to its auditors, then that higher value should be able to be used for thin capitalisation purposes. The submitters also noted that following accounting for determining the value of assets was a deliberate design choice, intended to reduce compliance costs. They argued it is inappropriate to deviate from this principle. Comment Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require many kinds of asset, including much intangible property such as goodwill, to be valued at cost. Revaluation of such assets is generally not permitted because a reliable value cannot be determined. The main exception to this rule is when an unrelated party pays for the asset as the amount paid for the asset is a reasonable indication of its actual value. There is a rare circumstance when increases in asset values can be recognised for accounting in the absence of a third-party purchase. This is when a corporate restructure known as a ―business combination‖ is carried out, where two sister companies are effectively merged. Officials understand that all assets subject to the business combination (including intangible property) may be brought across at fair value – which may be above the asset’s book value. However, any changes in asset values that cannot be recognised in the absence of the business combination will not be reflected in the combined businesses’ parent’s consolidated accounts. Business combinations can therefore be used to increase the value of a non-resident’s New Zealand operations – for example, if there is a non-resident parent company that combines two New Zealand companies. This would increase the amount of debt that the New Zealand companies can hold under the 60 percent safe harbour – despite the fact that there has been no increase in the value of assets in the parent company’s consolidated accounts. Officials therefore do not believe this type of asset uplift arrangement should be allowed. Officials do not consider this change will have any significant compliance impact as business combinations are not common. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 78 Issue: Asset uplift rules should only apply prospectively Clause 93 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The asset uplift proposals should only apply to asset value increases occurring on or after the date the rules apply. Identifying historic uplifts in asset values could be difficult and therefore would impose significant compliance costs. Comment Officials agree that requiring taxpayers to identify and eliminate historic uplifts in asset values would impose significant compliance costs. It is reasonable for this change to apply only to subsequent uplifts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Uplift as part of a larger restructure Clause 93 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) One exemption to the prohibition on including asset uplifts is when the increase in asset value follows a purchase of a parent company by a non-associate. As currently drafted, this exemption appears to be too narrow. It should be sufficient that a restructure has arisen following a transaction with an unrelated party which affects a New Zealand company or its worldwide group. Similarly, it is not clear if restructures following the acquisition of a foreign parent company are covered under the exemption. The context of the proposed legislation suggests that the company being acquired must be a New Zealand company. This is not appropriate as it will often be a foreign parent company that is purchased. Further guidance should be provided on when a restructure could be regarded as part of the acquisition of the group by a third party. Restructures can take some time to implement and may occur a year or longer after the acquisition. Further guidance should also be given on the meaning of the phrase ―a reasonable proportion of the change in value of the company’s total assets‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) 79 The ―reasonable proportionality‖ requirement should be deleted as taxpayers already have the burden of establishing that any changes in asset values are appropriate. (Ernst & Young) Comment The intention of proposed section FE 16(1E) is to allow uplifts to be recognised when a third party has, in essence, purchased a group of companies and part of that purchase price relates to the group’s intangible property. Officials understand that, immediately following the purchase, any increase in the value of the intellectual property will be isolated to the parent company of the group (that is, the purchased company). The company may then restructure its worldwide operations, in part to spread this increase in value among all of its subsidiaries. The situations described by submitters, when a foreign parent company is purchased, should therefore be covered by the section. Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved to make this intention clearer. This includes when a restructure can be taken as being related to the acquisition of the group by a third party and what constitutes a ―reasonable proportion‖ of the change in asset values. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Exemptions to the uplift rule are appropriate Clause 93 Submission (Ernst & Young) The exemptions provided for the asset uplift rule are appropriate. Comment Officials agree. The exemptions allow uplifts to be counted for thin capitalisation purposes where:  accounting allows assets to be revalued as a general principle; or  where the uplift is a reflection of the price implicitly paid for the asset by a third party, such as might occur when a third party purchases a company’s parent. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 80 Issue: Optional nature of the exemptions Clause 93 Submission (KPMG) Section FE 16(1E) currently provides that a taxpayer may include a change in asset value under two circumstances. It is unclear if this means taxpayers can elect not to include the change in value. Comment The carve outs are intended to be optional. Officials note that, if a taxpayer chooses not to exercise this option because an asset value has in fact gone down, accounting standards may still require that asset to be impaired. Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 81 WORLDWIDE GROUP DEBT TEST Issue: Extent of owner-linked debt rule Clause 94 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) The bill proposes to exclude debt that is linked to a person who owns part of a company’s worldwide group for the purpose of the group’s worldwide debt test. Here, a debt is linked to an owner if they are a party to the loan, have guaranteed the loan, or the loan is part of a back-to- back arrangement the owner is party to. Shareholder guaranteed loans should not be counted as linked to an owner. A shareholder guaranteed loan does not involve provision of funds by the shareholder to the borrowing company. It therefore cannot be a substitute for equity. There may also be difficulties in finding out whether a loan is guaranteed or not, especially if the borrowing company is outside of the New Zealand group. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) There should be an exemption where an owner on-lends third party borrowing to the worldwide group. (New Zealand Law Society) Debt that has been lent to the worldwide group by an owner should not be excluded if that debt is on the same terms as genuine third-party debt. This would ensure the loan is for a commercial level of debt. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Debt should not be counted if it is on arms-length terms and not in proportion to, or a substitute for, equity. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Comment Broadly speaking, thin capitalisation rules have three related objectives. These are to ensure:  that non-residents are not replacing equity with debt when investing into New Zealand;  only a fair amount of the non-resident’s worldwide debt has been allocated to New Zealand; and,  the New Zealand operation has a commercial level of debt. When a company is owned by a group of non-residents who meet the definition of a ―non- resident owning body‖, there is no test to determine whether they have allocated a fair amount of their worldwide debt to New Zealand. This test is proxied by the requirement that, in essence, any debt of the New Zealand company (in excess of 60 percent) must be from a third party. This demonstrates that the New Zealand business, on its own, is able to support that level of debt. This provides a reasonable indication that the debt in the New Zealand business is not attributable elsewhere. 82 Having shareholder-guaranteed loans not counted as owner-linked would weaken this. It would mean that the New Zealand business may not actually be able to commercially support its level of debt – the guarantee may have been required in order for the loan to proceed. This provides an indication that debt that should be allocated elsewhere in the world has been put in New Zealand – since the loan is implicitly supported by assets outside of New Zealand. For the same reason, officials do not support removing on-lent debt from being counted as owner-linked. If a shareholder borrows an amount and on-lends that, the shareholder is implicitly acting as a guarantor. The issue of shareholder-guaranteed debt is less significant in the case of a company controlled by a single non-resident. In this case the worldwide group debt test can act to ensure only a reasonable amount of the worldwide group’s debt is allocated to New Zealand. Shareholder guarantees could nonetheless be used to excessively gear the worldwide group. However, officials understand the concerns raised by submitters that a New Zealand company may struggle to get information about guarantees provided by shareholders of the ultimate parent company. On this basis, we recommend that shareholder-guaranteed debt not be treated as ―owner-linked‖ in relation to a company controlled by a single non-resident. Officials will reconsider this position if evidence arises that guaranteed debt is being used to excessively gear a company’s worldwide groups. Officials agree that related-party debt is not necessarily on terms different to arm’s-length debt. However, whether debt is truly at arm’s length can be difficult to determine. This was noted in the original issues paper on these changes. Further, even if related-party is truly at arm’s length, it can still be a substitute for equity. Officials therefore do not favour the submissions that arm’s length related-party debt, or arm’s length related-party debt that is not in proportion to equity, should be excluded from being owner-linked. Recommendation That the submission relating to upstream guarantees of third-party debt be accepted. That the other submissions be declined. Issue: Carve-out for widely held debt Clause 94 Submissions (Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section FE 18(3B)(c) provides an exemption to the requirement to exclude owner- linked debt. The exemption applies if a shareholder owns less than 10 percent of a member of the worldwide group and the financial arrangements held by the shareholder are traded on a recognised exchange. 83 The requirement for the debt to be traded on a recognised exchange is too restrictive. Limiting ownership interests to 10 percent should be sufficient. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The requirement for debt to be traded on a recognised exchange should be sufficient as it would be difficult for shareholders to manipulate their debt funding when it is widely traded. The 10 percent ownership threshold is therefore not necessary. (KPMG) A consequential amendment to the definition of ―recognised exchange‖ will be required. As currently defined, a recognised exchange is limited only to an exchange for trading shares or options – not financial arrangements. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree that it would be difficult to manipulate a company’s debt financing through publicly traded debt where the debt is widely traded. Officials also agree that limiting the owner-linked rule to taxpayers with substantial interests reduces compliance costs, as it limits the number of shareholders that a company needs to investigate to determine if they hold owner- linked debt. Officials therefore recommend that the exemption be changed so it applies when a person owns less than 5 percent of a member of the worldwide group, or when the debt of the person is widely traded on a recognised exchange. The reduced ownership threshold is to counterbalance the removal of the recognised exchange requirement for minority shareholders. Officials note that, with a 5 percent threshold, a maximum of 20 shareholders would need to be considered by the company to determine if they hold owner-linked debt. Officials note that this rule does not refer to interests held by associates for the purposes of the 5 percent ownership threshold. This is intentional. Otherwise the exemption’s purpose as a compliance reduction measure would be defeated. However, it is not intended to provide an opportunity for a non-resident with a significant interest in a company to avoid the application of the owner-linked debt rules by spreading their interests across numerous associated entities. We note that the general anti-avoidance provision may apply to this type of structure. Finally, we agree that a consequential amendment to the definition of ―recognised exchange‖ is required. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments on reducing the ownership interest threshold from 10 percent to 5 percent 84 Issue: Direct ownership interests and amendments to section FE 41 Clause 94 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed over whether an owner’s direct ownership interests should include the direct ownership interests held by their associates. This relates to the amendments to section FE 41 included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Comment Consistent with the amendments to section FE 41 in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act, a person’s direct ownership interests do not include the interests of their associates. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 85 OTHER MATTERS Issue: References to “associated person” in sections FE 2 and FE 26 Clauses 88 and 96 Submission (Ernst & Young) Several proposed paragraphs in section FE 2 provide that the members of a group should be treated as if they are associated. Such a reference is similarly included in proposed section FE 26(7). It is unclear what this is meant to achieve and it should be clarified. Comment The reference to associated persons is intended to link in with the rule in section FE 41 which, among other things, sets out how the interests of associated persons are to be combined. This rule, in essence, specifies that interests should not be double-counted. Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extension of on-lending concession for trusts Clause 91 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) The on-lending concession is generally being extended for trusts so that it applies to all financial arrangements. This extension is appropriate. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The extension applies only when a trust has no other property. However, ―property‖ may include rights under financial arrangement contracts that have been entered into. The provision should be amended as a trust may have property that is incidental to its financial arrangements. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) 86 The requirement for a trust to have a New Zealand group consisting of itself alone or itself and other trustees is not necessary. This requirement will automatically be fulfilled by virtue of the requirement that a trust owns no property other than financial arrangements. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young) Comment Officials agree with both issues raised by submitters. The extension to the on-lending concession should still be available to a trust that holds property incidental to its financial arrangements. We also agree that the requirement that a trust have a New Zealand group consisting of itself along (or itself and other trustees) is unnecessary as it will automatically be fulfilled given the requirement that the trust hold only financial arrangements. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Grouping rules for trustees Clause 89 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) Proposed amendments to section FE 3(1)(d) will provide that the New Zealand group of a trustee includes all companies controlled by the trustee. It is unclear what ―control‖ means in this context. Arguably all companies that a corporate trustee has legal control over could be caught, regardless of the capacity in which that control is held. (Ernst & Young) It is unclear why proposed sections FE 3(1)(f) and FE 3(1)(g) define the New Zealand and worldwide groups for a ―controlling body‖ as a collective. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) Comment ―Control‖ in section FE 3(1)(d) is intended to refer to the control threshold set out in section FE 27, as held by the trustee in their capacity as trustee of the relevant trust. Officials will consider whether this drafting could be clarified. Proposed sections FE 3(1)(f) and FE 3(1)(g) operate much in the same way as section FE 27 operates for parent companies. The controlling body is the New Zealand parent and every company under its control is included in its group. These sections do not determine the New Zealand group of the companies controlled by the controlling body. That is done under proposed section FE 26(4D) and section FE 28. Again, this is much the same as how rules work for standard companies. 87 Officials note that these sections may no longer be necessary given the recommended changes to section FE 2(1)(cc). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Reference to non-resident owning body in section FE 25 Clause 95 Submission (Ernst & Young) It is unclear why section FE 25 should be amended to include a reference to a ―non-resident owning body‖. Such a body is not a taxpayer and does not itself need to comply with the thin capitalisation rules. Comment Section FE 25 sets out how the grouping rules in sections FE 26 to FE 30 operate. The proposed amendments to section FE 25 reflect that these other sections are being modified to provide the New Zealand group of a non-resident owning body. Officials therefore consider that the amendment is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Worldwide group of those acting together Clause 97 Submission (Ernst & Young) The heading of proposed section FE 31D should be amended to clarify that it applies when a non-resident owning body has been identified as a company’s New Zealand parent. A similar provision should be provided if a company’s New Zealand parent is a controlling body (that is, determined under proposed section FE 26(4D)). Comment Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved in this section. 88 Officials note that a similar provision is provided for a company with a New Zealand parent that is a controlling body in proposed section FE 3(1)(g). Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Exclusion of indirect CFC and FIF interests Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Proposed section FE 16(1BA) will require individuals or trustees to exclude certain interests in a CFC or FIF held by companies in which those individuals or trustees have a significant interest. This exclusion is not appropriate in all cases. If the individual or trustee will be taxed on the CFC or FIF income when it is distributed, the relevant assets should be able to be included for thin capitalisation purposes. Comment Proposed section FE 16(1BA) will bring the treatment of a person who has a significant indirect interest in a CFC in line with the treatment where they have a significant direct interest in a CFC. Officials consider the proposal should therefore proceed. The submitter is correct that the individual or trustee will be taxed on their CFC or FIF income when it is eventually distributed. However, until this distribution occurs the individual or trustee may gain significantly from deferral. Officials note this situation could be avoided by placing debt offshore (so thin capitalisation thresholds are not breached) or by placing debt in a company (where any interest denial will generate imputation credits, preventing double-taxation of the eventual distribution). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 89 Issue: Rules to ensure debt and asset is used only once Clause 92 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill proposes several new provisions that are designed to ensure the assets and liabilities of an entity can only be included in one New Zealand group and one worldwide group for thin capitalisation purposes. The rules are complex and further consideration is required to ensure the rules have no unintended consequences. More practical examples on the operation of the rules should also be provided. Comment For the thin capitalisation rules to work appropriately, a person’s debt and assets should only be counted for one thin capitalisation group. If the assets and debt are counted more than once it can inappropriately affect the amount of debt non-residents are able to put into New Zealand. Officials consider this rule should therefore be kept. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Technical amendment to section FE 18 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section FE 18(5)(a) deems the debt-to-asset ratio of an entity’s worldwide group to be 54.54 percent in several situations. One of these is if the group’s members are all resident in New Zealand – that is, the group does not operate outside New Zealand. This section could arguably apply when a company’s worldwide group is deemed to be its New Zealand group, such as under proposed section FE 31D. This would not be appropriate. Officials recommend a technical amendment to section FE 18 to ensure the section does not apply in this case. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 90 Issue: Drafting matters Clauses 88, 89, 92, 93 and 96 Submission (Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers)  Proposed section FE 2(1)(d)(i) should be clarified so it is clear whether the associated person referred to is an associate of a non-resident or an associate of the trust.  Proposed section FE 2(1)(cc) could be read to require that an entity must meet all of paragraphs (a) to (cb). This is presumably not intended so should be clarified.  Proposed section FE 2(1)(cc) refers to ―entities, including one or more trustee‖. This could either be read as a group that includes at least one person acting as a trustee, or a group consisting solely of the trustees of one or more trusts. This should be clarified.  Proposed amendments to section FE 3(1)(b) sets out the worldwide group for an individual. This is unnecessary as individuals cannot apply the worldwide group debt test.  It is unclear that proposed section FE 16(1D) is intended to apply when shares are being transferred as the section refers to a transfer of assets.  Proposed section FE 26(2)(bb) sets out when a non-resident owning body is a New Zealand parent. It should be clarified that the requirements in paragraphs (i) and (ii) apply to the non-resident owning body, not the excess debt entity.  The word ―entity‖ rather than ―person‖ is used in several places. This suggests that only legal bodies are intended to be captured by the relevant provisions. Whether this is intended should be clarified. Comment Officials will consider whether the drafting could be improved in these sections. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 91 Black hole expenditure 92 93 OVERVIEW Clauses 16, 39, 41, 42, 44, 54, 55 and 124 This group of amendments addresses the tax treatment of certain items of ―black hole‖ expenditure, which is business expenditure of a capital nature that is neither immediately deductible nor gives rise to a depreciable asset for tax purposes. The amendments address the tax treatment of expenditure on:  failed or aborted resource consents, patents and plant variety rights;  certain fixed-life resource consents; and  paying a dividend, annual subscriptions to be listed on a stock exchange, and shareholder meetings. Five submitters commented on these aspects of the bill. Generally submitters supported the changes to remove certain distortions arising from tax settings, reduce compliance costs and provide certainty of tax treatment for taxpayers. However, submitters were concerned about the proposed claw-back provision (proposed new section CG 7B) clawing back a larger amount of deductions than intended. They also noted that other fixed-life resource consents remain subject to ―black hole‖ tax treatment. The proposed non-deductibility of expenditure on special shareholder meetings was not supported by most submitters. Submitters also advocated making the application dates of certain changes retrospective on the basis that the amendments are remedial and/or clarify and confirm current practice. 94 APPLICATIONS FOR RESOURCE CONSENTS, PATENTS AND PLANT VARIETY RIGHTS Clauses 39, 41 and 42 Issue: Support for the proposals Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Four submitters expressed their overall support for these amendments, based on the removal of ―black hole‖ expenditure on aborted or unsuccessful resource consent, patent and plant variety rights applications. One submitter notes that the amendments expand the scope of eligibility for deductible expenditure under sections DB 19 and DB 37 of the Income Tax Act 2007. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Another submitter notes the amendments legislatively clarify the deductibility of costs associated with failed and withdrawn patent, plant variety rights and resource consent applications. (KPMG) Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Expenditure incurred on lapsed resource consents should be deductible Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed amendment to section DB 19 should be extended to allow for situations where resource consents lapse or are surrendered. This may happen because its conditions are not met or the resource consent is not exercised. It is appropriate that this expenditure should be deductible as this situation is economically identical to that when a resource consent is refused, withdrawn or not lodged. 95 Comment The proposed amendment removes the requirement for taxpayers to have lodged an application for the grant of a resource consent before capital expenditure incurred on an aborted or unsuccessful resource consent can be deducted. This amendment does not currently cover expenditure on a resource consent that is granted but lapses or is surrendered. Officials agree with submitters that this situation is similar to those covered by section DB 19 as capital expenditure has been incurred on an unsuccessful resource consent. Allowing a deduction for expenditure incurred on lapsed or surrendered resource consents is consistent with the policy intent of removing ―black hole‖ treatment for expenditure on unsuccessful resource consents. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date for proposed amendments to sections DB 19 and DB 37 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposed amendments to sections DB 19 and DB 37 should be made retrospective to 1 October 2005, which is the date their predecessors (sections DB 13B and DB 28B of the Income Tax Act 2004) were inserted, and effective from. These amendments are remedial in nature and ensure that the law reflects the original policy intent of allowing a deduction for capital expenditure incurred in applying for a resource consent or patent that does not give rise to a depreciable asset. In the regulatory impact statement accompanying these proposed changes, it noted that officials expected that taxpayers would complete abandoned projects and then withdraw them to obtain a deduction under section DB 19. Taxpayers who considered this approach was inappropriate under either resource consent regulations or tax law and have not taken a deduction for expenditure on failed resource consent applications should be able to take the deduction now; this would necessitate making the proposed amendment retrospective. Comment The proposed amendment will reduce compliance costs by removing the requirement for taxpayers to apply for the grant of a resource consent to deduct their expenditure. Officials note that this amendment does not clarify the existing policy setting but changes it. Therefore, making the amendment prospective is the appropriate approach. Fiscal cost estimates have also been prepared on this basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 96 Issue: Clarification of deductible patent and resource consent expenditure Submission (KPMG) The proposed amendments to sections DB 19 and DB 37 provide only a small increase in additional deductions. Inland Revenue has a narrow view of what constitutes the cost of a patent or resource consent, which is understood to be only the legal and administration costs of the application, so any additional deductions arising from the proposed amendments are likely to be limited. Officials should provide guidance around what additional expenditure will now become deductible under these changes. Comment The intent of these changes is to expand the scope of eligibility for a deduction under these sections to instances when expenditure has been incurred by a taxpayer on an intended application which they decide not to lodge. Currently, a taxpayer must have lodged the application before they can receive a deduction. It is not the intent of the proposed changes to extend the types of expenditure deductible under sections DB 19 and DB 37 beyond those types of expenditure that are currently deductible under these sections. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 97 CLAW-BACK FOR SUBSEQUENT APPLICATIONS OR DISPOSALS Clauses 16, 54 and 55 Issue: Support for the proposals Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter expressed overall support for these amendments which claw back (or recapture) deductions for failed expenditure on applications for resource consents, patents and plant variety rights as income when abandoned application property is sold or used as part of another intellectual property right. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed claw-back amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The claw-back provision overreaches Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The scope of proposed section CG 7B(4) is currently too wide. In its current form it claws back ―the total amount of deductions‖ that were allowed under sections DB 19, DB 37 or proposed new section DB 40BA. Clawed-back income should only correspond to deductions for expenditure on an aborted or failed application to the extent that property obtained as a result of that expenditure is subsequently used in the lodging of a patent application or in obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights. The proposed claw-back provision does not simply claw back the additional capital costs that the bill proposes to make deductible, but also includes deductions currently (and previously) allowed under sections DB 19 and DB 37. It could also possibly result in the claw back of previously deducted feasibility expenditure. (KPMG) If this proposal is not changed, the clawed-back income should be limited to the lesser of the value of the failed expenditure previously deducted and the disposal proceeds (or the value of the new intellectual property created). (KPMG) 98 Comment Officials agree with the submission that the drafting of the provision should be changed to reflect the intended policy outcome of only clawing back deductions for expenditure on an aborted or failed application to the extent that property obtained as a result of that expenditure is subsequently used in the lodging of a patent application or in obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: When clawed-back income should be returned Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) Proposed new section CG 7B does not specify when the clawed-back income should be returned. While this should be straight-forward to determine when the abandoned application property is sold, it will be less straight-forward when the property is used for the purposes of another resource consent application. Clawed-back income should not arise until the resource consent is granted. Comment Officials agree with the submission, and wish to draw the submitters’ attention to the wording of proposed section CG 7B(2)(b), which states that a person has income ―if the application property is used ... in obtaining the grant of a resource consent‖. We agree that a timing-of-income provision should be added to provide clarity about which income year the income is allocated to. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Claw-back of deductions for subsequent applications Submission (Ernst & Young) The submitter notes it is reasonable to claw back deductions if the application property, for which a deduction under sections DB 19, DB 37 or proposed new section DB 40BA has been taken, is disposed of for consideration. This is equivalent to depreciation recovery income. 99 The submitter suggests that it is not appropriate to claw back deductions if abandoned application property is later used in making a patent application or obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights. There is likely to be uncertainty around whether expenditure incurred on making an application of the above type, that does not represent expenditure on any underlying invention or plant variety, has given rise to any identifiable property and whether it has then been used in obtaining the grant of a resource consent or plant variety rights or making a patent application. There is also no precedent for such a claw-back provision for either tangible or intangible depreciable property. For example, this does not apply to deductions allowed for unsuccessful software development. Such a claw-back provision would therefore be inconsistent with existing policy settings. Comment Officials note the concerns of the submitter but note this claw-back rule is an important integrity measure. Without a claw-back rule for deductions on expenditure on abandoned application property that is subsequently used in a successful application, taxpayers could obtain a timing advantage on their deductions compared with a taxpayer who makes a first-time successful application, for which the expenditure would be depreciable over the life of the resource consent, patent or plant variety rights. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Remove unnecessary provisions in proposed new section CG 7B Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Paragraphs (a) and (b) of proposed new section CG 7B(1) are superfluous as they repeat conditions which must have been met to satisfy section CG 7B(1)(c). Comment Officials agree with the submission and recommend a change to the drafting of the legislation to remove the unnecessary paragraphs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 100 Issue: Relationship between proposed new section CG 7B and sections EE 25 and EE 57 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When ―application property‖ is subsequently used in the production of an item of depreciable intellectual property, the drafting of the legislation should match what is proposed in the Commentary on the bill, which is that the clawed-back amount will be depreciated over the life of the new asset. The Commentary on the bill states that the clawed-back amount will be included in the cost of the intangible property to be depreciated over the life of the new depreciable asset. The method adopted by the legislation would seem to be that proposed new section CG 7B(2)(b) deems the amount to be ―income‖ and that the cost is then included in the proposed modifications to sections EE 25 and EE 57. There would seem to be no obvious linkage between these steps and it would be useful if the linkage between proposed new section CG 7B and the other provisions could be signalled in proposed new section CG 7B. Comment The submitter has correctly explained the intended interaction between proposed new section CG 7B and the proposed amendments to sections EE 25 and EE 57. Officials are happy to provide additional clarity around how proposed new section CG 7B links with sections EE 25 and EE 57, by including a ―signpost‖ within proposed new section CG 7B. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Inclusion of “plant variety rights” in section EE 57 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clause 55 should be amended to exclude ―plant variety rights‖ as these are already dealt with under clause 54. The proposed new section EE 57(3)(cb) will only apply if the ―expenditure has given rise under section CG 7B to an amount of income‖. Therefore, the expenditure on a failed plant variety rights application is taken into account for depreciation purposes under the proposed amendment to section EE 25(3)(a) and does not need to be duplicated in the proposed new section EE 57(3)(cb). The total deductions in section EE 60 specifically include the amount of a deduction under section EE 25. 101 Comment Officials disagree with this interpretation of the relationship between proposed section CG 7B and sections EE 25 and EE 57 under the proposed amendments to them. Section EE 25 allows a pro-rated deduction for the cost of a plant variety rights application when plant variety rights are granted. The proposed amendment to section EE 25(3)(a) ensures that any expenditure clawed back as income under proposed new section CG 7B is included within the cost of a subsequent plant variety rights application for the purposes of this deduction. Without the proposed amendment, the taxpayer would be entitled to a smaller deduction. Once they are granted, plant variety rights, being an item of fixed-life intangible property, should be depreciated over their legal life. Section EE 57 determines the ―base value‖ (or the cost) of an item for depreciation purposes. ―Total deductions‖ determined in section EE 60, are then subtracted from the base value to determine the ―adjusted tax value‖ of the item which reflects the item’s cost less depreciation deductions claimed in previous years. The item’s adjusted tax value is then used when calculating a year’s depreciation deduction. If plant variety rights are not included within proposed new section EE 57(3)(cb), the clawed- back amount would not be added to the base value of the asset, and consequently would not be depreciable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 102 FIXED-LIFE RESOURCE CONSENTS Clause 124 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitters expressed their overall support for the addition of resource consents granted under section 15A and 15B of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) to schedule 14 of the Act. This makes expenditure on these resource consents depreciable. Comment Officials note the general support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Other fixed-life resource consents Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Submitters noted that there are other fixed-life resource consents granted under section 9 of the RMA relating to restrictions on the use of land that are not currently depreciable. To the extent that these consents have a finite life, they should be included within schedule 14 of the Act and be depreciable. Comment Officials would welcome further evidence on fixed-life resource consents granted under section 9 of the RMA in order to assess the scope of the issue. Our approach is to consider black hole expenditure issues on a case-by-case basis. The addition of resource consents granted under section 9 of the RMA would be more complex than the current proposed changes envisage. Schedule 14 of the Act lists items of depreciable intangible property, and while the Act has a definition of ―depreciable intangible property‖ that requires the property to have an estimable, finite useful life, this criterion is overruled by the inclusion of the property in schedule 14. This prevents the addition of resource consents granted under section 9 of the RMA to schedule 14 because then all section 9 resource consents would be depreciable, whether the consent period is finite or perpetual. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 103 COMPANY ADMINISTRATION COSTS Clause 44 Issue: Support for parts of the proposals Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitters expressed their general support for the proposed amendments that clarify the tax treatment of expenditure on the payment of dividends, the annual subscription paid to list on a recognised stock exchange and annual shareholder meeting costs. Comment Officials note the support for the proposed amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Extend application of proposed section DB 63B to include all fees paid to a recognised stock exchange Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The bill proposes allowing the annual subscription paid to list on a recognised stock exchange to be deductible. Other listing fees, including the initial cost of listing, are not addressed in the bill. These should be deductible as an initial public offering is an ordinary part of a company’s business when it is seeking to access additional equity. It is also a necessary step in growing a business despite the one-off nature of the initial listing fee. A distinction between initial and annual listing fees is not appropriate from a policy perspective. Denying a deduction for initial listing fees may discourage New Zealand businesses from listing their shares, which goes against the Government’s goal of deepening capital markets to promote increased national savings. There are also a number of other listing fees such as the cost of an already listed company seeking additional capital or operating a dividend reinvestment programme. It is currently a judgement call whether these costs are capital or revenue. To reduce compliance costs and remove distortions, all listing costs should be deductible. 104 Comment Officials disagree with these views. From a policy perspective, initial listing fees are a one-off cost incurred to raise additional equity which creates an enduring benefit for the company. This expenditure is of a capital nature and should not be deductible. The Government has a broad-base, low-rate tax policy framework, which, in general, aims to tax all forms of income evenly at the lowest rate possible. To avoid taxpayers basing decisions on tax advantages instead of commercial merit, the tax system should not be used to encourage (or discourage) certain activities. Officials recognise the Government’s goal of deepening capital markets but note that the Government has other policy options at its disposal to support this objective that do not conflict with the overall tax policy framework. There is a significant difference in the nature of the benefit arising from expenditure on initial and annual listing fees respectively. While companies must pay a subscription annually to a recognised stock exchange to remain listed, the initial cost of listing is a one-off expense from which the benefits of additional equity endure for a long period. This forms a justification for allowing a deduction for annual listing fees but denying a deduction for initial listing fees. Officials’ view is consistent with Inland Revenue’s 2011 draft interpretation statement, Deductibility of company administration costs, which issued draft guidelines on the deductibility of certain company administration costs. It found that expenditure on listing fees was of a capital nature. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax treatment of special shareholder meeting costs Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG) The bill proposes denying a deduction for expenditure on special shareholder meetings. This should not proceed as taxpayers are comfortable with self-assessment at the capital-revenue boundary. There are a number of reasons to hold a special shareholder meeting that would ordinarily be considered revenue – for example, to block a hostile takeover, discuss a major transaction or change the management structure of the company. Expenditure on these meetings will not be deductible under the current proposals. This is not the correct outcome. Two submitters also proposed making expenditure on special shareholder meetings deductible. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) 105 Comment The proposed changes to the tax treatment of special shareholder meeting costs cannot be viewed in isolation. Instead, these must be considered in conjunction with the proposed tax treatment of annual shareholder meeting (AGM) costs. Officials have prioritised a reduction of compliance costs over the accuracy of the tax treatment and attempted to balance the proposed concessionary treatment of AGM costs with a revenue-positive treatment of special shareholder meeting costs. The bill proposes allowing a deduction for all expenditure on annual shareholder meetings in new section DB 63C(1). This is taxpayer-friendly as a special resolution voted on at an AGM could change the capital structure of the company, and therefore under self-assessment the amount attributed to the capital special resolution of the total AGM cost would not be deductible. However, officials do not think apportioning the meeting cost between the revenue and capital resolutions voted on is desirable from a compliance cost perspective. The taxpayer- friendly treatment of AGM costs necessitates that expenditure on special shareholder meetings be made non-deductible to ensure the overall changes to the tax treatment of shareholder meeting costs are revenue-neutral. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of “meeting costs” Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Officials should clarify in the Tax Information Bulletin commentary what exactly constitutes ―meeting costs‖ for the purposes of the legislation. The submitter suggests that only direct costs of the shareholder meeting, such as venue hire and catering, should be considered as costs of the meeting for the purposes of proposed new section DB 63C. Comment Officials expect that the expenditure items considered as ―meeting costs‖ should be clarified by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in the appropriate fashion, such as an interpretation statement. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 106 Issue: Application dates for the proposed new sections DB 63, DB 63B and DB 63C(1) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date for proposed sections DB 63, DB 63B and DB 63C(1) should be made retrospective. This is because the amendments clarify and confirm existing business practice. This will give taxpayers certainty that earlier tax positions taken will not be challenged. All submitters suggested that the application date should be made retrospective from the taxpayer’s statute bar period. One submitter suggested that, at the very least, the retrospective application needs to be from the commencement of the 2013–14 income year given the policy was announced in the May 2013 Budget. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The new provisions constitute a policy change rather than merely a confirmation of existing policy settings. They have been introduced to reduce compliance costs and provide certainty of the tax treatment of certain company administration costs that are on, or near, the capital- revenue boundary. Making the application dates prospective is the appropriate approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 107 OTHER SUBMISSIONS Issue: Further “black hole” expenditure issues Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We support the work undertaken to address certain areas of black hole expenditure. However, there remains a number of black hole expenditure items in the New Zealand tax system that require consideration by officials. A comprehensive solution to black hole expenditure should also be considered. Comment As noted above, officials’ approach is to consider black hole expenditure issues on a case-by- case basis. A comprehensive solution to black hole expenditure, such as a catch-all provision, is not currently under consideration. Different black hole expenditure issues will require individual policy solutions to ensure that their tax treatment remains neutral, consistent and fair. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 108 109 Foreign account information-sharing agreements 110 111 OVERVIEW New Zealand has signalled its intentions to negotiate an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States to clarify the reporting obligations of New Zealand financial institutions under the United States’ law commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). This bill contains amendments that are required to bring any agreed IGA into domestic law and allow New Zealand financial institutions to comply with its terms. The proposed amendments are generally drafted in a broad manner to accommodate the possibility of New Zealand entering into similar agreements with other jurisdictions in the future. The proposals attracted more than 50 submissions, mostly from individuals (including some from overseas). Submissions from these individuals were unanimously opposed to FATCA and the IGA and, by extension, the proposed changes. Submissions were also received from the financial services sector and their advisors. These submissions broadly supported the intent of the proposed amendments, and commented on some technical and drafting issues. 112 OPPOSED TO THE CHANGES Issue: Should the proposed legislation for foreign account information-sharing agreements be advanced? Clauses 2(23), 5, 6, 37, 128(1), (2), (5), 123(15), 129, 150, 151, 152 and 158 Submissions (Andrew Broadwell, Anne Cargill, Arielle Hiscox, Benjamin Popovich, C Tobias, Carol Tapanila, Caroline Hooper, Carrie Fisher, Centre for Freedom and Prosperity, Dan Sullivan, Darlene Hall, Darryl Betham, Dean Tatro, Dr Nathaniel Janke-Gilman, Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, Elliot Sawyer, Grant Kuppernick, Gwen D, Harold David Bonnett, Henry Velthuizen, Ian Fish, James George Jatras, James H Woods, Jason Spears, John Phillips, John Richardson, John Smith, Jonathan Baker, Jonathan Evans, Julian Woodhouse, Kent W Deitemeyer, Kirsten Woods, Lea Turkington, Lindsay Forbes, Lynne Swanson, Marvin Van Horn, Matt Joynes, Matthew Agnew, Matthew Provost, Mr A, Paul Andrew Ross, Rachael Fone, Rebecca Woodhouse, Richard Borain, Robert Fraser, Simon Titheridge, Stephen John Schoenberg, Stephen Rowe, Stephen Tamatoa Cairns, Tiffany Love, Timothy Smyth, Victor Paul) The aspect of the proposed legislation creating a framework for foreign account information sharing agreements should be withdrawn from the bill. Comment Officials are conscious of the fact that, although the submission summarised above does accurately portray the views of the relevant submitters, the primary concern appears to be with New Zealand’s proposed entry into an intergovernmental agreement (IGA) with the United States in respect of its Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). 1 In this regard, there are some key areas of concern that have been consistently raised during the submission process. It is therefore considered appropriate to address each of these key areas in turn. To the extent that submitters have raised concerns that extend beyond these key areas (but are nevertheless opposing the proposed legislation) officials have attempted to respond to those comments too. First, however, it is important to restate why officials consider that entering into an IGA with the United States is in the best interests of New Zealand. This explanation expands on that provided in the Inland Revenue Regulatory Impact Statement that accompanied the introduction of this bill. 2 Entering into an IGA Without an IGA, in order to avoid FATCA penalties, New Zealand financial institutions would need to enter into separate agreements with the United States’ Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under these agreements, the financial institutions would need to: 1 For the purposes of this report, it is assumed that New Zealand will enter into an IGA on the terms of the ―Model 1A IGA‖ (with corresponding Annex I and Annex II), as published in the US Treasury website: http://www.treasury.gov/resource- center/tax-policy/treaties/Pages/FATCA.aspx. 2 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2013-ris-arearm-bill-04.pdf. 113  identify US accounts and report certain information about these accounts to the IRS on an annual basis;  withhold 30% on payments from the US to a non-participating foreign financial institutions or to a recalcitrant account holder (account holders who have not provided the required information); and  close the accounts of these recalcitrant account holders. Officials consider that New Zealand financial institutions would not be able to comply with these agreements under our existing legislative framework. Private details of individuals may be able to be collected and shared if appropriate amendments were made to customers’ terms and conditions. Terms and conditions may also be able to be used to close accounts in appropriate instances. However, it is not clear that a financial institution could ever legally act as a withholding agent for a foreign government. Entering into separate agreements would also impose significant compliance costs on all New Zealand financial institutions. The only way such agreements could be effected would therefore be for New Zealand to enact specific legislation that allowed financial institutions to comply with their terms. This would solve the issue at one level but would still impose significant compliance costs on New Zealand institutions and would effectively result in those institutions being subject to US regulation. Entering into an IGA will significantly lower compliance costs on New Zealand financial institutions by providing some clear exemptions from reporting and relieving institutions of having to withhold on payments made to customers. It will also significantly reduce the likelihood that New Zealand financial institutions will have FATCA penalties imposed on them. In essence, not entering into an IGA and not enacting enabling legislation of some sort would leave New Zealand financial institutions with a choice of:  not investing either directly or indirectly into the US (to avoid withholding); or  investing in the US and suffering the withholding penalty. Officials do not consider either of these options is desirable for the health of the New Zealand financial services sector. Cost/benefit for New Zealand Officials do not consider it is possible to accurately predict the cost of Government inaction. This is largely because:  It is not known what the exact size of investments that the financial services sector, both directly and indirectly, has into the United States.  It is not possible to accurately estimate the likely returns that financial institutions would receive from the counterfactual of not investing in the United States. However, in saying this, it is our view that effectively denying New Zealand financial institutions access to the world’s largest capital market, or reducing the return from such investments by the 30% penalty, would be likely to have a severe impact on investment returns. Lower investment returns by New Zealand financial institutions has the potential to raise the cost of financial transactions for all New Zealanders, not just those ―US persons‖ that would be the subject of IGA reporting. 114 Officials also take the opportunity to reiterate that nothing in the IGA alters any substantive United States taxing rights – meaning that, if a New Zealand resident also has US tax obligations, those obligations already exist as a matter of law and nothing in the IGA or the proposed legislation will raise or lower the amount of US tax owing. International trends/reputational issues From a Government perspective, officials also note that FATCA is now part of a major global initiative to combat international tax evasion. FATCA is based on the idea of global automatic exchange of certain information by financial institutions. Previously these information exchanges have occurred either on an ad hoc or ―on request‖ basis, or annually by way of agreement between tax authorities under various double tax treaties. Automatic exchange of information between multiple jurisdictions is now the new international standard for automatic exchange endorsed by the G20 and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Officials consider there would be a severe reputational risk for New Zealand if it were not to be involved in this international movement. All OECD countries have either signed, or are negotiating, IGAs with the United States in respect of FATCA. The OECD itself has dedicated resources to devising a common reporting model for financial accounts, based on the FATCA model. This tax transparency is seen as complementing its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) work. The BEPS initiative is aimed at ensuring that entities and individuals that operate in numerous jurisdictions pay an appropriate amount of tax. Automatic information exchange and transparency in tax affairs is seen as an important compliance tool for this programme. It is also important to note that, under the IGA and any OECD/G20 model that may be devised in the future, New Zealand will also be the recipient of information in respect of New Zealand tax residents that have undeclared offshore bank accounts. This information will assist in ensuring that all New Zealanders also pay the correct amount of tax on their worldwide income. Officials consider that the aims of FATCA (which are, ultimately, reduced tax evasion) are being caught up in the wider issue of the United States ―citizenship‖ basis of taxation, which is relatively unusual by international standards. However, officials consider that entering into information exchange agreements that allow countries to levy tax according to its laws is becoming an important part of being a ―good international citizen‖ and will ultimately benefit New Zealand both in a fiscal and reputational sense. In saying this, officials acknowledge the genuine concern of submitters who consider that New Zealand entering into an IGA and enacting the proposed legislation will have a detrimental impact on their lives. Key concerns The key areas of concern raised in submissions are:  Allowing a financial institution the ability to send IGA-relevant information to Inland Revenue, which in turn will pass it to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the United States, is a breach of the privacy rights of the individuals concerned. 115  Allowing this information-sharing is a form of discrimination against a group of people based on their nationality, arguably contrary to New Zealand’s Human Rights Act and Bill of Rights Act.  The United States’ system of citizenship-based taxation is fundamentally unjust.  Reporting will result in ―overreach‖, with particular concerns being expressed that the information of spouses that are not ―US persons‖ will be provided.  New Zealand is being ―bullied‖ into accepting FATCA and the IGA, which are an impingement on New Zealand’s sovereignty. Officials will address each of these areas in turn. Issue: Privacy concerns (Anne Cargill, C Tobias, Caroline Hooper, Carrie Fisher, Centre for Freedom and Prosperity, Darlene Hall, Darryl Betham, Dr Nathaniel Janke-Gilman, Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, Elliot Sawyer, Grant Kuppernick, Gwen D, Harold David Bonnett, Ian Fish, James George Jatras, James H Woods, Jason Spears, John Phillips, John Richardson, John Smith (key recommendation 3 and recommendation 9), Jonathan Baker, Kirsten Woods, Lea Turkington, Marvin Van Horn, Matthew Agnew, Rachael Fone, Rebecca Woodhouse, Richard Borain, Stephen John Schoenberg, Stephen Rowe – and implicit in other submissions) New Zealand’s Privacy Act is written in a way that contemplates it being over-ridden by express statutory authority. Officials consider that the scheme of this Act therefore anticipates that there may be over-riding public policy arguments for setting limits on privacy principles in carefully defined circumstances. Officials accept that, under the IGA, information will be collected and shared which is not currently being collected or shared. In these cases, there is always a judgement about whether collecting that information is ―appropriate‖ in a public policy sense, taking all circumstances into account. This is as true of information-sharing between New Zealand government departments as it is to sharing between governments. The question therefore becomes: what is ―appropriate‖? It seems obvious from submissions that many of the individuals concerned do not consider information-sharing in this case to be appropriate. However, government is in the position of having to make such judgements on a national, rather than individual, level. As set out in ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report, officials consider that a sound public policy argument exists in this case that justifies New Zealand entering into an IGA – a necessary part of such an action being that the information collection and transmission contemplated in the IGA will occur. The privacy of the individuals concerned was a factor that officials examined in reaching this view, but it was, on balance, deemed to be outweighed by other public-interest considerations. 116 Issue: Discrimination (Andrew Broadwell, Anne Cargill, C Tobias, Caroline Hooper, Carrie Fisher, Darryl Betham, Dr Nathaniel Janke-Gilman, Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, Grant Kuppernick, Gwen D, Harold David Bonnett, Henry Velthuizen, Ian Fish, James George Jatras, John Richardson, John Smith (recommendation 1), Kent W Deitemeyer, Kirsten Woods, Lea Turkington, Marvin Van Horn, Matt Joynes, Matthew Provost, Richard Borain, Simon Titheridge – and implicit in other submissions) Officials accept that, as a result of IGA information gathering and collecting, information on people that are ―US persons‖ will be transmitted to the IRS, while the information of those that are not ―US Persons‖ (or exhibit no ―US indicia‖) will not. Officials also accept that there is an argument that this different treatment will take place because of the nationality of the person concerned, while noting that a ―US person‖ for IGA purposes is not synonymous with ―US Citizen‖. Contrary to what is asserted in some submissions, officials wish to reassure the Committee that this bill was vetted for consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act by the Ministry of Justice, which was informed of the context of the changes. 3 Issue: The US basis of taxation (Anne Cargill, C Tobias, Carol Tapanila, Caroline Hooper, Carrie Fisher, Darlene Hall, Darryl Betham, Dean Tatro, Dr Nathaniel Janke-Gilman, Grant Kuppernick, Gwen D, Harold David Bonnett, John Richarsdon, John Smith, Kent W Deitemeyer, Kirsten Woods, Lea Turkington, Marvin Van Horn, Matt Joynes, Mr A, Rachael Fone, Richard Borain, Robert Fraser, Simon Titheridge, Stephen John Schoenberg, Stephen Rowe, Tiffany Love – and implicit in other submissions) Officials acknowledge that the citizenship taxation model adopted by the United States is relatively unusual by international standards. However, it is not appropriate for Inland Revenue officials to comment on the merits or otherwise of tax policy decisions made by foreign governments. As officials have noted in the ―entering into an IGA section of this report, nothing in the IGA alters any substantive United States taxing rights. It is generally recognised that, with the benefits of citizenship of any country comes an obligation to abide by the laws of that country. Officials would also add that:  The United States does provide a mechanism whereby citizenship can be renounced. It is expected that a person that has renounced their US citizenship will be in a position to provide New Zealand financial institutions with sufficient evidence to prove that they are not a ―US person‖ and so should not be the subject of reporting. 3 http://www.justice.govt.nz/policy/constitutional-law-and-human-rights/human-rights/bill-of-rights/taxation-annual-rates- employee-allowances-and-remedial-matters-bill 117  The United States model of taxation is not new, so it appears reasonable to assume that citizens of the United States are aware both of their citizenship rights and obligations. Issue: Reporting “overreach” (Anne Cargill, Carrie Fisher, Dean Tatro, Elliot Sawyer, Grant Kuppernick, Gwen D, John Richardson, Marvin Van Horn, Rebecca Woodhouse, Richard Borain, Simon Titheridge, Stephen Rowe – and implicit in other submissions) It is important to note that the model IGA provides a set of ―due diligence‖ requirements that a financial institution is required to carry out in order to determine whether or not an account holder is a ―US person‖. Simply put, under these due diligence requirements, the institution is to collect or review existing data for what are known as ―US indicia‖. Where no US indicia is found, the institution is not required to report on the account holder. Where US indicia is found, there is a working presumption that the account will be held by a US person. However, even when US indicia is found, the presumption that the person is a US person is rebuttable. There are mechanisms within the IGA that allow the person to provide evidence that they are not a ―US person‖. Submitters appear particularly concerned that information on the spouses of ―US persons‖ (where those spouses are not ―US persons‖) will be reported. Officials note that oral submissions from representatives of the financial services industry confirm that New Zealand financial institutions are intending to, and their systems are designed to accommodate, separating joint account holders where necessary and only reporting the personal details of the relevant ―US person‖. In addition, officials make the following observations:  The United States has provided a ―schema‖ setting out the information that it expects to receive as part of the IGA reporting. That schema provides for the name of the US person and the account number, but it does not contain a field for the account name. Given our understanding that each customer with a bank has a unique customer number, this significantly reduces the risk of the details of a non-US taxpayer being transmitted in error.  Inland Revenue has established an IT working group with the financial services sector to ensure that only the necessary and correct information is transferred (noting that the first transfer of data to Inland Revenue is not due until about mid 2015).  Inland Revenue’s proposed technology solution for IGA information will result in data transferred from financial institutions being electronically screened to ensure it complies with minimum requirements. From the 2017 reporting period, one of the required data fields will be the US social security number (called a TIN for tax purposes and essentially an IRD number equivalent) of the relevant person. A person that is not a US taxpayer will not have a social security number. So, even if a financial institution did try to report on a non-US person, the data would be rejected by Inland Revenue systems as being incomplete. 118 The legislation before the Committee (clause 158, proposed section 185I) is also designed to reduce certain cases of ―over-reporting‖. For example, the wording on ―excluded choices‖ in clause 185 (proposed sections 185F(6) and (7)) is intended to prevent a financial institution from reporting on a US person if an account they have an interest in has a balance below the US$50,000 threshold set out in the model IGA. This is intended to ensure that financial institutions will not report on an account with a balance below that threshold even if they are held by a US person. In addition, the draft legislation only authorises financial institutions to transmit data to Inland Revenue ―...if that information and its providing and obtaining is described or contemplated in the agreement...‖. The model IGA does not contemplate the passing of information of anyone that is not a US person. Therefore, if a financial institution transmits data on any other person it will not be able to rely on the protections offered by the legislation if the relevant person made a complaint to the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act. Issue: Sovereignty issues (Arielle Hiscox, Benjamin Popovich, C Tobias, Carrie Fisher, Centre for Freedom and Prosperity, Darlene Hall, Dr Nathaniel Janke-Gilman, Grant Kuppernick, Ian Fish, James George Jatras, James H Woods, Jason Spears, John Phillips, Stephen John Schoenberg, John Richardson, John Smith (recommendation 2) Stephen Rowe, Stephen Tamatoa Cairns, Kent W Deitemeyer, Kirsten Woods, Lynne Swanson, Marvin Van Horn, Matt Joynes, Matthew Agnew, Matthew Provost, Mr A, Paul Andrew Ross, Rachael Fone, Richard Borain, Robert Fraser, Julian Woodhouse – and implicit in other submissions) From a tax policy perspective, the model IGA does not limit New Zealand’s taxing rights in the same way as, for example, a double tax treaty might. Nor does it dilute the New Zealand Government’s other regulatory capacity over financial institutions or individuals. Officials consider there is scope to raise sovereignty issues in respect of any international agreement or convention. However, there is an underlying assumption that the government of the day will only enter into agreements that it considers to be in the best interests of New Zealand. As set out in the ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report, officials consider that entering into the IGA and enacting legislation that enables financial institutions to comply with its terms is in the best interests of New Zealand in this case. In saying this though, officials are aware that this is ultimately a decision for Ministers and Parliament. The aim of the enabling legislation in this bill is simply to provide a legislative framework in which the proposed IGA, and any other similar agreements that may be entered into in the future, can operate. It is inherently limited in its scope to automatic exchange of information agreements, but is drafted in broadest way possible to accommodate these agreements, whatever form they may take. 119 Issue: Other matters raised Submissions also raise the following points: The IGA and enabling legislation will be detrimental to the New Zealand economy. (Elliot Sawyer, Kirsten Woods) It is recognised that IGA information may result in previously unpaid US tax liabilities being discovered. However, as officials have noted in the ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report, we consider that, from a New Zealand economy perspective, the most detrimental course of action would be not to negotiate and implement an IGA. The changes are being introduced by “stealth” through an omnibus tax bill. (Marvin Van Horn, Grant Kuppernick, John Smith (recommendation 20) Officials note that almost all amendments to the core tax legislation (particularly the Income Tax Act, the Tax Administration Act and the Goods and Services Tax Act) that take place outside the budget process are contained in omnibus tax bills. The complex nature of tax legislation makes this process of regular omnibus bills the most efficient way of progressing policy and remedial changes. This includes substantial changes and redrafting of entire parts of tax legislation. The content of all tax bills is publicly available as soon as the bill is tabled in Parliament, as is the Commentary to the bill and any regulatory impact statements prepared for bill items. This bill has followed all of these standard processes. No adequate cost/benefit analysis has been undertaken/the interests of US persons in New Zealand have not been properly canvassed. (Grant Kuppernick, C Tobias, Caroline Hooper, John Smith, (recommendations 3, 4, 5, 10, 16 and 19), Henry Velthuizen, Marvin Van Horn) Officials note that it is not possible to accurately determine exactly how many ―US persons‖ are likely to be reported on under the IGA. However, officials note that 2013 Census information records 21,462 people that are ―usually resident‖ in New Zealand were born in the United States. Despite these figures, the ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report sets out why officials consider the IGA to be in the best interests of New Zealand. Officials also acknowledge the difficulty in putting a dollar value on either entering into an IGA or declining to do so. However, even in dollar terms it is expected that negotiating an IGA would be the preferable course of action – the non-monetary factors, such as reputational risk, are seen as adding weight to this conclusion. Officials consider that public submissions on this bill, and the scrutiny that entails, is a good way of gauging public opinion. As noted above, this bill has followed all the usual procedures regarding publicity and dissemination of its content. The number of submissions received indicates to officials that this process is robust and Committee members have a fair view of how the changes are perceived. 120 The IGA will not in fact be reciprocal/the IGA will not be a “treaty” under US law. (James George Janras, John Smith (recommendations 12 and 14), Lea Turkington) These issues appear to be predicated on an assumption that the United States will not have the legislative or regulatory framework in place that will cater for reciprocity – or that the United States may cancel the IGA. Again, this is not an issue that officials are able to comment on. International agreements are negotiated on a good faith understanding that each party will give effect to its terms and only break those terms, or cancel the agreement, when there are genuine reasons for doing so. The IGA is no different in this regard. New Zealand should negotiate an amnesty under which US citizens in New Zealand would have a fast-track to renouncing that citizenship or negotiate other New Zealand-specific IGA concessions. (John Smith (recommendation 6)) Officials have addressed this point in the ―Matters raised by the committee‖ section of this report. New Zealand should insist on full reciprocity, being that New Zealand should only report on US “residents”, not US citizens. (John Smith (key recommendations 2 and 13)) Officials consider this to be a sub-set of submissions opposed to the United States’ method of taxation. As set out above, it is not considered appropriate for Inland Revenue officials to comment on these matters. Experience in the UK suggests that the IGA will result in discrimination. (Jonathan Evans) Officials consider that any choices taken by financial institutions in regard to their relationships with ―US person‖ customers will be less likely to result in discrimination than would have been the case without an IGA. The IGA should not be classified as a double tax agreement (DTA) simply to over-ride privacy concerns. (John Smith (recommendation 17)). Officials consider that the classification of the IGA as a DTA does not itself over-ride the Privacy Act. The relevant privacy principles in the Privacy Act are capable of being over-ridden by any legislation that expressly contradicts them (section 7 of the Privacy Act 1993). The legislation should be delayed until after the IGA is signed. (Caroline Hooper, John Smith) The committee should assume that New Zealand will sign on terms identical to the Model 1A IGA. (John Smith (recommendation 11)) Officials accept that it would be preferable to have an IGA agreed in order to inform the debate. However, New Zealand financial institutions will have to deal with the effects of FATCA from 1 July 2014 irrespective of any action taken by the New Zealand Government. In this context, given this bill is the last legislative vehicle that will allow for a 1 July 2014 application date, officials consider that advancing this legislation in the current bill is the only viable option. In providing its guidance notes (referred to in greater detail later in this report), Inland Revenue is assuming that a Model 1A IGA will be agreed and this report is also drafted on that basis. 121 The IGA will only affect the law abiding. (Dan Sullivan, James H Woods) The aim of FATCA and the IGA is to reduce tax evasion. Officials are not in a position to speculate as to the potential volumes of ―dishonest Americans‖ (as one submitter puts it) that will be reported on. The IGA itself should be subject to public scrutiny, as should any future amendments to that agreement. (Lea Turkington, John Smith (key recommendation 1 and recommendations 21 and 23) Inland Revenue officials note that the decision as to whether or not the IGA is subject to Parliamentary Treaty Examination is made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs. This decision will be taken prior to any treaty action being taken by the Government. FATCA will be repealed in any event/reciprocity is being challenged in US courts. (Centre for Freedom and Prosperity, John Smith, James George Jatras) Officials acknowledge that, as with all countries, the United States has the right to amend its own laws. It is therefore possible that the FATCA rules may be repealed at some stage in the future. However, officials consider that ignoring current US law and instead relying on the current or a future United States government taking such a course of action would be irresponsible and would provide no benefit for New Zealand institutions and individuals who are, in the meantime, left to comply with the existing 1 July 2104 deadline. Officials are aware that court proceedings in the United States are ongoing. However, a Federal Court has recently upheld the legal status of reciprocal reporting under IGAs. 4 The Government must inform affected persons what the IGA means for them. (John Smith (recommendation 8) As mentioned later in this report, Inland Revenue is providing extensive guidelines on how the IGA will operate in practice. This guidance is expected to be finalised after an IGA is agreed. The New Zealand Government should not be funding FATCA. As set out in the ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report, the decision to enter into an IGA is at least in part an attempt to lower compliance costs that would be imposed on financial institutions in any event. It is anticipated that, by centralising some of these costs, the compliance costs on New Zealand as a whole will be reduced. The legislation does not govern what information is exchanged (Paul Andrew Ross), is generally too broad (Victor Paul), is too open given the IGA has not yet been signed (John Philips) Officials note that the actual information to be exchanged would be contained in the IGA. Given this legislation is designed to accommodate future similar agreements, officials consider the lack of specificity is appropriate. 4 http://www.justice.gov/tax/2014/flabankersassoc.pdf 122 Officials reiterate that the proposed legislation is only the framework in which any IGA will operate – the two processes are separate. If an IGA is not signed for any reason, this legislation will exist without any operative effect. Tax relief provided by the double tax agreement is inadequate (John Richardson), and this DTA should be reviewed. (John Smith (recommendation 7)) Officials acknowledge that the double tax agreement (DTA) with the United States does not apply to all forms of taxation. This is not unusual in such agreements. However, submitters appear to accept that it does apply to employment and investment income. Officials consider that, for the vast majority of people, this will cover the major forms of their income. Information will be shared with other US government agencies. (Marvin Van Horn, Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall) The actual information exchange in accordance with any IGA will take place under the existing DTA between the countries. Article 25 of the DTA sets out the terms under which information exchange will occur. This article will apply to IGA information. Article 25(2) provides: Any information received under this Article by a Contracting State shall be treated as secret in the same manner as information obtained under the domestic laws of that State and shall be disclosed only to persons or authorities (including courts and administrative bodies) involved in the assessment, collection, or administration of, the enforcement or prosecution in respect of, or the determination of appeals in relation to, the taxes referred to above, or the oversight of such functions. Such persons or authorities shall use the information only for such purposes. They may disclose the information in public court proceedings or in judicial decisions. The enabling provisions and the IGA need to be read and considered together. (John Smith (recommendations 24 and 25)) Officials consider that the submission process to this bill has ensured that the Committee is aware of the potential impact of the IGA. The practical implications of the IGA for family trusts have not been evaluated. (John Smith) Officials reiterate (as set out in the response to a New Zealand Bankers’ Association submission on ―reasonableness‖ below) that Inland Revenue is currently undertaking a process whereby it is producing guidance notes for public consultation. Part of those guidance notes covers the IGA implications for trusts, including family trusts. Inland Revenue is happy to receive submissions on those draft guidance notes as part of its ongoing public consultation process. A summary of submissions should be provided to Cabinet. (John Smith (recommendation 22)) Officials see no reason why the usual process by which the Committee reports to Parliament should be deviated from in this instance. 123 The OECD and FATCA models are different. (John Smith (recommendation 18)) Officials acknowledge that there are differences, but note that, in some respects, more reporting may take place under the draft OECD model because that model does not appear to have any low-value thresholds. Again, the real issue appears to be the citizenship basis of taxation adopted by the United States. The due diligence requirements on New Zealand financial institutions need to be clarified. (John Smith) Officials consider that preventing financial institutions reporting on low-value accounts (as set out in the bill) will address many of the privacy concerns expressed by individuals. The effect of US tax policies on KiwiSaver funds needs to be clearly understood. (John Smith) The submitter notes that the model IGA would treat KiwiSaver funds as ―non-reporting‖. In saying this, officials accept that this may not remove any underlying tax obligation a US taxpayer may have in respect of such funds. However, as the Committee will recall from recent changes to New Zealand’s foreign superannuation rules, a country exercising taxing rights over savings held in another country is not necessarily unusual. The legislation constitutes an override of the DTA. (John Smith (recommendation 15)) Officials do not consider this legislation will override the existing DTA. As set out above, the information exchange will take place under the DTA but will not have an overriding effect. Suggested alternatives Many submissions also suggest alternative courses of action that the Government should consider in preference to entering into an IGA and enacting the legislation proposed. These include the Government taking no action and letting the financial institutions deal with FATCA within the existing legal framework. Officials have addressed why Government inaction is not considered appropriate in the ―Entering into an IGA‖ section of this report. Officials do not propose to comment on the various alternative courses of action suggested by submitters. The decision, at its simplest level, is to enter into an IGA or not. All alternative courses suggested by submitters are effectively a subset of the second option. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 124 TECHNICAL MATTERS Clauses 150 and 151 Issue: Criminal penalties Submissions (AMP, ANZ, BNZ, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Failure to register should not be a criminal offence, if it is to be a criminal offence, it should not be an absolute liability offence or be subject to some ―reasonableness‖ standard. Comment Officials accept that in some respects, IGA compliance will be ―self-policing‖ because the potential of being labelled ―non-participating‖ (effectively, non-compliant) by the United States could have a severe impact on the business of a financial institution. However, under the proposed IGA with the United States, it is expected that New Zealand will have obligations to remedy any serious non-compliance by New Zealand financial institutions. Therefore, in order to be in a position to comply with the IGA, officials consider it is necessary to have a domestic penalties regime in place. The New Zealand tax rules divide penalties into two categories: civil and criminal. Criminal penalties are effectively already in place in existing legislation for what officials consider are the other likely forms of serious non-compliance: failing to collect IGA-relevant information; and failing to pass that information onto Inland Revenue when required to do so (under a notice issued under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act). The bill therefore proposes a criminal sanction for failing to register when required to do so. Officials consider that it would be incoherent to have criminal penalties for some aspects of serious non-compliance and civil penalties for others. Such a system would be costly to administer and would seemingly place a priority on enforcing some non-compliant acts, when the IGA will require New Zealand to address all forms of significant non-compliance. In addition, civil penalties are generally levied on the basis of tax owing. However, in the IGA context there is no tax owing on which to attach a penalty. Any civil penalty would therefore have to take the form of a fine of an arbitrary figure. Bearing in mind New Zealand’s obligation to enforce compliance, it is considered that a civil penalty may not have the desired deterrent effect. This is because the penalty would have to be set at a level that would not financially cripple smaller institutions, but was nevertheless meaningful for larger institutions. Officials do not consider that a single civil penalty can achieve this result. By contrast the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions is universal. Finally, officials note that Inland Revenue, if it were to pursue a prosecution for failure to comply with obligations under the IGA, is always subject to the Solicitor-General’s Prosecution Guidelines. 5 5 http://www.crownlaw.govt.nz/uploads/prosecution\_guidelines\_2013.pdf. 125 These guidelines emphasise that a prosecution can only be brought if, amongst other things, the prosecution is ―required in the public interest‖. Officials consider these guidelines set a high bar and the Committee and submitters can therefore be reassured that prosecution decisions will not be taken lightly and can only be taken when the public interest warrants that action. Officials consider it extremely unlikely that any form of inadvertent non-compliance (such as that described in submissions) that was immediately remedied by the financial institution could ever satisfy this test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transition period Clauses 150 and 151 Submission (KPMG) Given the tight timelines for IGA/FATCA compliance, there should be a transition period for the proposed penalties that apply to financial institutions. Comment Officials accept that timeframes are tight for financial institutions. However, although information collection is due to commence on 1 July 2014, there will not be any actual reporting requirements for financial institutions until around the middle of 2015. Officials consider that is the earliest point at which any non-compliance will be able to be detected. It is anticipated that this is enough time for financial institutions to prepare. In any event, officials note that the 1 July deadline for information gathering has been publicly known for some time. Although the IGA and the related provisions in this bill provide the legal framework for FATCA reporting, financial institutions have long been aware that their obligations would commence on 1 July 2014 and the first filing obligation would be in 2015. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 126 Issue: Timeframes for reporting Clause 158 Submissions (ANZ, BNZ, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The timeframe for providing information to Inland Revenue should be:  Four months. (ANZ, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association)  Six months. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The bill proposes that information be collected in respect of a New Zealand tax year, ending on 31 March. The IGA is likely to require that information be transmitted by Inland Revenue to the IRS by the end of September in the same year. As a result, there a six-month window between the end of the year and final date for information to be sent. Allowing financial institutions the full six months to report to Inland Revenue, as proposed by some submitters, is therefore unworkable. The bill proposes that financial institutions proving information to Inland Revenue in accordance with the IGA must do so within two months. The reasons for this are:  Inland Revenue will act as more than simply a ―post-box‖ for IGA information. It is anticipated that Inland Revenue will also have a ―gatekeeper‖ role to ensure that the data provided meets the minimum reporting standards. If a financial institution fails to provide complete data, this must be followed up to determine whether the data was sent in error or if more complete data is available to comply with minimum standards. In a worse-case scenario, this could mean that Inland Revenue would go through this process with every financial institution. The two month/four month split was therefore designed to allow some time for this checking to occur and also build in some inherent flexibility in reporting times (noting that there are no proposed legislative sanctions for late filing).  The IGA itself contemplates that the reporting should generally occur on a calendar year basis. This reporting period would allow nine months between the end of the period and the due date for transmission to the United States. The bill’s proposal to move this reporting period to a tax year was made because the industry preferred a reporting period that aligned with its tax reporting periods. On the assumption that Inland Revenue considered it needed four months to screen and collate the data, it seemed appropriate that the risk of the later reporting period be borne by the industry that requested it – rather than the Government.  Two months is the timeframe in which financial institutions must provide their non- resident withholding tax information in respect of accounts held by non-residents. Given the potentially similar customer base between the two types of reporting, there appear to be sound reasons for having a consistent reporting period. 127 In saying this, officials also recognise that providing this information will be as new to financial institutions as it will be for Inland Revenue. We also understand that some of the timeframe allotted to Inland Revenue was to allow for the data to be accumulated before sending. This has now changed. Indications from the United States are that it will accept information on a more piecemeal basis, so information from a single financial institution can be sent as soon as it is verified as meeting minimum standards. This being the case, officials consider there is some scope to move the reporting deadline, but not to the extent requested by submissions. Given that (in practice) information is likely to be received on or near the final date, some time is still needed for Inland Revenue to verify incomplete records. Officials therefore consider that splitting the six-month period evenly between the financial institutions and Inland Revenue will provide a fairer outcome for both parties. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, with the reporting period for financial institutions extended to three months. Issue: Excluded choices Clauses 158 Submissions (AMP, ANZ, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The concept of excluded choices should be limited so that financial institutions can still collect information from all new account holders, but only report on those where the value of the accounts exceeds the thresholds set out in the IGA. (AMP, ANZ, BNZ, New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Prohibiting reporting on low-value accounts will increase the FATCA compliance costs for financial institutions and is not justified on policy grounds. Financial institutions obliged to report should be able to do so in the most cost-effective manner, even if this requires additional data to be collected and/or reported. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The provision dealing with excluded choices is designed to prevent a possible area of over- reporting. As the volume of submissions attest to, unnecessary reporting to the IRS is a genuine concern both for US persons and those that hold joint accounts with such persons. The bill therefore proposes that financial institutions cannot ignore any low-value thresholds set out in the IGA. Without this provision, a financial institution could chose to report on a US person that, for example, had an account with a balance of $30,000, even though such reporting is not actually required by the IGA. However, officials recognise that:  It is unlikely to be possible for a financial institution to accurately assess on account- opening what a person’s account balance is likely to be at the end of the tax year, when threshold tests are applied. 128  For a financial institution, the best time to collect the relevant information is on account opening. Having to extract information from an existing customer at the end of the year in which account balances exceed certain thresholds may be expensive and relatively unfruitful.  Although the provision of data is understandably a sensitive area, the real issue in this case appears to be the transmission of any data to the IRS, rather than the information being collected and retained by the financial institution. Officials therefore agree with submitters that the legislation should be amended to allow data to be collected, but nevertheless prohibit over-reporting of that data. Recommendation That:  The New Zealand Bankers’ Association, AMP, ANZ and BNZ submissions be accepted.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers submission be declined. Issue: Permitted choices Clause 158 Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) At present, the bill arguably requires a person to comply with all possible scenarios contemplated in a foreign account information-sharing agreement. The application of the ―permitted choice‖ provision should be limited to the choice actually made. Comment Officials disagree with the interpretation of the relevant section adopted by the submitter. The submitter refers only to sections 185F(1) and (3). However, it is intended that proposed section 185F be read as a whole. Particularly relevant to this submission is the wording of proposed section 185F(2). Section 185F(1) is designed as an application section. It sets out what a ―permitted choice‖ is – effectively any choice described or contemplated by the agreement. Section 185F(2) then provides the rule that applies to those choices. It says that the person is authorised to make a permitted choice and carry that choice into effect. An application provision, followed by a rule, is a common feature of tax legislation. Officials consider its use here is appropriate and, more importantly, provides the desired policy outcome. This outcome is, as the submitter notes, allowing financial institutions to make, and carry into effect, a choice contained in the relevant agreement. It is not intended to compel a financial institution to make all possible choices. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 129 Issue: The information required to be provided Clause 158 Submission (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) There should be a distinction between information that a person is required to provide to Inland Revenue and information they are authorised to provide. Comment Again, this is an issue where officials disagree with the interpretation adopted by the submitter. As the submitter notes in its previous submission, proposed section 185F(3) modifies a person’s obligations to the extent necessary to give effect to a permitted choice. This modification also applies to the section at issue here: section 185I. It is anticipated that the information that a person provides may, to some extent, depend on ―permitted choices‖ they have made. The purpose of section 185I is to compel the person to provide whatever information is produced from the exercise of their choices. The provision of this information is not optional – however, the composition of this information will depend on choices made. For example, suppose two financial institutions in the same position are permitted a choice under the relevant agreement to do X or Y. Institution 1 chooses X and is required to report on 100 customers. Institution 2 chooses Y and is required to report on 50 customers. The number of customers reported on will be directly affected by the choice, but each institution is nevertheless required to provide the information that it produces as a consequence of their respective choices. The section is designed to neither force a financial institution to report on the maximum or minimum number of people (such an obligation would be impossible to enforce in any event because it may not be known at the time the choice is made what the exact consequences of that choice will be). An institution is simply required to follow the consequences of any choices made. Recommendation That the submission be declined 130 Issue: “Reasonableness” standard Clause 158 Submissions (New Zealand Bankers’ Association) Obligations under Part 11B should be subject to a ―reasonableness‖ standard. Comment Officials agree that IGA compliance is a new and untested regime. However, this is similarly true of any new set of tax rules. There is invariably a ―bedding in‖ period for any new set of rules. Although officials accept that underlying FATCA is a complicated set of US Treasury regulations, the IGA is intended to significantly reduce, and in some cases eliminate, the need to consult those regulations. Therefore, there does not appear to be anything unique about Part 11B in this regard. However, officials note that, in order to address the concerns of the financial services sector, Inland Revenue is currently undertaking a process whereby it is producing guidance notes for public consultation. These guidance notes are effectively draft interpretations of the model IGA, and feedback on the interpretations taken are being sought with a view to providing a full set of guidance notes covering all key issues before 1 July. It is anticipated that this process will allow the Department’s preliminary views of some of the more contentious issues to be tested and, ultimately, publicised so that the key affected parties are aware of these views. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: “Contemplated by the agreement” too broad Clause 158 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) That the use of the phrase ―contemplated by the agreement‖ in the draft legislation is too broad. Comment The expression ―described or contemplated in the agreement‖ is designed to provide financial institutions with some degree of flexibility. Officials would be concerned if a financial institution felt it could not provide relevant information because that exact information was not strictly ―described‖ in the IGA. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 131 Issue: Defining a “valid request” Clause 158 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation, in proposed section 185J, needs to be clearer in setting out what a ―valid‖ request from a foreign competent authority is. (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be legislative authority to decline a request that is not ―valid‖. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The IGA contemplates that information exchanges will generally occur between ―competent authorities‖ (being special units within Inland Revenue in New Zealand and the IRS in the United States). However, it is expected that the IGA will also have a mechanism whereby, if the IRS discovers a minor or administrative error in information provided by a financial institution, it can approach the relevant financial institution directly to seek to address the matter rather than make all such requests through Inland Revenue. Proposed section 185J contemplates these exchanges and authorises New Zealand financial institutions to legally respond directly to such IRS requests without first having to respond to Inland Revenue. Officials consider that a ―valid‖ request will be one made in accordance with the terms of the IGA, where the IRS will be attempting to quickly resolve simple queries. It is accepted that there may be circumstances when it is unclear whether a request is strictly of a ―minor or administrative‖ nature, or whether the request is actually more substantial. However, the competent authority at Inland Revenue will be available to assist financial institutions in making this judgement, if the need ever arises. Attempting to legislatively define ―minor and administrative errors‖ could cause interpretation issues, and will detract from the broad nature of the legislation by introducing more terms that are potentially IGA-specific. In any event, the IRS has the option to contact Inland Revenue directly to seek its assistance in resolving any concerns they might have with the correct administration of the IGA. Specific legislative authority is not needed to decline a request that is not valid. By definition, a request that exceeds the scope of the IGA’s terms will not be ―valid‖, so a financial institution will not be expected to respond to it. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 132 Issue: Guidance for New Zealand financial institutions Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Inland Revenue should educate New Zealand financial institutions on their anticipated obligations under the IGA. Comment As mentioned above, Inland Revenue is currently drafting comprehensive guidance notes on what are seen as the key interpretive issues in the model IGA. Priorities for this guidance have been set in consultation with the industry, so that maximum time is allowed for discussion and finalising the Department’s views on contentious areas. In addition, the Department is also accepting and responding to ad hoc queries from interested parties on specific issues. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Solicitors’ trust accounts Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The status of solicitors’ trust accounts should be clarified by officials or specifically addressed in legislation. Comment Officials consider it would be contrary to the IGA to provide reporting exemptions in domestic legislation that are not provided for in the IGA itself. Such a course of action could see New Zealand breach the terms of the IGA by not providing information it has agreed to provide. However, officials acknowledge that the status of trusts is contentious – largely because ―trusts‖ can range in complexity from simple family trusts through to widely held unit trusts. For this reason, since submissions on this bill closed, the Department has released draft guidance on the IGA status of trusts, including solicitors’ trust accounts. Dialogue on these guidance notes is the most appropriate way of clarifying the status of trust accounts. Recommendation That the submission recommending clarification by officials be noted, acknowledging that draft guidance has since been provided. That the submission recommending the status of solicitor’s trust accounts be addressed in legislation be declined. 133 Issue: Information provided and Privacy Act breaches Clause 158 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) To cater for the possibility that information might have to be provided by account holders (including solicitors), the legislative protection against breaches of the Privacy Act should be extended to allow account holders to provide information when requested. Comment Officials consider that, if an account holder (such as a trustee) is asked to provide information on underlying beneficiaries, it will ideally ensure that it has the power to do so under the relevant trust deed or contract. It is anticipated that account holders will generally be protected by terms and conditions that allow them to comply with all legal information requests from financial institutions. It is important to note that the proposed legislation is designed to ensure that financial institutions have all the tools available to collect and provide information to Inland Revenue in accordance with the IGA. It deliberately does not require account holders to provide the information when requested by financial institutions. This is because FATCA and the IGA are principally obligations on the Government and financial institutions, not the general public. If a person declines to provide relevant information, the default position may be that they are reported on as a suspected US person. The financial institution may also reserve the right in its terms and conditions to close such accounts. However, this is a choice and it is not considered appropriate to legislatively interfere with the relationship between financial institutions and their clients. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax credits Clause 37 Submission (Ernst & Young) It should be confirmed or clarified that New Zealand taxpayers may claim foreign tax credits for the full amount of (the 30%) FATCA withholdings in relation to income that is assessable here. Comment It is Inland Revenue’s view that the 30% withholding penalty will not qualify for foreign tax credits. This is because it is not a foreign income tax – it is a penalty. The Department’s conclusion on this point has been communicated to the financial services industry, including some instances when a credit could become available. 134 From a policy perspective, allowing a credit is not considered to be an appropriate outcome. It would permit a financial institution to effectively use the New Zealand tax base to offset a penalty that came about because that financial institution has failed to comply with the IGA. If a financial institution finds itself in a position where FATCA penalties are being imposed, the economic cost of that should be borne by that institution, not by the Government. This is consistent with how other similar penalties are treated for tax purposes. Officials do not consider it is appropriate to legislate for this outcome because the current legislation already provides for it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 135 MATTER RAISED BY THE COMMITTEE The Committee has asked officials to consider whether there are any internal processes that New Zealand can undertake to allow dual New Zealand/United States citizens to renounce their US citizenship. Officials note that the United States already has systems in place that provide for renunciation of citizenship. Officials consider that the New Zealand Government can only realistically control its own immigration laws, rather than those of another country. Granting New Zealand citizenship (or any other immigration status) to a US citizen does not have an immediate bearing on that person’s US tax obligations. As a result, officials do not consider there is any unilateral action that New Zealand can take to alter a person’s US tax obligations. However, as noted above, officials consider that the DTA between the two countries does provide relief from double taxation in many instances. 136 137 Deregistration of charities 138 139 OVERVIEW Ten submissions were received on the proposed new tax rules for deregistered charities and were largely supportive of the underlying policy intention of the proposals. Submissions made a number of suggestions to improve the overall functioning of the new rules. A major issue in submissions related to the new tax on net accumulated assets of a deregistered charity that retains its net assets 12 months after deregistration. A number of submissions opposed the new tax on the basis that it may result in unintended and inappropriate consequences. This includes, for example, the over-taxation of some deregistered charities, compared with what they would have paid had they always been subject to tax. Even so, we believe the policy underlying the new tax is appropriate. Although some minor technical modifications are being recommended by officials, these will leave the original proposal largely intact. The Committee directed officials to consult with some Māori bodies to discuss the possible effects of the proposed rules for deregistered charities, particularly in the area of treaty settlements. As a result of this consultation, we have recommended amending the proposed requirements of the tax on net assets to exclude treaty settlements from the calculation of the tax. This change is consistent with previous government policy decisions to enable the transfer of settlement assets as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement to be effected without any tax impost. 140 END OF “TAX CHARITY” STATUS AND GRACE-PERIOD FOR COMPLIANT ENTITIES Issue: Compliance with the relevant constitutional documents or other information supplied to the Charities Commission or Board at the time of applying for registration Clause 27 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Sue Barker) The amendments to section CW 41 ensure that deregistered charities will continue to be tax- exempt until the date of ―final decision‖, so long as they have acted in accordance with their constitution or other information supplied to Charities Services at the time of applying for charitable status. This effectively provides a ―grace-period‖ for compliant entities starting from the date of registration with Charities Services to the earlier of two dates: namely, the day the entity is removed from the charities register or the day on which that entity exhausts all disputes and appeals to determine its charitable status. The requirement to act in accordance with ―information supplied ... at the time of applying for charitable status‖ is unclear and not workable. This is because an entity’s constitution may be amended over time, and the requirement to act in accordance with information supplied at the time of applying for registration will become increasingly anachronistic and irrelevant as time passes. We suggest changing this requirement to refer instead to the ―constituting document‖ or the ―entity’s rules as filed on the charities register‖. Comment We support the submissions. The constitution or rules of a registered charity are required to be filed on the charities register and any changes to the constitution or rules of the entity are required to be notified and reviewed by Charities Services. The constitution or rules of the entity as they appear on the charities register are current. Therefore, we believe it is sufficient to refer to the entity’s rules as they appear on the charities register. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 141 Issue: It is unclear why “day of final decision” should be used as an end point for the grace-period Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As noted above, the grace-period effectively allows an entity to remain a tax charity, and to be protected from exposure to tax on a retrospective basis, until any appeals or proceedings ―in relation to ... charitable status‖, are finalised or exhausted. It is unclear why this should be used as an appropriate end date. If such appeals or proceedings are successful, the entity should not be removed from the register at all. It is also noted that that the Courts can make interim and final orders for an entity to be restored to the register from a specified date and to remain on the register (sections 60 and 61 of the Charities Act). If such appeals or proceedings are unsuccessful, there does not seem to be any reason why the effective date of removal specified by the Charities Commission or Board, or effective date of removal as determined by the Court should not stand. Comment The protection afforded by the ―grace-period‖ is based on whether a charity has been compliant with its constitution or rules. This is a significant departure from the current rules, which assess whether a charity is deriving income for charitable purposes. We do not agree that the grace-period should end sooner for entities which do not successfully appeal their deregistrations. This is because these entities would have been acting in compliance with their constitutions or rules, and we feel comfortable that they should continue to be tax- exempt until the point that it is determined whether or not they will continue to be registered. The decision to deregister the entity might have come about as a result of a change in jurisprudential interpretation of whether a specific activity is in fact charitable in purpose. To subject the deregistered entity to tax while it is disputing the decision to deregister would impose unnecessary tax and compliance costs on an entity which has acted in good faith in compliance with a constitution it believed met the requirements for charitable status. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 142 Issue: Grace-period for compliant entities should be retrospective Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The amendments should also apply with retrospective effect given that the amendments are taxpayer-friendly, and entities that have already been deregistered should be given the protection afforded by the amendments. Comment The amendments relating to the grace-period are intended to provide increased certainty that, for tax purposes, entities can rely on the decision made by Charities Services to recognise that entity as charitable in purpose. Other amendments, such as the new tax on accumulated net assets in new section HR 12, impose additional requirements on deregistered charities. Those requirements are intended to maintain the integrity of the tax concessions available to charities and improve overall public confidence in the charitable sector. The grace-period is taxpayer-friendly, and will reduce the number of organisations which could face retrospective tax liabilities if they are deregistered. We understand the desire for certain taxpayer-friendly changes to have retrospective effect, but we note that they are designed as part of a package of changes, some of which would not be appropriate to apply retrospectively. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 143 TRANSITION FROM TAX-EXEMPT STATUS Issue: The application of other income tax exemptions to deregistered charities Clause 107 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Sue Barker) New section HR 11 clarifies how a deregistered charity should establish its initial tax base – such as the opening values of its assets and consideration for its financial arrangements. These tax base calculations are required to be undertaken on and after the date that a deregistered charity ceases to derive exempt income. New section HR 11 does not take into account the possibility that a deregistered charity may be eligible for one of the other income tax exemptions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (for example, the exemption for local and regional promotion bodies, amateur sports promoters or scientific or industrial research entities) which would avoid the need to undertake the tax base calculations in new section HR 11. The wording of new section HR 11 should be clarified to confirm that it will not apply if a deregistered charity is exempt under a provision other than section CW 41 or section CW 42. Comment We accept the submitters’ points that an entity which is removed from the charities register may still be eligible for an income tax exemption under another provision of the Income Tax Act 2007. We did not consider it necessary to set out in legislation that other exemptions would still apply to these entities because it was clear that they would. Even so, given the concerns raised by submitters, this matter should be clarified in the legislation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 144 Issue: Market value should be an option for valuation Clause 107 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Sue Barker) New section HR 11 does not allow a market value option in the valuation of an entity’s assets or financial arrangements. A market value option would be helpful in situations when historical cost information for valuing the entity’s assets or financial arrangements is not available. Comment We accept that some deregistered charities may not have sufficient records on the actual historical cost of their assets and financial arrangements because either they were not required to keep those records, or have low administrative capability which is common in smaller charities. Consequently, it would be difficult for them to establish the tax costs of their property, plant, equipment and trading stock. In this regard, having an alternative means of establishing the cost values would be helpful. However, we have concerns with using market value as an alternative because it could lead to higher depreciation deductions and present a risk to the revenue base. We note that there is a requirement under section 41 of the Charities Act 2005 for registered charities to furnish to the Charities Board an annual return containing financial information about the assets and liabilities of the charity. For charities that do not have historical cost records they will be able to use the cost data provided in their annual returns. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The operation of new section HR 11(5) should be clarified Clause 107 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification would be desirable that any prepayment or deferred employment payment deductions allowed under the proposed section HR 11(5) would still be subject to subsequent balance date add-backs under sections EA 3 and 4, CH 2 and 3 of any amounts then remaining unexpired. Comment We agree that the operation of new section HR 11(5) should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin following enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 145 Issue: Entities should be able to elect to be a Māori authority retrospectively Submission (Te Ohu Kai Moana Trust) If a deregistered charity is eligible under section HF 2 to be a Māori authority, it should be able to elect to be a Māori authority with effect from the date at which the charitable exemption in section CW 41 ceases to apply to it. Comment Under the proposed amendments, a deregistered charity will be taxed in accordance with the general tax rules of the Income Tax Act 2007 from the point at which it ceases to be eligible for the charitable income tax exemption. In the absence of another income tax exemption applying, these entities will be subject to tax based on their legal form or the activities that they carry out. For example, a company will be taxed as a company and subject to tax on its income at the corporate tax rate of 28%, a trust will be taxed as a trust and subject to tax on its trustee income at the rate of 33%, and a Māori authority will be taxed at the rate of 17.5%. An entity which is eligible may choose to become a Māori authority by notifying the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The election then takes effect prospectively. The rules concerning elections to become a Māori authority do not contemplate a retrospective election. If a deregistered charity that is eligible to be a Māori authority is removed from the charities register and has ceased to act in compliance with its constitution or rules, its election to become a Māori authority would only take effect prospectively. This will result in that entity being taxed at a higher rate for its retrospective tax obligations than its prospective tax obligations. We consider that deregistered charities which are eligible to be Māori authorities should be able to make a retrospective election to become a Māori authority. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 146 TREATMENT OF ACCUMULATED ASSETS Issue: New sections CV 17 and HR 12 should not be introduced, pending a thorough review Clauses 19 and 108 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New sections CV 17 and HR 12 set out the requirements of the new tax on net assets. They provide that an entity has an amount of income equal to the greater of zero or the value of its net assets held at the time that is 12 months after the date of deregistration, subject to some adjustments. These adjustments carve out certain assets, which reduce the net assets balance that will be subject to tax. The items carved out are:  any assets distributed to charitable purposes in the 12 months after the entity is deregistered; and  any assets (not including money gifted or left to the entity while it was deriving exempt income. The New Zealand Law Society submits that these amendments should not be made, pending a thorough review of their potential consequences. It considers that the proposed tax treatment of net assets may have unintended and inappropriate consequences. Specific concerns include:  The amendments do not attempt to ―claw back‖ accurately or in a scientific way the benefits of tax-exempt status to the entity in relation to accumulating assets and income.  Some deregistered charities may be prevented from distributing their accumulated assets for charitable purposes post-deregistration. This may arise if the entity’s purposes as set out in its constitution or rules are determined to be non-charitable in purpose.  Although the apparent simplicity of the proposed amendments may seem attractive, the potential application of the amendments to a wide range of deregistered charities needs to be carefully considered. Comment Officials do not support the general thrust of the submission. We believe the policy underlying the new requirements of the tax on net assets is appropriate. Current tax law (legislation and case law) supports the ability of charities to accumulate their income for future use, and no symmetry is required between the income tax exemption and the payments towards charitable purpose, either in amount or timing. Although there is a requirement for deregistered charities which cease to operate to distribute their assets and income to charitable purposes, there is no such requirement when deregistered charities continue to operate. 147 The stated policy is that the assets and income of a charitable entity with tax-exempt status should always be destined for a charitable destination, irrespective of whether the entity ceases to exist or not. However, if a deregistered charity continues in existence, the value of the deregistered charity’s net assets (assets minus liabilities) should be subject to income tax. The imposition of tax in this instance is consistent with the current policy intentions underlying the charities-related tax concessions. In other words, the tax concessions should only be available to bona fide charities and deregistered charities should be held to account for the assets and income they have built up while they enjoyed the benefit of the tax concessions. The proposed adjustments to the net assets balance and the one-year transition period before the tax is imposed is intended to provide encouragement to deregistered charities to distribute their assets for charitable purposes. We consider that the proposed tax on net assets with adjustments and the resulting calculations is a simple, low compliance-cost option but we acknowledge it may result in a tax impost for some deregistered charities that is higher than what they would have paid had they always been subject to tax. We have some sympathy for the specific concern relating to deregistered charities that may not be able to distribute their assets for charitable purposes post-deregistration because they had been found not to have a charitable purpose. To remedy their specific issue we consider that the entity could be permitted to distribute its assets for the purposes set out in its constitution or rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined in general. That new section HR 12 be amended to allow deregistered charities to distribute their assets in accordance with their constitution or rules. Issue: The tax on net assets should be paid a year after the day of final decision, rather than a year after deregistration Clauses 19 and 108 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Sue Barker) The tax liability should be calculated on net assets held by the deregistered charity on the ―day of final decision‖ rather than the day the entity is removed from the Charities Register. The starting date for the calculation of the tax liability of the deregistered charity should be consistent with the date its tax-exempt status ceases under section CW 41. The proposed date of the day the entity is removed from the register does not take into account either the possibility of interim reinstatement to the charities register or the appeals process, which can be lengthy and carry on over a number of years. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Sue Barker) 148 Other provisions base the income tax consequences of deregistration on the date an entity’s income ceases to be exempt under sections CW 41 or 42. Clause 27 proposes to amend section CW 41 so that organisations’ income and ―tax charity‖ status for those purposes would not necessarily end on removal from the Charities Register, but could continue until a later ―day of final decision‖ as to their charitable status. We suggest that section HR 12 should also be based on the date of cessation as described in proposed section HR 11(1) for consistency. (Ernst & Young) Comment Submissions are correct in noting that the time at which the entity should have to pay tax on the net assets it has not distributed for charitable purposes should be one year after the date of final decision, rather than one year after the date of deregistration. It is entirely possible that a disputes process could take more than one year and so the amendments, as currently drafted, could lead to a requirement to distribute the net assets before a final decision is made on whether an entity does in fact have charitable purposes. The definition of ―day of final decision‖ determines this is the later point of two dates, namely the day the entity is removed from the charities register, and the day all appeals are exhausted. Consequently, entities which dispute the deregistration decision will have a longer period before the tax on net assets is required to be paid. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Gifts of money should be excluded from the net assets calculations Clause 108 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Sue Barker) As noted above, new section HR 12 requires deregistered charities to pay tax on the value of their net assets, with adjustments for assets distributed for charitable purposes in a one-year period, and for any assets (other than money) gifted or left to the person while that person was deriving exempt income under sections CW 41 or 42. Submissions considered that:  It is not clear why money is excluded from the net assets calculation. The words ―other than money‖ should be deleted from section HR 12(2)(b). (Sue Barker)  Gifts of money, or at least certain gifts of money, should be excluded from the calculation, as tax incentives will not necessarily have been claimed by donors in relation to such gifts, and there are other items that should also be excluded from the calculation – for example, possibly capital gain amounts or assets acquired before becoming tax-exempt. (New Zealand Law Society) 149  Instinctively, amounts gifted to an organisation in any form should be excluded on the basis they represent some form of capital contribution rather than any trading or business income. Given the fungibility of money, the proposed exclusion for gifts of money is likely to be impossible to measure in practice since organisations may have cash on hand from various sources, such as gifts, trading or other income and sale of capital assets (which themselves may have been acquired using funding from a mix of sources). (Ernst & Young)  The exclusion of gifted money from the proposed adjustment introduces an arbitrary distinction between donations made in kind and monetary donations. Such a distinction would drive behaviour that is not beneficial to either the charitable sector or the public. The proposal to include as ―income‖ money gifted or left to the deregistered charity when the deregistered charity was deriving exempt income is contradicted by the Commentary to the bill. The Commentary states that for reasons of fairness an adjustment should be permitted for any donated assets as these assets were not funded by non-taxed income or through a tax-preferred source. Money that is gifted to a deregistered charity also meets these criteria: monetary donations are not ―income‖ of the deregistered charity; and in most cases a donor’s monetary donation is from post-tax income. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials note that new section HR 12 is intended to encourage deregistered charities to distribute their accumulated assets and income to charitable purposes within a reasonable time after they are deregistered. One submission states that for a charity there is no fundamental difference from a tax perspective between a gift of a non-cash asset or of money. As noted in the Commentary on the bill, the distinction between cash and non-cash assets relates to the tax preference generally afforded to donors in relation to cash gifts. Officials acknowledge that this tax could be viewed as severe. However, we believe it supports the Government’s policy position that money a deregistered charity acquired when it had an exemption from income tax should always be destined for a charitable purpose. This policy position is intended to maintain the integrity of charitable giving tax incentives, as donors can have some confidence that that charitable donations are more likely to remain in the charitable sector. The policy position is also consistent with the requirement on charitable organisations to distribute all their assets to charitable purposes on winding up. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 150 Issue: The tax on net assets should not apply to entities which have retrospective income tax liabilities Clause 108 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The new tax on net assets should not apply to a deregistered entity that is exposed to tax on a retrospective basis, at least when the benefits of tax-exempt status are clawed back in that way. Comment The tax on net assets is intended to protect the integrity of the revenue base by ensuring the tax concessions that apply to charities are well-targeted and policy intentions are met. This includes, for example, ensuring that if an entity has claimed tax exemptions as a charity and has accumulated assets and income, these assets and income should always be destined for a charitable purpose. The submission is opposed to applying the tax on net assets in situations when the deregistered charity had been non-compliant with its constitution or rules and has had to reconstruct its tax position retrospectively. In this situation, applying new section HR 12 could be viewed as penal, but it is intended to encourage the entity to distribute the assets for charitable purposes. Excluding deregistered charities that have been non-compliant from the tax on net assets would mean that the tax would only apply to entities which have complied with their constitutions or rules. This policy outcome would be unfair. We also note that the benefits of the tax exemption are not fully clawed back, as the entity has had use of the money over the period of the tax exemption, and has enjoyed the compounding benefits of this. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Split application date should be reconsidered Clause 108 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The rationale for the proposed split application date for section HR 12 should be reviewed, as it would be preferable for there to be a single application date. In light of the potential significance of the proposed amendments, the deferred April 2015 application would seem preferable, and this would not necessarily result in a rush of voluntary deregistrations bearing in mind the other tax consequences of deregistration and the fact that voluntary deregistrations would presumably be tracked during the period. 151 Comment Officials do not support an application date of 1 April 2015 for new section HR 12 for entities which choose to voluntarily deregister. The split application date is intended to prevent entities choosing to ―opt out‖ of the new tax on net assets by simply voluntarily deregistering from the charities register. This new tax on net assets is a response to the current ability of charitable entities to accumulate assets and income while tax-exempt, and the lack of any requirement to distribute these assets for charitable purposes once the entity deregisters if it continues to operate. We accept the submitter’s point that there would not necessarily be a rush of voluntary deregistrations but believe a delayed application date could lead to some entities with substantial asset bases deregistering to avoid the new tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section HR 12 should be limited to tax which would have been payable had the entity never been charitable Clause 108 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society, Te Ohu Kai Moana Trust) We appreciate that it may be difficult to provide an appropriate basis for bringing any income accumulated during a tax-exempt period into account without some element of arbitrariness. It is not clear, however, that amounts received by an organisation would necessarily have been taxable income even if the body had never been registered as a charity. Amounts received from members might have been excluded under the mutuality concept or the organisation might have been eligible for some other income tax exemption. Any income tax arising under new section HR 12 should be limited to the tax which would otherwise have been payable had the entity never been charitable (assuming the organisation has sufficient records to support such calculation). (Ernst & Young) Taxpayers should have an option to refine the calculation of ―net assets‖ under section HR 12(2) to remove items that would not have been taxable to them (or resulted in tax to pay) if they were not applying the charitable income tax exemptions. As currently drafted, this provision will operate to tax a deregistered charity on assets they continue to hold 12 months after deregistration even when the assets would not have been taxable to them if they had not been applying the charitable exemption in sections CW 41 or 42. Of particular relevance to organisations that Te Ohu Kai Moana represents are assets distributed to iwi organisations pursuant to a Treaty of Waitangi fisheries settlement. Receipt of these assets does not give rise to taxable income based on the application of general principles (that is, it is a capital receipt) irrespective of whether the recipient has charitable status. There are other settlements of a similar nature – for example, the forestry settlement (dealt with under the Central North Island Forests Iwi Collective Settlement Act 2008). 152 This issue is not limited to assets received pursuant to Treaty of Waitangi settlements. It is equally applicable to any other categories of income derived by the deregistered charity that would not otherwise have given rise to taxable income had it been derived by a taxpaying entity. For example, capital gains and unrealised revaluation gains on assets. Taxpayers should be provided with an option to refine the calculation of ―net assets‖ by removing certain items if they have sufficient information to do so. By making the refinement of the calculation optional, the proposed amendment will not impose a compliance cost on deregistered charities that choose to apply the simple definition of ―net assets‖ (as currently defined). However, it also allows a more neutral (and equitable) outcome to be reached for taxpayers who choose to undertake a more detailed calculation of ―net assets‖. (Te Ohu Kai Moana Trust) The provisions relating to the calculation of the amount of income to be recognised in section HR 12(2) and (3) need to be carefully reviewed and should be more closely aligned with the concept of clawing back the benefits of tax-exempt status. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment We acknowledge submitters’ points that if a deregistered charity chooses to retain its accumulated assets after deregistration, the tax imposed on those assets under new section HR 12 will not result in the same outcome as if the entity had never received the charitable exemption. This result is intentional. Submitters are correct in noting that the formula could result in tax being applied to amounts that would not have been taxable if the entity had been subject to income tax when it received or derived those amounts. We note that the calculation in proposed section HR 12 is intended to encourage the entity to choose to distribute those assets for charitable purposes, rather than to retain them. As noted in the Commentary to this bill, the Government believes that the assets of an entity with tax- exempt status should always be destined for a charitable purpose, irrespective of whether the entity ceases to exist or not. We therefore do not support giving taxpayers an option to apply a refined version of the net assets formula. We are recommending, however, that assets received pursuant to Treaty of Waitangi settlements should be excluded from the requirements of new section HR 12. This change recognises previous government policy decisions to enable the transfer of settlement assets as part of a Treaty of Waitangi settlement to be effected without tax impost. Recommendation That the submissions generally be declined. That the submission on assets received pursuant to a Treaty of Waitangi settlement be accepted. 153 Issue: Clarifying the meaning of “liabilities” Clause 108 Submission (Matter raised by officials) New section HR 12 should be clarified to explain what is meant by ―liabilities‖. Comment This clarification can be set out in the Tax Information Bulletin. An example of a liability would be the amount of tax which an entity would be liable to pay in relation to past years if it ceased to comply with its constitution or rules at some point before deregistration. Similarly, an entity might have incurred legal costs in disputing the decision to deregister it but not yet paid those amounts. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: New section HR 12 should not apply to entities which are re-registered before the 12-month period ends Clause 108 Submission (Matter raised by officials) New section HR 12 should be clarified to explain that when an entity is reregistered before the end date after which new section HR 12 takes effect, the entity should not be required to distribute its net assets or pay tax on those assets. Comment New section HR 12 should not apply to entities which are still eligible for an income tax exemption, whether by virtue of another exemption or because they have been reregistered as a charity. As discussed in item ―Issue: The application of other income tax exemptions to deregistered charities‖, we have recommended that new section HR 12 be amended to clarify that if an exemption applies to an entity, the requirements in section HR 12 will not also apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 EFFECT OF DEREGISTRATION ON FRINGE BENEFIT TAX AND DONEE ORGANISATION STATUS Issue: Consequences for donors should be dealt with at an administrative, rather than legislative level Clauses 110 Submission (Sue Barker) Loss of registered charitable status does not necessarily mean loss of donee status. The consequences for donors of donations made to a charity that is subsequently deregistered would be better dealt with at an administrative, rather than legislative level. Comment Officials disagree with the submission. The proposed amendment is intended to ensure that donors have a greater level of certainty that their donations tax relief will not ordinarily be reversed in circumstances when they have made a bona fide monetary gift and the entity they have donated to is later deregistered. We do not consider that the proposed intention can be achieved by continuing to deal with this matter at an administrative level. If an entity is removed from the charities register, and before deregistration it ceased to comply with the requirements to be a donee organisation, then the donations relief claimed for donations made in the period after the date of non-compliance can be reversed by Inland Revenue. In practice, this requires Inland Revenue to approach each donor for evidence of the amount and circumstances of their gift, which can be onerous. We did not consider that this outcome was satisfactory for donors, and believed that it might discourage charitable giving if people were concerned that any donations tax relief could later be reversed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 155 Issue: Extending donee status to all registered charities Clause 110 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, Sue Barker) The proposed amendment to section LD 3 will allow registered charities to have donee status even if they carry out their charitable purposes wholly or mainly overseas. It will therefore allow donations to overseas-focussed charities to be eligible for donations tax credits. This will render schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and the careful vetting process by which overseas charities are able to become listed on schedule 32, largely redundant. It is not clear if this result is intended. Comment The submissions are correct in noting that this drafting has resulted in an unintended change. Officials did not intend to extend the scope of the donations tax credit regime to all entities registered on the charities register. As the submitters note, the current drafting would make all entities that are registered on the charities register ―donee organisations‖, and therefore make all donations of $5 or more eligible for donations tax relief. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That new section LD 3(1)(ab) in clause 110 be redrafted to ensure that it achieves its policy intention. Issue: No protection for donors in relation to gifts to approved donee organisations on Inland Revenue’s website Clause 110 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The protection afforded by new section LD 3(1)(ab) should be extended to donors who have made donations to entities included on the list of approved donee organisations, which is maintained on Inland Revenue’s website. Comment The submission raises a valid point but further work is required before a decision can be made to extend the protection for donors in this situation. This work can be carried out as part of the current tax review of donee organisations, which is on the Government’s tax policy work programme. 156 Recommendation That the submission be noted. That the submission be considered further as part of the current tax review of donee organisations. 157 DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Use of the terms “ceased charities” and “date of cessation” Clauses 19, 27, 104 and 107 Submission (Sue Barker, New Zealand Law Society, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The word ―ceased‖ should not be used in the headings of new section CV 17 and new section CW 41(6), as the charity may not have ceased. Similarly, this term should not be used in new section HC 31(1B). In addition, section HR 11 should be amended to refer to ―the date of the change in circumstances‖ rather than ―the date of cessation‖. Comment The use of the term ―ceased charity‖ was intended to denote that the entity’s ―tax charity‖ status had ceased, rather than the charity itself. Officials accept that this phrase could be confusing and that a different phrase would be more appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of the term “person” Clauses 19, 27, 107, 108 and 123 Submission (Sue Barker) The provisions relating to deregistered charities should use the term ―entity‖, as that term is defined in the Charities Act 2005, rather than ―person‖. Comment Officials consider that the term ―person‖ is more appropriate than ―entity‖. The term ―person‖ as used in the Income Tax Act 2007 encompasses a wider range of entity types than ―entity‖ as defined in the Charities Act does. For example, an unincorporated body of people is a person, but would not necessarily be an entity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 158 Issue: Use of the term “Charities Commissioner” Clause 27 Submission (Sue Barker) There is a typographical error in proposed section CW 41(1)(aa)(i), it should say ―Charities Commission‖, rather than ―Charities Commissioner‖. Comment Officials agree that this is an error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of undefined terms Clause 27 Submission (Sue Barker) The term ―Board‖ is not defined. A definition should be added to section YA 1. Alternatively, a generic term, such as ―charities regulator‖ should be used instead, and defined in section YA 1, as this could cover the Department of Internal Affairs as well as the Charities Registration Board. Comment We accept this submission. Statutory bodies, such as the Charities Commission, do not need to be defined in the Income Tax Act. The submission correctly noted that the Board is not defined in statute. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 159 Issue: Eligibility to derive exempt income in section HR 12 Clause 108 Submission (Sue Barker) New section HR 12(2)(b) excludes assets which were gifted or left to the person while the person was deriving exempt income under sections CW 41 or CW 42. The adjustment should not turn on whether the entity was actually deriving exempt income under these sections, but rather on whether it was eligible to do so. Comment Officials accept this submission. In a small number of cases a deregistered charity may not have been actually deriving income, and so the use of an eligibility concept is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify what “distribution” means Clause 108 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society) New section HR 12 requires net assets to be ―distributed for charitable purposes‖. It should be confirmed that assets may be regarded as ―distributed‖ for the purpose of section HR 12 if their legal or registered ownership has not changed but there has been a change in the capacity and purpose for which they are held. For example, if a deregistered charity has resolved that particular assets be held on trust for another organisation with appropriate charitable purposes. (Ernst & Young) To provide flexibility it would seem appropriate to refer to assets ―distributed or applied‖ for charitable purposes within the relevant 12-month period and possibly also to clarify that this would include the entity settling, or declaring that it holds, assets on trust for charitable purposes within the 12-month period. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment We consider the term ―distribution‖ is likely to be wide enough to encompass assets whose equitable ownership has changed. Even so, and for the avoidance of doubt, this matter can be made clearer in new section HR 12. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 160 Issue: Clarify whether gifts are to be disregarded in section HR 12 regardless of their current form Clause 108 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is required to determine that amounts must be disregarded in relation to gifts of money. It is not clear whether new section HR 12(2)(b) is intended to ignore gifts of money (regardless of the form in which they may now be represented and held) or the amounts of gifts which are now represented and held as money, even though the original gifts may have been of other types of assets or investment. Comment Officials consider this matter should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin, not in the legislation. The requirements in new section HR 12 are based on assets held at a relevant date. If an asset, other than money, was gifted to an entity but has since been disposed of and is now represented in money, that money is not ignored under proposed section HR 12(2)(b) as it is not in itself an asset other than money. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarify the definition of “net assets” Clause 108 Submission (KPMG) The definition of ―net assets‖ in new section HR 12 should be clarified to make it clear that if an asset is disposed of for an amount less than market value, at the entity’s ―end date‖, it is the amount of the net proceeds from disposal which is treated as income. Comment Officials consider this matter should be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin, not in the legislation. The requirements in new section HR 12 are based on assets held at a relevant date. If an asset has been disposed of before that date for less than market value, then it is the amount of disposal proceeds which section HR 12 will take into account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 Issue: Suggested alternate approach to the amendments to section CW 41 Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting of proposed section CW 41 is complicated and confusing, attempting to achieve its effect by way of amendments to section CW 41(1) and (5), plus the addition of new subsection CW 41(6), and a confusing provision relating to the application of the amendments (clause 27(5)). The intent of the proposed amendments is to clarify the point in time when a deregistered entity is a tax charity and to ensure that an entity is not exposed to tax on a retrospective basis when the entity has effectively relied upon registration under the Charities Act 2005 in taking the position that it was tax-exempt. A simpler way to achieve the policy intention would be to amend section CW 41 by:  amending the definition of ―tax charity‖ to clarify the start and end dates for this status; and  adding a new subsection (which could be new subsection (1A), (2A) or (6)), that clearly states the intended effect (that is, tax charity status until the day of final decision, provided that the entity has complied with its constitution). Comment Officials believe the drafting of new section CW 41 meets the intended policy outcome but it could be simplified to improve taxpayer certainty. The issue of retrospectivity, requiring the validation of past mistakes, coupled with the requirement of fairness on a go-forward basis and the current pre-existing structural complexity of section CW 41, all contribute to the difficulty of the drafting. The New Zealand Law Society’s suggestions, which are also complex, demonstrate the inherent drafting difficulties. Nevertheless, we believe the current drafting of section CW 41, enhanced by some minor clarifications suggested by the Law Society and other submitters, is ―fit for purpose‖. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That new section CW 41 be simplified to improve taxpayer certainty. 162 Issue: Clarify that non-compliance with the entity’s constitution or rules does not necessarily mean it does not meet the requirements in new section CW 41(1) Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It may be appropriate to state explicitly that a tax charity’s non-compliance with its rules does not necessarily mean that it does not meet the requirements set out in new section CW 41(1). Comment The proposed amendments apply to entities which are removed from the charities register. If an entity’s non-compliance with its constitution or rules does not lead to it being removed from the register, these rules will not apply to that entity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting should recognise that the effective date of registration could be before the day an entity is registered Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The drafting should recognise that under the Charities Act 2005 the effective date of registration may be either the time at which an entity actually becomes registered as a charitable entity or an earlier ―effective registration time‖ (Section 20 of the Charities Act 2005 refers). Comment Section 20 of the Charities Act 2005 sets out that: ―The Board may, if it thinks fit, direct the chief executive to register a notice in the register of charitable entities that specifies that an entity must be treated as having become registered as a charitable entity at a time (the effective registration time) that is before the time at which the entity actually became registered as a charitable entity. If the Board exercises its powers under subsection (1) in relation to an entity, the entity must be treated as having become registered as a charitable entity at the effective registration time for the purposes of this Act, the Income Tax Act 2007, and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968‖. 163 Officials believe therefore that the proposed wording in clause 27 is adequate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of the term “day of final decision” Clause 123(8) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) It would be simpler if the term ―day of deregistration‖ or ―day of effective deregistration‖ were used instead of ―day of final decision‖. The reference in paragraph (a) of the definition of ―day of final decision‖ to the day the entity ―is removed from the register of charitable entities‖ is intended to refer to the effective date of removal specified by the Charities Commission or Board under section 31 of the Charities Act 2005, rather than the date the notice of removal is registered in the register under that section. This seems appropriate, provided that the effective date of deregistration cannot be set retrospectively. If the effective date of deregistration could be set retrospectively, then it may be appropriate to refer to the date the notice of removal is registered in the register under section 31 of the Charities Act 2005. Comment Officials intended this date to denote the effective date of deregistration, not the day on which the decision to remove the entity was actually noted in the register. As above, when referring to the effective date of registration, we believe that the current wording adequately achieves the policy intention. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The drafting of section HC 31 should mirror that of section HR 11(1) Clause 104 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendment to section HC 31 should mirror the drafting used in new section HR 11(1) in relation to the circumstances in which section HR 11 will apply – for example, instead of referring to a charitable trust ―losing its charitable status‖, new section HC 31(1B) should refer to a charitable trust ―ceasing to meet the requirements to derive exempt income under sections CW 41 or CW 42‖, or similar, or simply include a cross-reference to section HR 11. 164 Comment The submitter raises a good point that the wording of new section HC 31(1B) should match that of new section HR 11 to ensure consistency between the two provisions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section CV 17 need not deal with the timing of derivation of the relevant income Clause 19 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) New section CV 17 need not deal with the timing of derivation of the relevant income because this is dealt with in new section HR 12. Comment Officials see no harm in including this reference in both sections, as they will provide certainty for taxpayers about when this amount will be income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Proposed amendments in clauses 110 and 123(6) are potentially misleading Clauses 110 and 123(6) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendments in clauses 110 and 123(6) of the bill, which imply that there is a direct link between registration and deregistration under the Charities Act 2005 and the tax concessions relating to donee organisations and fringe benefit tax, are potentially misleading and inappropriate, and this may provide sufficient grounds for deleting both amendments, in their current form. 165 Comment Officials do not believe these provisions imply a direct link between an entity being deregistered and an entity ceasing to meet the requirements to be a donee organisation or a charitable organisation for FBT purposes. We acknowledge that a deregistered charity might still apply its funds wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purposes within New Zealand and therefore qualify for these tax concessions. The reason for including these amendments was to provide protection for entities and their donors when the entity is found to have ceased to meet the requirements at some time, but had nonetheless acted in compliance with their constitution or rules until deregistration. This is effectively a ―grace-period‖, similar to the one contained in proposed new section CW 41. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting of donee organisation status Clause 110(1) Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society,) The rationale of the proposed amendment to section LD 3(2) is to provide donors with a greater level of certainty that their donations tax relief will not ordinarily be reversed in circumstances when they have made a bona fide monetary gift and the entity they have donated to is later deregistered. In our view the current drafting of new section LD 3(2)(ab) does not reflect this. A simpler approach to achieve the policy intent of the proposed amendment would be to provide specific protection for donors in relation to taking the position that an entity to which they have donated is a donee organisation. In this context, an entity’s registration under the Charities Act 2005 or listing on Inland Revenue’s donee organisation list could be specified as a sufficient or relevant grounds for concluding that an entity is a donee organisation. Comment Officials accept that the current drafting may not fully achieve the policy intention. This is explained in the item ―Extending donee status to all registered charities‖. The amendment is intended to apply to registered charities who meet the current requirements of a donee organisation. There are a number of ways to achieve this result. New section LD 3(2)(ab) should refer to a registered charity whose funds are applied wholly or mainly to purposes (as set out in its rules) within New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That new section LD 3(2)(ab) be redrafted to better achieve its policy intention. 166 Issue: Extension of FBT status Clause 123(6) Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed amendment to the definition of ―charitable organisation‖ in section YA 1, by adding a new paragraph (ab) that refers to deregistered charities, is intended to be taxpayer- friendly, by protecting organisations that have relied upon registration under the Charities Act 2005 in taking the position that the limited exemption from FBT for charitable organisations can be utilised. The general intent of the proposed amendment is supported but the way in which the amendment seeks to achieve that intent is confusing and needs to be revisited. A simpler approach to achieve the general intent of the proposed amendment would be to provide specific protection, under either the Income Tax Act 2007 or the Tax Administration Act 1994, for an entity that has taken the position, on reasonable grounds, that it is a ―charitable organisation‖ and in this context provide that an entity’s registration under the Charities Act 2005 or listing on Inland Revenue’s donee organisation list is a sufficient ground for taking such a position. Comment Officials accept that the current drafting may not fully achieve the policy intention. This matter is discussed in the previous item ―Drafting of donee organisation status‖. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That new section LD 3(2)(ab) be redrafted to better reflect its policy intention. Issue: Drafting of section HR 12 Clause 108 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The exclusion of gifted assets, and potentially other items, should be dealt with as part of the ―net assets‖ calculation, and the amount of income to be recognised under section HR 12 would then be the net assets value less the value of assets distributed for charitable purposes in the relevant 12-month period. Comment Officials believe the current drafting achieves the intended policy. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 167 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Administrative guidance on meaning of “benevolent”, “philanthropic”, “cultural” and “charitable” should be provided Submission (Sue Barker) We understand that Inland Revenue is currently working on guidelines on the various limbs of section LD 3 – that is, what constitutes ―benevolent‖, ―philanthropic‖, ―cultural‖ or ―charitable‖ purposes for the purposes of section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. These guidelines could be usefully expedited. Comment Officials understand that this work is expected to be completed mid-year. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: “Declined” charities Submission (Sue Barker) The tax consequences for charities that have been declined registration, as opposed to deregistered, can be just as complicated, and should also be addressed as part of these reforms. Comment The submitter raises a valid point. However, further work is required to investigate the policy implications of extending the proposed reforms to declined registrations. This work should be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That officials consider whether declined registrations should have the same treatment as deregistered charities as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. 168 Issue: Amendments should be made to the Charities Act 2005 Submission (Sue Barker) The approach being taken to the definition of ―charitable purpose‖, and the Charities Act 2005 generally, by the charities regulator is too narrow, even ―anti-charity‖, and needs to be amended. The narrow approach of the charities regulator is incorrect as a matter of law, and will ultimately be found to be so. The approach is also contrary to the original rationale for the establishment of the Charities Act in the first place, which was to monitor ―bad‖ charities, not to deregister so many ―good‖ charities on the basis of fine, black-letter, and by no means universally accepted legal distinctions. Given this, and if the promised review of the Charities Act is not to take place, the most helpful amendment that could be made would be to the process by which decisions of the charities regulator can be appealed. Comment Officials note that any changes to the Charities Act 2005 would be outside the scope of this bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The rules should also apply to charities which are required to obtain approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Clauses 27 and 28 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) There does not appear to be any reason why the new rules for deregistered charities should apply to entities that register under the Charities Act 2005 to become tax charities but not apply to entities that are required to obtain approval from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Both types of tax charity ought to be covered by these proposals. Comment Officials do not support the submission. The amendments apply to charities that have been deregistered or removed from the charities register. They do not apply to periods before 1 July 2008, the date on which the charities income tax exemptions in sections CW 41 and 42 were linked to registration with Charities Services. As a result, the grace-period for compliant deregistered charities, during which an entity is not exposed to tax on a retrospective basis where the entity has effectively relied upon the decision of Charities Services that it is charitable, cannot apply to periods before 1 July 2008. 169 Before 1 July 2008, whether an entity was a charity or not, and therefore eligible for the charities-related income exemption, was a question of fact and there was no requirement for Inland Revenue to register or approve a charity. However, a practice had developed whereby entities would specifically seek Inland Revenue’s confirmation that the entity met the requirements of the charities-related income tax exemption and Inland Revenue would in such cases issue a letter of confirmation. We do not consider the grace-period afforded to compliant deregistered charities should apply to periods before 1 July 2008 for the following reasons:  There was no registration system for charities – the proposed rules deal solely with the tax consequences for charities deregistered by Charities Services.  The legislation before 1 July 2008 provided for charities to self-assess their eligibility for the charities-related tax exemptions. Notwithstanding the Inland Revenue practice of confirming charitable status, we cannot be assured that charities have complied with their rules in periods before 1 July 2008 as there was no formal registration or monitoring of charities.  It would be very difficult to legislate for an administrative routine (the practice whereby Inland Revenue confirmed eligibility for the charitable tax exemption that existed before 1 July 2008), and to validate that routine with appropriate adjustments to take into account the current policy changes, at the same time.  Inland Revenue should not be fettered in its ability to reassess non-compliant deregistered charities in periods before 1 July 2008. It is likely, however, that any such reassessment would occur only in the most egregious of cases, such as when fraud or tax avoidance, or serious mismanagement has been identified. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: An exemption from income tax should be given where an entity has a short break in registration Clause 27 Submission (New Zealand Law Society, KPMG) New section CW 41 does not cover the position of an entity whose ―tax charity‖ status, and therefore tax-exempt status, is affected by a short period of non-registration under the Charities Act 2005, even though the entity’s assets and income may be held, or distributed exclusively for charitable purposes at all times. For example, it is not uncommon for entities to seek re- registration under the Charities Act 2005, rather than bearing the cost of disputing the Charities Commission or Board’s decision to deregister an entity, but unless the effective date of re- registration precedes or matches the effective date of deregistration (for example, by way of backdating under section 31 of the Charities Act 2005), there will be a period of non-registration during which the entity is not a tax charity as defined in section CW 41, even under the amended definition of that term. 170 Consideration should be given to amending section CW 41 to provide for continuity of tax- exempt status in certain circumstances where an entity that is a tax charity is deregistered but then re-registers (for example, applies for and obtains a new registration) under the Charities Act. Comment Officials acknowledge that entities which undergo a short period of non-registration face a ―broken period‖ for tax purposes, where they are subject to income tax for the period of non- registration. Under current tax law, the deregistered charity is required to file tax returns for any periods of non-registration. We accept the submitters’ points that it would reduce compliance if entities which are eventually reregistered were provided with continuity of tax-exempt status in the interim period. The problems that officials encounter with this suggestion are how to provide such continuity, and whether doing so would undermine the charities registration regime. With the benefit of hindsight, it may be apparent that an entity has a period of non-registration. At the time the entity is deregistered though, there is no way of determining whether that entity will later be reregistered. The proposed rules extend the tax charity status of entities which are compliant with their constitutions to the ―day of final decision‖. This means that if an entity is deregistered and disputes the deregistration decision it will not face a taxable period before re- registration. Officials are also confident that the number of entities which encounter periods of non- registration should significantly decrease as a result of new administrative practices implemented by the Department of Internal Affairs. The most common reason for deregistration since the charities register opened has been the failure to file an annual return. Until recently, Charities Services automatically deregistered charities if they had failed to file one annual return. Under a new approach, registered charities will be given more opportunity to file their annual returns. Officials note giving the Department of Internal Affairs the power to backdate an entity’s re- registration could further reduce the number of entities which have to file tax returns during periods of non-registration. This would, of course, only alleviate the need to file a tax return if the entity applied for reregistration before its tax return was due. However, changes to the Charities Act 2005 are outside the scope of this bill. Officials do not believe the tax consequences for entities facing short broken periods (but which do not form a material breach of tax-exempt status requirements) will be significant. However, officials from the Department of Internal Affairs are investigating options for giving Charities Services the power to backdate an entity’s registration as a charity in appropriate cases. The issues raised in submissions were also covered in Inland Revenue’s regulatory impact statement New tax rules for deregistered charities. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 171 Issue: New section HR 11 should be broadened to apply to other entities that cease to be eligible for a tax exemption Clause 107 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The provisions in new section HR 11 could be broadened to apply not only to deregistered charities but also to other entities that are eligible for a general exemption from income tax and then become ineligible because they no longer meet the requirements of that exemption. Comment The Income Tax Act 2007 does not provide guidance about what rules apply when an existing entity that is neither a trust nor a deregistered charity enters the tax base. The submission raises a valid concern that could be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That the submission be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. Issue: Guidance should be given on how to establish the cost of prepayments Clause 104 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to section HC 31 should be expanded to include guidance to trustees, or other persons liable for the satisfaction of the income tax liability of the trustee, on how to establish the cost of prepayments. Including calculation rules for prepayments in section HC 31 will give greater certainty and coherency. Comment The submission raises a valid point that should be considered further. We suggest that this matter should be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. Recommendation That the submission be noted. That the submission be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. 172 Issue: Mistakenly applying funds for a non-charitable purpose Clause 27 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) As drafted, the grace-period for charitable status in new section CW 41 can end when the entity fails to act in accordance with its constitution. As a practical matter, charitable entities can apply funding to a large number of projects and causes and there is scope for an individual outlay to, strictly speaking, not be for a charitable purpose. We submit that consideration should be given to narrowing the scope under which an entity can fail to meet the definition of ―tax charity‖ under the amendment. For example, the previously released issues paper on this topic referred to a failure arising because the entity wilfully failed to comply with its constitutional documents. Comment The proposed rules for deregistered charities are triggered by deregistration. Therefore, the matter raised in the submission is directly related to the Charities Services deregistration process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consideration should be given to enacting more tax exemptions Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Entities which are deregistered may continue to apply money they receive in a manner which is beneficial to the community or public. If the entity does not operate a ―business‖, arguably its revenue is not income under ordinary concepts. Difficulties can arise when determining to what extent expenses including grants and donations are deductible against that income. In some cases, entities can act as ―conduits‖, receiving funding or donations and distributing these amounts to other charitable entities. We are concerned that, in this situation, an amount of ―income‖ could arise without a corresponding tax deduction. Comment The submission raises an interesting issue that should be considered further. This matter should be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. 173 Recommendation That the submission be declined. That the submission be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. Issue: Exemption for amateur sport promoters Submission (Dr Michael Gousmett) The bill should be amended to require the commercial activities of amateur sport promoters to be liable to income tax at a rate to be determined by the Committee. Comment Currently section CW 46 of the Income Tax Act 2007 exempts the income derived by a ―club, society or association‖ established mainly to promote an amateur game or sport. The submission seems to be concerned that the exemption now applies to entities with large commercial operations and so the original intention of the exemption may no longer be valid. Although the submission raises a valid issue more time is needed to consider this matter. We recommend that this matter be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. Recommendation That the submission be declined. That the submission be considered in the context of the Government’s tax policy work programme when it is next set. 174 175 Tax status of certain community housing entities 176 177 OVERVIEW Ten submissions were received on the amendments relating to community housing entities and most of them supported the underlying policy intention of the amendments. However, the majority of these submitters (mainly from the community housing sector) were strongly opposed to the eligibility criteria and recommended significant changes. The sector’s opposition centres on the proposed income and assets tests that would be applied to the intended recipient class. The sector believes that the proposed tax exemption is unlikely to apply to community housing entities that they believe are most in need of it. This is because their current housing clients are unlikely to meet the proposed criteria for the intended recipient class. For example, Habitat for Humanity considers that the income and asset levels of some of its current housing clients would mean that it would not be eligible for the proposed tax exemption, should it no longer be eligible to be a registered charity. Officials support the use of an income threshold to help determine the intended recipient class as it will ensure that the proposed exemption is effectively targeted. Furthermore, an income threshold is objective and can easily be applied in a self-assessment environment. Finally, we acknowledge that the way in which the regulation-making provision in new section 225D is drafted means Ministers can dispense with any one of the factors in determining the intended recipient class. Therefore, there is some flexibility for the responsible Ministers to make recommendations on the overall scope of the recipient class and to target the exemption accordingly. 178 SUPPORT FOR THE POLICY INTENT UNDERLYING THE COMMUNITY HOUSING ENTITY PROPOSALS Clauses 28, 29, 110, 123 and 159 Submissions (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Ernst & Young, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust, Sue Barker) The submissions support the policy intent of the amendments to confer a new income tax exemption for certain community housing entities and donee organisation status on these entities so that tax incentives can be claimed for donations to such entities. However, the majority of these submitters (mainly from the community housing sector) were strongly opposed to the eligibility criteria and recommended significant changes. The sector’s opposition centres on the proposed income and assets tests that would be applied to the intended recipient class. (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust, Sue Barker) Broadly the amendments will increase certainty in the tax system and align tax policy with the Government’s housing policy. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The amendments are intended to address the current tax uncertainties relating to community housing entities who provide affordable home-ownership products to low-income households. These tax uncertainties arise because the charitable status for some of these entities is uncertain. Therefore, the amendments would be relevant only for those entities that lose their charitable status. Specific concerns with the eligibility criteria are dealt with in the next items. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 179 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Issue: Recipient class defined by reference to an income threshold Clause 29 Submissions (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Habitat for Humanity, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) The submissions are opposed to the income threshold being applied to determine the intended recipient class on the basis that they are too restrictive. They consider that the application of the current income threshold will exclude community housing entities that they believe are most in need of it. For example, Habitat for Humanity considers that the income threshold of some of its current clients would mean that they would exceed the income threshold based on the lower quartile of household income and therefore they would not be eligible for the proposed tax exemption. The preferred approach put forward by these submissions is to apply tests on the community housing entity that would ensure its income, assets and profits are deployed solely towards the objects of its housing mission, and delivered through a non-profit structure. To enable pathways to independent living, this approach cannot require any further tests of income or assets of the class of recipient household for the purposes of confirming the tax-exempt status of the community housing entity. If the proposed income threshold were retained, the tests should not be set by reference to the lower quartile of household income but rather 120 percent of the median household income, adjusted annually for inflation and set for each district or City Council jurisdiction throughout New Zealand. A further related submission is concerned that community housing entities may lose their tax- exempt status if the assessment of the household income level must be observed even after the client has been initially considered eligible to receive housing assistance. Comment New section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 permits the Governor-General to make regulations specifying people, or classes of people, who may be recipients of housing products or services offered by community housing entities. The factors which may be used to determine a recipient may be any combination of the following:  the person’s geographic location in New Zealand;  the composition of the household a person lives in;  the income of the person or household relative to a maximum set by taking into account the lower quartile of household income based on household economic survey data published by Statistics New Zealand, and adjusted by an appropriate economic factor (for example, cost of living); or  the person’s assets relative to a maximum. 180 The Minister for Housing and the Minister of Revenue are jointly responsible for making recommendations on these factors. Officials support the use of an income threshold to help determine the intended recipient class as it will ensure that the proposed exemption is effectively targeted. Furthermore, an income threshold is objective and can easily be applied in a self-assessment environment. We also acknowledge that an income threshold set by taking into account the lower quartile of household income may mean that some current community housing entities will not qualify for the proposed exemption. The way in which the regulation-making provision in new section 225D is drafted means Ministers can dispense with any one of the factors in determining the intended recipient class. Therefore, there is some flexibility for Ministers to make recommendations on the overall scope of the recipient and to target the exemption accordingly. In relation to the alternative proposal put forward by submissions, we note that 120 percent of the median household income nationwide in 2013 was $82,000. We also note that the income threshold (and the asset test) is intended to be measured at the point a community housing entity is considering providing the housing assistance to a recipient, rather than continually measured over time. We can clarify this point in the regulation. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Provision of new housing criterion Clause 29 Submissions (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Habitat for Humanity, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust) The criterion that the proposed exemption applies to community housing entities that provide new houses is too narrow. The problem that the amendments are resolving relate to both existing community housing entities with portfolios of families living in shared ownership homes, as well as entities who are currently under contract for delivering shared ownership. Comment We agree that the criterion is too narrow. The amendments should apply to both existing and new housing products so long as the activities of the entity includes the provision of home- ownership products and services to low-income households and meet the other criteria. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 181 Issue: Reinvestment of profits criterion Clause 29 Submissions (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Habitat for Humanity, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, New Zealand Law Society, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) The New Zealand Law Society queries whether the requirement that ―all profit of the business is reinvested into the business‖ might preclude the distribution or application of the profit for community housing purposes that should be permitted – for example, a distribution or application of such profit to or for the benefit of a parent or beneficiary/client community housing entity. (New Zealand Law Society) The criterion that requires housing profits to be reinvested in the housing activity of the community housing entity should be extended to allow distribution of housing profits to a parent entity that is itself a charitable organisation. (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Habitat for Humanity, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) Comment We support the submissions. Community housing entities should be able to distribute housing profits to a parent entity that is itself a charitable organisation on the basis that the profits would be used to further the charitable purposes of the parent entity. Additionally, community housing entities should be permitted to distribute profits to other related community housing entities as this is consistent with the requirement in new section CW 42B(1)(a). Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Registration with the new Regulatory Housing Authority criterion Clause 29 Submissions (Accessible Properties, Community Housing Aotearoa, Habitat for Humanity, Marlborough Sustainable Housing Trust, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) The proposed amendments and the proposed registration framework for community housing entities should be properly aligned to ensure consistency. For example, currently there is a discrepancy between the definition of ―community housing provider‖ for registration purposes and the proposed exemption criterion relating to the provision of new housing. 182 Comment Officials agree with the submissions and the suggested change relating to ―Issue: Provision of new housing criterion‖ should address the submission. We also note that all community housing providers are required to provide social rental products to be eligible to register with the new Regulatory Housing Authority. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 183 REGULATION-MAKING POWER Clause 159 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The regulation-making power in new section 225D of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be ―framed‖ by a purpose provision that makes it clear that the factors referred to in section 225D (3) are to be used to ensure that the operations of tax-exempt community housing entities are targeted at the provision of new housing for the benefit of individuals and families who are on relatively low incomes and who could not otherwise afford to buy a house without government assistance. Comment Officials do not agree with the submission. A purpose provision is not necessary as new section 225D already provides sufficient explanation about how the regulation is to be promulgated and what it may contain. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 184 OTHER MATTERS Issue: Use of the term “business” Clause 29 Submissions (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) For the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, a ―business‖ includes any profession, trade, or undertaking carried on for profit. The reference to ―business‖ in new section CW 42B may cause uncertainty and confusion in this context. We suggest references to activities or purposes should be sufficient to cover the intended entities, without having to consider whether or not there is any ―profit‖ element. (Ernst & Young) The term ―business‖ may not be an appropriate term to cover the full range of community housing activity undertaken by the target community housing entities and it may be more appropriate to use wider or more neutral terms, such as ―enterprise‖ or ―activity‖. (New Zealand Law Society) The proposed exemption is aimed at community housing entities that operate under a non-profit model, but this aim may not be achieved because use of the term ―business‖ suggests that the target community housing entity must have an intention to make a profit. The lack of intention to make a profit should not exclude a community housing entity from the proposed exemption. (Russell McVeagh) Comment We agree the use of the term ―business‖ is confusing and may lead to unintended consequences. We support amending section CW 42B in line with the suggestions raised in submissions. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Use of the terms “beneficiaries” and “clients” Clause 29 Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) New section CW 42B refers to ―beneficiaries of the trust‖ or ―clients of the company‖. It may be preferable for section CW 42B to refer to ―the only beneficiaries or clients of the entity, as the case may be ...‖. This is because trusts and companies may have either beneficiaries or clients. (New Zealand Law Society) 185 Limiting the beneficiaries of any trust and the clients of any company to classes of persons specified in new section CW 42B is too restrictive and uncertain. References to ―beneficiaries of the trust‖ and ―clients of the company‖ should be deleted. (Russell McVeagh) Comment We agree with the submission of the New Zealand Law Society, as it is consistent with the intended policy outcome. However, we disagree with the submission put forward by Russell McVeagh as it would remove an important design feature of the new exemption that ensures it is effectively targeted. Recommendation That the submission to amend new section CW 42B to refer to ―the only beneficiaries or clients of the entity, as the case may be ...‖ be accepted. That the submission for Russell McVeagh be declined. Issue: Scope of the exemption provision Clause 29 Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) New section CW 42B is limited to the income of a community housing entity from its housing business. This limitation might create some uncertainty as to the scope of the exemption in relation to income from other sources – for example, interest or dividends. (New Zealand Law Society) The reference in new section CW 42B to income from a business may unintentionally limit the scope of the exemption or (in some cases) cause it not to apply at all. (Russell McVeagh) Comment We agree that new section CW 42B should exempt all income derived by the community housing entity, and not be limited to income from an entity’s housing activity. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 186 Issue: Scope of the donee status provision Clause 29 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) As currently drafted, new section LD 3(2)(ac) would apply only if ―the gift is made in a tax year that the entity derives exempt income under section CW 42B‖. It may be preferable for the provision to refer to the donee as being an entity that is ―eligible to derive‖ exempt income under new section CW 42B. Comment We agree with the submission as it will ensure that new section LD 3(2)(ac) achieves the intended policy. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Continuation of the tax-exempt status for already deregistered charities Clause 29 Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) The amendments relating to community housing entities and deregistered charities do not address the specific issue of continuity of tax-exempt status for an entity if there has been a period of non-registration under the Charities Act 2005 (and no other general income tax exemption applies to the entity). Consideration should be given to including amendments in the bill to provide for continuity of tax-exempt status for community housing entities if continuity of tax-exempt status would otherwise be affected by deregistration under the Charities Act 2005. (New Zealand Law Society) In a related submission, the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust submitted that the Trust is the only community housing entity deregistered by Charities Services. The Trust commented that the proposed exemption for community housing entities will not restore tax exemption for the Trust and its activities and that it had received an assurance from the Minister for Housing that it would be covered by the proposed exemption. This matter was noted by the Committee. (Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust) 187 Comment We do not agree with the submissions. The proposed exemption is intended to target those community housing entities that meet the proposed criteria. The exemption is not intended to cover all community housing entities. Furthermore, we note that the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust advised the Committee on 19 February 2014 that it was in discussions with the Government about its current tax liability. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 188 189 Other policy matters 190 191 LAND-RELATED LEASE PAYMENTS Clauses 8, 9, 53, 56 and 123 Issue: Support for aspects of the reform Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) We generally welcome the narrower/targeted focus of the rules aimed at taxing payments to transfer a lease paid in substitution for taxable lease premiums and lease surrender payments, rather than the original proposed broad reform which would have treated all land-related lease payments as being on revenue account. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society) We support the amendment treating consecutive leases as a single lease for depreciation purposes. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment to clarify that retirement villages’ occupation rights should be excepted financial arrangements to align their treatment with leases of land under the financial arrangement rules, is supported. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Officials welcome this support and note that it illustrates the benefits of the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Glasgow-type leases are akin to freehold estates Submission (Parininihi ki Waitotara Incorporation, West Coast Settlement Reserve Lessees Association (Inc)) Payments made in respect of Glasgow-type leases (with the usual term of 7, 12 or 21 years), which are renewable in perpetuity, should not be taxable to the recipient, and deductible to the payer. The reason is that Glasgow-type leases are more akin to freehold estates, and are different from ordinary commercial leases with a defined term. The payments for Glasgow-type leases can include a payment made on the transfer of a lease or on the surrender of the lease. The fact that the payments can occur between associated parties, for commercial reasons, should not change the non-taxable and non-deductible nature of the payments. 192 Therefore, the transfer of Glasgow leases should be excluded from the ambit of proposed new section CC 1B. The lease surrender provisions in section CC 1C should also be amended to exclude payments for the surrender of Glasgow leases. Comment Officials agree with the position that Glasgow leases are more akin to freehold estates because, in principle, the tenant has the right to use the land in perpetuity. Officials recommend that proposed section CC 1B of the bill, and section CC 1C of the Income Tax Act 2007, be amended to exclude payments made for the transfer or surrender of Glasgow leases. The amendment to section CC 1C should apply from the commencement of that section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Glasgow-type leases should be depreciable property Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Glasgow leases should remain depreciable property. Glasgow lease payments are made for a fixed period and at the end of this period, if the lease is not renewed, the lessee’s rights are extinguished. A Glasgow lease is not like freehold land and an interest in such a lease should continue to be depreciable. This would ensure symmetry of tax treatment, and the recipient remains taxable on the payments under section CC 1. The definition of ―fixed-life intangible property‖ should also be amended to include Glasgow leases in order for a deduction to be spread over the initial lease term. Comment Officials consider that Glasgow leases are more akin to freehold estates because, in principle, the tenant has the right to use the land in perpetuity. Therefore, it is the correct policy that these leases are not depreciable property. A tenant under a Glasgow lease may not claim depreciation deductions during the term of the lease (for premiums paid on the grant of the lease) because this type of lease has a perpetually renewable lease period. The tenant may be able to claim a depreciation loss when the perpetually renewable lease is sold for less that its adjusted tax value if the lease meets the definition of ―depreciable property‖ in section EE 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 – that is, in normal circumstances, the lease might reasonably be expected to decline in value. Officials consider it is likely that Glasgow leases are not depreciable under the current law. Officials therefore consider that this amendment only clarifies the existing position. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 193 Issue: Application date of Glasgow lease amendment Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment would capture Glasgow leases that have been in effect for many years. These leases would have been negotiated on the basis of lease premiums paid being depreciable property, and the deduction arising on termination/transfer of the lease. These decisions should not be affected by these changes. The proposed amendment should only apply to Glasgow leases entered into on or after 1 April 2015. (KPMG) The amendment to section EE 7, which will apply from 1 April 2015, will change the tax treatment of a number of Glasgow leases part-way through the lease term. This will create uncertainty for taxpayers and involve some element of retrospectivity which is not justified. The proposed amendment should not apply to existing leases which were negotiated on the basis of the tax treatment in force at the time the leases were entered into. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The amendment excluding Glasgow leases from being depreciable property currently has an application date of 1 April 2015. This is consistent with the application dates for all other land- related lease payments amendments in the bill. As noted above, it is likely that Glasgow leases are not depreciable under the current law. Given that the amendment is of a clarifying nature only, officials consider that the application date of 1 April 2015 is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Premium paid on grant of Glasgow leases Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, Russell McVeagh) Treatment of payments for perpetually renewable leases should be consistent for payer and recipient. Payments to landowners for the grant of a perpetually renewable lease should be excluded from section CC 1, so that the treatment for the landlord and the tenant is consistent. Otherwise the effect of the proposal would be to treat a perpetually renewable leasehold interest as akin to a freehold interest to the lessee (such that the lessee would have no deduction for the expenditure) but like any other leasehold interest for the landowner (such that the landowner would be taxed on the receipt). This would be inconsistent from a policy perspective, and contrary to symmetrical tax treatments, which have been a significant driver on recently enacted and currently proposed reforms to the tax treatment of lease-related payments. 194 Comment There is no universal principle of tax symmetry in the income tax system. Tax asymmetry is inherent and inevitable in a system that distinguishes between capital and revenue items. For example, lease transfer payments are generally non-taxable to the recipient but depreciable to the payer. Lease premiums paid on the grant of a Glasgow lease should continue to be taxable to the owner of the land under section CC 1, which has been the tax treatment since 1915. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Lease transfer payments amendment is not necessary Submission (KPMG) In practice, in commercial settings, payments to assign commercial leases will have different drivers to lease premiums and lease surrender payments. These payments are therefore unlikely to be substitutable, without some degree of artificiality and a high degree of structuring. This also introduces additional legislative complexity. (KPMG) Comment Officials note that during extensive consultation on the examples of certain lease transfer payments being substitutable for taxable lease surrender payments and lease premiums, the validity of these examples was not disputed. Officials consider the examples remain valid and that there is a risk to the tax base if such lease transfer payments are not made taxable. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting of the lease transfer payments provision Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Drafting of new section CC 1B(3) requires improvement as it uses double negatives which make the provision difficult to understand. 195 Comment Officials have considered the points raised in the submission, but have decided that the current drafting is sufficiently clear. Re-drafting of the provision so that the current exceptions in section CC 1B(3) are included in the opening subsection would make the drafting significantly more complex. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope of lease transfer payments amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Russell McVeagh) If a landlord, as part of a broader commercial relationship, provides funds to a new tenant, part of which is to be applied in an arm’s-length transaction for a lease transfer payment, this should not be taxable. Any transfer payment in this case is not a substitute for a lease premium or lease termination payment paid to or by a landlord. So the tax treatment should not be dependent on the source of the lease transfer payment funds, and section CC 1B(3)(c) should be more appropriately targeted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Proposed section CC 1B(3)(c) could result in lease transfer payments being taxable to the outgoing tenant who may have no knowledge or control over the arrangement. For example, if the landlord makes a loan to the incoming tenant to enable the new tenant to purchase the outgoing tenant’s business (including the lease), the lease transfer payment made by the incoming tenant as part of the business sale would be taxable. By contrast, if the incoming tenant borrowed from a bank rather than from the landlord, the lease transfer payment would not be taxable. (Russell McVeagh) Comment Officials agree that the scope of section CC 1B(3)(c), which taxes payments sourced directly or indirectly from funds provided by the landlord, is too wide. Officials agree that situations involving an arm’s-length transaction between the landlord and the incoming tenant should not be caught, and the provision should be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 196 Issue: Aligning section DB 20B with new section CC 1B Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society) Current section DB 20B provides a deduction for the existing section CC 1B where the payer is the person who owns the land right, the estate from which the land right is granted and the payment is to the person who is obtaining the land right. New section CC 1B(1) will apply if there is a transfer of the land right from the holder of the land right to another person. This should be clarified to ensure that the person who pays the amount is entitled to a deduction. Section DB 20B requires a corresponding amendment to provide a matching deduction. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) As currently drafted, proposed section CC 1B may cause mismatches between the income and deductibility treatment of some lease inducement payments. The bill should harmonise the income and deductibility treatment of lease inducement payments for the transfer of land rights. This could be done by amending the criteria in section DB 20B to reflect more closely the exemption criteria in proposed new section CC 1B. (New Zealand Law Society) Comment Officials consider it is not necessary to expand the deductibility criteria in section DB 20B(1)(a) to refer to payments for the transfer of land rights from the holder of the land to another person. This is because the transferee of the land right (the incoming tenant) would receive a deduction for the payment under the depreciation rules, being a payment for the right to use land under schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Officials consider that a deduction would not be denied to the owner of the land in a case where the owner uses an agent to make a lease inducement payment to the prospective tenant. This is because section YB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007 treats anything done by a nominee of a person as being done by that person. Therefore, the owner of the land would still be treated as the payer under section DB 20B(1)(b), and be entitled to a deduction. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Residential premises exemption needs amendment Submissions (Ernst & Young) Section CC 1B should be amended to remove the ―natural person‖ requirement from the section CC 1B(4)(a) residential premises exemption. If necessary, the reference in that provision to residential premises should be amended to ensure the exclusion relates to premises in the nature of dwellings occupied, intended or available for occupation by individuals as residencies. 197 Transfers of shares in cross-leased properties could fall within the proposed provisions. A large number of cross-leased family units may be owned as family trusts, the executors or trustees of deceased estates, or companies that may or may not be charging rentals. Transfers of such properties to associates may occur. There is no reason why the structural nature of an owner of any such residential premises should be critical in determining whether amounts derived or deemed (when subparts FB or FC apply) for their assignment or transfer would be taxable. If expenditure on acquiring such leased or licensed residential premises would not meet the general permission criteria for deductibility for the transferor, application of the proposed section CC 1B should be excluded, regardless of the nature of the transferor. Comment Officials consider that the current ―natural person‖ requirement in the exception for residential situations is necessary to maintain the integrity of this exception. The ―natural person‖ requirement in new section CC 1B is consistent with the residential exceptions in current sections CC 1B and CC 1C. The submission refers to transfers of residential property by the executors or trustees of deceased estates. Such transfers do not involve the payment of consideration and would therefore be outside the ambit of section CC 1B(1), which requires a transfer in exchange for the payment of an amount of consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Wash-up of deductions if the lease is terminated early Submission (KPMG) This issue is in relation to section EI 4B, enacted by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. Section EI 4B allows spreading of income and deductions for the lease inducement payment over the term of the relevant lease. An exception to this is when a person ceases to hold the lease or land from which the lease is granted, before the end of the lease term. However, section EI 4B(5) does not provide a wash-up of deductions for landlords if a lease is terminated early (for example, for reasons of insolvency); the landlord is still required to spread deductions over the original term of the lease. This outcome is inconsistent with the policy rationale for having the wash-up mechanism. For consistency, a wash-up mechanism for lease inducement deductions for landlords (that is, lessors and sub- lessors) should be provided in section EI 4B(5). 198 Comment Officials agree it would be consistent with the policy of the wash-up provision in section EI 4B(5) to allow a landlord to receive the balance of deductions for a lease inducement payment, if the lease is terminated early. This would be consistent with the treatment of a lessee who is taxed on the balance of income from a lease inducement payment if the lease is terminated early. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Permanent easement exclusion Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment Clause 8 of the bill excludes all payments for permanent easements from being taxable to landowners. It should be clarified that the exclusion does not apply to ongoing periodical payments for a permanent easement, as such payments should be on revenue account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 199 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS – AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE AND PURCHASE OF PROPERTY OR SERVICES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Issue: Support for proposed changes Clauses 60 to 67, 82 and 123 Submissions (Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitters support changes to simplify the spreading methods used by taxpayers for the agreements. They particularly note the appropriateness of the changes for IFRS taxpayers while also noting that some further improvements could be included for non-IFRS taxpayers. The latter submissions are discussed below. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Lowest price clauses and interest explicitly included in agreements for non- IFRS taxpayers Clauses 65 and 123 Submissions (Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group) The elimination for tax of the lowest price clause mechanism to value the property or services in agreements and thereby not implicitly agree the amount of interest (if any) is not appropriate for non-IFRS taxpayers. The imputation of interest into ―12-month ASAPs‖ is also inappropriate when non-IFRS parties have not explicitly agreed interest. Comment The current rules for agreements for sale and purchase of property or services (ASAPs) is to value them at the lowest price the parties would have agreed, on the date the agreement was entered into, if payment had been required in full at the time the first right in the property was transferred or the services provided. This tax rule has resulted in the long-established practice of including ―lowest price‖ clauses in commercial contracts for the sale and purchase of property or services in New Zealand. The lowest price tax mechanism also establishes if there is any interest in the agreement for tax, being the difference between the lowest price and the total consideration paid for the property or services. However, when the objective facts indicate that interest is disguised or capitalised, Inland Revenue may challenge the lowest price stated by the parties (Tax Information Bulletin Vol 3, No 3, October 1991 p8 sets out Inland Revenue’s position). 200 The submissions focus on the long established practice of including lowest price clauses in commercial contracts when there is no interest explicitly agreed in the contracts. They submit that this practice has worked well and has become widely accepted. Officials acknowledge these points but consider that the practice is not relevant when New Zealand taxpayers enter into contracts with non-residents. However, officials consider that the genuine explicit agreement of interest in commercial contracts should not be overturned through the application (or non-application) of a tax rule. This will address the issues regarding lowest price clauses raised in the submissions. Officials also consider that the imputation of interest for tax purposes is appropriate for ―12- month ASAPs‖, as included in the bill, in the absence of an explicit agreement of interest in commercial contracts. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part, subject of officials’ comments. Issue: Definition of 12-month ASAP Clause 123 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of ―12-month ASAP‖ (applicable for non-IFRS taxpayers) should be amended to exclude ASAPs which incorporate certain deferral features (for example, an earn-out) but do not have the underlying features of a loan. Comment The concern is that an ASAP may become a 12-month ASAP because an ―earn-out‖ payment (expressed as an adjustment to the purchase price) is made 12 months after completion of the transaction. The deferral of payment in such a case occurs because of uncertainty regarding the value of the business, not because there is some imputed interest component between the parties that ought to be recognised for tax purposes. Similar issues may arise with warranty payments that are expressed as an adjustment to the purchase price, or working capital adjustments that take more than 12 months to determine. Officials agree that these payments should not result in interest income or expenditure when there is no interest explicitly agreed between the parties. Officials recommend that the definition of ―12-month ASAP‖ in the bill be amended to exclude agreements which include these types of payments made more than 12 months after the rights date. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 201 Issue: Definition of “foreign ASAP” Clause 123 Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The definition of ―foreign ASAP‖ should be clarified to confirm whether an ASAP will be a foreign ASAP when some part (but not all) of the consideration is denominated in a foreign currency. Comment Officials agree with the submission and recommend that the definition of ―foreign ASAP‖ in the bill be amended to apply to foreign ASAPs where 50 percent or more of the consideration (measured at the time the ASAP is entered into) is in foreign currency. This rule will be based on using spot foreign currency rates at the time the ASAP is entered into. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Revenue account property/trading stock Clause 66 Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section EW 33B should be amended to refer consistently to revenue account property for all taxpayers and foreign ASAP situations, rather than using that term in section EW 33B(1)(a)(i) but referring to trading stock in section EW 33B(2)(a). Comment The use of trading stock (along with depreciable property) in proposed section EW 33B(2)(a) for non-IFRS taxpayers was considered to be appropriate as those taxpayers would usually be hedging those types of sales and purchases in foreign currency. It was also considered appropriate to constrain the ability to use foreign currency hedging for tax for non-IFRS taxpayers to the most common transactions. It was considered that IFRS taxpayers would be hedging all types of revenue account property (including trading stock) and that the use of the IFRS accounting rules for tax for all those transactions was appropriate. On reflection officials agree that the proposed section for non-IFRS taxpayers should apply to all revenue account property. We also consider that the section should also apply to services (as it already does for IFRS taxpayers). However, use of the hedging provisions by non-IFRS taxpayers should continue to be subject to a once only irrevocable election (in writing) to apply the section. This is appropriate for non-IFRS taxpayers because, unlike IFRS taxpayers, they 202 will not usually be using a proscribed hedging treatment in the financial accounts for these transactions. Because of the vast range of small to medium-sized taxpayers in this category, it is appropriate they be required to make a conscious act to be able to use the hedging rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transitional provisions Clause 82 Submission (Ernst & Young) The requirement that taxpayers should have filed returns in accordance with the proposed sections EZ 70 or EZ 71 as the case may be, for ―every earlier income year‖ as well as for the 2013–14 income year, should be deleted. Comment The submission says, given the uncertainty, confusion and numerous amendments which have been made to the financial arrangement rules, it is unreasonable to restrict application of the proposed transitional provisions to taxpayers who may have filed all previous year returns in accordance with provisions which are only now in the process of being articulated and enacted. The proposed changes to the tax rules for foreign ASAPs are the first changes to these rules since they were enacted in 1999. There have been changes to other parts of the tax rules for financial arrangements since then. The proposed changes will simplify the current treatment of these financial arrangements considerably and are generally welcomed by taxpayers. During consultation with taxpayers and their advisers over the past few years over possible changes to the rules for these arrangements, it became clear there is a substantial degree of non- compliance with the technicalities of the rules. It is considered necessary to retrospectively endorse this technical non-compliance when it has been in accordance with what the new rules require. We understand from discussions with a number of taxpayers and their advisers that the proposals in the bill for endorsing the past years are appropriate. However, it is necessary to apply this to every year of the term of a financial arrangement as the technically incorrect methods applied should have been applied for all years. It is not appropriate to retrospectively endorse positions when taxpayers have switched between various (technically non-compliant) methods for the same financial arrangements during their terms. It is appropriate to amend the proposed sections to endorse positions taken when the treatment was originally technically non-compliant but has been changed to technically compliant. This will apply to the treatment of all a taxpayer’s foreign ASAPs for the relevant years. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. 203 Issue: Deposits/payments for progress made Clause 123 Submission (Ernst & Young) Clarification is needed as to when deposits or other instalments would not be regarded as ―payments for progress made‖ and thus excluded from treatment as prepayments in the definition of ―12-month ASAP‖. Comment The submission is concerned about relatively small deposits paid at or very close to the commencement of a contract which may not be regarded as ―payments for progress made‖. These contracts may have payments for progress made subsequent to any initial deposit. Officials agree there is good reason to exclude small deposits paid at the beginning of contracts from creating a 12-month ASAP under the proposed rules. Officials recommend that the bill be amended to exclude deposits aggregating no more than 10 percent of the total consideration to be paid for the property or services and paid within the first three months of entering into the contract from being treated as prepayments for the definition of a 12-month ASAP. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Sale and purchase of services Clause 123 Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed definitions of ―12-month ASAP‖ and ―rights date‖ should be clarified in relation to agreements for sale and purchase of services. Comment The submitter is concerned the proposed definition (of ―rights date‖) is not appropriate in relation to the provision of services, particularly if they are provided on many dates or over a continuous period. The proposed definition uses the same words used in an existing definition of ―right‖ which has been part of the financial arrangements rules since they were introduced. Officials have not been provided with any actual examples of issues regarding the valuation of services using the existing definition of ―right‖. 204 In the absence of known widespread problems, and given that the words used in the definition of ―rights date‖ (and therefore also in ―12-month ASAP‖) are already used in the legislation, officials consider no action should be necessary at this time. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency requirements Clause 60 Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The consistency requirements in subpart EW require taxpayers to use the same spreading method every income year for financial arrangements that are the same or similar. The bill does not amend the consistency requirement to allow taxpayers to use the IFRS method for new foreign currency ASAPs if they are currently applying Determination G29 to other ―same or similar‖ ASAPs entered into before the application of these new rules. Comment Officials agree that the consistency rules should be amended as submitted, to allow for the proposed changes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Interest-free loans Clause 60 Submission (KPMG) Another bill contains an amendment to the IFRS spreading method in section EW 15D to ensure that holders of interest-free or low interest loans cannot claim deductions for interest imputed under IFRS that has not been economically incurred. It is not clear whether a foreign currency ASAP could also fall within the scope of the low-interest loan proposals. The policy intention should be clarified. This could be achieved by defining the terms ―interest-free loan‖ and ―low- interest loan‖ so that they exclude foreign currency ASAPs (if this is the intention). 205 Comment The submission is correct that it is not the intention that interest-free and low-interest loans are included in the proposals for foreign currency ASAPs. The two proposals are separate. Officials consider that the proposals for interest-free and low-interest loans stand alone and need no further clarification. The term ―interest-free loan‖ is used in various other parts of income tax legislation and is not defined for any of those purposes. As a result, it is not considered necessary to add further text to income tax legislation. The point will be noted in the Tax Information Bulletin which will follow enactment of the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Appropriate spreading methods for foreign currency ASAPs Clauses 60 to 67, 82 and 123 Submission (KPMG) The Act and the bill should be reviewed and appropriate amendments made to ensure that taxpayers have appropriate spreading methods to apply. Comment The submission suggests that when a foreign currency ASAP does not meet the application criteria for the yield-to-maturity method it is difficult to apply a spreading method that meets the purpose of the financial arrangements rules. This results in the allocation of an inappropriate amount of income/expenditure to each income year. While officials appreciate that sometimes it is difficult to achieve an appropriate allocation of income or expenditure in some situations, it is not an issue of major significance to warrant an immediate review of the Act. Officials are also aware of various disputes and discussions with taxpayers where it has been relatively easy to apply an appropriate spreading method using existing legislation and the underlying purposes of the financial arrangements rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 206 Issue: Use of spot rates to convert foreign currency payments Clause 66 Submission (Deloitte) The use of spot rates to convert foreign currency amounts to New Zealand currency in proposed section EW 33C needs to be clarified. Also, proposed subsections EW 32(2C) and (2D) include redundant wording being, ―section EW 33C applies if the consideration is in a foreign currency‖, as the provisions only apply to foreign currency transactions in the first instance. Comment Officials accept that the use of spot rates could be clarified. The intention is to allow some flexibility in the use of spot rates to cater for a variety of factual circumstances which can apply. Officials recommend that the use of spot rates be amended to make it clear that spot rates to be used are the spot rates on the dates payments are made during an income year. When payments are made after the end of an income year, the spot rates used can be the actual spot rates for payments made within 93 days of the end of the income year or the spot rate at the end of the income year. The redundant words in proposed section EW 33C will be addressed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Elections by non-IFRS taxpayers to use foreign currency hedging Clause 66 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Separate elections should not be required (by non-IFRS taxpayers) to include in the value of property certain forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge the foreign currency arrangements. Comment The bill proposes that a once only irrevocable election is made in writing to apply the proposed section to all financial arrangements for the property. The form and timing of the election is considered quite clear from the wording of the proposed section. 207 It is considered appropriate to include this requirement for non-IFRS taxpayers to enable them to use hedging for foreign currency ASAPs because they will not usually be using hedging for accounting purposes. IFRS taxpayers can only apply hedging to foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to designated hedging under IFRS accounting. The application of designated hedge accounting under IFRS is a rigorous exercise and its use will be compulsory for tax. It is considered appropriate that non-IFRS taxpayers be required to consciously elect to use hedging for tax and to be on a similar footing to IFRS taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Future and discounted valuing Clause 65 Submission (Deloitte) Proposed section EW 32(2C) requires a non-IFRS taxpayer to determine in respect of a foreign ASAP that is more than 12 months: ―the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values, on the rights date‖. What is required is uncertain. This wording should be clarified and clear, worked examples should be provided in a commentary. Comment The words in proposed section EW 32(2C) are the same as those used in an existing subsection of section EW 32. There are examples of the use of the future value, or the discounted value, or a combination of both the future and discounted values in existing determinations. These existing provisions and examples will be referred to in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 208 Issue: Life financial reinsurance contracts which may be foreign ASAPs Clause 60 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Life financial reinsurance contracts are subject to specific provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007. Where such contracts come within the definition of foreign ASAPs it is proposed that section EW 15D (the IFRS financial reporting method) is not able to be applied and the existing section EW 15I spreading method continues to apply. Comment Officials consider that the current and proposed IFRS accounting treatment may result in the spreading of income and expenditure on these contracts which does not reflect the underlying purposes of the financial arrangement rules. As a result, it is considered that the existing spreading treatment of such contracts under section EW 15I should be retained. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 209 ACQUISITION DATE OF LAND Clause 7 Issue: The amendment is not needed Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young) The legislative amendment is not necessary, and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should revisit her interpretation of when land is acquired to ensure it is consistent with case law. This would make clause 7 unnecessary. Comment The Commentary on the bill (page 100) and the officials’ issues paper Clarifying the acquisition date of land, 6 explains the uncertainty regarding section CB 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is caused by the timing of when the taxpayer’s intention or purpose should be determined. The Courts have held that the relevant time for determining a taxpayer’s purpose or intention is at the time the taxpayer acquired the land. 7 There is minimal case law to provide sufficient guidance on when acquisition actually occurs, in particular when an agreement for the sale and purchase of land is initially conditional. A 1973 tax decision in the High Court held that land is acquired when the parties to an agreement become bound by the contract to purchase and to sell – that is, when the contract becomes unconditional and an order for specific performance of the land transfer is available. 8 However, in a subsequent non-tax case, the Court of Appeal held that under the general law, a purchaser acquires an equitable interest in land if specific performance in its wider sense (that is, any form of equitable remedy) is available to protect the purchaser’s rights under the contract. 9 In other words, it is a question of whether a purchaser can, by injunction or otherwise, prevent the vendor from dealing with the property in a way that is inconsistent with the contract of sale. The interpretation of these two cases (and those that followed) has resulted in a number of differing views over when land is acquired. Further confusion is caused because the definition of ―land‖ in the Income Tax Act 2007 includes estates and interests in land. In a typical sale and purchase situation, the purchaser acquires different interests and estates in ―land‖ over time which is then merged when the title is registered. Neither the legislation nor common law has provided sufficient clarity over which interest in ―land‖ the date of acquisition should apply to. 6 This issues paper is available at: http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2013-ip-acquisition-date-land/overview. 7 AnzamcoLtd (in liq) v CIR (1983) 6 NZTC 61,522 (HC). 8 Beetham v CIR \[1973\] 1 NZLR 575 (HC). See also West v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1976) 2 NZTC 61,114 (HC), Case Y3 (2007) 23 NZTC 13,028, and Annalong Pty Ltd v FCT 72 ATC 4141. 9 Bevan v Smith \[1994\] 3 NZLR 648 (CA). 210 Within Inland Revenue, the Crown Law Office and the private sector, there are diverse views on what is the most accurate interpretation of the law and date of acquisition. The diversity of views is exacerbated when there is a significant period of time between entering into an agreement to purchase land and the registration of the land transfer title. Officials consider a clear legislative test is the best way of dealing with the current uncertainty. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The drafting of section CB 15B Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) The drafting of proposed section CB 15B is circular and could be improved to better convey how the test applies. Comment Proposed section CB 15B (1) current states: ―General rule ―(1) For the purposes of subpart CB, a person acquires land on the date that begins a period in which the person has an estate or interest in the land, alone or jointly or in common with another person.‖ \[emphasis added\] Officials consider the wording of this proposed section is not circular even though the definition of ―land‖ in the Income Tax Act includes estates and interests. The crucial aspect of the wording of section CB 15B (1) is that the ―land‖ that is being acquired is identified and the ―estate or interest‖ is in that ―land‖. Furthermore, section CB 15B (1) will only be applied retrospectively, so the emphasis is in looking back to when the person had the first estate or interest. Once the taxpayer determines the point in time that they had the first estate or interest, the beginning of this period is considered to be the acquisition date for the purposes of subpart CB. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 211 Issue: The timing of the test of a person’s intention and purpose Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Russell McVeagh) The drafting of proposed section CB 15B should refer explicitly to the time at which a person’s purpose or intention is to be determined (that is, when the person enters into a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of land), as opposed to when land is acquired. Comment The policy intent of proposed section CB 15B is to clarify the timing of when land is acquired as the Court has held that this is when a person’s purpose or intention should be tested. 10 Officials consider that focusing the proposed section on the timing of the person’s intention or purpose will narrow the application of proposed section CB 15B just to section CB 6. This will not resolve when the date of acquisition is for the rest of the land provisions, as the date of acquisition is important for:  section CB 15 – which determines when land is acquired by associated persons for most of the land provisions in subpart CB;  sections CB 7, CB 9, CB 10 and CB 14 – which determine when the 10-year period begins for a business dealing in land (including land development, subdivisions and change of land under the Resource Management Act 1991); and  sections CB 18 and CB 19 – which determine when land is acquired for the purposes of the residential and business exemption. Furthermore, if the legislation referred more explicitly to the date the person enters into a sale and purchase agreement, the inclusion of the word ―agreement‖ would create a proxy and would narrow the scope of the provision even further, as any other form of acquisition (outside of an agreement) will fall outside the scope of proposed section CB 15 B and section CB 6. Officials are of the view that this could create a revenue risk. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 10 See footnote 2. 212 Issue: Proposed section CB 15B should be deleted or reconsidered more substantially Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section CB 15B should be deleted or reconsidered more substantially; in particular, further clarification is needed on:  identification of the ―land‖;  changes in the nature of a person’s interest or holding in the land;  a need to deal explicitly with options, nominee and trust situations; and  amending provisions allowing for deductions for the cost of acquiring property which is or becomes ―revenue account property‖ under the Land Sale Provisions. Comment The clarification sought by proposed section CB 15B has highlighted a number of technical problems and other related areas of ambiguity with the current application of section CB 6, the definition of land and the relationship between section CB 6 and other land sale provisions. Although proposed section CB 15B will address the main problem of when the taxpayer’s intention or purpose should be tested, further detailed analysis to address the technical issues raised by the submitter is needed. Officials consider that if further amendments are proposed to address the issues raised, this may create further ambiguities without the benefit of full consideration. Given the time constraints for the bill, and the number of issues that would need to be worked through (and consulted on), the current bill is not the best vehicle to address the various technical issues raised. A number of these issues could be best addressed in a published statement on the interpretation and application of proposed section CB 15B given there is a range of case law that covers some of the issues raised. For example, there are a number of cases on whose intention or purpose should be tested:  Harkness v CIR 11 – where the purpose is the purpose of the owner of the land;  Tilley v FCT 12 – the agent’s purpose will be imputed to the principal;  Boanas v CIR 13 – the intention is of the partnership and not the partners; and  CIR v National Distributors 14 – the company’s purpose is the purpose of the persons who control the decisions of the company. Officials disagree that an explicit provision covering these circumstances should be included in the bill but further guidance in a public statement would provide further clarity. 11 (1975) 2 NZTC 61,017. 12 77 ACT 4027. 13 (2008) 23 NZTC 22,046. 14 (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346. 213 Officials also do not agree that proposed section CB 15B be removed from the bill for the reasons noted above (the diverse views between Inland Revenue, the Crown Law Office, taxpayers and their agents). A number of other submitters are supportive of the legislative clarity. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to Inland Revenue publishing a statement on the interpretation and application on proposed section CB 15B. Issue: Purpose and intention of the subsequent nominee, nominated transferee or assignee Submission (Ernst & Young) Outside of the circumstances of section YB 21, proposed section CB 15B would not be effective in relation to the subsequent nominee, nominated transferee or assignee. For example, in the absence of any specific deeming provision, we do not understand how a subsequently incorporated company could acquire any interest in land before the company came into existence, let alone have the purpose or intentions of another legal person at that pre-existence time. Comment Officials agree that in the circumstance when a subsequent nominee, transferee or assignee does not yet exist it is impossible for this subsequent nominee, transferee or assignee to have any requisite purpose or intention to test under proposed section CB 15B. Officials therefore recommend that a provision be included in the bill that clarifies the circumstance when a subsequent nominee, transferee or assignee is yet to exist, that the purpose and intention of the person who controls the nominee, transferee or assignee, be imputed onto the subsequent person once this subsequent person comes into existence. The provision is only likely to be needed in a company situation, as this is a clear example of where a ―person‖ does not yet exist but can be created. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 214 Issue: Definition of “interest in land” Submission (New Zealand Law Society) The Income Tax Act 2007 does not define what an ―interest in land‖ is for this purpose and there is the potential for uncertainty where ―land‖ acquired is different from the ―land‖ being disposed of, therefore the ambit of ―land‖ should be clarified. Comment Subpart YA 1 provides a definition of ―interest‖ in relation to land so no separate definition of ―interest‖ for the purposes of section CB 6 is needed. A wider review of the ambit of ―land‖ is outside the scope of the proposed amendment. Officials also consider that the effect of section CB 6(3) is that the ―land‖ acquired and the ―land‖ sold need not be the same ―land‖. Subsection CB 6(3) states: Land partially sold or sold with other land (3) This section and sections CB 7 to CB 23 apply whether the land disposed of— • (a) is part only of the land to which the relevant section applies: • (b) is the whole of the land to which the relevant section applies: • (c) is the whole of the land to which the relevant section applies, together with other land As explained in the officials’ issues paper, the introduction of subsection CB 6(3) was to cover situations where land that is disposed of constitutes the whole or part of any land. According to an Inland Revenue Head Office Circular, this subsection was introduced to circumvent the Australian case Moruben Gardens, 15 where the Australian High Court held that it was necessary for there to be a clear ―identity‖ between the estate or the interest acquired, and the estate or interest disposed of. It also follows that in a typical sale and purchase agreement for the acquisition of land, all the estates and interests in land merge into the one legal title, therefore there is always a link between what ―land‖ is disposed of and what ―land‖ is acquired. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 15 Moruben Gardens Pty Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation (Cth) (1972) 46 ALJR 559; 3 ATR 225; 72 ATC 4147 (HC). 215 Issue: Alignment with the definition of “land” Submission (Matter raised by officials) Proposed section CB 15B should include options to acquire land, or an estate or interest in land. Comment The definition of ―land‖ in the Income Tax Act includes ―an option to acquire land, or an estate or interest in land‖. Currently proposed section CB 15B only refers to estates or interests in land. Officials recommend that proposed section CB 15 B include an ―option‖ to acquire land to align with the definition of ―land‖. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Previous interests and estates in land with an option Submission (Matter raised by officials, Ernst & Young) The policy intent should be clarified where taxpayers hold an interest in one type of land (such as a leasehold interest) but then acquire another interest in that land (such as the estate in fee simple), which is later all or partly disposed of. Comment The policy intent of proposed section CB 15B is to test the person’s intention or purpose when they first acquire an interest or estate in the land. The submitter raised the issue that clarification is needed where a taxpayer holds an interest of one type of land in a particular block of land, such as a leasehold interest, then acquires the freehold, which is later all or partly disposed of. As currently drafted, the taxpayer’s intention or purpose would only be tested when they acquired the leasehold interest. Officials agree that in the circumstance outlined by the submitter, this situation is only likely to occur where there is an option to exercise a right to acquire another estate or interest in land. For example:  Brian has an unregistered leasehold in land, with a ―first right‖ option to acquire the fee simple estate if it is disposed of by the lessor April.  April decides to sell the estate in fee simple, and offers the land to Brian as per the terms of the lease agreement.  Brian agrees to exercise the option to acquire the estate in fee simple. 216 In this example Brian has a number of interests and estates – the leasehold land, the option and once the option is exercised, a contingent equitable interest in the land that eventually merges into an estate in fee simple. Under the current drafting of proposed section CB 15B, Brian’s intention or purpose is only tested when he acquires the unregistered leasehold interest. However because an unregistered leasehold interest does not merge into the legal estate in fee simple, if Brian had the intention to acquire the estate in fee simple to dispose of it, and Brian disposes of the estate in fee simple, any gain Brian makes from this disposal falls outside the ambit of section CB 6. This is because when Brian acquired (the leasehold) he did not have the intention to dispose of the leasehold, despite making another active decision to exercise the option and acquire the estate that is eventually disposed of. Officials consider that this outcome is not consistent with the underlying policy intent of section CB 6 or the first interest principle, as Brian has made another active decision to enter into an agreement to acquire the estate in fee simple. Officials consider that this subsequent acquisition should be treated as separate acquisition of land, and Brian’s intention or purpose should be tested at this time (when he exercises the option). As per the officials’ issues paper: ...the policy intent of section CB 6 is to capture property speculators, arguably the most appropriate time to assess a taxpayer’s intention and purpose should be when a person decides to enter into a sale and purchase agreement. It is the initial decision-making that informs how a person intends to use the property. It would be unusual for a property speculator to enter into a sale and purchase agreement unless they thought it very likely that the purchase and its subsequent disposal would be profitable. Officials recommend that a new provision be included in the bill that provides where a person has a previous (first) interest in land, and exercises an option that is related to that land, the person has entered into a new acquisition and the section CB 6 and proposed section CB 15B should be applied, as if the previous interest did not exist. The example above is distinct from the situation where a person just has an option to acquire land but no other previous interest in land. As per the officials’ issues paper, the appropriate time to test their intention or purpose in relation to the option is when the option is granted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Timing in subpart FB and FC Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The new section should only apply when subpart FB or FC provide a different timing of a transaction to that provided under the new section. 217 Comment Proposed subsection CB 15B (2) provides that the timing of when land is acquired is overridden by any timing set out in subpart FB (transfers of relationship property) and FC (distribution, transmission, and gifts of property). Under the current wording, proposed subsection CB 15B (1) is only overridden if there is a timing set out in subpart FB and FC. Therefore when there is no timing specified in subpart FB or FC, the timing of subpart CB 15B (1) will apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section 225 of the Resource Management Act 1991 Submission (Deloitte) Clause 7 should contemplate arrangements subject to section 225 of the Resource Management Act 1991 and confirm land is acquired when a binding agreement is entered into regardless of any conditions. Comment Section 225 of the Resource Management Act 1991 (RMA) deems that an agreement to sell land or any building that constitutes a subdivision and is made before the appropriate survey plan is approved is conditional on the survey plan being deposited. A purchaser can therefore cancel or rescind the agreement if there are delays in the title separation. The policy underlying the preferred date to test the taxpayer’s purpose or intention is founded on the ―first interest‖ approach, where the date to test a person’s purpose or intention is the date when the first interest (equitable or legal) in land arises under an agreement for the sale and purchase of land (the ―first interest‖ interpretation). Therefore, an explicit provision for agreements subject to section 225 of the RMA is not needed, as the parties intend to be bound by the agreement and the Court has the ability to enforce the purchaser’s right in the agreement by ordering specific performance in the sense of requiring the vendor to submit a survey plan. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 218 Issue: Proposed section CB 15B should not apply to other land-related provisions Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The rule should not apply to other land-related provisions in subpart CB, but could apply for sections CB 7, CB 18 and CB 19. Comment As noted above, in general the timing of the acquisition date of land affects most of the land- related provisions in subpart CB:  section CB 15 – determines when land is acquired by associated persons for most of the land provisions in subpart CB;  sections CB 7, CB 9, CB 10 and CB 14 – determine when the 10-year period begins for a business dealing in land (including land development, subdivisions and change of land under the Resource Management Act 1991); and  sections CB 18 and CB 19 – determine when land is acquired for the purposes of the residential and business exemption. Officials do not agree with limiting the rule to just section CB 6 as the issue of when land is acquired for the remaining land-related provisions would be unclear. Officials consider that one rule for all the land-related provisions is the more appropriate policy approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Correction of the application date of new section CB 15B Clause 2(20) Submission (Matter raised by officials) Comment Clause 2(20) provides that the application date for proposed section CB 15B is from the date of the introduction of the bill whereas it has always been intended (as reflected in the bill Commentary) that proposed section CB 15B applies to disposals of land from the date the bill is introduced. Officials recommend that the application date be corrected. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 219 Issue: Clarify that the application date can be retrospective Clause 2(20) Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group) It should be made clearer that proposed section CB 15B has a retrospective effect to determining the acquisition date or Inland Revenue should indicate it will immediately cease advancing the new interpretation of the existing law. Comment If the Committee agrees the application date should be corrected to apply to disposals of land from the date the bill is introduced, it will be made clear that proposed section CB 15B can apply to land that has been acquired before the date the bill is introduced, and is therefore retrospective where land has not yet been disposed of. Although the officials’ issues paper acknowledged that the ―first interest‖ interpretation is the preferred tax policy interpretation, the current interpretation used by Inland Revenue (that is, the disposal interpretation – where the date of acquisition is determined by the ―land‖ that is disposed of) is not a totally unreasonable interpretation. We consider it unwarranted for the Commissioner to ―unwind‖ previous positions taken by both the taxpayer and Inland Revenue when the land has already been disposed. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to the Committee agreeing to the correction of the application date. Issue: Deferral or limitation of the application date Clause 2(20) Submission (Ernst & Young, Matter raised by officials) There does not appear to be any reason for urgency in bringing in any change of rules, therefore the commencement and scope of application of any such new provision should be:  deferred at least until enactment of the legislation; and  limited in application to land acquired after that date. Comment In the officials’ issues paper, it was suggested: ―For ease of administration and in the interests of fairness, if the Government does decide to clarify the date of acquisition following feedback on the options presented here, we suggest that the date of application for any legislative option (that is, for new acquisitions as opposed to new disposals) be prospective from the date of Royal assent of the relevant tax bill.‖ 220 Submissions received on the application date in the officials’ issues paper were not supportive of the prospective application date. Two application dates were suggested by two submitters during consultation: 1. ―Retrospective to allow for the reversal of previous decisions/ interpretations that are inconsistent with what is now acknowledged to be the correct interpretation.‖ 2. ―Retrospective for all disposals where income tax has not been assessed prior to the date the preferred changes are publicly announced. This will help minimise issues with uncertainty and will ensure that neither taxpayers nor Inland Revenue need to continue protracted disputes. Applying a clarified definition only to land purchased after enactment will leave uncertainty for those taxpayers subject to the 10-year rule in the other land provisions, potentially up to 10 years after the enactment of the legislation.‖ Officials considered that the current interpretation applied by Inland Revenue is not a totally unreasonable interpretation that it warrants a fully retrospective application date as suggested in the first submission. However officials did agree with submitter 2, that the impact on the other land provisions was not ideal, and that the application date in the officials’ issues paper needed to be reconsidered. Hence the application date suggested in the bill Commentary, which we have recommended the Committee correct in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 221 REPEAL OF THE SUBSTITUTING DEBENTURE RULE Clauses 38, 40, 51, 83, 84, 105 and 123(13) and (40) Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The submitters support the repeal of the substituting debenture rule. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Transitional provision and application dates Clause 83 Submission (Ernst & Young) The application date based on income years should be clarified and revised. Parties to the same debenture may have different balance dates. This could cause uncertainty where, for example, the issuer has a 30 June balance date and pays a ―dividend‖ in April. Because the substituting debenture is still treated as a share from the issuer’s perspective, the payment is treated as a dividend and may be imputed. If the holder has a 31 March balance date, then the new regime will apply, the debenture will be treated as debt and the payment by the issuer will be treated as interest. There is uncertainty over whether the holder can use the imputation credit. Comment Officials considered two ways of dealing with the transition date:  an ―income year approach‖ where all instruments transition from equity to debt at the end of each affected taxpayer’s 2014–15 income year (the exact date of transition will therefore vary depending on the taxpayer’s specific balance date). This is the approach currently in the bill. The rationale for the income year approach is to make the transition as clean as possible for taxpayers and to prevent the need for potentially complicated part- year adjustments that may be required if a single date (such as 31 March 2015) was chosen. Under the income year approach, a taxpayer who is party to a substituting debenture will have an equity investment for the whole of the 2014–15 income year and a new debt investment for the whole of the 2015–16 and later income years. The income year approach does, however, have the disadvantage identified by Ernst & Young where the balance dates of the parties to the substituting debenture are different and there is a payment under the debenture (or some other event such as a remission/cancellation or repayment) in the period between their balance dates; or 222  a ―tax year approach‖ where all instruments transition from equity to debt at the end of the 2014–15 tax year – 31 March 2015. The tax year approach has the benefit of setting a single transition date for all taxpayers who are parties to substituting debentures and eliminates the potential for mismatches in debt/equity treatment between parties to the same arrangement. However, it does mean that some taxpayers may have a transition part-way through their income year which may increase compliance costs associated with what is intended to be a taxpayer-friendly measure. Ernst & Young has not identified a preferred solution to the problem it has identified. One way of dealing with the submitter’s concern would be to include provisions specifying how payments (or other actions/events) under the substituting debenture should be treated where the parties’ balance dates do not align. This would add significant complexity to the legislation. The alternative would be to adopt the tax year approach. Ernst & Young considers that the complexity and compliance costs of doing a part-year adjustment should be minimal (given people already have to calculate their outstanding principal at year-end). Accordingly, adopting the tax year approach should not make any taxpayers worse off and would solve a potential problem for parties to substituting debentures with non-aligned balance dates. This approach is also consistent with the goal of eliminating any potential tax treatment mismatches generally. Officials therefore support adopting a tax year approach to the repeal of the substitution debenture rule and the transitional provision. This means that the substituting debenture rule will be repealed on 1 April 2015 for all taxpayers and the transitional provision will apply to deem a redemption of shares on 31 March 2015 and the advance of a new loan on 1 April 2015. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Transitional provision – clarifications Clause 83 Submissions (Ernst & Young) The ―outstanding principal‖ concept in the transitional provision should be clarified to explicitly include any accrued but unpaid interest. The transitional provision should clarify that the deemed repayment and re-issue of the debenture applies to both the issuer and the holder of the debenture. Comment Officials agree that these clarifications would be useful. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 223 Issue: Transitional provision – effect on shareholder continuity Clause 83 Submission (Ernst & Young) Some debentures carry voting rights. When these debentures cease to be treated as shares for tax purposes, taxpayers could potentially suffer a shareholder continuity breach, thus forfeiting tax losses and/or imputation credits. Specific ―savings‖ provisions are needed in relation to the measurement of voting interest in determining continuity for losses and imputation credits to ensure no adverse tax consequences arise. Comment Officials estimate it would be fairly unusual to have voting debentures that were originally held in proportion to equity, but have ceased to be so held such that their subsequent redemption could affect shareholder continuity. However, the repeal of the substituting debenture rule was not intended to have any adverse tax consequences, therefore a savings provision is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Tailoring the transitional provision Clause 83 Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Corporate Taxpayers Group supports the transitional provision, however notes that there may need to be some amendments to ensure individual taxpayers are not adversely affected. Corporate Taxpayers Group expects affected taxpayers would submit separately on this matter. New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants submits that the transitional provision should be tailored to ensure individual taxpayers are not adversely affected (for example, in relation to available subscribed capital (ASC)). New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants advises that officials are aware of how taxpayers could be negatively affected. Comment Officials note the submissions. Other submitters have drawn officials’ attention to the specific amendments needed to transitional provisions to ensure taxpayers are not adversely affected and these have been separately considered. 224 There have not been any submissions on how ASC may be affected. Officials considered the effect of the transitional provision on ASC in drafting the transitional provision. The transitional provision is intended to ensure that the deemed redemption – an ―off-market cancellation‖ – of the ―share‖ has the same tax consequences as the redemption of a non- participating redeemable share that is: (a) no dividend arises to the ―shareholder‖ to the extent the redemption payment does not exceed ASC; and (b) the company’s ASC is reduced by the amount of the principal repayment (being a component of ―returns‖ in the ASC formula in section CD 43(2)). The original subscription for the ―share‖ should have generated ASC equal to the loan principal and this should be sufficient to shelter the dividend arising on redemption. Assuming the full loan balance is outstanding at the transition date, the original ASC should be equal to redemption proceeds/principal repayment, and there should be no dividend and (appropriately) there should be a reduction in the ASC equal to redemption proceeds/principal repayment. If the outstanding principal on the transition date is less than the amount originally lent (because some of the principal has been paid down), we would expect the ASC to have been reduced by previous loan repayments (that is, the ASC would have been used to shelter ―dividends‖ arising from previous repayments). So, for example, if one hundred $1 debentures were originally issued, this would have generated $100 of ASC. If $30 has been repaid to date (treated as a cancellation of thirty $1 debentures), this repayment will not have been a dividend to the extent covered by ASC and, consequently, the ASC should have been reduced by $30. This means when the deemed repayment of $70 occurs on the transition date, the remaining ASC of $70 should shelter the dividend. The ASC will also be reduced by $70. If there was only a single debenture issued for $100, the previous $30 repayment cannot have been sheltered by ASC (because the debenture was not cancelled). This means that the $30 repayment would have been a dividend and ASC would not have been reduced by $30. On the transition date, because the debenture is cancelled, the $70 repayment is sheltered by ASC of $70 and this leaves the company with $30 ASC (which may only be applied in future to amounts paid in respect of shares of the same class). Recommendation That the submissions be noted. Issue: Grandparenting of existing transactions Submission (KPMG, New Zealand Law Society, PricewaterhouseCoopers) Some taxpayers may have deliberately issued substituting debentures and changing the tax treatment/classification of the debentures part-way through their life could have adverse consequences for issuers and investors. Some of these taxpayers may have sought binding rulings. While tax law is always subject to change, holders and issuers may have taken long- term positions based on the tax treatment at the date they entered into the transaction. A savings provision is therefore warranted to preserve the existing tax treatment (as equity) if the taxpayer so desires. 225 Comment The substituting debenture rule is an anti-avoidance provision. It is slightly unusual for a taxpayer to structure into an anti-avoidance rule. However, the repeal is intended to be a taxpayer-favourable reform and was not intended to have any adverse consequences. Accordingly, officials support the elective grandparenting of existing transactions on the following basis:  The transaction must have been entered into before the introduction of the bill.  The transaction must have been subject to a binding ruling which would continue to apply in the absence of the repeal of the substituting debenture rule (that is, the facts disclosed in the binding ruling continue to be correct for the entire term of the transaction and all ruling conditions met).  An electing party must notify the Commissioner by 31 July 2014 that it elects to continue to treat the debentures as shares. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 226 WITHHOLDING TAX AND INFLATION-INDEXED BONDS Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We generally support the proposals in the bill to deal with technical issues in relation to the application of the RWT and NRWT rules to inflation-indexed instruments. However the Government should consider how workable rules could be introduced in other areas where there is a mismatch between income arising and cash flows. Comment Officials note that this submission raises an issue that would require further analysis and needs to be prioritised against other work on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Officials propose to discuss the priority of this work with the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 227 CLASSIFICATION OF MINING PERMITS AS REAL PROPERTY FOR TAX PURPOSES Clause 123(35) Issue: Whether the amendment creates uncertainty Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Including mining permits in a definition of ―real property‖ in the Income Tax Act 2007 may result in unforeseen ambiguity. It raises the question of whether mining permits are akin to other forms of real property and, in particular, akin to land. For example, section CT 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 defines a ―petroleum mining asset‖ as including a petroleum permit, but excluding ―land‖. One solution is to limit the extended definition of ―real property‖ (which includes mining permits) to the application of New Zealand’s double tax agreements (DTAs). Comment The amendment changes the definition of ―real property‖, which is a different definition (and concept) from ―land‖ (although land is a subset of real property). There should be no ambiguity with respect to the definition of ―petroleum mining asset‖ in section CT 7 because the term ―real property‖ is not used in that section; the relevant term used is ―land‖ (the definition of which does not refer to ―real property‖). Accordingly, the proposed amendment has no legislative effect on section CT 7. Additionally, CT 7 is very explicit about how ―petroleum mining asset‖ is defined – that is, petroleum mining assets include a ―petroleum permit‖ (which is one kind of real property), but does not include ―land‖ (which is another kind of real property). So the proposed change is not inconsistent with the definition in section CT 7. Limiting application of the amended definition to the application of New Zealand’s DTAs would mean that the amendment does not adequately address the problem identified because New Zealand’s DTAs refer to domestic law definitions to determine source-country taxing rights. Therefore, the definition would be somewhat circular (and potentially ambiguous) if the domestic law definition was only for the purpose of DTAs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 228 Issue: Classification of mining permits as real property for goods and services tax purposes Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Consideration should be given to introducing a similar clarification to the definition of ―land‖ for GST purposes. Comment The amendment is to the definition of ―real property‖, which is a different definition (and concept) from ―land‖. In addition, the change to the definition of ―real property‖ is for income tax purposes and the policy rationale does not necessarily translate to goods and services tax where ―land‖ has a meaning tailored to that tax type. Officials will further consider and engage with the submitter on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 229 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES AND PAYE Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) Reforms should be included in the bill that would allow employers to elect to treat benefits under share purchase agreements (commonly referred to as ―employee share schemes‖ (ESS)) as subject to PAYE, when it is practical to do so. Inland Revenue’s recent published position is that employee share scheme income is not subject to PAYE, and employees with such income must file IR 3 income tax returns. Employee share schemes have a productivity benefit to New Zealand by providing employees with a stake in the companies that they work for. When there is a tax consequence, the compliance obligations for employees should be minimised. Requiring employees to file IR 3 returns is not the most desirable outcome from a policy perspective as employees will often have no other tax filing requirement. The current law therefore brings more taxpayers into the filing system despite Inland Revenue actively trying to remove the need for individuals to file tax returns in many circumstances. Further, overall compliance with tax laws is likely to be reduced if employees are required to file IR 3 returns, as many are likely to be unaware of their tax obligations (and others may simply not comply). Greater compliance is assured when employers are able to deduct PAYE in relation to employee share scheme awards and the Government is assured of receiving the correct amount of tax. The Group is happy to work with officials to develop a policy response to this issue, noting that any such response should also ensure that past positions adopted by taxpayers are protected. Comment Officials agree in principle with the concerns raised by the Corporate Taxpayers Group. However, given the large number of taxpayers potentially affected by this change, it is more appropriate for any reforms to be included in a future tax bill to ensure the proposed solution is subject to full consultation in accordance with the generic tax policy process. If the suggested amendment was included in the bill at this stage, some taxpayers would not have the opportunity to consider the proposed solution and comment on it. Accordingly, officials recommend that the submission be declined for this tax bill, but that work commence on a solution for a future tax bill. Officials have discussed this approach with the submitter who is comfortable with it. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 230 ASSOCIATED PERSONS AND PERSON WITH A POWER OF APPOINTMENT OR REMOVAL Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) A person with a power of appointment or of removal of a trustee should be exempt from association with the trustee under section YB 11 (Trustee and person with power of appointment or removal) if they are subject to the professional code of conduct and disciplinary processes of an approved organisation. Section YB 11(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 prescribes that a trustee of a trust and a person with the power of appointment or removal of trustees in relation to the same trust are associated for tax purposes. An exclusion to this associated persons test was enacted by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. Among other requirements, the exemption applies to a person who is a ―member of an approved organisation‖. To be an approved organisation, the organisation’s natural person members must be subject to a professional code of conduct and to disciplinary processes in accordance with that code (among other requirements). There are circumstances in which this exemption does not operate as intended. Using the New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants (NZICA) as an example of an approved organisation, chartered accountancy practices can have partners who are members of NZICA and partners who are not members. A partner in a CA practice who is not a member of NZICA is still subject to NZICA’s code of ethics and disciplinary processes because they are part of a member firm. However, because they are not a member of NZICA themselves, they are not currently covered by the exclusion in section YB 11(2). It appears contrary to the policy for the exclusion that a partner who is not a member of NZICA but receives a power of appointment or removal of a trustee in their professional capacity is not covered by the exclusion. Comment Officials agree that the policy intention was to exclude from the association test those trustees acting in a professional capacity. The membership of a professional body was seen as an appropriate test as it ensured that those eligible for the exclusion would be limited and that a high standard would have to be met before the exclusion was available. Members of professional bodies such as the New Zealand Law Society and NZICA are the most likely trustees to be acting in a professional capacity. A non-member of NZICA working in a chartered accounting firm is as likely as an NZICA member to be a trustee in their professional capacity and should not be treated any differently for the purpose of the associated persons test. Therefore, the exemption should be extended to include not only members of an approved organisation, but also persons who are subject to the approved organisation’s code of ethics and disciplinary processes (provided the other requirements of the exclusion in section YB 11(2) are also met). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 231 EXTENDING THE TAX EXEMPTION FOR NON-RESIDENT OFFSHORE OIL RIG AND SEISMIC VESSEL OPERATORS Issue: Extending the exemption to other vessels Clause 30 Submission (Ernst & Young) The exemption should be extended to also cover vessels that operate electromagnetic surveying, not just seismic survey vessels. Comment The exemption, as drafted, applies to non-resident companies ―... operating a ship to provide seismic survey readings...‖. The submission suggests that the reference to seismic surveys does not adequately cover new forms of technology that provide a comparable or substitutable function – in particular, electromagnetic surveying. Officials agree that it is generally desirable for substitutable products to be given the same or similar tax treatment whenever possible. Officials also agree with the submitter that electromagnetic and seismic surveying are two techniques that achieve broadly the same result for the same purpose. The policy justifications for extending the exemption for seismic vessels appear to be equally applicable to electromagnetic vessels. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Modular rigs Submission (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) The exclusion for modular drilling rigs should only apply if the rig is in New Zealand for 183 days after December 2014. Comment The bill proposes to remove from the scope of the exemption modular drilling rigs, on the basis that these smaller rigs (that are designed to be installed on an existing platform) do not have the same high mobilisation and demobilisation costs associated with other rigs in operation. These were never intended to be covered by the exemption. 232 For these rigs, the exemption will expire on 31 December 2014. Officials consider this expiry date to be appropriate. Operators of these rigs have had plenty of notice of the intended change. Given they were never intended to be within the exemption, effectively extending the exemption for a further 183 days appears unnecessarily concessionary. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Prospecting activities Submission (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) Section CW 57 should be redrafted to explicitly cover ―prospecting‖ with seismic vessels. Comment Officials consider that the words ―identifying and developing‖ are appropriate. These words have always been used to define the scope of the exemption and to change them now may cause unnecessary confusion. Subject to the earlier recommended changes regarding electromagnetic surveying vessels and modular rigs, the policy is to roll over the exemption – not to change the relevant activities it applies to. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Extended exemption Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The extension of the exemption is supported. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte). The extension should be made permanent. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) Comment Officials consider that the extension of the exemption will provide the industry with a considerable degree of certainty in the medium term. The appropriateness or otherwise of a permanent exemption can be revisited at the expiry of the proposed extension. Recommendation That the submissions be noted. 233 UNDERGROUND GAS STORAGE Clauses 17, 18 and 36 Issue: Scope of the proposed provision Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) The legislation should make it clear that the proposed rules do not apply to the storage of unprocessed gas. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants); or instances where gas is reinjected as part of field management or depletion. (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) The appropriate reference is to ―royalty paid gas under a mining permit that has been issued or amended under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 for the purposes of underground gas storage.‖ (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) Comment Inland Revenue officials have discussed this matter with officials from Resource Markets at the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, who consider the definition of ―underground gas storage facility‖ as defined in section 2 of the Crown Minerals Act (as currently used in the draft bill) is appropriate and there should not be any confusion in practice by what is covered by the proposed provision. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Grandparenting existing arrangements Submission (Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand) Allowing owners of existing facilities to continue present treatment would reduce compliance costs. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Grandparenting arrangements in the proposed legislation are appropriate. (Petroleum Exploration and Production Association of New Zealand, Deloitte) Recommendation That the submission be noted. 234 OVER-CREDITING OF IMPUTATION CREDITS IN EXCESS OF FIF INCOME Submission (BDO Wellington Ltd) Section CV 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007 should not include imputation credits already taxed under the FIF rules. Alternatively, section CV 19 should not be enacted at all. Comment Section CV 19 was recently enacted by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. It was part of the amendments designed to address a mismatch arising under the tax rules in relation to imputed dividends paid by Australian companies under the trans-Tasman imputation rules. This mismatch arose because imputation credits were calculated on the basis of the dividend paid but income tax arises only on the foreign investment fund (FIF) income. Officials agree there is double-counting of imputation credits when the comparative value or deemed rate of return FIF calculation methods are used. Officials agree that section CV 19 should be amended to prevent the double-counting of imputation credits in these cases. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 235 WHETHER A TRUSTEE OF A HEAD-TRUST IS A SETTLOR OF A SUB- TRUST Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section HC 28 of the Income Tax Act 2007 lists a number of activities of a person that result in that person being treated as a settlor of a trust for tax purposes. A person is treated as a settlor of a sub-trust if they are a settlor of a head-trust and a trustee of that head-trust settles property on the sub-trust. However, by virtue of section HC 27(2) of the Act, the trustee of the head-trust may be treated as a settlor of the sub-trust. It is therefore arguable that the trustee of a head-trust could be treated as a settlor of the sub- trust, as they are transferring value to the sub-trust. Section HC 27(2) should be amended so that it does not apply to treat a trustee as a settlor in circumstances where the trustee transfers value to a sub-trust as a result of a settlor of a head- trust settling a new trust. Comment Officials note that this issue is primarily related to foreign trusts. A trust is a foreign trust in relation to a distribution if no settlor is resident in New Zealand. Foreign trusts are not taxed on their foreign-sourced trustee income. The review of the tax treatment of foreign trusts will be included in the Government’s tax policy work programme as part of the work on base erosion and profit shifting. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 236 TAXATION OF LIFE INSURANCE BUSINESS – MATCHING EXPENDITURE TO INCOME Submissions (Partners Life) Partners Life is seeking a legislative change to restore its tax position to what it was before the enactment of an amendment to the financial arrangement rules made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. The submitter has proposed two ways of achieving this outcome (discussed below). Comment Changes made to the financial arrangement rules by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 were directed at countering arrangements that sought to re-characterise capital expenditure as revenue expenditure using a compliance cost- savings measure in those rules. The change prevented taxpayers from making an election that an ―excepted financial arrangement‖ is a ―financial arrangement‖ for short-term agreements for the sale and purchase of property. Officials had not anticipated (and could not reasonably be expected to anticipate) that the change would have an impact on taxpayers seeking to spread expenditure that would ordinarily be classified as being on revenue account, such as commission expenses incurred in relation to the sale of life insurance policies. Practice in the life insurance industry is that such expenditure is deducted in full (that is, not spread) when the expenditure is ―incurred‖ for tax purposes. Inland Revenue accepts this practice. Partners Life has adopted an alternative interpretation and spreads life insurance brokerage commission expenses against future premium income to better match expenditure and income for taxation purposes. A benefit of slowing the recognition of expenditure is that the taxpayer does not generate a large volume of tax losses (created when deductions exceed taxable income), when in fact in commercial and accounting terms it is profitable. This outcome is of concern when the losses could be lost through the operation of the loss continuity rules given that Partners Life is a start-up company and undertaking on-going capital-raising. Partners Life submits that there are two options to restore its tax interpretation; either:  restore the drafting of the relevant provision previously relied on by Partners Life to match its deduction against income – section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007; or  provide a new set of rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 that would allow, at the insurer’s election, commissions to be spread. Officials have considered the implications of both options. 237 The first option is within the scope of the bill as it already contains changes to the financial arrangement rules. Given the impact the change to section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has had on Partners Life and the fact that it was unanticipated, officials consider there is a case for restoring in some limited form the scope and application of the election permitted under section EW 8 (before it is was amended by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013), subject to some modification to deal with the base integrity concerns that officials had with the original section. Officials recommend that section EW 8 be amended, with retrospective effect, to restore an election allowing taxpayers to treat certain ―excepted financial arrangements‖ as ―financial arrangements‖ on the condition that the expenditure was on revenue account (that is, it does not rely on the election allowed by section EW 8 to deem the expenditure as on revenue account). This condition is intended to address the policy concern behind the amendment made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. The proposal is designed to restore Partners Life to the situation before the change. This should not be taken as a comment on the interpretation taken by Partners Life, which is a function of the application of the law to the taxpayer’s specific fact situation. The change allows Partners Life to prepare tax returns on the same basis and relying on the same statutory provisions that it used before the amendment of section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This would be consistent with Partners Life’s financial reporting. For tax purposes, spreading brokerage commission expense is out of step with industry practice, but of itself is not objectionable from a policy perspective. Officials have consulted with the submitter about the proposal. Partners Life agrees that the suggested solution meets the concerns raised in its submission. There are no direct fiscal consequences arising from accepting the submission. Officials have also considered Partners Life’s second option, which involves adding a new set of rules to the Income Tax Act 2007 to facilitate spreading life insurance brokerage commissions. Officials consider that this option, while conceptually correct, has wider implications for the life insurance industry and, in our view, is not a change that should be made without further or more considered consultation with the industry using the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. The amendment to section EW 8 made by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 be repealed and the election permitted under section EW 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007 be restored, provided that the expenditure to be spread is on revenue account (that is, it does not rely on the election allowed by section EW 8 to deem the expenditure as on revenue account). 238 239 Remedial matters 240 241 GST REMEDIALS Issue: Retirement villages and rest homes Clause 161 Submission (The Selwyn Foundation, KPMG) The amendment to the ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ definitions in conjunction with the proposed ―wash-up rule‖ will require retirement villages and rest homes to refund input tax deductions claimed on acquiring properties during the period between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2015. These deductions were claimed in good faith owing to a previous change to the dwelling definition in 2011. It is recommended an amendment be made that would either apply the dwelling amendments to:  supplies of goods and services on properties acquired/constructed/developed from 1 April 2015; or  goods and services supplied from 1 April 2015, and input tax deductions claimed on construction costs incurred before 1 April 2015 should not be repaid under the current apportionment, or wash-up adjustment; or  goods and services supplied from 1 April 2015, and a ―savings‖ provision should be introduced whereby output tax previously paid is taken into account when performing the wash-up adjustment. Comment This issue arises due to the interaction of two separate legislative changes in the bill:  The first change is an amendment to the ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ definitions which is intended to restore the pre-1 April 2011 GST-exempt treatment of residential units in retirement villages and rest homes. Officials understand the majority of the retirement village industry is supportive of this change as exemption was always the intended outcome.  The second change is a ―wash-up‖ rule which will require taxpayers who have applied the apportionment rules to account for any unclaimed input tax or pay output tax when the use of the asset changes exclusively either to taxable or non-taxable use. The submitters have pointed out that the amendment to restore the exempt treatment of residential units in retirement villages and rest homes will trigger the wash-up rule. This would only arise for those taxpayers that have been treating the supply of these residential units as taxable from 1 April 2011. Officials understand it is only likely to affect a small number of taxpayers. For these taxpayers the application of the GST apportionment rules and the proposed ―wash-up rule‖ will primarily negatively affect them by requiring them to repay input tax deductions claimed after 1 April 2011 on GST incurred in acquiring residential units and related expenditure. 242 Considering these taxpayers claimed these deductions and made commercial decisions during this period based on a legitimate interpretation of the law, it seems appropriate to provide some form of relief. Officials recommend giving affected taxpayers 16 the choice whether to continue to treat the supply of residential units in retirement villages and rest homes as taxable. This approach recognises that affected taxpayers have made long-term commercial decisions on the basis that the supply of these residential units would be taxable. However, we recommend that taxable treatment would only apply to residential units acquired before 1 April 2015; the supply of residential units acquired after that date would be exempt. Alternatively, affected taxpayers could decide to return to exempt treatment. For these taxpayers, officials recommend the introduction of a ―savings‖ provision that would turn off the application of the proposed wash-up. These taxpayers would not be required to return input tax deductions in one lump-sum payment. Instead, the regular apportionment rules would apply to take into account the change of use brought about by the dwelling amendment, thereby allowing the payments to be spread. For taxpayers that have been treating the supply of residential units as taxable during the period between 1 April 2011 and 31 March 2015, output tax paid would not be refunded and input tax deduction claimed and expensed during that period would not need to be returned. These proposals relate solely to supplies made during that period. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Dwelling definition Clause 161 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) Amendments to the ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ definitions deal only with the uncertainty surrounding the GST treatment of residential units in retirement villages and rest homes. However, uncertainty still exists in respect of the GST treatment of similar types of independent living units such as student accommodation and accommodation for people with intellectual or physical disabilities. This should be rectified in the current bill or the next tax bill. Comment Officials do not agree with the submissions. Similar submissions were made, specifically related to student accommodation, when the definitions of ―dwelling‖ and ―commercial dwelling‖ were amended in 2011. It was considered preferable for the dwelling definitions to describe the nature of the accommodation rather than the types of occupant of the premises. 16 Taxpayers that have been treating the supply of residential units as taxable for GST purposes from 1 April 2011. 243 This approach better achieves the policy objective which is to prescribe exempt treatment to the provision of accommodation that is an economic equivalent to owner-occupied homes. Officials still consider this argument to be valid and that the amendment suggested by submitters would be an undesirable departure from the current approach. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Requirement to be registered Clause 169 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The scope of the amendment to section 21HB of the Goods and Services Tax Act (GST) should be extended to include those who are already GST-registered. The amendment allows suppliers affected by the 1 April 2011 changes to the ―dwelling‖ definition the option of not including a commercial dwelling as part of their broader taxable activity. The amendment as proposed will only apply to taxpayers who are not GST-registered, but the issue more commonly arises for those individuals who are already registered in relation to other activities. These taxpayers are less able to structure their affairs to limit the impact of the previous law change. However, taxpayers whose newly defined commercial dwelling would constitute a ―taxable activity‖ in its own right should not be given relief. Accordingly, an exclusion would be appropriate when the rental income exceeds the GST registration threshold. Comment Officials agree that the suggested amendment to section 21HB, as currently drafted, would have limited application as it would only apply when the change in definition caused a person to exceed the $60,000 GST registration threshold. We agree with the submission that the scope should be broadened so that it applies to persons who are already GST-registered. These people would not be required to account for GST on their newly defined commercial dwellings so long as their rental income from those dwellings is below the $60,000 threshold. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 244 Issue: Wash-up rule – definition of actual deduction Clause 168 Submission (Tax Team) The definition of ―actual deduction‖ in the proposed ―wash-up‖ rule should refer to adjustments made up until the end of the adjustment period when taxpayers are required to perform the wash-up calculation. Comment The proposed ―wash-up‖ rule would require taxpayers who have applied the apportionment rules to account for any unclaimed input tax or pay output tax when the use of the asset changes exclusively to either taxable or non-taxable. To qualify for the ―wash-up‖, taxpayers need to sustain the 100 percent change-of-use from the adjustment period in which the use changes and the following adjustment period (up to two years). Officials agree with the suggested amendment. Currently, the definition of ―actual deduction‖ only includes adjustments made up to the date on which the use was changed. However, taxpayers would be required to make adjustments up until the date the wash-up was required to be carried out, which could be up to two taxable periods after the change of use. To achieve an accurate wash-up calculation, the actual deductions made after the date the use changed should also be taken into account. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Wash-up rule – registration after acquiring goods and services Clause 168 Submission (KPMG) If a person, or partnership, becomes registered after acquiring goods and services, the taxpayer must wait until the first adjustment period in order to claim change-of-use calculations. This method of calculation would result in a timing delay for the taxpayer and is inconsistent with the position for a taxpayer who is already registered. It is recommended that the adjustment should be made when the taxpayer is registered and first uses goods or services to make taxable supplies. 245 Comment Officials disagree with the submission. To qualify for the ―wash-up‖, taxpayers need to sustain the 100 percent change-of-use from the adjustment period in which the use changes and the following adjustment period (up to two years). This time period is required to demonstrate a genuine change of use and must be demonstrated whether or not the taxpayer has just registered for GST, or has always been registered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Procurement of a lease Clause 165 Submission (Real Estate Institute of New Zealand, PricewaterhouseCoopers) The bill amends section 11(8D) so that a payment to procure a lease is subject to the GST zero- rating of land provisions. The application of this amendment should be clarified, specifically whether the amendment is intended to capture payments in relation to a new commercial lease agreement in the absence of any transfer of business. Comment The proposed addition to section 11(8D) is intended to apply only to situations when a third party has paid to procure an existing lease (such as in a business sale). Officials agree that a further amendment should be made to section 11(8D) to clarify this policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section 11(8D) – drafting suggestions Clause 165 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) There should be no ―if‖ at the start of section 11(8D)(b)(ii) and the circular wording of section 11(8D)(c) should be removed. 246 Comment Officials agree with the submission. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Surrenders and assignments of land Clause 165 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment to the zero-rating of land rules should be designed to ensure that only surrenders and assignments of interests of land are subject to the zero-rating of land rules. Any other surrender and assignment (for example, contractual releases) that do not involve transfer or disposals of interests in land should be governed by ordinary GST principles. Comment Officials agree with the policy approach outlined in this submission but we consider the draft legislation is sufficiently clear to achieve the correct policy outcome. Further guidance will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin to be published after enactment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Surrender of an interest in land Clause 165 Submission (KPMG) The scope of what is a ―surrender of an interest in land‖ contained in section 11(8D) is unclear. A surrender of an interest in land should include:  payments from a tenant to a landlord to obtain the landlord’s consent for the tenant’s surrender of the lease; and  payments from a landlord to a tenant for surrender of the tenant’s interest in the land. 247 The phrase ―surrender of an interest in land‖ should be defined to ensure both of the above examples can be zero-rated. Comment Officials agree with the submission in part. The policy intent of section 11(8D) is to capture both types of surrender payments as described by the submitter. Officials will consider whether the current wording of section 11(8D) achieves this and recommend an amendment in a later tax bill if required. Recommendation That the submission be declined subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Other rights and obligations in respect of land Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Consideration should be given to providing further guidance on the treatment of certain other rights and obligations where their classification as ―land‖ is unclear. Examples include mining permits and transferable fishing quota. Comment The submission does not specifically relate to an amendment in the bill. However, officials will further consider and engage with the submitter on this issue. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Deemed supply of land on disposal Clause 163 Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers, Offen Advisors Ltd, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, Deloitte) A number of submissions have been received on the amendment to section 5(16) (Deemed taxable supply of land on disposal). These include:  The amendment is not necessary as the current law is adequate.  The amendment would have the effect of a capital gains tax. 248  Taxpayers should not be required to account for output tax when selling a private asset.  The output tax payable should be capped to the input tax claimed.  GST-registered persons should have the option to choose not to claim input tax on land in order to avoid the payment of output tax when the land is sold. This option should also be available under the equivalent rules for mixed-use assets.  The meaning of ―course and furtherance‖ should be clarified.  The relationship between the amendment to sections 5(16) and 14(1)(d) (exempt supply of a dwelling), 11(1)(mb) (zero-rating of land), and 21FB (the proposed new wash-up rule) should be clarified. Comment The purpose of the amendment to section 5(16) is to address an avoidance concern where taxpayers can change the use of an asset before sale to avoid the application of output tax. The amendment would require taxpayers to pay output tax on the sale of land when any input tax deduction had been claimed in respect of the acquisition of the land. Submitters have raised valid concerns over the practical application of the proposed amendment, particularly the GST implications of selling essentially private land where a relatively small input tax deduction had been claimed in the past. Officials consider the new wash-up rule and the general anti-avoidance provision will address many of the concerns underlying the amendment to section 5(16). Therefore, officials recommend the amendment to section 5(16) be removed from the bill at this time. Officials will further engage with taxpayers about how we could address the avoidance concern while also taking into account the practical concerns raised by submitters. At the same time we will also consider whether similar issues arise under the recently enacted mixed-use asset GST rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Zero-rated services supplied to non-residents Clause 166 Submissions (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants, KPMG) In the proposed section 11A(3B) the words ―not directly connected with‖ should be replaced with ―not directly in connection with‖. The phrase ―not directly in connection with‖ is better understood in law. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Guidance should also be given as to when a presence is not directly connected with the supply. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) 249 The term ―directly connected with the supply‖ needs to be defined to prevent uncertainty over the application of this measure. (KPMG) Comment Officials agree with the submission that the wording of proposed section 11A(3B) should be amended to the better understood phrase ―not directly in connection with‖. Officials understand that, in practice, it could be unclear whether a non-resident’s presence in New Zealand would be regarded as not directly connected with the supply. However, we do not think the term should be defined; instead such a determination would depend largely on the facts of each case. The policy rationale behind the amendment is to deal with situations when it is unreasonable for the supplier to be aware that the non-resident is in New Zealand during the time the services are performed, and therefore, whether the services should be zero-rated. Further guidance will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin if the proposed amendment is enacted. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part. Issue: Scope of the hire purchase definition Clauses 123 and 180 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed amendment to the definition of ―hire purchase agreement‖ is more than a mere clarification; it broadens the definition to include those agreements where a purchase is considered but not ―expressly contemplated‖. Comment Officials agree that for some taxpayers the amendment may require them to change GST systems and procedures. However, the amendment is required to address a drafting error which arguably means a person’s upfront agreement to purchase the goods is required in order for an arrangement to be a hire purchase agreement. This interpretation is inconsistent with the original policy intent so an amendment is necessary to ensure the law achieves the correct policy outcome. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 250 Issue: Apportionment rules Submissions (BDO Wellington Ltd) The various threshold rules in the GST apportionment rules should provide for the aggregation of the costs of goods and services. Secondly, if the GST transitional rules require the ―old apportionment rules‖ to still be used for goods and services, the ―old apportionment rules‖ should also continue to be applied to further costs incurred in relation to the same goods and services. Comment These submissions do not relate to any provision in the bill. However, officials will further consider and engage with the submitter on these matters. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Agency rules Submission (Deloitte) An amendment to the agency rules should be made to ensure there is consistency between when an agent acts for the seller and an agent acts for the purchaser. Comment The submission does not relate to any provision in the bill. However, officials will consider this issue for inclusion in a future GST omnibus consultation paper. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 251 Issue: Credit and debit notes Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment is required to fix a drafting oversight in the credit and debit note provision in relation to land which has been incorrectly standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated. Comment Section 25 relates to the issuing of a credit or debit note when GST has been accounted for incorrectly. A remedial amendment is required to section 25(4) to ensure that when the supply of land has been incorrectly standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated, the recipient of the supply must correct any input tax claim in relation to that supply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Zero-rating tooling costs Submission (Matter raised by officials) A remedial amendment is required to ensure services that are carried out on tools can be zero- rated when the tools are used in New Zealand solely to manufacture goods that will be exported. Comment The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 extended the application of the zero-rating rules to tools used in New Zealand solely to manufacture goods that will be for export and supplied to a recipient who is a non-resident and not GST-registered. A remedial amendment is required to ensure that when services are carried out on tools that are to be zero-rated under the new provision, the services can also be zero-rated. This is consistent with the treatment of services in relation to exports more generally and the policy intent of GST neutrality in cross-border trade. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 252 Issue: Non-resident registration rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Asset Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 introduced rules under which non-resident businesses can register for New Zealand GST and claim input tax deductions for GST incurred. This ensures that GST is neutral for these businesses in the same way as it is for domestic businesses. The new rules take effect from 1 April 2014. Officials have identified a potential fiscal risk with the design of these new non-resident registration rules: The new rules may enable registered non-residents to sell high-value goods to New Zealand private consumers without the net imposition of GST. This could be achieved by the non-resident treating themselves as the ―importer‖ of the goods so that the GST liability falls on the non-resident rather than on the final consumer. The non- resident is then able to claim an input tax deduction for the GST incurred on importation. Because the goods were offshore at the time of supply, GST would not be required to be returned on the sale, therefore no net GST will be collected despite a final consumer receiving the imported good. Comment Officials recommend an amendment be made to prevent GST-registered non-residents from claiming input tax deductions in relation to GST levied by the New Zealand Customs Service. Instead, when the non-resident acts as an ―importer‖, the recipient of the good will be treated as if they had paid the GST and will be entitled to an input tax credit for the GST if they are GST- registered and receiving the goods as part of their taxable activity. It is recommended that the amendment applies from 1 April 2014, the same date the new registration rules come into effect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 253 Issue: Wash-up rule Clause 168 Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment to the proposed ―wash-up‖ rule is required to ensure the timing of the wash-up occurs at the end of the second adjustment period after the use has changed. Comment The proposed ―wash-up‖ rule requires taxpayers who have applied the apportionment rules to account for any unclaimed input tax or pay output tax when the use of the asset changes exclusively to either taxable or non-taxable use. To qualify for the ―wash-up‖, taxpayers need to sustain the 100 percent change of use from the adjustment period in which the use changes and the following adjustment period (up to two years). As currently drafted, taxpayers are required to carry out the wash-up calculation at the end of the third adjustment period following the change of use. This was not the intended policy outcome; instead, taxpayers should be required to carry out the wash-up calculation at the end of the second adjustment period following the change of use. Officials recommend an amendment be made to ensure the correct policy outcome is achieved. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 254 CFC REMEDIALS Issue: Foreign exchange gains and losses on liabilities Clause 74 Submissions (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) In many cases a company’s accounts will report foreign exchange gains and losses relating to both assets and liabilities. To reduce compliance costs, the bill includes an amendment which allows taxpayers to use an aggregate figure when applying the active business test. As currently drafted, the amendment applies more broadly than intended. It would capture other types of gains and losses such as gains and losses on derecognition of a liability and changes in the reported value of liabilities. It should be limited to foreign exchange gains or losses. Comment Officials agree that the amendment that allows taxpayers to include gains and losses on liabilities in the active business test should be limited to foreign exchange gains and losses. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: CFCs with offshore branches should be able to join test groups Submission (Deloitte, Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The CFC rules allow taxpayers to group multiple CFCs together for the purposes of calculating the active business test. There are rules which limit the CFCs that can be included in the group, one of which says that each CFC must have a ―taxed CFC connection‖ with the same country or territory. The ―taxed CFC connection‖ essentially requires that the CFC is taxed and resident in the country it is based in and not taxed or resident in any other country. This has the effect of barring any CFC that has an offshore branch from being included in a test group. The issue is whether this has a disproportionate effect on CFCs that have minor business presences in other countries. The submission proposes allowing these CFCs to form test groups despite the presence of offshore branches. Any active income earned by the offshore branch would be disregarded in the active income test. 255 Comment It is not unusual for the operating company to have an offshore branch in another jurisdiction which may, for example, comprise a small sales team. The rules determining whether a branch exists are not clear cut, and can vary from country to country, so it is possible that a CFC may unintentionally establish an offshore branch and unexpectedly fall outside of the test group rules. Officials agree that this may have a disproportionate effect on the taxpayer’s position and the proposed amendment should include two additional safeguards to prevent abuse. First, the CFC with the offshore branch must be a non-attributing active CFC in its own right. This eliminates the possibility of passive income earned through a branch being sheltered by active income earned in the country the CFC is based in. Secondly, the anti-abuse provisions in sections GB 15B and 15C may need to be amended so that they also cover arrangements/supplies between offshore branches and head offices that have been entered into/made with the intent of gaining the active exemption. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Application date for relocation of apportioned funding income Clause 70 Submission (Ernst & Young) The bill relocates an existing adjustment for apportioned funding income from sections EX 20C to 20B. This amendment should not apply retrospectively as it could affect a taxpayer’s active business test results. Comment Applying the amendment retrospectively could potentially mean that a CFC may now pass an active business test that it would have previously failed. Because taxpayers do not have to pay tax on profits from a CFC which passes an active business test, this will usually be taxpayer- friendly. In other words, if the amendment applied prospectively it would be more likely to disadvantage taxpayers. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 256 Issue: Section DB 55 should not be repealed Clause 43 Submission (Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Section DB 55 should not be repealed as the repeal will not have a material fiscal impact but would lead to uncertainty and compliance costs from having to apportion expenses between exempt and assessable income. Some submitters have also suggested that the repeal could create ―black hole‖ expenditure which is contrary to the Government’s recent work on reducing ―black hole‖ expenditure. Comment As a general principle, expenses can only be deducted for tax purposes if they are incurred in earning taxable income. In other words, if the expenses relate to income which is exempt from tax, no deduction can be claimed. When a New Zealand company receives a dividend from a foreign company, the dividend is exempt from income tax. Section DB 55 allows deductions despite the fact that the dividends are exempt from income tax. The rationale for this, is that before 2009, the dividends were subject to a special levy, known as ―foreign dividend payment‖ or ―FDP‖ which was equivalent to income tax. In 2009 there was a major reform of New Zealand’s international tax rules. This reform was designed to reduce tax barriers on New Zealand businesses that expand offshore. It did this by exempting most types of income that businesses earned through foreign subsidiaries. As part of this reform all tax on foreign dividends paid to New Zealand companies, including FDP was removed. In the course of implementing the 2009 reforms, the need to repeal section DB 55 was overlooked. We are now seeking to repeal it as part of the current bill. Maintaining section DB 55 in the absence of FDP would be contrary to general tax principles of not allowing deductions which relate to exempt income (now that the dividends are truly exempt). It would effectively be a tax concession or subsidy. There would be fiscal risks associated with providing deductions in cases where the resulting income will not be taxed, as these could be used as building blocks for tax planning arrangements which shift income offshore or which generate artificial losses to shelter other forms of income. The repeal of section DB 55 does not prevent deductions for head office expenses that relate to subsidiaries. These could still be claimed if they satisfy the ―general permission‖ in section DA 1, which applies for all other types of expenses. 257 It is a common commercial practice for head offices to charge their subsidiaries for head office expenses and, in such cases, a deduction should be available under the general permission. In other cases, apportionment of expenses between exempt and taxable income may be necessary. However, the compliance costs associated with apportionment are unlikely to be significant as taxpayers already have discretion to make fair and reasonable apportionments. Taxpayers are frequently required to apportion expenses in many other situations, such as when they relate to receiving an exempt government grant, or an untaxed capital gain. There is no generally agreed definition of ―black hole‖ expenditure. However it usually refers to expenses incurred in an activity that was expected to generate taxable income, but which cannot be claimed (either immediately or as a depreciable asset) as the activity fails to produce any income. This is not the case with section DB 55 as this provision specifically relates to expenses incurred in deriving exempt income. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Repeal of section DB 55 application date Clause 43 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The application date of the repeal of section DB 55 should be the date of introduction of the bill to Parliament in order to preserve tax positions taken by taxpayers who have relied on the provision. Comment As currently drafted, the repeal of section DB 55 includes a ―savings‖ provision which means it does not apply to tax positions taken in tax returns filed before the date the bill was introduced to Parliament (22 November 2013). This savings provision deals with the concern raised by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 258 Issue: Repeal of DB 55 savings provision Clause 43 Submission (The Whyte Group) The repeal of section DB 55 has a ―savings‖ provision whereby it does not affect tax positions taken in tax returns that have been filed before the date the bill was introduced to Parliament. This savings provision fails to accommodate taxpayers who have applied section DB 55 during their 2013 or 2014 income years, but had not yet filed their returns for these years as these returns are not due until after November 2013. This means the repeal could have a retrospective effect of denying deductions that have already been taken for these income years in cases when the relevant tax return has not yet been filed. Comment Officials agree that the savings provision should be extended to deal with the concern raised by the submitter. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Nexus requirement under section DB 55 Clause 43 Submission (The Whyte Group) The current nexus test provided by section DB 55 is too narrow as it only allows deductions that are directly incurred in deriving the exempt dividends. This creates uncertainty over whether management fees could be deducted under this section. In contrast, the general permission for deductions in section DA 1 has two limbs. It allows deductions for expenditure incurred in earning income and expenditure incurred in carrying on a business of deriving income. Section DB 55 should be broadened so that it matches both limbs of the test provided by the general permission in section DA 1. 259 Comment Section DB 55 was introduced in 2004 because at that time, foreign dividends were subject to a special levy, known as a ―foreign dividend payment‖ or ―FDP‖, which was equivalent to income tax. The 2004 Official’s report on the Taxation (Annual Rates, Venture Capital and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 17 which introduced the amendment explained that the policy intention was to allow a deduction for expenditure incurred by a company in deriving the foreign dividend, to the extent to which it was subject to FDP. We note that FDP only arises when a dividend is actually received. This suggests that a relatively narrow nexus could have been intended. In contrast, management fees may be charged irrespective of whether a dividend is received (for example, the management fee may relate to making an investment in a company that never pays dividends). Because the existing nexus requirement in section DB 55 appears to achieve the original policy objective, officials do not think there is a strong case for retrospectively broadening the nexus test. This is particularly true with respect to periods after 2009, after which FDP no longer applied to the dividends. This meant the original rationale for allowing deductions under section DB 55 was no longer required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removing Australian unit trusts from the Australian exemption Clauses 75 and 76 Submission (KPMG) The amendment to remove Australian unit trusts from the CFC and FIF exemptions in sections EX 22 and EX 35 is not a remedial item. It should be omitted from the bill and be subject to a proper consultation process. Comment The exemptions from the CFC and FIF rules in sections EX 22 and EX 35 are based on the assumption that Australian companies generally face similar tax rules and a similar level of tax to New Zealand companies. Australian unit trusts are not taxed as companies in Australia, and investments made through an Australian unit trusts often face a lower rate of tax than Australian companies. 17 http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2004-or-arvcmp/overview. 260 For this reason, the policy intention at the time of the 2009 international tax reforms was that Australian unit trusts should not be able to qualify for the Australian exemption. The policy of excluding Australian unit trusts was explicitly expressed, on page 49 of the 2009 Official’s Report on the Taxation (International Tax, Life Insurance, and Remedial Matters) Bill which introduced the Australian exemption. The change in the current bill ensures that the law achieves the original policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date for removing Australian unit trusts from the Australian exemption Clauses 75 and 76 Submissions (Vital Healthcare Property Limited, The Whyte Group) As currently drafted, the removal of Australian unit trusts from the Australian exemption applies from the 2014–15 income year. This could have a retrospective effect for some taxpayers who will have begun their 2014–15 year before the bill is enacted. To prevent this retrospective effect, a savings provision should be provided for taxpayers who have applied for a binding ruling before the date the bill was introduced (22 November 2013). The application date for taxpayers who did not apply for a binding ruling should be deferred by one year, until the start of the 2015–16 income year. (Vital Healthcare Property Limited) The application date should be for income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014:  Previous amendments to section EX 22 have been by reference to this 1 July date.  The Australian unit trusts which are affected by the provision typically have a 30 June balance date.  Other proposed amendments to the CFC rules contained in the bill also have application dates that refer to 1 July. (The Whyte Group) Comment We agree that the application date should be amended to apply to income years beginning on or after 1 July 2014. Because the bill is expected to be enacted before July, this should reduce the possibility of a retrospective effect, while still providing taxpayers with certainty about when the amendment will take effect. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. 261 Issue: Further guidance material on CFC remedials Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Inland Revenue should publish examples of the application of the CFC remedial changes in a Tax Information Bulletin. Comment Officials agree that the remedial changes are complex and that further guidance material, including examples, will be provided in a Tax Information Bulletin following enactment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Indirect interests in FIFs Clauses 78 and 80 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The bill attempts to clarify the rules that apply to interests in FIFs that are held indirectly through another FIF or CFC. However, as currently drafted, the proposed amendments will not entirely resolve the uncertainty and the proposed drafting needs further consideration and refinement. In addition, if the indirect interest in a FIF is minor or immaterial it should be disregarded for the purposes of these rules. Comment Officials consider that the current drafting achieves the intended policy result. We will, however, discuss the specific drafting suggestions with the bill’s drafters. With regard to the submission on disregarding indirect interests in FIFs when these are minor or immaterial, we note that this would have wider policy implications which would need to be further considered and consulted on. For these reasons it would not be appropriate to advance this suggestion in the current bill but we will consider this issue as part of our future policy work on CFCs and FIFs. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 262 Issue: Extending the on-lending concessions and exemptions for group funding Submission (Matter raised by officials) The CFC rules should be amended so that the on-lending concession and exemptions that apply to certain interest payments also apply to those dividends that are taxed like interest payments. Comment The CFC rules generally treat dividends from certain types of shares (deductible and fixed-rate shares) in the same way as interest on debt. This is because these shares have debt-like characteristics and are highly substitutable for debt. Taxpayers have identified two areas where the rules for these shares are less favourable than the equivalent rules that apply to debt. This can lead to the same income being taxed twice. Under the current CFC rules, a CFC that borrows money and then lends that money on to an associated CFC is able to claim a full deduction of any expenses incurred (the on-lending concession). There is also an exemption for interest income that a CFC receives from lending money to an associated active CFC that is located in the same country. Officials recommend that this on-lending concession and exemption be extended so they also apply to deductible and fixed-rate shares. Because this amendment is taxpayer-friendly and consistent with the over-arching policy treatment of the affected shares, we recommend the amendments apply retrospectively to the date these rules were first introduced. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 263 MIXED-USE ASSET REMEDIALS Issue: Support for remedial amendments Clauses 47 to 49 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants supports the proposed remedial amendments contained in clauses 47 to 49 of the bill. Comment Officials note the support for the amendments which ensure the mixed-use asset rules operate in accordance with the policy intention and correct minor errors in legislative examples. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Minor technical issues with remedial amendments Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The drafting of the amendment to section DG 6 should be amended to make it clear that paragraph (b) is a continuation of the section. Comment The drafting convention is to leave the section as originally drafted – including paragraphs (a) and (b) – so the history of the provision is clear; accordingly the section in the principal Act will read: ―Despite section YB 3(1), for the purposes of this subpart, a company and a person other than a company are associated persons if— (a) repealed; or (b) the person’s share in the company gives them a right to use the asset.‖ Recommendation That the submission be declined. 264 Submission (Ernst & Young) Repealing and replacing section DZ 21(2) arguably repeals the example, it should be clarified that the example remains. Comment An example in the legislation is not part of the legislation, it is an interpretation aid. Therefore, replacing a subsection does not repeal the following example as it is a stand-alone item and not ―attached‖ to the particular subsection. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Further mixed-use asset amendments Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The legislation was rushed and is in need of further remedial attention. Comment Officials note NZICA’s concern and will continue to work with NZICA (and other stakeholders) to address remedial issues with the rules. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: In certain circumstances, the asset value is too high for land Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Leased assets Where a mixed-use asset is leased, the valuation of that mixed-use asset should reflect the degree of ownership interest in the asset. Where a close company seeks to claim interest deductions in respect of a mixed-use asset, the company must first determine the amount of its debt value and its asset value to determine the amount of interest it is allowed to claim. 265 The ―asset value‖ for land, including an improvement to land, is the amount given by the later of either its most recent capital value or annual value (as set by the relevant local authority), or its cost on acquisition (or market value, if the transaction involves an associated person). If a crib/batch is on leased land, the capital value greatly overstates the value to the lessee as the lessee does not own the land. Therefore, there is a greater likelihood that the asset value will result in either:  a denial of an interest deduction to the company; and  a denial of an interest deduction to a shareholder. The quarantining provisions in section DG 16(1), which apply to all taxpayers, also require amendment for valuation purposes when an asset is a leased asset. Two new rules are required for leased assets: 1. a rule that applies if there is a lease between associated persons and prevents ―gaming‖ of the rules in such situations; and 2. a valuation rule for leased assets where the parties are not associated. Two activities on a single title The legislation also requires amendment to provide for apportionment when a single legal property title covers two separate activities and the mixed-use asset rules applies to only one of those activities. The situation envisaged is when a taxpayer owns a beach house which is on a piece of land with two houses. The capital value on the legal title will give the value for both houses and the whole of the land area. Where the mixed-use activity is being carried on by only one of the owners, it would be very difficult for that owner to reach the quarantining threshold because of the presence of the two houses. This is similar to a situation where a farmer sets up a house on the farm as a farmstay. The house is on the farm land, and is used to derive rental income, but is also used by the farmer’s children and their friends when they come home. If the land value cannot be apportioned, then the farmer would never be able to claim any expenditure associated with the farmstay, as the income would never reach 2 percent of the value of the total farm. Comment Officials agree, that in certain circumstances, using the capital value or annual value (as set by the relevant local authority) could overstate the assets’ value for the purposes of subpart DG. In the lease example raised by the submitter, it is arguable that a leasehold estate is an asset separate from the freehold estate and therefore does not have a capital/annual value itself – which means that the relevant ―asset value‖ is the price paid for the leasehold estate or the market value (if acquired from an associate). 266 However, officials agree it is appropriate to clarify/amend the ―asset value‖ concept for land (or an interest in land) where the mixed-use asset itself is only a part of the underlying freehold estate valued by the capital/annual value, and this results in an inappropriately high ―asset value‖ for the purposes of the close company interest apportionment rule in section DG 11, and the loss quarantining rule in section DG 16. The capital/annual value may give too high an asset value because:  the mixed-use asset is a leasehold (rather than freehold) estate; or  a property has a single legal title but different activities are carried on within that single title, only one of which involves mixed use – for example, a farmstay on a large commercial farm or two baches on a single title, only one of which meets the mixed-use asset criteria. When these situations arise, the legislation should provide an option to use as the ―asset value‖ a reasonable apportionment of the capital/annual value of the freehold property to the mixed-use asset based on:  in the case of a leased asset, the market value of the leasehold estate (a valuation that is less than three years old, and has been completed by a registered valuer, will be accepted as the market value); and/or  in the case of two activities/assets on a single title: – the percentage of the land area used for the mixed-use activity (for example, the proportionate area the dwelling and curtilage bear to the total land area); or – some other reasonable apportionment determined under a valuation by a registered valuer (such valuation must be less than three years old). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Quarantined losses and depreciation recovery income Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When a mixed-use asset has quarantined expenditure, the taxpayer should be able to offset any depreciation recovery income against the quarantined losses if the asset is sold. There seems to be no policy reason why a taxpayer should not be able to offset any depreciation recovery income against quarantined losses but officials seem to consider that depreciation recovery income cannot be offset against quarantined losses. This gives rise to various issues. The first is that section DG 17(1)(b) states that section DG 17 applies when (inter alia) the person’s income for the current year from the use of the asset is more than the amount of their deductions under sections DG 7, DG8 and DG 11. 267 We understand that some officials considered that depreciation recovery income would not arise ―from the use of the asset‖ (that is, it results from the disposal of the asset rather than the ―use‖ of the asset) which is defined in section DG 3(7) as ―use of the asset for its intended purpose‖. The second issue is that section EE 49(3) (which provides the calculation when there is depreciation recovery income and there has been mixed-use of an asset) has a numerator based on the ―deductions‖ which are deductions for which the person is allowed a deduction under Part D (see section BD 2). In the case of quarantined deductions, a person is not allowed a deduction; therefore the numerator would be zero. Accordingly the amount of the depreciation recovery income would be nil or a low amount. This is the correct outcome in our view as it would seem egregious that taxpayers are expected to pay depreciation recovery income when they have not been able to claim depreciation deductions. The third issue is that, in some instances, there will be situations when a mixed-use asset was used before the advent of the mixed-use asset rules. Accordingly, the formula in section EE 49(3) will have an amount in the numerator as there were deductions permitted in the years before the mixed-use asset rules. We consider that the taxpayer should be able to use the quarantined losses as they have been paying tax on income derived over the period when the mixed-use asset rules were in place, but were denied any deductions under subpart DG. The very least those taxpayers should expect is to be able to use the quarantined losses against depreciation recovery income when they have been denied a depreciation deduction while the mixed-use asset rules have been in place. Comment A number of points are covered in this submission: (a) Taxpayers should be able to access quarantined losses to reduce depreciation recovery income derived from the sale of a mixed-use asset and, under one interpretation of the current rules, they are unable to do so. It is not the role of policy officials to give the Commissioner’s interpretation of current law. However, from a policy perspective, depreciation recovery income is a mechanism to reverse depreciation deductions claimed over the life of an asset, where that asset has not depreciated to the extent anticipated by the depreciation rate (in some cases, it will have actually appreciated in value). If the depreciation deductions in respect of the mixed-use asset have been quarantined (thus not been accessible to the taxpayer) and then depreciation recovery income arises upon the sale of the asset, officials agree taxpayers should be able to access those quarantined deductions to offset against the depreciation recovery income. The depreciation recovery income otherwise imposes an additional tax liability on the taxpayer who has not had the benefit of the deductions the recovery income intends to reverse. In summary, officials agree in principle with the submission. (b) If taxpayers have not had the benefit of depreciation deductions because the mixed-use asset rules quarantine the deductions, when applying the depreciation recovery formula in section EE 49, the numerator should be 0 and therefore no depreciation recovery income arises. Again, policy officials do not give the Commissioner’s interpretation of the legislation. However, for the same reason identified above, from a policy perspective, officials accept that the outcome identified by the submitter is the correct policy outcome. 268 (c) If a taxpayer holds a mixed-use asset and they held the asset before the introduction of the mixed-use asset rules, they should be able to use losses quarantined under the mixed-use asset rules to offset depreciation recovery income arising from the sale of the asset after the rules were introduced. Officials consider that, when the benefit of depreciation deductions have previously been obtained by a taxpayer (because the deductions were claimed before the enactment of the mixed-use asset rules), it is appropriate that depreciation recovery income gives rise to a tax liability (in the absence of other deductions/losses available to the taxpayer). This is because the depreciation recovery income reverses a previous tax benefit obtained by the taxpayer. Therefore, officials disagree with this submission, to the extent the taxpayer has had the benefit of depreciation deductions before the mixed-use asset rules were enacted. In summary, officials accept in principle the submitter’s points in (a) and (b) above, but disagree with the submission in (c). Given the rules in this area are complex and affect a number of taxpayers, officials believe it is appropriate to decline the submission in the context of this bill, but to consider the submissions further, engage with the submitter and design a robust solution that can be included in a future tax bill that will be subject to full consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Taxation of exempt income when distributed to shareholders Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) When a company distributes retained earnings that have arisen from exempt income under the mixed-use asset rules, these should retain their character as exempt income rather than being taxed as unimputed dividends. Comment Officials appreciate the concern raised by the submitter; however this is a policy issue that requires significant consideration. Some tax preferences (such as other tax exemptions) are clawed back when profits are distributed to shareholders. On the other hand, officials can see an argument that the tax exemption should flow through to the shareholder, otherwise the intended symmetry between denial of deductions and exemption of income is arguably not achieved. Officials therefore note the submission, but recommend that it be declined for inclusion in this bill on the basis that the rules in this area are complex and affect a number of taxpayers, so it is appropriate to engage with the submitter and design a robust solution that can be included in a future tax bill that will be subject to full consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 269 Issue: Clarification of application to shareholders who lease assets to subsidiaries Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Clarification is needed as to how the mixed-use asset rules apply when a parent company has, say, leased an asset on a full-time basis to a subsidiary that uses the asset in a way that qualifies it for the application of the mixed-use asset rules. Comment Officials note the submission and will engage with the submitter to clarify the issue identified. This may involve including a measure in a future tax bill that will be subject to full consultation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amendment to deal with capital use of a mixed-use asset Submission (Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) An amendment to the apportionment formula is needed when there is capital use of an asset, as well as income-earning use and private use. The issue is explained by the following example: A privately owned corporate group owns a plane that has the following use (per year):  private use (for example, the owner of the group flying overseas on holiday) – 20 days;  income-earning use (for example, the owner/management flying overseas for business purposes where there is a direct nexus with income) – 20 days; and  capital use (for example, the owner/management flying overseas to analyse potential capital acquisitions) – 20 days. The plane is therefore used 1/3 for private use, 1/3 for income-earning use and 1/3 for capital use. The plane is unused for the remainder of the year. The following expenditure is incurred in relation to the plane:  $100 solely relating to private use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to private use);  $100 solely relating to income-earning use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to income-earning use); 270  $100 solely relating to capital use (for example, fuel and pilot costs directly attributable to capital use); and  $100 ―mixed use‖ expenditure that does not solely relate to any specific use (for example, annual insurance premium for the plane). Under the general rules (that is, before applying the mixed-use asset rules), the approach would be to apportion the expenditure based on actual use. A deduction would be taken for $100 for the expenditure solely relating to the income-earning use (as per section DA 1). No deduction would be taken for the $200 solely relating to private and capital use (as per the private and capital limitations in section DA 2), and a $33 deduction would be taken for the portion of the mixed-use expenditure that is deemed to relate to the income-earning use (that is, 1/3 x $100 = $33) (as per section DA 1). In addition, the following tax treatment results from the application of the mixed-use asset rules. In relation to the non-mixed-use expenditure, the $100 solely relating to the income-earning use should be fully deductible (as per section DG 7) and the $200 that solely relates to private and capital use should be non-deductible (as per the private and capital limitations in section DA 2). $33 of the mixed-use expenditure that is considered to relate to income-earning use should be deductible under the rules. For this to be the case under the mixed-use asset rules, the full $100 of mixed-use expenditure needs to be included in the item ―expenditure‖ in the apportionment formula in section DG 9 as the capital-use days are not income-earning days. This would effectively require there to be no apportionment under the capital limitation and the private limitation before the application of the apportionment formula: expenditure x income-earning days / (income-earning days + counted days) i.e. $100 x 20/60 = $33. However, the item ―expenditure‖ in the apportionment formula only includes expenditure in relation to the asset that is ―deductible in the absence of this subpart‖ and the capital limitation and the private limitation could therefore be considered to apply before the apportionment under section DG 9. Clearly, however, the mixed-use expenditure that relates to private use must be included in ―expenditure‖ in the apportionment formula otherwise the apportionment formula would be redundant. If section DG 9 is read as requiring expenditure that might otherwise be apportioned as capital expenditure to be excluded from ―expenditure‖ in the apportionment formula, expenditure relating to the capital use of the asset would be subject to two levels of apportionment (that is, denied once by the capital limitation and then again by the mixed-use asset rules). As capital- use days are treated as ―counted days‖ in the apportionment formula, excluding capital expenditure from ―expenditure‖ would limit the deduction for the capital mixed-use expenditure twice: expenditure x income-earning days / (income-earning days + counted days) i.e. $67 x 20/60 = $22. This problem could potentially be corrected by: (1) extending the words ―and that would be deductible in the absence of this subpart‖ in subsection DG 9(3)(a) and including the words ―prior to any apportionment of expenditure due to capital or private use of the asset‖; or 271 (2) excluding ―capital use days‖ from ―counted days‖ in the apportionment formula and addressing the private limitation with something similar to (1). This would result in the following outcome: expenditure x income-earning days / (income-earning days + counted days – capital use days) i.e. $67 x 20/(20+40-20) = $33. ―Capital-use days‖ could be defined as ―the total number of days in the income year on which the asset is in use and the use is of a capital nature‖. This outcome would then appropriately focus the formula on apportioning otherwise deductible expenditure between private and income-earning use. The submitter suggests that option 1 would be simpler as it essentially just clarifies that the apportionment formula does all the apportionment for capital and private use. Option 2 would further complicate the apportionment formula. Comment Officials agree with the submission and agree in principle that option 1 is a sensible approach to address the issue. Officials recommend however that the appropriate solution is to delete the words: ―... and that would be deductible in the absence of this subpart‖ from section DG 9(3)(a). This is because section DG 8(3)(a) states section DG 8 overrides the capital limitation and the private limitation, and section DG 9 is the formula that determines the amount deductible under section DG 8(1), so the capital and private limitation are already overridden. Accordingly, if the words: ―... and that would be deductible in the absence of this subpart‖ are removed from the definition of expenditure in section DG 9(3)(a), the expenditure that is apportioned under that formula will be all expenditure (including capital and private expenditure). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Different definition of “asset income” for quarantining rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of ―asset income‖ in section DG 17 should be aligned with the definition of the same term in section DG 16. Comment If a taxpayer generates assessable income from a mixed-use asset in an income year of less than 2 percent of the asset’s value, some of the deductions generated by the asset are quarantined until a future income year. The low relative level of income generated by the use of the asset suggests that the asset is likely to be a predominantly private asset and therefore it is appropriate to suspend tax deductions that could otherwise be used to offset the taxpayer’s income from other sources. 272 If the income does not reach the 2 percent threshold, any deductions above the assessable income from the asset (the ―asset income‖) derived in that income year are quarantined, to be accessed in future income years. The effect is that, in a year when a taxpayer derives a low level of assessable income from the asset, the taxpayer is allowed deductions sufficient to offset that assessable income (so no tax is payable in respect of the income from the asset), but is not able to generate a net loss on that asset. In a future income year, the taxpayer is able to access quarantined deductions if they have income from the use of the asset that exceeds their current year deductions. The amount of quarantined expenditure that can be accessed by the taxpayer is the lesser of the quarantined expenditure and the excess of current year income from the asset (the ―asset income‖) above current year allowable deductions. Officials have identified a problem with the definition of ―asset income‖ in the provision that allows taxpayers to access quarantined expenditure (section DG 17). In the primary quarantining provision (section DG 16), the ―asset income‖ is the total amount of income, other than an amount of exempt income, derived for the income year from the use of the asset. This is the correct approach as taxpayers should not be able to access excess deductions because they have earned exempt income. In contrast, in section DG 17, which is the section that allows taxpayers to access previously quarantined amounts, the definition of ―asset income‖ is the total amount of income derived for the current year from the use of the asset. There is no exclusion for exempt income. This means that taxpayers can access excess quarantined deductions on the basis of exempt income they derive in relation to the asset (for example, income from associates, which is easily manipulated). Given the income is exempt, accessing quarantined deductions in this way will also give rise to a net loss on the asset for that income year which is contrary to the policy intention of the provision. Accordingly, officials recommend that the definition of ―asset income‖ in section DG 17 should be aligned with the definition of the same term in section DG 16. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 273 LOOK-THROUGH COMPANIES Clauses 147 and 148 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter supports the amendment which proposes that the references in the promoter (section 141EB) penalty legislation which refer to loss attributing qualifying companies be updated to refer to look-through companies (LTCs), and that the penalty relief provision for loss attributing qualifying companies be repealed. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Further reforms to the LTC rules Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The amendment corrects a minor technical error rather than deals with any of the fundamental and more significant issues with the look-through company rules that we and others have raised over the last two years. We submit that the Committee should consider asking the Government and officials to treat the reform of the LTC rules as an urgent priority. Comment The amendment is concerned with correcting the terminology. Officials note that this submission raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. The Government’s tax policy work programme, announced on 8 November 2013, includes a review of the tax rules for closely held companies. This work will consider simplification, technical and base maintenance issues that arise under current tax rules applying to closely held companies, including improving the overall coherence of the rules. These include the rules for look-through companies and other close company regimes. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 274 UNACCEPTABLE TAX POSITION SHORTFALL PENALTY Clause 146 Issue: Support for the amendment Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) The submitter is supportive of the proposed amendment to clarify that the unacceptable tax position penalty does not apply in respect of GST and withholding tax shortfalls, and the retrospective application of this amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Drafting Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The proposed method of clarifying ―income tax‖ in section 141B is unnecessarily complex, involving the introduction of a new term ―core income tax‖. We submit that ―income tax‖ should be retained as the relevant term in section 141B(2) and new section 141B(10) should define ―income tax‖ for the purpose of the section as ―income tax as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 ignoring the effect of section RA 2 of that Act‖. Comment The proposal clarifies that the unacceptable tax position penalty does not apply to shortfalls that arise in respect of GST and withholding-type taxes. That is, the penalty will only apply to income tax shortfalls. Officials agree with the submission which would align the proposal with the original intent of the 2007 amendment. It would also prevent the introduction of a new term. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 275 SETTING NEW DUE DATE FOR PAYMENT OF TAX Clause 149 Issue: Extension of provision Submission (Ernst & Young) A further amendment should be made to clarify that a new due date should be set when a new assessment is made or issued, regardless of whether it is the Commissioner or the taxpayer who makes the assessment in question. Comment Officials consider that the submission raises issues that would result in a significant widening of the existing provision and which would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 276 SERIOUS HARDSHIP Clauses 128(4) and 153 to 157 Issue: Support for the proposal Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter accepts that, on occasion, the Commissioner may need to bankrupt a taxpayer who is in serious hardship, and considers that the Commissioner should not have regard to the reasons why a taxpayer is in serious hardship when the taxpayer applies for financial relief. Comment The proposals in the bill are being made to allow the Commissioner, in appropriate circumstances, to bankrupt taxpayers who are in serious hardship, and to ensure that the reasons why the debt arose are not a factor in determining whether the taxpayer is in serious hardship. The submission supports the proposals in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: Relevant factors in determining “serious hardship” Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The inclusion of proposed section 177A(2)(c) should be reconsidered as it could lead to questions about the factors that the Commissioner considered are ―relevant‖ factors. Comment The bill proposes a new definition of ―serious hardship‖. The current definition uses the word ―includes‖ and lists factors that may give rise to the taxpayer being in significant financial difficulties. The proposed definition does not use the word ―includes, but rather states that the Commissioner can make a decision and consider ―other factors that the Commissioner thinks relevant would likely arise‖. The current definition and the proposed definition are not definitive lists of circumstances but allow the Commissioner to consider individual circumstances. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 277 WFF – CHANGES TO DEFINITION OF “FAMILY SCHEME INCOME” Clauses 114, 115 and 116 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The submitter supports the proposed amendments to correct errors and clarify the definition of ―family scheme income‖ but considers they add another layer of complexity to an area where simplicity is fundamental. The process of applying section MB 13 is becoming unwieldy. The ―family scheme income‖ rules in subpart MB should be reviewed and simplified. Comment Officials acknowledge that the definition of ―family scheme income‖ for Working for Families (WFF) tax credits has become more complex. Complexity is a feature of social policy income definitions more generally and reflects the desire for accuracy and integrity in targeting financial assistance to those in genuine need. The broadening of the definition of ―family scheme income‖ from 2011, including the addition of subpart MB 13, was in response to concerns about the fairness and integrity of the family scheme income rules. There had been an increase in the level of the tax credits over 2004–07 and changes in how businesses were being structured (for example, as family trust-owned companies). The 2011 broadening reforms sought to recognise the resources available to families to better identify those families in genuine need of additional government assistance. The trade-off is an increase in complexity, and for some families, an increase in compliance costs. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 278 PIE REMEDIALS Issue: Entry and exit fees Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) For an entity to be a portfolio investment entity (PIE) it must meet various requirements, including in relation to the types of income it can derive. A PIE must derive less than 10 percent of its income from sources other than land, financial arrangements, excepted financial arrangements, and rights and options in relation to those things. This restriction should be modified so a PIE does not face the 10 percent restriction on entry and exit fees. These fees are payable when investors invest in, or exit, a PIE. They are intended to cover the brokerage and administration costs incurred by the PIE. Comment PIEs are intended to be passive investment vehicles. A PIE must earn most of its income in forms that might be expected to arise from passive investments such as rents, dividends or interest. The ability for a PIE to derive up to 10 percent of its income from other sources was designed to cover incidental forms of income such as entry and exit fees. Officials understand that entry and exit fees could inadvertently become a large portion of a PIE’s income if there is a period of particularly low investment returns. However, officials consider this issue would need further analysis to ensure removing the 10 percent restriction from entry and exit fees does not have any unintended consequences. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Disposal of certain shares by a PIE Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Section CB 26 should not apply in relation to dividends from a listed PIE. There is no need for the section to apply as the unimputed portion of such dividends are not taxable under section CX 56C. This change should apply no later than the commencement of the 2013–14 income year. 279 Comment Officials agree there is no need for section CB 26 to apply. Section CX 55 provides that gains arising from the sale of most Australian and New Zealand-listed shares are excluded income for PIEs and similar entities. However, section CB 26 deems a taxable dividend to arise when a share that satisfies the criteria of section CX 55 is sold after a dividend is declared but before the dividend is paid. This is to prevent a PIE turning a taxable dividend receipt into a non-taxable gain on sale. These concerns do not arise for dividends received from listed PIEs as those dividends are not taxable in any event. There is no tax advantage in selling a share in a listed PIE after a dividend is declared but before it is paid. Officials do not agree that the application date of this change should be the beginning of the 2013–14 income year. Many PIEs will have already finalised their tax positions for most of that year. As such, only some investors in some PIEs would benefit from the retrospective application. Officials consider an application date of Royal assent more appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted subject to officials’ comments. 280 REMOVAL OF 20% UPLIFT FROM LAND IMPROVEMENT PROVISIONS Submission (BDO Wellington Ltd) Clauses 50 and 125 have already been enacted and should be removed from the bill. Comment Clauses 50 and 125 aim to remove the remaining 20% uplift rules. These two clauses have already been enacted through the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013 (sections 103 and 104 of that Act). These two clauses should be removed from the current bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 281 REMITTED AMOUNTS ON DISCHARGE FROM BANKRUPTCY Clause 15(1) Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed section CG 2B should be amended to apply to an individual whose discharge from bankruptcy occurs in the same income year as enactment of the bill. Proposed section CG 2B(2)(b)(ii) should be amended to ensure the amount calculated is relevant only if it is a positive amount. Comment The bill is likely to be enacted during the 2014–15 income year, and returns of income for this tax year are not required until July 2015. Therefore, adopting this application will provide consistent tax outcomes for all discharged bankrupts for the 2014–15 income year. Officials do not agree with the second submission. The debt adjustment can completely extinguish the loss balance from the preceding tax year (giving a zero result in the formula). A zero result in the formula will result in the discharged bankrupt having no income under section CG 2B, as intended. Recommendation That the submission for the application date be accepted. That the submission for section CG 2B(b)(ii) be declined. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We support this proposal as it is consistent with the ―fresh start‖ principles of insolvency law. Where the Official Assignee has administered the bankruptcy, s/he has considered the bankrupt’s position in depth and it is therefore sensible and preferable for the tax legislation to ―defer‖ to the Insolvency Act 2006. We agree that any tax losses carried forward by a former bankrupt should be reduced by the lesser of the amounts remitted or the total losses carried forward. Comment Officials note the support for the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 282 LOSS GROUP CONTINGENT ON GROUP LOSS COMPANY SATISFYING ITS LIABILITIES FOR DEDUCTIBLE EXPENDITURE Clause 15(2) Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group) We support the amendments as being reasonable in principle, subject to technical and drafting issues being resolved but do not agree the amendments are remedial in nature. Comment Officials note the submission supports that the amendments are reasonable in principle but cannot identify any drafting issues raised in the submission. Technical points raised by the Group in relation to specific submissions are dealt with separately in this report. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considers the amendments ought to have been more appropriately dealt with as a policy matter rather than an ―other remedial matter‖ in the Commentary to the bill. We consider that the proposed amendments are appropriately classified as remedial measures, as they correct an unintended consequence arising from earlier amendments. Before the commencement of the Income Tax Act 2004, the Commissioner could amend past years’ assessments of a taxpayer to cancel the benefit from using past tax losses if the taxpayer’s liabilities for deductible expenditure were later discharged without full consideration, were remitted or had become unrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse of time. This power to issue this amended assessment was not limited to the normal four-year time bar. This power also applied to the benefit of loss grouping in past years. To achieve consistency with self-assessment, the rewrite of these provisions altered both the manner and timing of the adjustment to cancel the benefit of using past tax losses. The adjustment was treated as income in the year a taxpayer’s liabilities for deductible expenditure were later discharged without full consideration, were remitted or had become unrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse of time. However, this policy change did not adequately address how this policy applied to past loss grouping. The proposed amendments:  correct this gap in the law arising from the 2004 Act change to the manner and timing of the adjustment; and  do not involve a change in existing policy. Recommendation That the submission that the amendments are reasonable in principle be noted. That the submission that the amendments are remedial in nature be declined. 283 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We agree in principle with what the amendment is aiming to achieve. Comment Officials note the support for the amendments. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submissions (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Income should not be deemed to arise prior to amounts being remitted. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The proposals targeting companies leaving consolidated groups and voidable preference transactions seem to go too far and do not leave companies with many options when trying to refinance an insolvent company prior to a group profit company trying to exit a group. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The amendment results in an overreach when a company wishes to leaves a consolidated group. The profit company may be subject to a tax liability as a result of the financial position of other members of the consolidated group in certain situations merely because either the profit company or the loss company exits the group. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment These submissions relate to proposed section CG 2D, which applies in circumstances when the group loss company and group profit company are in the same group. This approach addresses concerns raised in submissions on a consultation paper that an adjustment to cancel the benefit of past loss grouping should not apply if the group loss company and the group profit company are not in the same group of companies. The proposed amendment is consistent with the general adjustment rule that cancels the benefit of using past tax losses if unpaid liabilities for past deductible expenditure (related to those past tax losses) became unrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse of time. The proposed amendment in section CG 2D identifies that at the time loss grouping status is broken:  if the group loss company is insolvent, there is a high risk that the liability will not be satisfied in full (that is, it is likely to be unrecoverable); and  that risk will be known to the management of the group of companies. 284 Officials consider that as the unpaid liabilities have a high risk of being unrecoverable, it is appropriate to cancel the benefit of related past tax losses used under the loss grouping rules. It also ensures proposed section CG 2C cannot be easily avoided. Section CG 2C applies if the loss company is liquidated, struck off or otherwise removed from the register of companies. Submitters also comment it is possible the group loss company may later satisfy its liabilities. We consider that, in most circumstances, it is unlikely that the insolvent group loss company would later satisfy its obligations for unpaid deductible expenditure. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Subsections CG 2D(4), (5) are unnecessary and should be removed. (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte, Ernst & Young) References to ―transactions or arrangements‖ in proposed subsection CG 2D(4) introduce uncertainty into the rules. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment The reference to an arrangement was intended to take into account:  guarantees given by other taxpayers that enable the insolvent group loss company to meet the solvency test;  a release given by creditors of the group loss company from the obligation to pay the unsatisfied liability; or  an agreement of composition with the group loss company’s creditors. The policy concern is that funding provided to the group loss company to satisfy the solvency test should not subsequently be used to make an insolvent transaction. An insolvent transaction could subsequently be reclaimed by a liquidator of the group loss company. An example of payments that could be at risk are payments to satisfy outstanding accident compensation levies, or fringe benefit tax, both of which are normally deductible expenses for a company. However, we agree that the use of ―an arrangement‖ might cause uncertainty in the mergers and acquisitions market. To address the uncertainty, the provisions in section CG 2D(4), (5) should be aligned more closely with the insolvent transaction provisions under company law and omit the reference to ―arrangement‖. There appears to be a low risk that an arrangement would subsequently be used to fund an insolvent transaction. We do not consider that the two provisions otherwise create uncertainty. 285 Submitters comment that the general anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 could address the insolvent transaction concerns. We consider the policy for the proposed provisions address a specific issue relating to insolvent transactions, and this is preferable, for compliance and administration cost reasons, to leaving the matter to be addressed under the general anti-avoidance provisions. Recommendation That the submission that the provisions relating to voidable transactions be removed from the bill be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Submission (Ernst & Young) The provisions of proposed sections CG 2C and CG 2D should not apply if a loss company is removed from the register of companies through formal amalgamation under the Companies Act 1993 or any equivalent Court order, whereby the liability to pay their relevant unpaid expenditure amounts pass to the on-going amalgamated company Comment Officials agree that, if the group loss company has been removed from the register by reason of amalgamation, proposed sections CG 2C should not apply. This is because the unsatisfied liabilities of the group loss company are assumed by the amalgamated company (the company remaining after the formal amalgamation). However, as the liabilities have been assumed by the amalgamated company, proposed section CG 2D should apply to the amalgamated company. This ensures that the formal amalgamation process cannot be used as a means to avoid the assessment of income to the group profit company under proposed sections CG 2C and 2D (for example by amalgamation and then liquidating the amalgamated company). Recommendation That the submission be accepted, subject to officials’ comments. Submission (Ernst & Young) Proposed sections CG 2C and 2D should be clarified as to whether or how the proposed rules might apply if loss companies have been part of a consolidated group for income tax purposes. Comment Officials agree that it would be helpful to clarify how the consolidated group rules are to interact with proposed sections CG 2C and 2D as that would assist in minimising compliance and administration costs. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 286 Submission (Ernst & Young) The Commissioner of Inland Revenue should provide appropriate guidance for the application of proposed sections CG 2C and 2D in situations when loss companies have losses representing a combination of paid and unpaid expenditure and when they have apportioned losses to more than one group of company. Comment The recovery rules in proposed sections CG 2C and 2D modify the general recovery rule applying to taxpayers with unpaid liabilities (relating to an amount of deductible expenditure) that have been remitted or cancelled. This includes liabilities that have become unrecoverable or unenforceable through the lapse in time. Under this general rule, there is no requirement to match or trace the unpaid liability for deductible expenditure and match those amounts to specific use of tax losses. Instead, the taxpayer is assessed for an amount of income equal to the relevant amount remitted or cancelled. Proposed sections CG 2C and 2D adopt the same approach for consistency and to maintain the integrity of the tax system. We agree with the submission relating to apportionment. We consider that allocation of the recovery income arising under sections CG 2C and 2D should be explicit in the legislation. This will assist in minimising compliance and administration costs. Recommendation That the submission on paid and unpaid expenditure be declined. That the submission on tax losses apportioned to more than one group company be accepted. Submission (Ernst & Young) Exclusions for financial arrangements within proposed sections CG 2C and 2D should be clarified. Comment As drafted, proposed sections CG 2C and 2D make it clear that they do not apply to financial arrangements. For example, proposed sections CG 2C and 2D apply to unpaid liabilities for normal trade debts. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 287 Submission (Ernst & Young, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) The interaction of proposed sections CG 2C and 2D with sections IC 11 and IC 12 should be clarified. (Ernst & Young) The effect of section IC 11 should be considered. (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) Comment Section IC 11 applies if the Commissioner amends an assessment to determine that the tax loss of a group loss company (for a tax year) is less than the total amounts made available and subtracted from net income of group profit companies. This section applies, for example, when the group loss company has taken a tax position on an expenditure that has not been accepted by the Commissioner. Officials consider section IC 11 is not suitable for cancelling the benefit of past grouping of tax losses on remission or cancellation of unpaid liabilities for deductible expenditure of a group loss company because:  section IC 11 results in retrospective amended assessments of the group companies. That approach was strongly opposed in submissions on a consultation paper;  section IC 11 is subject to the time bar, preventing the Commissioner from cancelling the benefit of past tax losses if more than four years have passed since the last assessment. However, we agree that it would be desirable to adopt an apportionment rule similar to the apportionment in section IC 11 to minimise compliance and administration costs. We agree with the submission that proposed sections CG 2C and 2D should not apply to tax losses for which other provisions apply (such as section IC 12). We recommend that this be clarified. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Submission (Russell McVeagh) Sections CG 2 and 2D should be treated as coming into force and applying to all income years ending on or after the date upon which the bill is introduced. Comment Officials can see no policy reason why the proposed provisions should not apply from the date of introduction of the bill (22 November 2013). The proposed provisions apply if a group loss company with unpaid liabilities or past deductions has subsequently: 288  been removed from the register or companies; or  lost group status with a group profit company that received the benefit of past tax losses. The long-standing policy is that the use of tax losses is contingent on the payment of liabilities for deductible expenditure. The proposed amendments are consistent with the general rule for all taxpayers that cancels the benefit of past tax losses if liabilities for past deductible expenditure are remitted or cancelled. We also consider the amendments in sections CG 2C and 2D are significantly more constrained than the previous law, which permitted the Commissioner to amend assessments to cancel the benefit of past tax losses, without any time constraints, whether or not the group loss company or group profit company were in the same group of companies. Recommendation That the submission be declined, subject to officials’ comments. Issue: Income derived in trust by public and local authorities Clauses 25 and 26 Submission (Ernst & Young) The amendments to sections CW 38 and 39 are too restrictive and may prevent exemptions applying to income derived in trust for charitable or other exempt public purposes. Comment The exemption for income derived by a public authority or a local authority (sections CW 38 and 39) is not available for income derived by a trust for which a public authority or a local authority is the trustee. The policy of this exemption has never been related to the terms of the trust, as suggested by the submitter. However, the amendment addresses an issue raised with the Commissioner relating to the trustee’s tax obligations for the beneficiary. As the income derived by the trustee is not exempt under section CW 38 or CW 39, we consider that the amendment clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt that:  the exemption for income derived by a public authority or a public authority does not extend to income derived in the capacity as trustee that has not been distributed; and  the trustee may take into account any exemption from income of the beneficiary for determining the trustee’s income tax obligations on that beneficiary income. 289 However income derived by a public authority or local authority as trustee may be exempt under other provisions of the Income Tax Act which may take into account the terms of the trust. We consider this amendment does not disturb these principles and that the submitter is raising issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submissions (New Zealand Law Society, Tax Team, The Whyte Group) The proposed amendments are unnecessary, as the current position in relation to trust income distributed as beneficiary income is clear. (New Zealand Law Society) The amendments are ad hoc amendments that potentially exacerbate existing uncertainty in relation to the interpretation and application of the exclusions from the public and local authority exemptions for income derived ―as a trustee‖. (New Zealand Law Society, Tax Team) If any amendments are made to the exclusions, they should only be made following a more comprehensive review of the underlying policy and intended scope of the exclusions. (New Zealand Law Society) The amendment to section CW 39(3) should be removed from the bill. (The Whyte Group) Comment We consider the submission is seeking a review of the scope of the policy for the public and local authority exemptions which raises issues that would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. The long-standing policy is that the public and local authority exemptions do not extend to income that a public or local authority derives as a trustee. This is because income is derived in trust beneficially for the beneficiaries of the trust and not for the public or local authority. The amendment clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt that if a public or local authority derives income as a trustee:  whether the income derived and retained by the trustee is exempt income and is determined by whether other exempt income provisions in the Income Tax Act apply to the trustees and the trust, and not by the public or local authority exemptions; and  income distributed as beneficiary income to a public or local authority is exempt income. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 290 Issue: Spreading of income derived from land Clauses 58 and 59 Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We support the amendment as a clarification to the current position. Comment Officials note the support for the amendment. Recommendation That the submission be noted. Submission (BDO Wellington Ltd, PricewaterhouseCoopers) A taxpayer should be able to choose a shorter timeframe for the spreading of income rather than being locked into a statutory timeframe (set out in the amendment). (BDO Wellington Ltd) A review should be undertaken regarding the timing of income and its allocation between income years. (PricewaterhouseCoopers) Comment The amendment clarifies that income is to be spread evenly over the time periods referred to in sections EI 7 and 8. This was the practice before the following drafting changes were made:  in 2002 to give effect to formal self-assessment; and  in rewriting those provisions into the Income Tax Act 2004. The submission raises a policy question relating to a number of spreading provisions (both deduction and income) in the Income Tax Act 2007. These provisions are mainly concerned with:  the primary sector; and  certain intangibles (such as copyright, patents or leases). Officials consider that, consistent with the objective of maintaining the integrity of the tax system, any review of the timeframes should consider all similar spreading rules which would require further analysis as part of the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 291 REWRITE AMENDMENT Issue: Rewrite amendments relating to use of foreign balance dates Clauses 57 and 176 Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed amendments should be revised or deleted as they do not appear to make any substantive difference to section EG 1 as currently enacted and they do not appear to relate to either of the related submissions to the Rewrite Advisory Panel. Comment The election under section EG 1 allows a taxpayer to adopt a simpler method for returning foreign-sourced income for compliance cost reasons. The amendment to section EG 1(6) ensures that this election is not available for a person whose net foreign-sourced income is more than $100,000 in any income year. The current law restricts the application of the election to income years falling after the year in which the election is made. The amendment reflects the Rewrite Advisory Panel’s recommendation on that submission. We note that the second submission to the Rewrite Advisory Panel on this provision was declined by the Panel, and that no amendment is therefore required. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Tax Administration Act 1994: Cross-references to sections 108 and 109 Clauses 135 to 145 Submission (Corporate Taxpayers Group, Deloitte) The amendments contained in the bill do not actually result in the relevant provisions within the Tax Administration Act linking into section 108. We recommend that each of clauses 135 to 145 of the bill be amended and a cross-reference to section 108 added. 292 Comment The submission is requesting that the time-bar referred to in section 108 be extended to apply to tax types, for which the time-bar does not currently apply. The time-bar prevents the Commissioner from making an amended assessment to increase the income tax payable more than four years after the previous assessment. The amendment is a simple correction of cross-referencing from each of the provisions in clauses 135 to 145 of the bill, into section 108 or 109, as appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants) We support the intention of the proposal. That the drafting of each of clauses 135 to 145 of the bill should be reviewed to ensure the intended effect is achieved. Comment Officials note the support for the amendments, and agree that the drafting should be reviewed. Recommendation That the support for the amendments be noted. That the submission to review the drafting be accepted. 293 NON-CASH DIVIDENDS Clause 120 Issue: Drafting correction Submission (Ernst & Young) The proposed remedial amendment is technically correct, but it needs to be repeated in section RE 16(3). Comment Officials agree with the submitter on this drafting correction. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Reconciling tax treatment of bonus issues Submission (Ernst & Young) That the resident withholding tax treatment of the two types of bonus issue should be reconciled. Comment Officials agree that there is some scope for refinement in this area. The matter has been previously raised with officials by another firm of accountants and is being considered as part of the review of the tax rules for closely held companies that is currently on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Recommendation That the submission be noted subject to officials’ comments. 294 MINOR DRAFTING POINTS Clauses 22, 60, 123(9), 123(32) and 155 Submission (Ernst & Young)  Clause 60 – The new paragraph to be inserted in section EW 15D(2) should be labelled (ae), rather than (ad) as proposed, as the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act (122-2) already inserted paras (ac) and (ad).  Clause 123(32) – We suggest the proposed new definition of ―ownership interest‖ also needs to recognise amendments inserted by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Measures) Act 2013 and earlier in relation to corporate reorganisations and reverse takeovers. In particular we note section YC 18B modifies the general tested by ignoring ―excluded preference shares‖.  Clause 155 – Under the proposed replacement of section 177A of the Tax Administration Act, illness of a taxpayer or dependant would seem to be relevant only if it occurs after the application is made for relief. Is that intended or appropriate? We suggest the wording be revised. Comment Officials acknowledge the minor drafting points raised by the submitter and have referred these points to the bill drafters for their consideration. Recommendation That the submission be noted. 295 Matters raised by officials 296 297 CHILD SUPPORT Issue: Deferred application dates Clauses 182 to 191 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials recommend that the child support remedial items in clauses 182 to 191 come into force on 1 April 2015. Comment The application dates for the child support reforms in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 were deferred by one year as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Part one of the Child Support Amendment Act will now apply from 1 April 2015. The child support remedial items in this bill relate to changes in Part one of the Child Support Amendment Act and should likewise be deferred. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Payment waiver when non-parent receiving carer is in receipt of a social security benefit Clause 191 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 191 of the bill amends section 179A of the Child Support Act 1991 (as inserted by clause 29 of the Child Support Amendment Act 2013) to recognise that some non-parent carers can qualify to receive a sole parent support benefit payment instead of the unsupported child benefit. The amendment will mean that a non-parent receiving carer will not be able to waive their right to receive child support if they receive the unsupported child benefit (UCB) or a sole parent support payment. Likewise, if they start to receive either of these two payments any existing waiver is revoked. 298 Officials recommend that a non-parent receiving carer should be excluded from being able to waive their right to receive child support payments if they are getting the UCB for a child or if they are receiving any other social security benefit (other than the UCB). In such circumstances, non-parent receiving carers should not be able to waive their right to receive child support as the money collected is being retained by the Crown to offset the costs of the benefit payments. Comment It has been identified that a non-parent receiving carer could be getting a social security benefit – for example, sole parent support or jobseeker support – in relation to a dependent child and they have another qualifying child in their care who is not included in their benefit. They apply for child support for the qualifying child and any payment is retained by the Crown to offset the benefit costs in accordance with section 142 (Payment of formula assessment child support to custodians who are social security beneficiaries) of the Child Support Act 1991. Under current wording they may be able to waive their right to receive child support under section 179A, which is inconsistent with the Crown payment recovery rules. Section 142 requires the Crown to withhold payment when a receiving carer is in receipt of a social security benefit – it does not specify that the benefit is in relation to the qualifying child. In terms of the proposed amendment to section 179A(5), if a ―payee‖ (non-parent receiving carer) begins to receive the UCB for the child to whom the waiver relates, or any other social security benefit, then a waiver under section 179A which is in place is deemed to be revoked. Such an approach is consistent with the Crown payment recovery principles under section 142 of the Child Support Act 1991. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 299 MINERAL MINING REMEDIALS Submissions (Matters raised by officials) The Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 amended the rules that applied to miners of certain minerals (such as gold, silver and iron- sands). The Advisor to the Committee has noted a number of minor drafting concerns with the mineral mining rules in that Act. Because the new rules are to apply to affected mineral miners from the 2014–15 income year, officials consider it is important to clarify the relevant drafting to avoid any unnecessary confusion. We recommend that any amendments should take effect from the current income year (2014– 15) to ensure that different rules do not apply within the same income year. Although, strictly speaking, this makes the amendments retrospective, the changes are not anticipated to have a material effect on the positions adopted as enactment is anticipated well before the first end-of- year assessments using the new rules are due. Comment The following matters are technical drafting issues and only serve to reinforce the stated policy intent of the provisions in question: Prospecting and exploration expenditure The intent of the original changes was that a miner should always get a deduction for expenditure that is either ―prospecting‖ or ―exploration expenditure‖ (subject to a claw-back rule that applies to exploration expenditure in some cases). This deduction was always meant to be available. However, the relevant provision, in section DU 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, does not explicitly override the capital limitation. It may therefore be possible for a miner to be denied a deduction for prospecting expenditure. Officials recommend that section DU 1 be amended to clarify that the deduction should be available even if this expenditure is ordinarily regarded as capital. It is not anticipated that this drafting suggestion will impinge on the operation of the claw-back rule in appropriate instances. Spreading of development expenditure It is intended that development expenditure and clawed-back exploration expenditure should be capitalised and amortised (deducted) over the life of the mine. This amortisation should take place on either a time or a ―unit of production‖ basis. However, there is a technical question about whether clawed-back exploration expenditure is adequately catered for in section EJ 20E(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007, which operates when a miner operates on a unit of production basis. Failure to capture this expenditure properly could result in the miner being unable to amortise the amount – possibly resulting in ―black hole‖ expenditure. 300 To remedy this, officials recommend that clawed-back expenditure should be specifically included in amounts that are subject to amortisation on a unit of production basis. “Operational expenditure” ―Operational expenditure‖ is defined in section DU 12 (4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 as an exclusion to ―development expenditure‖. Development expenditure is capitalised and amortised over the assumed life of the mine, whereas operational expenditure is treated according to general tax principles. An issue has been raised that may result in a miner claiming immediate deductions for expenditure that is properly categorised as ―development expenditure‖. This could arise when a miner has elected to allocate expenditure on a mine-by-mine basis, rather than over the entire permit area. It may be that the miner can treat development expenditure on a second mine as ―operational‖ on the basis that it creates an asset that has an estimated useful life of less than one year. To remedy this, officials recommend that expenditure that ―contributes to the creation of an asset that has an estimated useful life of more than one year‖ should also be treated as development expenditure. On a single mine operation, this is not intended to expand the definition of ―development expenditure‖. Cap on amortising development expenditure As described above, it is intended that development expenditure be amortised over the assumed life of the mine. An exception is when the assumed life is expected to be 25 years or longer. In this case, it is intended that the amortisation period be capped at 25 years. However, the current drafting of section EJ 20D(3) of the Income Tax Act 2007 arguably does not achieve this result. Officials therefore recommend that the wording be clarified to ensure that the 25 years operates as a cap. Reassessing the life of the mine It was anticipated that a miner would be required to reassess the assumed life of their mine each year to take into account any new deposits discovered or possibly to reduce the estimated life because probable deposits did not in fact materialise. This was designed to provide the most accurate estimate possible over time. The drafting of section EJ 20D(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 technically does not require this reassessment to take place every year. Officials therefore recommend that this be clarified to ensure that this regular recalculation is undertaken. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted.
POLICY AND STRATEGY Policy report: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Date: 14 November 2014 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report no: IR2014/531 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to the recommendations in this report and refer a copy of the report to the Minister of Finance None Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Carmel Peters Policy Manager, Inland Revenue \[Telephone numbers withheld under section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 to protect the privacy of natural persons.\] Melissa Siegel Policy Analyst, Inland Revenue 14 November 2014 Minister of Revenue Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Executive summary In August 2014, we reported to you on the progress of the G20/OECD BEPS Action Plan (“Action Plan”) (T2014/1412; IR 2014/366 refers). That report was our fourth tax policy report on the OECD’s base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) work, and was provided to you just prior to the release of the first set of deliverables under the Action Plan in September 2014. It summarises the OECD’s progress under the Action Plan on an item-by-item basis and the implications of the work for potential domestic law reform. We have attached a copy of that report as appendix B for your information. The purpose of this report is to provide you with an expected timeline for the BEPS-related work that is on the tax policy work programme, lined up against the OECD’s timeline for the release of its work under relevant items of the Action Plan. It does not provide you with any additional information on the substance of the OECD’s work or the implications of that work on potential do mest ic law reform (on which there are no significant developments to report). More specifically, this report provides a timeline for: • Planned release dates of OECD work; • Planned release dates of New Zealand public consultation documents; and • Planned introduction dates of associated legislation. A summary table of the information provided is included as appendix A to this report. New Zealand has been actively involved in the OECD’s BEPS work, particularly in areas where the OECD’s recommendations will affect New Zealand without changes to our domestic rules (for example, under the action items concerning tax treaty abuse, transfer pricing, and GST and the cross-border supply of services, intangibles, and goods), as well as in areas that we expect to be important in terms of guiding our future domestic law reform programme. As regards to those recommendations that will affect New Zealand without changes to our domestic rules, we note that the Digital Economy Task Force (under Action 1 of the Action POLICY AND STRATEGY Te Wāhanga o te Rautaki me te Kaupapa National Office Level 8 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone 04-890 1500 Facsimile 04-903 2413 IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 1 Plan) and the OECD’s Working Party 9 on Consumption Taxes are releasing a discussion consultation document on services and intangibles in December, and we intend to report to you on this following this month’s Working Party 9 meeting at the OECD, before the planned release of that consultation document. While New Zealand’s international tax policy settings are generally robust, there are areas in which New Zealand is actively considering reform to its domestic rules to line up with the OECD’s recommendations under the Action Plan. These areas are: • Neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements (Action 2); and • Limit base erosion via interest deductions (Action 4). The OECD work in these areas will be finalised as part of the whole Action Plan package at the end of 2015. Our aim is to release consultation papers in late 2015 regarding potential domestic law reform in these areas following the conclusion of the OECD’s work. The advantage of waiting for the OECD work to be finalised is that it will ensure any New Zealand initiatives are guided by the approaches recommended by the OECD. There are also areas of work, although not specific to action items under the Action Plan, in which New Zealand’s current international tax settings could be improved to address BEPS concerns. These areas include: • Reviewing the taxation of foreign trusts; • Strengthening non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) rules; and • Improving the quality and usefulness of tax information via administrative measures (“BEPS Compliance Measures”). We intend to report to you regarding a review of the rules for taxing foreign trusts prior to the end of the year. Regarding the projects on strengthening the NRWT rules and BEPS Compliance Measures, we expect to release consultation documents by mid-2015. These can be released prior to the finalisation of the OECD’s work under the Action Plan, because the recommendations coming out of the Action Plan do not specifically address these matters. Another related area of work which will have domestic implications is the G20’s automatic exchange of information initiative (on which we last reported to you on 15 October 2014 (refer IR2014/485)). Inland Revenue and Treasury officials will continue to attend OECD meetings on BEPS – particularly those meetings on action items that are relevant to the BEPS concerns that are important to New Zealand. This includes some or all of the meetings of the following working parties (and related focus groups): • Working Party 1 on Tax Treaties; • Working Party 6 on the Taxation of Multinational Enterprises; • Working Party 9 on Consumption Taxes; • Working Party 10 on Exchange of Information and Tax Compliance; • Working Party 11 on Aggressive Tax Planning; and • Committee of Fiscal Affairs. IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 2 We will keep you informed on important developments that arise from these meetings. In tandem with this work, we are continuing to update our international tax treaty network, and we have included the double tax agreement, tax information exchange agreement, and air transport agreement negotiations planned for 2015 in this report. Three previous reports by officials on the OECD’s BEPS work have been publically released (T2012/3250; PAD2012/268, T2013/927; PAS2013/63; T2013/2059; PAS2013/152). You may wish to consider publically releasing this report, and the report attached as appendix B. We recommend that you refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance for his information. Recommended action We recommend that you: (a) Agree to the timelines for BEPS-related reforms. Agreed/Not agreed (b) Consider whether to release this report and the previous BEPS report provided to you in August 2014 (and attached as appendix B to this report) (T2014/1412; IR2014/366 refers). Considered (c) Refer a copy of this report to the Minister of Finance. Referred Carmel Peters Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue Hon Todd McClay Minister of Revenue IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 3 Background 1. We last reported to you on 19 August 2014 on the progress of OECD’s BEPS work under the Action Plan, and the implications of that work on potential domestic law reform. That report was the fourth tax policy report that we have provided regarding the OECD’s BEPS work (“Fourth BEPS Report”), and was provided just prior to the release of the first set of deliverables under the Action Plan in September 2014. The remaining Action Plan deliverables are due for release in September and December 2015. 2. We attach a copy of the Fourth BEPS Report (T2014/1412; IR2014/366) for your information as appendix B. 3. We have also previously reported to you on the related G20’s automatic exchange of information (“AEOI”) initiative; most recently on 15 October 2014 (refer IR2014/485). 4. New Zealand has been actively involved in the OECD’s BEPS work, particularly in areas where the OECD’s recommendations will affect New Zealand without changes to our domestic rules (for example, under the action items concerning tax treaty abuse, transfer pricing, and GST and the cross-border supply of services, intangibles, and goods), as well as in areas that we expect to be important in terms of guiding our future domestic law reform programme. 5. With regard to our future domestic law reform programme, this report provides you with an expected timeline for BEPS-related work, lined up against the OECD’s timeline for the release of its work under relevant items of the Action Plan. This work either: • Directly relates to an action item under the Act ion Plan; or • Is an area of work that, although not specific to an action item, requires attention to address BEPS concerns; or • Otherwise relates to the OECD’s BEPS work. 6. In tandem with this work, we continue to work on updating our international tax treaty network, and we have included in this report the double tax agreement (“DTA”), tax information exchange agreement (“TIEA”) and air transport agreement negotiations planned for 2015. OECD timeline for deliverables under the Action Plan 7. As noted in the Fourth BEPS Report, the OECD released its first set of deliverables under the Action Plan ahead of the G20 Finance Ministers’ meeting, in September 2014. The papers released in September 2014 covered are: • Tax challenges of the digital economy (Action 1); IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 4 • Hybrid mismatch arrangements (Action 2); • Counter harmful tax practices more effectively (Action 5) (interim report); • Preventing treaty abuse (Action 6); • Modifications of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines related to transfer pricing aspects of intangibles (Act ion 8); • Modifications of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines related to documentation (Action 13); and • Develop a multilateral instrument to modify bilateral tax treaties (Action 15). 8. The remaining Action Plan deliverables are due for release in September and December 2015. The action items to be covered are as follows: September 2015 • Strengthen Controlled Foreign Companies (“CFC”) rules (Action 3); • Limit base erosion via interest deductions (Action 4); • Counter harmful tax practices more effectively (Action 5); • Prevent the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (Action 7); • Transfer pricing in relation to risks and capital, and other high-risk transactions (Actions 9 and 10); • Establish methodologies to collect and analyse data on BEPS and the actions to address it (Action 11); • Require disclo sure of aggressive tax planning arrangements (Action 12); and • Make dispute resolution mechanisms more effective (Action 14). December 2015 • Transfer pricing to limit base erosion via interest deductions (Action 4); • Counter harmful tax practices more effectively (Action 5); and • Develop a multilateral instrument to modify bilateral tax treaties (Action 15). GST and cross-border trade in services, intangibles and goods 9. The Digital Economy Task Force (as part of Action 1 under the Action Plan) and the OECD’s Working Party 9 on Consumption Taxes are recommending guidelines for determining the place of consumption and, therefore, the right to tax in relation to services and intangibles. This will be accompanied with a recommendation that foreign suppliers register for consumption tax purposes in the country of consumption and pay local value added tax or goods and services tax, primarily in relation to business-to-consumer services and intangibles (at this stage separately from the services and intangibles guidelines). Working Party 9 will also consider the question of the low-value threshold for goods. IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 5 10. We are intending to report to you following this month’s meeting of Working Party 9, before the planned release of an OECD public consultation document on services and intangibles in December. New Zealand timeline for deliverables relating to New Zealand domestic law reform Action Plan items 11. While New Zealand’s international tax policy settings are generally robust when viewed from a BEPS perspective, there are areas in which New Zealand is actively considering reform to its domestic rules to line up with the OECD’s recommendations under the Action Plan. These areas are: • Neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements (Action 2); and • Limit base erosion via interest deductions (Act ion 4), in particular, through the use of related-party and high-priced debt. 12. The OECD has already released recommendations for domestic rules to neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements (Actio n 2) (see paragraph 7 above). However, as with all of the recommendations released under the Action Plan to date, these recommendat ions have been released in draft. This is because the Act ion Plan aims to provide comprehensive solutions to BEPS, and the recommendations contained in the work already released may be affected by the remaining work scheduled for delivery in 2015. Under Act ion 2, there is also a commentary to be developed to explain how the recommended rules will operate in practice, and there are remaining technical issues to consider which may require refinement of the draft recommendations. 13. The OECD’s recommendations for domestic rules to limit base erosion via interest deductions (Act ion 4) are not due for release until September and December 2015. 14. The recommendations under Action 2 and 4 will deliver recommended best-practice domestic rules (unlike so me o f the recommendations under the Action Plan, which will result in changes to international standards, such as the OECD’s Model Tax Convention and its Commentary). This means that New Zealand will need to reform its do mest ic rules if it wishes to adopt the OECD’s recommendations. It would be possible to run ahead of the OECD’s timeline for final recommendations under these action items. However, it makes sense to wait for the OECD’s final recommendations before consulting on the merits of adopting those recommendations, or other similar rules, in order to: • Develop proposals that are guided by the final recommendations resulting from the Act ion Plan; • Ensure the most efficient and effective consultation process; and • Have the support of a final international consensus on the optimal design of the rules. IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 6 15. We propose to continue work on considering the need for possible reform to domestic rules aimed at neutralising hybrid mismatch arrangements and limiting base erosion via interest deductions through the use of related-party and high-priced debt, with the intention that public consultation documents would be released for each of these areas of work in late 2015 (following the release of the OECD’s final recommendations under the Act ion Plan). Other BEPS-related work 16. There are other areas of work, although not specific to an action item under the Action Plan, in which New Zealand’s current international tax settings could be improved to address BEPS concerns. These areas include: • Reviewing the taxation of foreign trusts; • Strengthening non-resident withholding tax (“NRWT”) rules; and • Improving the quality and usefulness of tax information via administrative measures (“ BEPS Compliance Measures”) to: o Require large corporates to file income tax returns earlier so that information can be analysed and issues identified sooner; o Require large corporates to disclose additional information that is readily available to them in a standard format so that it can be quickly analysed; and o Introduce a voluntary code of practice for large corporates which would likely include having good tax governance, a transparent relationship with Inland Revenue and avoid aggressive tax planning. 17. We intend to report to you regarding a review of the rules for taxing foreign trusts prior to the end of the year. 18. We also intend to report to you on the projects regarding strengthening the NRWT rules and the BEPS Compliance Measures with a view to public consultation documents being ready for release in mid-2015. These documents can be released prior to the finalisation of the OECD’s work under the Action Plan, because the recommendations coming out of the Action Plan do not specifically address these matters. Automatic exchange of information 19. G20 leaders announced the automatic exchange of information (“AEOI”) initiative in September 2013 and New Zealand joined in the adoption of a general statement of support for the initiative in May 2014. New Zealand has made a political commitment to begin exchanging information on a voluntary basis from 2018 and on a mandatory basis in 2019. This is in line with Australia’s implementation timeline. 20. AEOI will impose a new global standard that will require automatic exchange of information on financial assets based on the United States’ Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”) requirements. It will require financial institutions to undertake enhanced due diligence procedures on account holders and then to report ownership and further account IR2014/531: Timeline for BEPS-related tax policy work Page 7 information to their local tax authority, which will be automatically exchanged with applicable EOI treaty partners. 21. We are continuing to work through domestic implications including necessary legislative changes and the costs of systems implementation options. 22. A caveat to New Zealand’s political commitment is that it is subject to our ability to enact any necessary legislation by the end of 2016. This timing will ensure that any financial inst itutions that wish to comply on the voluntary timeline are legally able to commence customer due diligence and reporting to Inland Revenue from the beginning of 2017. We are therefore working towards introducing the required legislation in the bill planned for introduction in November 2015. 23. A second caveat to New Zealand’s political commitment is that it is subject to our ability to build the necessary Inland Revenue systems in time. In terms of systems implementation options, Inland Revenue’s intent has always been to build on the FATCA implementation solution due to the fact that AEOI is similar to FATCA in many respects, but on a much larger scale. As FATCA has now moved in the direction of third party vendor off- the-shelf software, we are in the process of determining whether this new software is a feasible option for AEOI. International tax treaty programme 24. In tandem with the work detailed above, we continue to work on updating our international tax treaty network. We expect that, in 2015, we are likely to be involved in negotiations for: • DTAs/protocols with Korea, Australia, Norway, Slovak Republic, China, Portugal and Samoa. • A TIEA with San Marino. We will also complete TIEA negotiations that are currently in progress with Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Grenada, Macao and Monaco. (Note that The Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters is now the preeminent exchange-of-information treaty, and as a result, it is unlikely that many further TIEAs will be entered into.) \[Information withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 to avoid prejudice to New Zealand’s internat ional relat ions.\] Consultation 25.

This report updates you in relation to these developments and the process going forward. The Action Plan addresses problems of tax minimisation and avoidance that have arisen from out-dated concepts, deliberate tax competition and poorly co-ordinated domestic rules. New Zealand has been contributing to the plan since its release in July 2013 and has also identified domestic reforms which would address weaknesses in our own international rules. The Action Plan is spread over 2014 and 2015 (refer to Appendix 1 for a summary). This September the OECD will release reports covering the following seven actions: • Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digital Economy (Action 1) • Neutralise the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (Action 2) • Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance (Action 5) • Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances (Action 6) • Modifications of Chapters I, II and VI of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Related to Transfer Pricing Aspects of Intangibles (Action 8) • Modifications of Chapters V of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Related to Documentation (Action 13) • Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties (Act ion 15) We support the approaches taken in all the reports on the basis that they are generally consistent with the principles of international taxation and administration that we follow. We note, however, that there is considerable work remaining to address outstanding technical and implementation issues. Further briefings on the detail of the papers will be provided to you T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 1 In Confidence ahead of their release in mid-September. Note the remaining Action Plan deliverables are due in September and December 2015. Of these actions New Zealand has been closely involved in the work on treaty abuse and transfer pricing because new rules will have important implications for the operation of our treaty networks. In addit ion, we are giving high priority to those actions that we expect to be important in terms of guiding our future domestic law reform programme such as those concerning hybrid mismatches, certain of the 2015 deliverables relating to interest deductibility and transfer pricing, and GST and online shopping. For instance, hybrid ent ities and instruments, which give rise to differing tax treatments in two countries resulting in double deductions or deductions without corresponding income, are a source of BEPS problems in New Zealand. The OECD is developing proto-type do mest ic law rules which link the domestic tax treatment of an entity or instrument with the tax outcomes in the other jurisdiction. These rules will be important in determining the design of New Zealand domest ic tax reforms to counter hybrid mismatch arrangements affecting our tax base. Similarly, while we have taken some measures to address profit shifting by multinat ionals taking excessive interest deductions in New Zealand, there are further issues to address. The work being undertaken by the OECD on best practice domestic law measures in relation to thin capitalisation rules and pricing of debt will be important to us in terms of guiding our future work in this area. In addition to the issues regarding interest deductibility we have a concern regarding the robustness of our own non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) rules in respect of interest. NRWT is an existing profit shifting prevention measure which applies a final layer of tax on interest payments made to other jurisdictions. However, we have identified deficiencies in New Zealand’s rules that can lead to the indefinite deferral of NRWT or the avoidance of NRWT entirely. New Zealand’s indirect tax base (GST) can also be considered in the BEPs context, in particular the impact of online shopping. In early 2015 the OECD will publish draft international guidelines for the application of GST/VAT regimes on cross border business-to- consumer transactions. Finally, we have also been working on a number of administrative measures that aim to improve the quality and usefulness of tax information. Work is underway to identify the costs and benefits of shortening the length of time large corporates have to file tax returns and introducing a new, standardised electronic disclo sure which would replace an existing and inefficient manual process. We have formed a technical reference group of software developers, tax agents and corporate tax managers to ensure that our proposals are robustly tested and widely socialised. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 2 In Confidence Consideration of the feasibility and usefulness of a code of practice for large corporates continues and includes both government-led and business-led models. As indicated in previous reports, we would recommend that any domestic reforms would be developed using the generic tax policy process. Recommended action We recommend you note the contents of this report. Steve Mack Carmel Peters Principal Advisor Policy Manager Tax Strategy Policy and Strategy Treasury Inland Revenue Hon Bill English Hon Todd McClay Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 3 In Confidence Background 1. In early 2012 the amount of tax being paid by multinational companies was in the spotlight following the global financial crisis, the bailouts in the financial services sector and the introduction of austerity measures in some European countries. In June 2012 the G20 called on the OECD to report on the “the need to prevent base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS)” and the resulting report, published in February 2013, announced the development of a BEPS Action Plan. 2. The 15 point Action Plan was released in July 2013 and proposed an ambitious programme of reforms over 2014 and 2015. In August 2013 officials set out a programme of potential do mest ic reforms to address weaknesses in New Zealand’s international tax rules (refer T2013/2059, PAS2013/152 – Taxation of multinationals – herein the August 2013 report). This report was subsequently released to the public in October 2013. 3. In June 2014 the OECD’s Committee on Fiscal Affairs (CFA) met to consider the seven 2014 deliverables in the Action Plan (refer IR2014/364 - OECD Committee on Fiscal Affairs meeting). The remaining deliverables in the Action Plan are due in September and December 2015 (refer Appendix 1). Release of the 2014 OECD BEPS Action Plan papers 4. Seven papers and an accompanying explanatory statement will be publically released in mid-September, ahead of the G20 Finance Minister’s 20-21 September 2014 meeting. Until this time the papers are in draft form and the OECD has requested countries refrain from publically commenting on the detail of the recommendations. Officials will prepare briefings for you on the paper closer to the time of release. 5. To date the focus of our domestic law reform efforts has been to develop our thinking through participating in the drafting the OECD’s BEPS action reports. It is desirable to propose reforms to New Zealand law that take into account the direct ion o f OECD proposals on related issues. Any recommendations for reform that result from this work should be subject to the normal generic tax policy process. 6. Overall we support the direction that the OECD BEPS work has taken to date. The suggested approaches are consistent with the general principles of international taxation and administration that New Zealand follows. The following sections comment on the papers being released in September, set out the priorities for 2015 and provide an update on the associated New Zealand law reform projects. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 4 In Confidence Action 1: Address the tax challenges of the digital economy (2014) 7. The September Act ion 1 paper will recommend against any solution that targets the digital economy specifically as it is increasingly indistinguishable from the wider economy. Some aspects of the digital economy exacerbate BEPS issues and these features will be considered under the relevant BEPS actions. Online shopping 8. The OECD’s work in relation to the online shopping issue has been referred to by the Digital Economy Task Force as part of a wider project relating to the VAT/GST treatment of cross-border supplies of services and intangibles. The project is being undertaken by the consumption taxes working party (Working Party 9) with the objective of producing international guidelines for both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) transactions. 9. The B2B guidelines, by setting out agreed approaches to determining the place of taxation, are intended to ensure that VAT/GST does not become a cost to businesses trading internationally given that VAT/GST is intended to be a tax on consumers, not businesses. The OECD signed off these guidelines earlier this year following public consultation and they were endorsed by a global forum in Tokyo in April. They also served as part of the background to the recent GST changes made in New Zealand to allow foreign businesses to claim back GST paid here. 10. Working Party 9 has now turned its attention to developing the B2C guidelines. It is expected that these will be finalised early next year and follow the same consultation process as the B2B guidelines. It is expected that OECD will provide a paper for public consultation early next year. It is likely that it will also set out rules around the place of supply and suggest that one approach to the collection of GST on intangibles such as digital downloads is for the foreign supplier to register for VAT/GST in the country of consumption. While the guidelines may not specifically address the question of low-value goods, Working Party 9 and the OECD more generally are aware of the relevance of the guidelines to this question. Action 2: Neutralise the Effects of Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements (2014) 11. The September Action 2 paper will recommend co-ordinated domestic law reform and updates to tax treaties which, once implemented, will eliminate hybrid mismatches. This will mean that taxpayers will no longer be able to claim two deductions for the same expense, claim a deduction without a corresponding tax liability, or generate multiple foreign tax credits from a single tax payment. Further implementation guidance in the form of a commentary will be released by September 2015. 12. New Zealand has participated in this work and is comfortable with the overall direction of the OECD proposals. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 5 In Confidence 13. While the main recommendations have been completed, considerable technical work will be needed in 2015 to develop the commentary and address implementation issues. Implications for domestic reform – hybrid mismatches 14. Our August 2013 report proposed to “explore whether New Zealand should restrict interest deductions on hybrid instruments where the interest payment is not taxed in the foreign jurisdiction” and “explore the need for an anti-arbitrage rule for offshore entities who seek double non-taxation of income or double deductions of expenditure by taking advantage of differences between countries’ tax rules.” These two lines of enquiry have been considered together by the OECD as hybrid mismatch arrangements. Issues 15. Action 2 of the Action Plan aims to neutralise the effects of hybrid mismatch arrangements by developing model treaty provisions and recommendations regarding the optimal design o f do mest ic tax rules. Hybrid mismatch arrangements use the different tax treatment of a hybrid entity or instrument between two or more countries to achieve double non-taxation or long term tax deferral, by, for example, creating two deductions for one borrowing (a double deduction (DD) outcome) or creating a deduction without a corresponding income inclusion (a deduction/no inclusion (D/NI) outcome). This is usually achieved as a result of a mismatch of domestic laws, but the application of double tax treaties can be used to enhance the tax benefit (for example, via the elimination or reduction of withholding taxes at source). It is often difficult to determine which of the countries involved has lost tax revenue, but there is a reduction of overall tax paid by the parties as a whole. 16. Notably, Inland Revenue has identified a number of arrangements being used by New Zealand taxpayers that exploit the different tax treatment of entities. One example is the use of an Australian limited partnership (“ALP”) between Australia and New Zealand (i.e. a hybrid entity) to achieve a DD outcome. 17. In terms of the taxation of hybrid instruments, officials previously recommended that there be no changes to current domestic settings, but that recommendation pre-dated the release of the Action Plan (refer PAD2012-216/T2012-2356 – Tax deductions for hybrid instruments issued by New Zealand companies). In addition, officials signalled that the advice would need revisiting if planned Australian law changes in this area, which could increase the fiscal cost to New Zealand of the use of hybrid instruments, proceeded. The Australian Government has recently released draft legislation indicating that those changes will proceed, 1 although the proposals have not yet passed into law. OECD Proposals 18. The September Action 2 paper provides: • a definition of a hybrid mismatch arrangement; • recommendations for countries seeking to amend their domestic law in order to: 1 Tax and Superannuation Laws Amendment (2014 Measures no. 4) Bill 2014. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 6 In Confidence o prevent mismatches from arising (general domestic rule recommendations) and o neutralise their effect (hybrid mismatch rules); and • a discussion of recommended changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention to deal with hybrid entities, and the interaction between domestic rules and the OECD Model Tax Convention. 19. The bulk of the paper is a discussion of the recommended hybrid mismatch rules. These are linking rules that seek to align the tax treatment of an instrument or entity with the tax outcomes in the counterparty jurisdiction, but otherwise do not disturb the tax or commercial outcomes. To ensure that the mismatch is eliminated even when not all the jurisdictions adopt the rules, the recommended rules are divided into a primary response and a defensive rule; the defensive rule applying when there are no hybrid mismatch rules in the other jurisdiction or the rules are not applied to the entity or arrangement. In brief: • For a D/NI outcome, the primary response should be to deny the deduction in the payer’s jurisdiction. If the payer jurisdiction does not respond, the defensive rule would require the payment to be included as ordinary income in the payee’s jurisdiction. • For a DD outcome, the primary response should be to deny the duplicate deduction in the parent jurisdiction. A defensive rule would require the deduction to be denied in the payer jurisdiction only if the parent jurisdiction did not adopt the primary response. • To deal with an indirect D/NI outcome, a payer jurisdiction should deny a deduction for a payment where the payee sets the payment off against expenditure under a hybrid mismatch arrangement. Next steps 20. The OECD’s recommendations, as set out in the paper, are due to be published in September 2014. A further commentary providing in depth explanations and examples detailing how the domestic rule recommendations will operate in practice, and considering some remaining technical issues, is intended to be published by September 2015. Addit ional work concerning the application of the rules to hybrid regulatory capital that is issued intra- group, and the interaction of the rules with CFC rules, is intended to be published together with the commentary. We will report to you further on whether these types of rules would be useful to adopt in the New Zealand context to counter BEPS. Action 4: Limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments (2015) 21. This action is due to report in 2015 and addresses a key risk to New Zealand of multinationals using debt (and other financial payments) to shift profit offshore. New Zealand has been and will continue to be closely involved. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 7 In Confidence Implications for d omestic reform - thin capitalisation 22. The August 2013 report proposed to “examine problems with tax rules (thin capitalisation and transfer pricing) designed to prevent profit shifting by non-residents who fund their New Zealand investment using related party debt.” As mentioned earlier, the relevant OECD analysis and proposals on this issue will not be finalised until September 2015 – although draft proposals will be published for consultation earlier. 23. New Zealand has thin capitalisation rules that, by and large, work effectively to limit profit shifting by non-residents through excessive interest deductions. These rules were recently amended to improve their robustness, most notably by extending them so they apply to non-residents who act together when investing into New Zealand. Previously the rules only applied to investments controlled by a single non-resident. Issues 24. Despite these recent amendments, the rules could benefit from a more fundamental review. A key issue is that, under the current rules, profit stripping can still be achieved by using debt with a very high interest rate. 25. The thin capitalisation rules place limits on the amount of debt that can be put into New Zealand. Transfer pricing rules should limit the interest rate charged on the loan. However, we are concerned that there is still considerable scope for most (or all) of a firm’s profits to be shifted out of New Zealand through loading debt up to the thin capitalisation limits and thus artificially weakening the local subsidiary’s relative financial position. The increased risk of default can result in more highly priced related party debt producing very high interest deductions despite meeting the requirements of the current thin capitalisation rules. Other issues being considered by the OECD 26. As well as the issue of high-priced debt, the OECD’s work on interest deductions will also consider other design aspects of thin capitalisation rules. This includes whether the allowable level of debt should be based on a company’s parent’s worldwide debt from external lenders, or if the rules should feature a so-called safe harbour. Safe harbours allow debt up to a certain level (such as 60% of assets) without need to defend the level of gearing by reference to company’s parent’s overall worldwide debt level. While they reduce compliance costs, it can be argued that they allow room for profit shifting as companies with little or no worldwide debt can nevertheless utilise related-party debt up to the safe harbour. 27. We will consider whether there is cause to review other aspects of our domestic thin capitalisation rules, such as the use of safe harbours, in light of the findings of the OECD. Next steps 28. We will continue to analyse the potential issues above (especially in light of our involvement with the on-going work at the OECD). This will include investigating the data available to help quantify the extent of each problem. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 8 In Confidence Implications for domestic reform - non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) 29. The August 2013 report proposed to “address problems with the application of non- resident withho lding tax to related party debt”. While the OECD is not looking at NRWT issues specifically we consider this work to be consistent with BEPS as it aligns with the general concern regarding tax reductions from international tax planning. 30. NRWT is deducted from interest that is paid from a New Zealand resident to an associated non-resident. NRWT acts as a safeguard against multinationals stripping profit from New Zealand through interest by imposing a final layer of tax on the payments. Cross- border interest payments between non-associated parties may be subject to approved issuer levy (AIL) which replaces the NRWT rate of generally 15% with a 2% levy charged to the borrower. AIL was introduced to lower the cost of capital for New Zealand borrowers and recognises that the issue of profit stripping between non-associated parties generally does not arise. Issues 31. We have identified areas where the NRWT regime does not appear to be working as intended including that: • the rules that trigger when NRWT is deducted are deficient; • the associated person test for NRWT may not be sufficient; and • payments made to non-residents operating a New Zealand branch are not subject to the rules. When NRWT is deducted 32. New Zealand’s rules for taxing debt (the “financial arrangement” rules) aim to match the income and expenditure of the lender and borrower by spreading the amounts across the term of the agreement regardless of when the payments are actually made or received. The general result is that a deduction for accrued interest is claimed by the borrower when the amount is taxable to the lender. 33. In a purely domestic setting these rules work well as both sides file returns and have their tax assessed. In a cross-border transaction where a New Zealand borrower pays interest to a non-resident lender the NRWT is withheld from the interest by the borrower and returned to Inland Revenue on the non-resident’s behalf. 34. The problem that arises is that NRWT only applies to interest when it is actually paid. Accordingly, a deduction may be available to a New Zealand borrower under the financial arrangement rules for interest without a corresponding obligation to withhold NRWT. In some cases it may be possible to create debt instruments where the terms are such that there is an indefinite deferral of the obligation to pay NRWT. 35. Another issue is that, for the purposes of NRWT, interest generally means a payment for money lent. Money lent includes an amount of money lent to a person (e.g. a standard loan) and an amount of credit given to a person (e.g. a deferral of an amount to be paid). We have encountered cases where payments that are economically equivalent to interest are not captured by these definitions. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 9 In Confidence Who is subject to NRWT 36. AIL is paid by the borrower at 2% and eliminates the NRWT obligation but only in cases where the parties to the transaction are not associated. We have concerns that this requirement for non-association can be circumvented 37. One concern relates to associated parties inserting an unrelated intermediary in a back- to-back loan arrangements in order to qualify for AIL when the loan when otherwise be between those associated parties and therefore subject to NRWT. 38. Another concern is the situation where the loan is made by a group of unrelated non- residents that, taken as a group, own a controlling stake in the New Zealand entity. If these non-residents are acting together they can shift profit from the New Zealand entity through interest deductions but pay AIL rather than NRWT as they are not considered associated with the New Zealand entity. This issue is similar to the problem recently addressed through changes to the thin capitalisation rules (refer PAS2013/181 - Thin capitalisation review: final decisions). NRWT and onshore branches 39. NRWT does not apply to any interest payments made to a non-resident that operates a branch in New Zealand. This means the withholding obligations for a New Zealand person borrowing from a New Zealand branch of a foreign bank are the same as if they borrowed from a New Zealand resident bank. This exemption applies because in many cases the interest will be subject to New Zealand tax as part of the branch’s income. 40. However, the exemption from NRWT applies even when the lending has no connection with the New Zealand branch. This means the exemption can be used by non-resident companies to lend to their New Zealand subsidiaries without needing to pay NRWT or treat the interest as income of the New Zealand branch (provided the parent company operates a branch in New Zealand). This is inappropriate. As the lending is from an associated non- resident, the resulting interest payments should attract NRWT. Next steps 41. This work is being considered in conjunction with the proposals being developed as part of BEPS action 4 (limit base erosion via interest deductions and other financial payments). We will continue to analyse the issues identified and will report to you again with proposed solutions and a consultation plan. Action 5: Countering Harmful Tax Practices More Effectively, Taking into Account Transparency and Substance (2014) 42. The September Action 5 paper will include a review of OECD member countries and identifies which countries have preferential tax regimes. A common feature of such regimes, particularly those relating to intellectual property, is that they allow a taxpayer to benefit from the regime wit h little, if any, economic activity occurring in the jurisdiction. The report recommends that taxpayers should be required to have “substantial activity” in the jurisdiction T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 10 In Confidence before benefitting from a preferential regime and provides guidance on how this criteria might be assessed. 43. We have monitored this work and we are comfortable with the direction taken. Action 6: Prevent treaty abuse (2014) 44. The September Action 6 paper will make a number of recommendations on countering general and specific forms of treaty abuse. These include: • Tax treaties should clearly state that the treaty is intended to prevent double taxation and double non-taxation or tax minimization through evasion or avoidance. • Tax treaties should include a rule that restricts the types of taxpayers that can access treaty benefits (commonly known as a limitation on benefits or LOB rule). • Tax treaties should include some form of general anti-abuse rule requiring that transactions do not have tax benefits as a principal purpose. 45. New Zealand is comfortable with the direction this work has taken. 46. In 2015 the focus will shift to drafting the specific changes to the OECD Model Tax Convention, and consideration of how changes to existing treaties could be expedited through the mult ilateral instrument. Action 7: Preventing the artificial avoidance of permanent establishment status (2015) 47. This action is due to report in 2015. The concept of a “permanent establishment” is a key component of the OECD Model Tax Convention. It sets the threshold for determining whether a non-resident has established enough of a presence in a jurisdiction to warrant being taxable in that jurisdiction. The meaning largely revolves around determining whether the non-resident has a fixed place of business in that jurisdiction. 48. Act ion 7 is focussed on the question of whether the definition of a “permanent establishment” is out-of-date or can be easily avoided. Any recommendations made in this report will involve changes to the Model Tax Convention and related commentaries. 49. New Zealand is participating in this work because it may have important implications for the future of our treaty network. As a net capital importer we are in favour of a permanent establishment rule that sets a reasonable boundary for establishing a taxing right in New Zealand. As things stand we favour a slightly broader concept of permanent establishment in our treaties than that contained in the OECD Model Tax Convention. 50. On the other hand, we recognise the need to strike the right balance. That is, to ensure that the concept of permanent establishment does not get so broad that non-residents wit h a T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 11 In Confidence very limited presence in a jurisdiction get caught up in that jurisdiction’s tax system – wit h all the result ing compliance costs. Actions 8, 9 and 10: Assure that transfer pricing outcomes are in line with value creation –intangibles, risk and capital, other high risk transactions (2014 and 2015) 51. The September Action 8 paper will make some progress on amending the transfer pricing guidelines to better assist taxpayers and revenue authorities dealing with intangible property transactions. This work is intrinsically linked to the 2015 deliverables relating to risk, capital and financial transactions and the full guidance on intangibles will not be delivered until September 2015. 52. New Zealand has been contributing to this work and we are pleased with the decision to defer some parts of the review so that it can be considered holistically along with related proposals. 53. The remaining work under the three actions points looks at some of the most complex and fundamental issues in base erosion and profit shifting – potential solutions may have far reaching implications for New Zealand. The OECD are planning to have five or six Working Party 6 meetings in 2015 and officials are considering at how they most effectively contribute to this work. Action 13: Modifications of Chapters V of the OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines Related to Documentation (2014) 54. The September Action 13 paper will recommend a three tiered approach to documentation, including: • a master file which outlines the multinational’s global structure, strategies and business model; • a country-by-country report which provides an overview of where employees, assets and activity is located and where taxes are paid and accrued; and • a local file which provides detailed information relevant to that jurisdiction. 55. The intention is that the master file and country-by-country report should be available to all jurisdict ions where the mult inat ional is present. 56. New Zealand supports the approach taken which balances the needs of revenue authorities, who want more information, with the needs to the private sector, who want to minimise compliance costs. 57. Some implementation issues still need to be resolved in 2015. Key amongst those issues is whether multinationals will file their master file and country by country report once T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 12 In Confidence in the ultimate parent entity’s jurisdiction or whether they will need to separately file the documents in all o f the jurisdict ions where they have a presence. If the former option is adopted then the information could be shared through treaty networks, however this would exclude many developing nations who do not have extensive treaty networks. However the latter option raises commercial confidentiality concerns as some nations lack the legal safeguards of tax secrecy or privacy legislation. Action 15: Developing a Multilateral Instrument to Modify Bilateral Tax Treaties (2014) 58. The September Action 15 paper will conclude that a mult ilateral instrument should be developed to at least incorporate changes to tax treaties. 59. New Zealand has not been closely involved in this work. We are pleased to see that a multilateral instrument is feasible as the alternative, renegotiating all treaties to incorporate BEPS proposals, would not be practical. Other BEPS actions 60. The remaining four actions not covered above relate to controlled foreign companies (Action 3), statistical and economic analysis of BEPS (Action 11), disclosure of aggressive tax positions (Action 12) and disputes resolution (Action 14). Officials continue to follow developments in these projects. Domestic administrative proposals 61. In addition to international and domestic policy reform, officials have been developing a number of administratively focused proposals which aim to improve transparency between Inland Revenue and large corporates. Targeted electronic disclosures 62. The August 2013 paper proposed to explore “improving information disclosure for large companies.” 63. Under current practice, large corporates file a Basic Compliance Package (BCP) when they submit their income tax return. The BCP includes the taxpayer’s financial statements, group structure and tax reconciliation. 64. There is no prescribed format for this information – generally it is received as PDFs of the relevant documents in as many different formats as there are taxpayers. Investigators then T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 13 In Confidence manually go through the documents in order to identify the key points of data needed to perform a risk assessment. 65. In a separate project Inland Revenue is developing an automated risk assessment tool which will be able to take key points of data from a standardised electronic form and quickly apply a range of tests and criteria to identify areas of concern. We are proposing to replace the existing manual BCP with a new disclosure which would be standardised, electronic and feed directly into Inland Revenue’s new automated risk assessment tool. 66. This will offer benefits both to Inland Revenue, through eliminating costly manual work and freeing up investigators to work on audits, and taxpayers, through faster risk assessments. Currently Inland Revenue takes between three to six months from receipt of a BCP to advise a taxpayer whether further information is needed or further action is being taken. We aim to reduce this to one to two months, providing earlier practical certainty to large corporates. Technical reference group 67. The accounting systems and software packages supporting large corporates and their tax agents are complex and often highly customised. Developers and tax managers need adequate lead in time to implement changes and particular care needs to be given when selecting what information should be disclosed. 68. In order to get early and expert advice in the lead up to preparing an issues paper we have recently formed a reference group including representatives from CAANZ, large corporates and the specialist software developers that provide products and services to them. It is our intention to work closely with this group so that the final product will extract the best information at the lowest compliance cost. Next steps 69. Officials intend to report on the costs and benefits of this proposal in November 2014 and will seek approval to consult with the wider public. Earlier returns 70. Tax returns are due four months after the end of the taxpayer’s income year (7 July for a standard 31 March balance date) unless covered by an extension of time. Large corporate taxpayers are almost entirely covered by the extension of time offered to all clients of tax agents – they are able to file their returns by the end of the next tax year. Example – ABC Co is a subsidiary of a US company and has a 1 January to 31 December income year to align with the standard US financial year. They have an “early” balance date as their income year ends before the 31 st of March. Their 2013 income year runs from 1/1/2012 to 31/12/2012. Their 2013 tax return is due on 31/03/2014 as this is the end of the next tax year (the tax year always runs from 1 April to 31 March). This gives the taxpayer 15 months from the end of their income year to file their tax return. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 14 In Confidence 71. This extension means that Inland Revenue may not receive an income tax return for up to 18 months after the end of the taxpayer’s income year. Detecting, preventing and addressing tax avoidance is made more difficult when the information analysed is delayed. This applies both in the operational (audits and investigations) and policy (trend identification) arenas. 72. New Zealand is out of step with the international norms for return filing due dates which are generally around six months from the end of the income year. This does not align with Inland Revenue’s strategic direction of being an intelligence-led, world class tax administration. 73. This proposal would see large corporates file their returns within six months of the end of their income year. Next steps 74. The technical reference group formed to support the targeted electronic disclosures proposal will also inform this work. Officials intend to report on the costs and benefits of this proposal in November 2014 and will seek approval to consult with the wider public. A code of practice for large corporates 75. The August report proposed to “consider introducing a code of practice for large corporates” and look specifically at the UK Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks (the UK code). In addition to the UK code we are also considering a business-led code of practice, in particular the statement produced by the Business and Industry Advisory Committee (BIAC), an independent international business association devoted to advising government policymakers at the OECD. We have had some informal conversations with stakeholders on what role such a code might have in New Zealand. Next steps 76. Officials will continue to evaluate the strengths and weakness of a code of practice, both government-led and business-led, and will report to you with recommendations later in the year. Other items 77. The August 2013 paper referred to a number of proposals that have either been formally deferred or have yet to be progressed. This section outlines the status of each proposal: • Examine incoherence relating to different tax treatment of “look through vehicles” and structures. This issue is being considered as part of the review of tax rules for closely-held companies. T2014/1412, IR2014/366: BEPS progress update Page 15 In Confidence • Design the active income exemption for offshore branches to ensure it does not facilitate profit shifting through repatriation of losses. This proposal has been deferred in the latest work programme report (refer IR2014/363, T2014/1188 Tax policy work programme update – July 2014). • Review the tax treatment of foreign trusts. Officials plan to progress this work in 2015. • Aligning AIL information disclosure with NRWT disclosure requirements. This proposal has been deferred in the latest work programme pending further work on the OECD automatic exchange of information project.

In the case of a trust that is a Financial Institution, an Equity Interest is considered to be held by any person treated as a settlor or beneficiary of all or a portion of the trust, or any other natural person exercising ultimate effective control over the trust. A Specified U.S. Person shall be treated as being a beneficiary of a foreign trust if such Specified U.S. Person has the right to receive directly or indirectly (for example, through a nominee) a mandatory distribution or may receive, directly or indirectly, a discretionary distribution from the trust. w) The term “Insurance Contract” means a contract (other than an Annuity Contract) under which the issuer agrees to pay an amount upon the occurrence of a specified contingency involving mortality, morbidity, accident, liability, or property risk. x) The term “Annuity Contract” means a contract under which the issuer agrees to make payments for a period of time determined in whole or in part by reference to the life expectancy of one or more individuals.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, an account shall not be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account if such account is not identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after application of the due diligence procedures in Annex I. dd) The term “Account Holder” means the person listed or identified as the holder of a Financial Account by the Financial Institution that maintains the account. A person, other than a Financial Institution, holding a Financial Account for the benefit or account of another person as agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or intermediary, is not treated as holding the account for purposes of this Agreement, and such other person is treated as holding the account. For purposes of the 14 immediately preceding sentence, the term “Financial Institution” does not include a Financial Institution organized or incorporated in a U.S. Territory. In the case of a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, the Account Holder is any person entitled to access the Cash Value or change the beneficiary of the contract.

This subparagraph 1(ee) shall be interpreted in accordance with the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. ff) The term “Specified U.S. Person” means a U.S. Person, other than: (i) a corporation the stock of which is regularly traded on one or more established securities markets; (ii) any corporation that is a member of the same expanded 15 affiliated group, as defined in section 1471(e)(2) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as a corporation described in clause (i); (iii) the United States or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality thereof; (iv) any State of the United States, any U.S. Territory, any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing; (v) any organization exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or an individual retirement plan as defined in section 7701(a)(37) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (vi) any bank as defined in section 581 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (vii) any real estate investment trust as defined in section 856 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (viii) any regulated investment company as defined in section 851 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or any entity registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (15 U.S.C. 80a-64); (ix) any common trust fund as defined in section 584(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (x) any trust that is exempt from tax under section 664(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or that is described in section 4947(a)(1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (xi) a dealer in securities, commodities, or derivative financial instruments (including notional principal contracts, futures, forwards, and options) that is registered as such under the laws of the United States or any State; (xii) a broker as defined in section 6045(c) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; or (xiii) any tax-exempt trust under a plan that is described in section 403(b) or section 457(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 16 gg) The term “Entity” means a legal person or a legal arrangement such as a trust. hh) The term “Non-U.S. Entity” means an Entity that is not a U.S. Person. ii) The term “U.S. Source Withholdable Payment” means any payment of interest (including any original issue discount), dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income, if such payment is from sources within the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment does not include any payment that is not treated as a withholdable payment in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations. jj) An Entity is a “Related Entity” of another Entity if either Entity controls the other Entity, or the two Entities are under common control. For this purpose control includes direct or indirect ownership of more than 50 percent of the vote or value in an Entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, New Zealand may treat an Entity as not a Related Entity of another Entity if the two Entities are not members of the same expanded affiliated group as defined in section 1471(e)(2) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. kk) The term “U.S. TIN” means a U.S. federal taxpayer identifying number. 17 ll) The term “New Zealand TIN” means a New Zealand taxpayer identifying number. mm) The term “Controlling Persons” means the natural persons who exercise control over an Entity.

Article 4 Application of FATCA to New Zealand Financial Institutions 1. Treatment of Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions. Each Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution shall be treated as complying with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code if New Zealand complies with its obligations under Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement with respect to such Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, and the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: 24 a) identifies U.S. Reportable Accounts and reports annually to the New Zealand Competent Authority the information required to be reported in subparagraph 2(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement in the time and manner described in Article 3 of this Agreement; b) for each of 2015 and 2016, reports annually to the New Zealand Competent Authority the name of each Nonparticipating Financial Institution to which it has made payments and the aggregate amount of such payments; c) complies with the applicable registration requirements on the IRS FATCA registration website; d) to the extent that a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is (i) acting as a qualified intermediary (for purposes of section 1441 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) that has elected to assume primary withholding responsibility under chapter 3 of subtitle A of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code; (ii) a foreign partnership that has elected to act as a withholding foreign partnership (for purposes of both sections 1441 and 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code); or (iii) a foreign trust that has elected to act as a withholding foreign trust (for purposes of both sections 1441 and 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), withholds 30 percent of any U.S. Source Withholdable Payment to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution; and e) in the case of a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution that is not described in subparagraph 1(d) of this Article and that makes a payment of, or acts as an intermediary with 25 respect to, a U.S. Source Withholdable Payment to any Nonparticipating Financial Institution, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution provides to any immediate payor of such U.S. Source Withholdable Payment the information required for withholding and reporting to occur with respect to such payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution with respect to which the conditions of this paragraph 1 are not satisfied shall not be subject to withholding under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code unless such Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution pursuant to subparagraph 2(b) of Article 5 of this Agreement. 2. Suspension of Rules Relating to Recalcitrant Accounts. The United States shall not require a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to withhold tax under section 1471 or 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with respect to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder (as defined in section 1471(d)(6) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code), or to close such account, if the U.S. Competent Authority receives the information set forth in subparagraph 2(a) of Article 2 of this Agreement, subject to the provisions of Article 3 of this Agreement, with respect to such account. 3. Specific Treatment of New Zealand Retirement Plans. The United States shall treat as deemed-compliant FFIs or exempt beneficial owners, as appropriate, for purposes of sections 1471 and 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code New Zealand retirement plans described in Annex II. For this purpose, a New Zealand retirement plan includes an Entity established or located in, and regulated by, New Zealand, or a predetermined contractual or legal arrangement, operated to provide 26 pension or retirement benefits or earn income for providing such benefits under the laws of New Zealand and regulated with respect to contributions, distributions, reporting, sponsorship, and taxation. 4. Identification and Treatment of Other Deemed-Compliant FFIs and Exempt Beneficial Owners. The United States shall treat each Non- Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution as a deemed-compliant FFI or as an exempt beneficial owner, as appropriate, for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. 5. Special Rules Regarding Related Entities and Branches That Are Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. If a New Zealand Financial Institution, that otherwise meets the requirements described in paragraph 1 of this Article or is described in paragraph 3 or 4 of this Article, has a Related Entity or branch that operates in a jurisdiction that prevents such Related Entity or branch from fulfilling the requirements of a participating FFI or deemed-compliant FFI for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code or has a Related Entity or branch that is treated as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution solely due to the expiration of the transitional rule for limited FFIs and limited branches under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations, such New Zealand Financial Institution shall continue to be in compliance with the terms of this Agreement and shall continue to be treated as a deemed-compliant FFI or exempt beneficial owner, as appropriate, for purposes of section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, provided that: 27 a) the New Zealand Financial Institution treats each such Related Entity or branch as a separate Nonparticipating Financial Institution for purposes of all the reporting and withholding requirements of this Agreement and each such Related Entity or branch identifies itself to withholding agents as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution; b) each such Related Entity or branch identifies its U.S. accounts and reports the information with respect to those accounts as required under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code to the extent permitted under the relevant laws pertaining to the Related Entity or branch; and c) such Related Entity or branch does not specifically solicit U.S. accounts held by persons that are not resident in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located or accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions that are not established in the jurisdiction where such Related Entity or branch is located, and such Related Entity or branch is not used by the New Zealand Financial Institution or any other Related Entity to circumvent the obligations under this Agreement or under section 1471 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as appropriate. 28 6. Coordination of Timing. Notwithstanding paragraphs 3 and 5 of Article 3 of this Agreement: a) New Zealand shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the calendar year with respect to which similar information is required to be reported to the IRS by participating FFIs pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; b) New Zealand shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which participating FFIs are required to report similar information to the IRS under relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; c) the United States shall not be obligated to obtain and exchange information with respect to a calendar year that is prior to the first calendar year with respect to which New Zealand is required to obtain and exchange information; and d) the United States shall not be obligated to begin exchanging information prior to the date by which New Zealand is required to begin exchanging information. 7. Coordination of Definitions with U.S. Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding Article 1 of this Agreement and the definitions provided in the Annexes to this Agreement, in implementing this Agreement, New Zealand may use, and may permit New Zealand Financial Institutions to use, a definition in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations in lieu of a corresponding definition in this Agreement, provided that such application would not frustrate the purposes of this Agreement. 29 Article 5 Collaboration on Compliance and Enforcement 1. Minor and Administrative Errors. Subject to any further terms set forth in a competent authority arrangement concluded pursuant to paragraph 6 of Article 3 of this Agreement, the Competent Authority of the United States may make an inquiry directly to a Reporting Financial Institution in New Zealand where it has reason to believe that minor or administrative errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete information reporting or resulted in other infringements of this Agreement. The competent authority arrangement may provide that the Competent Authority of the United States shall notify the Competent Authority of New Zealand when it makes such an inquiry of a Reporting Financial Institution in New Zealand regarding the Reporting Financial Institution’s compliance with the conditions set forth in this Agreement. The Competent Authority of New Zealand shall notify the Competent Authority of the United States where it has reason to believe that minor or administrative errors may have led to incorrect or incomplete reporting or resulted in other infringements of this Agreement. The Competent Authority of each Party shall apply its domestic law to obtain corrected and/or complete information or to resolve other infringements of this Agreement. 2. Significant Non-Compliance. a) A Competent Authority shall notify the Competent Authority of the other Party when the first-mentioned Competent Authority has determined that there is significant non- compliance with the obligations under this Agreement with respect to a Reporting Financial Institution in the other jurisdiction. The Competent Authority of such other Party 30 shall apply its domestic law (including applicable penalties) to address the significant non-compliance described in the notice. b) If, in the case of a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, such enforcement actions do not resolve the non- compliance within a period of 18 months after notification of significant non-compliance is first provided, the United States shall treat the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution pursuant to this subparagraph 2(b). 3. Reliance on Third Party Service Providers. Each Party may allow Reporting Financial Institutions to use third party service providers to fulfill the obligations imposed on such Reporting Financial Institutions by a Party, as contemplated in this Agreement, but these obligations shall remain the responsibility of the Reporting Financial Institutions. 4. Prevention of Avoidance. The Parties shall implement as necessary requirements to prevent Financial Institutions from adopting practices intended to circumvent the reporting required under this Agreement. Article 6 Mutual Commitment to Continue to Enhance the Effectiveness of Information Exchange and Transparency 1. Reciprocity. The Government of the United States acknowledges the need to achieve equivalent levels of reciprocal automatic information exchange with the Government of New Zealand. The Government of the United States is committed to further improve transparency and enhance 31 the exchange relationship with New Zealand by pursuing the adoption of regulations and advocating and supporting relevant legislation to achieve such equivalent levels of reciprocal automatic information exchange. 2. Treatment of Passthru Payments and Gross Proceeds. The Parties are committed to work together, along with Partner Jurisdictions, to develop a practical and effective alternative approach to achieve the policy objectives of foreign passthru payment and gross proceeds withholding that minimizes burden. 3. Development of Common Reporting and Exchange Model. The Parties are committed to working with Partner Jurisdictions and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on adapting the terms of this Agreement and other agreements between the United States and Partner Jurisdictions to a common model for automatic exchange of information, including the development of reporting and due diligence standards for financial institutions. 4. Documentation of Accounts Maintained as of June 30, 2014. With respect to Reportable Accounts maintained by a Reporting Financial Institution as of June 30, 2014: a) The United States commits to establish, by January 1, 2017, for reporting with respect to 2017 and subsequent years, rules requiring Reporting U.S. Financial Institutions to obtain and report the New Zealand TIN of each Account Holder of a New Zealand Reportable Account as required pursuant to subparagraph 2(b)(1) of Article 2 of this Agreement; and b) New Zealand commits to establish, by January 1, 2017, for reporting with respect to 2017 and subsequent years, rules 32 requiring Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to obtain the U.S. TIN of each Specified U.S. Person as required pursuant to subparagraph 2(a)(1) of Article 2 of this Agreement.

New Zealand shall be granted the benefit of any more favorable terms under Article 4 or Annex I of this Agreement relating to the application of FATCA to New Zealand Financial Institutions afforded to another Partner Jurisdiction under a signed bilateral agreement pursuant to which the other Partner Jurisdiction commits to undertake the same obligations as New Zealand described in Articles 2 and 3 of this Agreement, and subject to the same terms and conditions as described therein and in Articles 5 through 9 of this Agreement. 2. The United States shall notify New Zealand of any such more favorable terms, and such more favorable terms shall apply automatically under this Agreement as if such terms were specified in this Agreement and effective as of the date of the signing of the agreement incorporating the more favorable terms, unless New Zealand declines in writing the application thereof.

FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF NEW ZEALAND: FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 ANNEX I DUE DILIGENCE OBLIGATIONS FOR IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING ON U.S. REPORTABLE ACCOUNTS AND ON PAYMENTS TO CERTAIN NONPARTICIPATING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS I. General A. New Zealand shall require that Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions apply the due diligence procedures contained in this Annex I to identify U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions. B. For purposes of the Agreement, 1. All dollar amounts are in U.S. dollars and shall be read to include the equivalent in other currencies. 2. Except as otherwise provided herein, the balance or value of an account shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 3. Where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of June 30, 2014 under this Annex I, the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of that day, and where a balance or value threshold is to be determined as of the last day of a calendar year under this Annex I, 2 the relevant balance or value shall be determined as of the last day of the calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 4. Subject to subparagraph E(1) of section II of this Annex I, an account shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account beginning as of the date it is identified as such pursuant to the due diligence procedures in this Annex I. 5. Unless otherwise provided, information with respect to a U.S. Reportable Account shall be reported annually in the calendar year following the year to which the information relates. C. As an alternative to the procedures described in each section of this Annex I, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to rely on the procedures described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations to establish whether an account is a U.S. Reportable Account or an account held by a Nonparticipating Financial Institution. New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to make such election separately for each section of this Annex I either with respect to all relevant Financial Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts (such as by line of business or the location of where the account is maintained). 3 II. Preexisting Individual Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Preexisting Accounts held by individuals (“Preexisting Individual Accounts”). A. Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, the following Preexisting Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 1. Subject to subparagraph E(2) of this section, a Preexisting Individual Account with a balance or value that does not exceed $50,000 as of June 30, 2014. 2. Subject to subparagraph E(2) of this section, a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract with a balance or value of $250,000 or less as of June 30, 2014. 3. A Preexisting Individual Account that is a Cash Value Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract, provided the law or regulations of New Zealand or the United States effectively prevent the sale of such a Cash Value 4 Insurance Contract or an Annuity Contract to U.S. residents (e.g., if the relevant Financial Institution does not have the required registration under U.S. law, and the law of New Zealand requires reporting or withholding with respect to insurance products held by residents of New Zealand). 4. A Depository Account with a balance of $50,000 or less. B. Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value as of June 30, 2014, that Exceeds $50,000 ($250,000 for a Cash Value Insurance Contract or Annuity Contract), But Does Not Exceed $1,000,000 (“Lower Value Accounts”). 1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution for any of the following U.S. indicia: a) Identification of the Account Holder as a U.S. citizen or resident; b) Unambiguous indication of a U.S. place of birth; c) Current U.S. mailing or residence address (including a U.S. post office box); 5 d) Current U.S. telephone number; e) Standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States; f) Currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address; or g) An “in-care-of” or “hold mail” address that is the sole address the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution has on file for the Account Holder. In the case of a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account, an “in- care-of” address outside the United States or “hold mail” address shall not be treated as U.S. indicia. 2. If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, or the account becomes a High Value Account described in paragraph D of this section. 3. If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the electronic search, or if there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial 6 Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 4. Notwithstanding a finding of U.S. indicia under subparagraph B(1) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to treat an account as a U.S. Reportable Account if: a) Where the Account Holder information unambiguously indicates a U.S. place of birth, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); (2) A non-U.S. passport or other government-issued identification evidencing the Account Holder’s citizenship or nationality in a country other than the United States; and 7 (3) A copy of the Account Holder’s Certificate of Loss of Nationality of the United States or a reasonable explanation of: (a) The reason the Account Holder does not have such a certificate despite relinquishing U.S. citizenship; or (b) The reason the Account Holder did not obtain U.S. citizenship at birth. b) Where the Account Holder information contains a current U.S. mailing or residence address, or one or more U.S. telephone numbers that are the only telephone numbers associated with the account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and 8 (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. c) Where the Account Holder information contains standing instructions to transfer funds to an account maintained in the United States, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); and (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. d) Where the Account Holder information contains a currently effective power of attorney or signatory authority granted to a person with a U.S. address, has an “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address that is the sole address identified for the Account Holder, or has one or more U.S. telephone numbers (if a non-U.S. telephone number is also associated with the 9 account), the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution obtains, or has previously reviewed and maintains a record of: (1) A self-certification that the Account Holder is neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident for tax purposes (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or other similar agreed form); or (2) Documentary evidence, as defined in paragraph D of section VI of this Annex I, establishing the Account Holder’s non- U.S. status. C. Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Individual Accounts That Are Lower Value Accounts. 1. Review of Preexisting Individual Accounts that are Lower Value Accounts for U.S. indicia must be completed by June 30, 2016. 2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Individual Account that is a Lower Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless subparagraph B(4) of this section applies. 10 3. Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. D. Enhanced Review Procedures for Preexisting Individual Accounts With a Balance or Value That Exceeds $1,000,000 as of June 30, 2014, or December 31 of 2015 or Any Subsequent Year (“High Value Accounts”). 1. Electronic Record Search. The Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must review electronically searchable data maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section. 2. Paper Record Search. If the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s electronically searchable databases include fields for, and capture all of the information described in, subparagraph D(3) of this section, then no further paper record search is required. If the electronic databases do not capture all of this information, then with respect to a High Value Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must also review the current customer master file and, to the extent not contained in the 11 current customer master file, the following documents associated with the account and obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution within the last five years for any of the U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section: a) The most recent documentary evidence collected with respect to the account; b) The most recent account opening contract or documentation; c) The most recent documentation obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures or for other regulatory purposes; d) Any power of attorney or signature authority forms currently in effect; and e) Any standing instructions to transfer funds currently in effect. 3. Exception Where Databases Contain Sufficient Information. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to perform the paper record search described in subparagraph D(2) of this section if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s electronically searchable information includes the following: 12 a) The Account Holder’s nationality or residence status; b) The Account Holder’s residence address and mailing address currently on file with the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution; c) The Account Holder’s telephone number(s) currently on file, if any, with the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution; d) Whether there are standing instructions to transfer funds in the account to another account (including an account at another branch of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution or another Financial Institution); e) Whether there is a current “in-care-of” address or “hold mail” address for the Account Holder; and f) Whether there is any power of attorney or signatory authority for the account. 4. Relationship Manager Inquiry for Actual Knowledge. In addition to the electronic and paper record searches described above, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat as a U.S. Reportable Account any High Value Account assigned to a relationship manager (including any Financial Accounts aggregated with such High Value Account) if 13 the relationship manager has actual knowledge that the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person. 5. Effect of Finding U.S. Indicia. a) If none of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, and the account is not identified as held by a Specified U.S. Person in subparagraph D(4) of this section, then no further action is required until there is a change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account. b) If any of the U.S. indicia listed in subparagraph B(1) of this section are discovered in the enhanced review of High Value Accounts described above, or if there is a subsequent change in circumstances that results in one or more U.S. indicia being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. c) Except for Depository Accounts described in subparagraph A(4) of this section, any 14 Preexisting Individual Account that has been identified as a U.S. Reportable Account under this section shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account in all subsequent years, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. E. Additional Procedures Applicable to High Value Accounts. 1. If a Preexisting Individual Account is a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account by June 30, 2015. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account on or before December 31, 2014, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to 2014 in the first report on the account and on an annual basis thereafter. In the case of an account identified as a U.S. Reportable Account after December 31, 2014 and on or before June 30, 2015, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to report information about such account with respect to 2014, but must report information about the account on an annual basis thereafter. 2. If a Preexisting Individual Account is not a High Value Account as of June 30, 2014, but becomes a High 15 Value Account as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must complete the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section with respect to such account within six months after the last day of the calendar year in which the account becomes a High Value Account. If based on this review such account is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must report the required information about such account with respect to the year in which it is identified as a U.S. Reportable Account and subsequent years on an annual basis, unless the Account Holder ceases to be a Specified U.S. Person. 3. Once a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution applies the enhanced review procedures described in paragraph D of this section to a High Value Account, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is not required to re-apply such procedures, other than the relationship manager inquiry described in subparagraph D(4) of this section, to the same High Value Account in any subsequent year. 4. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a High Value Account that results in one or more U.S. indicia described in subparagraph B(1) of this section being associated with the account, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it elects 16 to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section and one of the exceptions in such subparagraph applies with respect to that account. 5. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must implement procedures to ensure that a relationship manager identifies any change in circumstances of an account. For example, if a relationship manager is notified that the Account Holder has a new mailing address in the United States, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is required to treat the new address as a change in circumstances and, if it elects to apply subparagraph B(4) of this section, is required to obtain the appropriate documentation from the Account Holder. F. Preexisting Individual Accounts That Have Been Documented for Certain Other Purposes. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution that has previously obtained documentation from an Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status as neither a U.S. citizen nor a U.S. resident in order to meet its obligations under a qualified intermediary, withholding foreign partnership, or withholding foreign trust agreement with the IRS, or to fulfill its obligations under chapter 61 of Title 26 of the United States Code, is not required to perform the procedures described in subparagraph B(1) of this section with respect to Lower Value Accounts or subparagraphs D(1) through D(3) of this section with respect to High Value Accounts. 17 III. New Individual Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts among Financial Accounts held by individuals and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Individual Accounts”). A. Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified, or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Individual Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, the following New Individual Accounts are not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as U.S. Reportable Accounts: 1. A Depository Account unless the account balance exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. 2. A Cash Value Insurance Contract unless the Cash Value exceeds $50,000 at the end of any calendar year or other appropriate reporting period. B. Other New Individual Accounts. With respect to New Individual Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, upon account opening (or within 90 days after the end of the calendar year in which the account ceases to be described in paragraph A of this section), the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self- certification, which may be part of the account opening documentation, that allows the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to determine whether the Account Holder 18 is resident in the United States for tax purposes (for this purpose, a U.S. citizen is considered to be resident in the United States for tax purposes, even if the Account Holder is also a tax resident of another jurisdiction) and confirm the reasonableness of such self-certification based on the information obtained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution in connection with the opening of the account, including any documentation collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. 1. If the self-certification establishes that the Account Holder is resident in the United States for tax purposes, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account and obtain a self-certification that includes the Account Holder’s U.S. TIN (which may be an IRS Form W-9 or other similar agreed form). 2. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a New Individual Account that causes the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the original self-certification is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution cannot rely on the original self- certification and must obtain a valid self-certification that establishes whether the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident for U.S. tax purposes. If the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is unable to obtain a valid self-certification, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. 19 IV. Preexisting Entity Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Preexisting Accounts held by Entities (“Preexisting Entity Accounts”). A. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all Preexisting Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such an election, a Preexisting Entity Account with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported as a U.S. Reportable Account until the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000. B. Entity Accounts Subject to Review. A Preexisting Entity Account that has an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, and a Preexisting Entity Account that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 but the account balance or value of which exceeds $1,000,000 as of the last day of 2015 or any subsequent calendar year, must be reviewed in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section. C. Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. With respect to Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, only accounts that are held by one or more Entities that are Specified U.S. 20 Persons, or by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents shall be treated as U.S. Reportable Accounts. In addition, accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions shall be treated as accounts for which aggregate payments as described in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement are reported to the New Zealand Competent Authority. D. Review Procedures for Identifying Entity Accounts With Respect to Which Reporting Is Required. For Preexisting Entity Accounts described in paragraph B of this section, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must apply the following review procedures to determine whether the account is held by one or more Specified U.S. Persons, by Passive NFFEs with one or more Controlling Persons who are U.S. citizens or residents, or by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions: 1. Determine Whether the Entity Is a Specified U.S. Person. a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person. For this purpose, information indicating that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person includes a U.S. place of incorporation or organization, or a U.S. address. 21 b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a U.S. Person, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account unless it obtains a self-certification from the Account Holder (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or a similar agreed form), or reasonably determines based on information in its possession or that is publicly available, that the Account Holder is not a Specified U.S. Person. 2. Determine Whether a Non-U.S. Entity Is a Financial Institution. a) Review information maintained for regulatory or customer relationship purposes (including information collected pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures) to determine whether the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution. b) If the information indicates that the Account Holder is a Financial Institution, or the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account. 22 3. Determine Whether a Financial Institution Is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution Payments to Which Are Subject to Aggregate Reporting Under Subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. a) Subject to subparagraph D(3)(b) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, as applicable. In such case, no further review, identification, or reporting is required with respect to the account. b) If the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. 23 c) If the Account Holder is not a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution, then the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the Account Holder as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution payments to which are reportable under subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement, unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution: (1) Obtains a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or similar agreed form) from the Account Holder that it is a certified deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (2) In the case of a participating FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI, verifies the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number on the published IRS FFI list. 4. Determine Whether an Account Held by an NFFE Is a U.S. Reportable Account. With respect to an Account Holder of a Preexisting Entity Account that is not identified as either a U.S. Person or a Financial Institution, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must identify (i) whether the Account Holder has Controlling Persons, (ii) whether the Account 24 Holder is a Passive NFFE, and (iii) whether any of the Controlling Persons of the Account Holder is a U.S. citizen or resident. In making these determinations the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must follow the guidance in subparagraphs D(4)(a) through D(4)(d) of this section in the order most appropriate under the circumstances. a) For purposes of determining the Controlling Persons of an Account Holder, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may rely on information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures. b) For purposes of determining whether the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder to establish its status, unless it has information in its possession or that is publicly available, based on which it can reasonably determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE. c) For purposes of determining whether a Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident for tax purposes, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may rely on: 25 (1) Information collected and maintained pursuant to AML/KYC Procedures in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that does not exceed $1,000,000; or (2) A self-certification (which may be on an IRS Form W-8 or W-9, or on a similar agreed form) from the Account Holder or such Controlling Person in the case of a Preexisting Entity Account held by one or more NFFEs with an account balance or value that exceeds $1,000,000. d) If any Controlling Person of a Passive NFFE is a U.S. citizen or resident, the account shall be treated as a U.S. Reportable Account. E. Timing of Review and Additional Procedures Applicable to Preexisting Entity Accounts. 1. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that exceeds $250,000 as of June 30, 2014 must be completed by June 30, 2016. 2. Review of Preexisting Entity Accounts with an account balance or value that does not exceed $250,000 as of June 30, 2014, but exceeds $1,000,000 as of December 31 of 2015 or any subsequent year, must be completed within six months after the last day of 26 the calendar year in which the account balance or value exceeds $1,000,000. 3. If there is a change of circumstances with respect to a Preexisting Entity Account that causes the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution to know, or have reason to know, that the self-certification or other documentation associated with an account is incorrect or unreliable, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must redetermine the status of the account in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph D of this section. V. New Entity Accounts. The following rules and procedures apply for purposes of identifying U.S. Reportable Accounts and accounts held by Nonparticipating Financial Institutions among Financial Accounts held by Entities and opened on or after July 1, 2014 (“New Entity Accounts”). A. Entity Accounts Not Required to Be Reviewed, Identified or Reported. Unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution elects otherwise, either with respect to all New Entity Accounts or, separately, with respect to any clearly identified group of such accounts, where the implementing rules in New Zealand provide for such election, a credit card account or a revolving credit facility treated as a New Entity Account is not required to be reviewed, identified, or reported, provided that the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution maintaining such account implements policies and procedures to prevent an account balance owed to the Account Holder that exceeds $50,000. 27 B. Other New Entity Accounts. With respect to New Entity Accounts not described in paragraph A of this section, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must determine whether the Account Holder is: (i) a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; or (iv) an Active NFFE or Passive NFFE. 1. Subject to subparagraph B(2) of this section, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may determine that the Account Holder is an Active NFFE, a New Zealand Financial Institution, or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution reasonably determines that the Account Holder has such status on the basis of the Account Holder’s Global Intermediary Identification Number or other information that is publicly available or in the possession of the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, as applicable. 2. If the Account Holder is a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. 28 3. In all other cases, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must obtain a self-certification from the Account Holder to establish the Account Holder’s status. Based on the self-certification, the following rules apply: a) If the Account Holder is a Specified U.S. Person, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. b) If the Account Holder is a Passive NFFE, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must identify the Controlling Persons as determined under AML/KYC Procedures, and must determine whether any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident on the basis of a self- certification from the Account Holder or such person. If any such person is a U.S. citizen or resident, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must treat the account as a U.S. Reportable Account. c) If the Account Holder is: (i) a U.S. Person that is not a Specified U.S. Person; (ii) subject to subparagraph B(3)(d) of this section, a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution; (iii) a participating FFI, a deemed-compliant FFI, or an exempt beneficial owner, as those terms are defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations; 29 (iv) an Active NFFE; or (v) a Passive NFFE none of the Controlling Persons of which is a U.S. citizen or resident, then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, and no reporting is required with respect to the account. d) If the Account Holder is a Nonparticipating Financial Institution (including a New Zealand Financial Institution or other Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution treated by the IRS as a Nonparticipating Financial Institution), then the account is not a U.S. Reportable Account, but payments to the Account Holder must be reported as contemplated in subparagraph 1(b) of Article 4 of the Agreement. VI. Special Rules and Definitions. The following additional rules and definitions apply in implementing the due diligence procedures described above: A. Reliance on Self-Certifications and Documentary Evidence. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may not rely on a self-certification or documentary evidence if the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution knows or has reason to know that the self-certification or documentary evidence is incorrect or unreliable. B. Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this Annex I. 30 1. AML/KYC Procedures. “AML/KYC Procedures” means the customer due diligence procedures of a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution pursuant to the anti-money laundering or similar requirements of New Zealand to which such Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is subject. 2. NFFE. An “NFFE” means any Non-U.S. Entity that is not an FFI as defined in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations or is an Entity described in subparagraph B(4)(j) of this section, and also includes any Non-U.S. Entity that is established in New Zealand or another Partner Jurisdiction and that is not a Financial Institution. 3. Passive NFFE. A “Passive NFFE” means any NFFE that is not (i) an Active NFFE, or (ii) a withholding foreign partnership or withholding foreign trust pursuant to relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations. 4.

Preexisting Account. A “Preexisting Account” means a Financial Account maintained by a Reporting Financial Institution as of June 30, 2014. C. Account Balance Aggregation and Currency Translation Rules. 1. Aggregation of Individual Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an individual, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is required to aggregate all Financial Accounts maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. Each holder of a jointly held Financial Account shall be attributed the entire balance or value of the jointly held Financial Account for purposes of applying the aggregation requirements described in this paragraph 1. 35 2. Aggregation of Entity Accounts. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by an Entity, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is required to take into account all Financial Accounts that are maintained by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution, or by a Related Entity, but only to the extent that the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution’s computerized systems link the Financial Accounts by reference to a data element such as client number or taxpayer identification number, and allow account balances or values to be aggregated. 3. Special Aggregation Rule Applicable to Relationship Managers. For purposes of determining the aggregate balance or value of Financial Accounts held by a person to determine whether a Financial Account is a High Value Account, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is also required, in the case of any Financial Accounts that a relationship manager knows, or has reason to know, are directly or indirectly owned, controlled, or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person, to aggregate all such accounts. 4. Currency Translation Rule. For purposes of determining the balance or value of Financial Accounts denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must convert the U.S. dollar threshold 36 amounts described in this Annex I into such currency using a published spot rate determined as of the last day of the calendar year preceding the year in which the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution is determining the balance or value. D. Documentary Evidence. For purposes of this Annex I, acceptable documentary evidence includes any of the following: 1. A certificate of residence issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) of the jurisdiction in which the payee claims to be a resident. 2.

With respect to an Entity, any official documentation issued by an authorized government body (for example, a government or agency thereof, or a municipality) that includes the name of the Entity and either the address of its principal office in the jurisdiction (or U.S. Territory) in which it claims to be a resident or the jurisdiction (or U.S. Territory) in which the Entity was incorporated or organized. 37 4. With respect to a Financial Account maintained in a jurisdiction with anti-money laundering rules that have been approved by the IRS in connection with a QI agreement (as described in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations), any of the documents, other than a Form W-8 or W-9, referenced in the jurisdiction’s attachment to the QI agreement for identifying individuals or Entities. 5. Any financial statement, third-party credit report, bankruptcy filing, or U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission report. E. Alternative Procedures for Financial Accounts Held by Individual Beneficiaries of a Cash Value Insurance Contract. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution may presume that an individual beneficiary (other than the owner) of a Cash Value Insurance Contract receiving a death benefit is not a Specified U.S. Person and may treat such Financial Account as other than a U.S. Reportable Account unless the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Specified U.S. Person. A Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution has reason to know that a beneficiary of a Cash Value Insurance Contract is a Specified U.S. Person if the information collected by the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution and associated with the beneficiary contains U.S. indicia as described in subparagraph (B)(1) of section II of this Annex I. If a Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the beneficiary is a Specified U.S. Person, the Reporting New Zealand Financial Institution must 38 follow the procedures in subparagraph B(3) of section II of this Annex I. F. Reliance on Third Parties. Regardless of whether an election is made under paragraph C of section I of this Annex I, New Zealand may permit Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions to rely on due diligence procedures performed by third parties, to the extent provided in relevant U.S. Treasury Regulations. 1 ANNEX II NON-REPORTING NEW ZEALAND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND ACCOUNTS General The following Entities shall be treated as exempt beneficial owners or deemed-compliant FFIs, as the case may be, and the following accounts are excluded from the definition of Financial Accounts. I. Exempt Beneficial Owners other than Funds. The following Entities shall be treated as Non-Reporting New Zealand Financial Institutions and as exempt beneficial owners for purposes of sections 1471 and 1472 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, other than with respect to a payment that is derived from an obligation held in connection with a commercial financial activity of a type engaged in by a Specified Insurance Company, Custodial Institution, or Depository Institution. A. Governmental Entities. The government of New Zealand, any political subdivision of New Zealand (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes a state, province, county, region, or municipality), or any wholly owned agency or instrumentality of New Zealand or any one or more of the foregoing (each, a “New Zealand Governmental Entity”). This 2 category is comprised of the integral parts, controlled entities, and political subdivisions of New Zealand. 1. An integral part of New Zealand means any person, organization, agency, bureau, fund, instrumentality, or other body, however designated, that constitutes a governing authority of New Zealand.

Tax Pooling – Summary 1180583\_2 Tax Pooling Review – Summary 19 September 2014 Inland Revenue September 2014 Page ii Contents Executive summary3 Next steps5 Introduction6 How tax pooling operates10 Key players in the tax pooling industry12 Tax Pooling – Summary Page 3 Executive summary Background Tax pooling was first introduced in 2003 to allow taxpayers an avenue to mitigate the financial consequences that arise as a result of getting their provisional tax estimation wrong. This is done by allowing taxpayers to access better rates through approved intermediaries that arbitrage the low overpayment UOMI rate and high underpayment UOMI rate. Tax pooling appears to be operating with efficiency and no significant issues have arisen to date. However, given the growth in the use of tax pooling by taxpayers as well as its continuing evolution, consideration should be given as to whether there are any potential risks that may not be well understood by key stakeholders. This report considers the operation of tax pooling and provides a summary of the lifecycle of the various tax pooling transactions. It also identifies the key risks associated with tax pooling. Overall finding of Phase One Tax pooling is operating well and is a service and option that is valued and used extensively by taxpayers. Tax pooling appears to be achieving the policy objectives envisaged when it was developed. Tax pooling has evolved beyond the sale and purchase of tax Tax pooling continues to meet the policy objectives that it set out to achieve. That is, it allows taxpayers to mitigate their exposure to UOMI costs as a result of the uncertainty they faced in trying to estimate their provisional tax obligations. This is effectively delivered by the sale and purchase of tax in a tax pool. However, additional transaction types have been developed including the provision of tax finance to taxpayers to allow them to manage cash flow issues. Tax finance was not anticipated by policy makers at the time tax pooling was first introduced. Further consideration should be given to tax finance to ensure it does not result in additional risks for Inland Revenue (IR) as well as other key stakeholders. There is minimal regulatory oversight on tax pooling intermediaries Tax pooling intermediaries are subject to scrutiny when they first apply to become an intermediary. However, following approval there is little regulatory oversight imposed on the intermediaries. In particular, no checks are done by IR to ensure that the tax pooling intermediary continues to meet the legislative requirements imposed under the tax legislation. The only ongoing regulatory oversight would appear to be in relation to the anti- money laundering and countering financing of terrorism frameworks. Consideration should be given to whether further checks should be performed to ensure the intermediaries are continuing to meet the standards set out in the legislation. For example, adequate records are being kept to provide confidence that taxpayers would be able to access their funds when required. Further, IR should establish processes to ensure that if the legislative standards are not met, IR is aware and able to wind up the intermediary if required. Consideration should also be given as to whether further regulatory oversight is necessary given the nature of the services that are provided. The risk of something going wrong may be low but the consequences would likely be significant The risk of significant issues arising from tax pooling appears to be low. This is in part due to the industry practices that have been adopted by the tax pooling intermediaries themselves, for example the use of independent trustees. However, the consequences should something go wrong would likely be significant for IR in terms of reputational risk and could extend to other government agencies. This is on the basis that there may be a potential perception that there has not been adequate government oversight over tax pooling to ensure taxpayers’ funds are protected against things such as fraudulent activities. In addition, public perception may be that any issues that arise are the responsibility of IR to remedy. IR should therefore be clear that it is comfortable with the level of regulatory scrutiny that is imposed on tax pooling intermediaries when balanced with the level of risk and the potential consequences. There is a lack of transparency around tax pooling There is very limited information publically available that comprehensively explains tax pooling and the various services that are provided. While tax pooling may be understood at a conceptual level, it is difficult to access the information required to fully understand the intricacy of the services provided. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 4 There may be legitimate commercial reasons for the lack of transparency. However, care should be taken that IR is fully informed and understands all of the services that are provided by tax pooling intermediaries. There are some operational risks within IR There are some risks in the way IR currently operates tax pooling. These include manual calculations being performed, a heavy reliance on certain key personnel within IR to operate tax pooling, lack of reconciliations being performed on tax pooling balances with the tax pools, and the potential for policy decisions to be made by operational staff. IR should ensure that adequate safeguards are in place to ensure that tax pooling operates as intended. This may include IR having more oversight of the tax pooling process as a whole, as well as developing reconciliation procedures with the tax pooling intermediaries. Difficulties in revenue forecast Tax pooling provides challenges for revenue forecasting as funds deposited into a tax pool are not recognised as tax revenue under the current processes. As tax pooling continues to grow, the issue with revenue forecasting will only become more significant. However, it was recognised that revenue recognition for year- end purposes should not be skewed by tax pooling as all tax pooling transactions would need to have been completed before IR year end (30 June). IR may wish to investigate whether additional information or data sharing, internally or with tax pooling intermediaries could eliminate some of the risks currently associated with how tax pooling interacts with revenue recognition. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 5 Next steps Phase 1 of the tax pooling review has identified that tax pooling is operating well and is a service and option that is valued and used extensively by taxpayers. Tax pooling appears to be achieving the policy objectives envisaged when it was developed. Our review has identified certain risks that exist within the tax pooling framework. IR should consider these risks and determine whether further analysis should be undertaken in order to better understand how these risks are currently being managed, the consequences of the exposure to these risks and, if appropriate, how these risks may be mitigated. In the event that IR considers further analysis should be undertaken, we would recommend the following approach: perform more in depth analysis to understand how these risks are currently being managed by the key stakeholders such as IR, tax pooling intermediaries and trustees identify the potential areas of risk exposure by highlighting the significant areas of unmitigated risk and understanding the consequences of this exposure consideration of opportunities that would enhance tax pooling to better meet stakeholder requirements and better manage risks. Potential solutions While Phase 1 of the review is focused on the identification of risks, we provide some high level comments on potential solutions that IR may wish to consider. We note that these are merely observations we have made to date as part of the risk identification phase and therefore should not be taken as the complete suite of potential solutions. As referred to above, this may require IR to undertake a second phase of work. IR should consider expanding the regulatory oversight it has over tax pooling intermediaries. Our initial view is that IR is best placed to provide that oversight as tax pooling is fundamentally part of the tax system. This may include annual checks to be performed by the intermediaries that they continue to meet the legislative requirements, together with some form of quality assurance programme over systems and processes. Periodic reconciliation procedures should be adopted between IR and the tax pooling intermediaries/trustees to ensure the systems are operating as they should. IR should increase its understanding of the commercial aspects of tax pooling and the policy objective of tax pooling to ensure that there is a clear understanding within IR of how the various services offered by tax pooling intermediaries operate, and how that delivers the policy. IR, Treasury and the tax pooling intermediaries should hold a workshop to discuss the revenue forecasting issue and agree a process to resolve the forecasting challenges. IR should consider making the use of an independent trustee as a legislative requirement on the tax pooling intermediaries. Recognising that some tax pooling transactions have characteristics of financial instruments IR should hold further discussions with the Financial Markets Authority to explore any concerns that departments may have in relation to the services that are provided by the tax pooling intermediaries, for example, tax financing. IR should maintain regular interactions with other agencies that have a role in the regulation of tax pooling intermediaries, including the Department of Internal Affairs, to ensure there is a good general overview of the tax pooling industry. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 6 Introduction Background New Zealand, in common with many other jurisdictions, has a regime in place which requires tax to be paid throughout the year as profits arise based on an estimation of total annual profit. Under this regime, provisional tax is required to be paid by taxpayers (including companies and individuals) if their residual tax liability for the income year is over a certain level. 1 The provisional tax is payable in three equal instalments throughout the year. Given the volatility of business profits, IR allows three methods for taxpayers to calculate the amount of provisional tax that is payable for an income year. Taxpayers have the option to choose one of the methods outlined below. The “standard calculation” method is the default calculation method which bases the provisional tax payable for the year on a percentage uplift of the most recent residual income tax. Taxpayers may base payments on their own estimates of actual profit levels. Taxpayers may base payments on a percentage of their GST taxable supplies (“GST ratio method”). How to ensure taxpayers make accurate provisional tax payments throughout the year? A combined regime that imposes interest (referred to as use-of-money interest or “UOMI”) and/or penalties is in place to ensure taxpayers are incentivised to make accurate provisional tax payments. Broadly, penalties are imposed if payments are made late 2 or if the amount of provisional tax paid is not a reasonable estimate of tax payable. 3 1 The majority of individual taxpayers do not fall into the provisional tax regime as tax is fully withheld at source on income received by wage and salary earners and bank interest. 2 The late payment penalty has two components: UOMI is payable or receivable to the extent that actual taxable income is more or less than the estimated amount, therefore resulting in an underpayment or overpayment of provisional tax. The variability in business profits means that UOMI often arises even if detailed estimate calculations are undertaken by taxpayers. The UOMI rate-setting framework is very much focused on ensuring the right incentives are in place to encourage taxpayers to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The underpayment rate attempts to reflect the fact that the government is an involuntary and unsecured lender, and is unable to assess the actual credit-worthiness of each taxpayer. The overpayment rate is designed to discourage taxpayers from using IR as an investment opportunity. The underpayment UOMI rate is set using the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate, plus 250 basis points. 4 The overpayment rate is based on the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate, minus 100 basis points. Linking UOMI rates to RBNZ rates ensures that the UOMI rates reflect overall movements in market interest rates. The current UOMI rate for the underpayment of tax is 8.4% per annum, and for the overpayment of tax is 1.75% per annum. There is a significant differential between the underpayment and overpayment rates of 6.65%. Initial late payment penalty – 1% is added on the day after the due date then a further 4% is added to the unpaid tax and the late payment penalty already imposed at the end of the seventh day after the due date; and Incremental late payment penalty - 1% is added the day after the end of the month following the imposition of the initial late payment penalty. The incremental late payment penalty is calculated based on the unpaid tax and any late payment penalties already imposed. 3 Shortfall penalties that can apply can be between 20% to 150% of the unpaid tax. 4 The current method in setting the underpayment UOMI rate was introduced in 2009. Prior to that, the rate was set using the Reserve Bank of New Zealand 90-day bank rate plus 450 basis points. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 7 This differential has remained relatively consistent over the years. The table below summarises the UOMI rates for the underpayment and overpayment of tax over the last 8 years. PeriodUnderpayment rate (%) Overpayment rate (%) Differential between underpayment and overpayment From 8 May 2012 8.401.756.65 From 16 January 2011 8.892.186.71 From 29 June 2009 8.911.827.09 From 1 March 2009 9.734.235.50 From 8 March 2007 14.246.667.58 From 8 March 2005 13.085.717.37 Why introduce tax pooling? In 2001 the Government released a discussion document, “More time for business”, which looked at tax simplification from the point of view of small businesses. The discussion document considered a number of options for simplifying the provisional tax rules to give taxpayers more certainty, and to minimise exposure to UOMI while still incentivising taxpayers to pay the correct amount of tax. The proposals were developed in response to sustained concerns about the penal impact of UOMI from organisations such as the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (as it was then). Tax pooling was one of the options proposed in the discussion document. Tax pooling was expected to allow businesses to pool their provisional tax payments together so that underpayments by some in the pool could be offset against overpayments by others in the same pool. The intended result of tax pooling was summarised as follows: HOW POOLING WOULD WORK In the example, Taxpayer 1 who overpays would have received $1,219 of UOMI for their overpayment from IR, but instead receives $1,487 from the Intermediary by paying their provisional tax through the Intermediary. Taxpayer 1 is better off by $268. Taxpayer 2 who underpays would have had to pay $2,681 of UOMI to IR, but instead pays $2,124 to the Intermediary. Taxpayer 2 is better off by $557. Pool Taxpayers No Pool Interest I n t e r m e d i a r y $5,000 overpayment $5,000 overpayment $5,000 overpayment $5,000 underpayment $5,000 underpayment $5,000 underpayment 7 Nov 01 7 Jul 01 7 Mar 02 Total underpayment $15,000 Total overpayment $15,000 7 Nov 01 7 Jul 01 7 Mar 02 $637.40 7% /$1,487.2610% /$2,124.66 IRD pays $1,219.55 IRD receives $2,681.32 Govt rate 5.74%12.62% Govt rate Taxpayer 1Taxpayer 2 Tax Pooling – Summary Page 8 The Intermediary would gain $637 from the opportunity to manage the arbitrage between those in a pool who overpay and those who underpay. Tax pooling was implemented as part of the tax simplification measures undertaken in 2002. Policy rationale for tax pooling Officials acknowledged that the provisional tax rules often resulted in uncertainty for businesses as they operate on the premise that businesses are able to correctly estimate their income for the year. The result of not getting the estimation right will mean the taxpayer overpays or underpays their tax for the year both of which have financial consequences for the business. Overpayment of provisional tax results in money that a business could use in their business to be “deposited” with IR at a cost to the business. Underpayment of provisional tax means businesses have to face an unexpected interest charge (UOMI). This issue is further exacerbated in that many taxpayers consider that the UOMI rate for overpayment is too low (i.e. does not adequately compensate the business) and the rate it charges on underpayment is too high. Changing the UOMI was not a feasible option... It is likely that reducing the UOMI rate differential (for example reducing the underpayment rate) would have alleviated some of the concerns raised by taxpayers in respect of the application of UOMI. However, in the 2001 discussion document dismissed a change to the UOMI rates as it was considered to be unworkable. In particular, it emphasised that the underpayment rate needs to be set high enough so that there are appropriate incentives in place to ensure taxpayers pay the right amount of tax at the right time. It was further suggested that if the underpayment rate was reduced, an additional penalty may be required to apply to underpayments to ensure the right incentives are in place to encourage compliance from taxpayers. Although a change of UOMI was swiftly dismissed by IR, the Treasury has subsequently questioned the efficiency of using tax pooling as a way to address the perception of high UOMI underpayment rates and uncertainty in determining provisional tax obligations. It instead favoured a review of the UOMI and provisional tax regimes with a view to making it more certain and acceptable to taxpayers thereby removing the need for a tax pooling regime. ...therefore tax pooling was introduced Tax pooling was introduced as a way to provide some relief of the financial impact UOMI rules have on businesses as a result of the uncertainty they face in trying to estimate their provisional tax liability without changing the UOMI rates. The UOMI costs faced by taxpayers who participate in tax pooling was expected to more readily reflect the true commercial cost of borrowing or lending by the taxpayer concerned. In short, tax pooling was intended to provide an opportunity for taxpayers to manage their tax payment risks. It would do so by allowing businesses to pool their provisional tax payments with those of other businesses, with the result that underpayments would be offset by overpayments within the same pool. The Government also expected to benefit from the introduction of tax pooling. In particular, the government would be seen to have taken a concrete step to address concerns over the UOMI interest rate setting process, by opening up an opportunity for taxpayers to reduce their costs. The sustainability of the then UOMI rate setting processes would also be strengthened. Tax pooling has evolved over time While the policy rationale for tax pooling has remained the same, a number of changes have been made to the regime since its introduction in 2003. In particular, a review of the legislation applying to tax pooling intermediaries was undertaken to ensure the rules were working as intended. As a result of the review a number of amendments were made to the tax pooling legislation in 2009 and in 2011. The changes include: extending tax pooling to reassessments (including reassessment that arise as a result of a voluntary disclosure or the resolution of a dispute) extending tax pooling to voluntary disclosures for certain non-income tax obligations (i.e. GST, PAYE or FBT) where no previous assessment has been made providing discretion for IR (i.e. the Commissioner) to allow taxpayers to use tax pooling for certain income tax or RWT voluntary disclosures where no return has previously been filed Tax Pooling – Summary Page 9 enabling pooling funds to be transferred between intermediaries allowing all taxpayers to make deposits into tax pooling accounts extending the time limit available to satisfy an obligation to pay provisional or terminal tax to 75 days (note that for reassessments the time limit remains at 60 days from the date of the reassessment) removing this time limit for meeting provisional or terminal tax obligations when taxpayers use their own deposited funds, provided the return was filed on time. In addition to this general review of the tax pooling legislation, IR also conducted a specific review of the operation of the Commissioner’s discretion to allow the use of tax pooling funds for certain income tax or RWT voluntary disclosures where no return has previously been filed. The review concluded that the discretion is operating as intended and should be retained. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 10 How tax pooling operates Tax pooling generally involves a taxpayer depositing money with a tax pooling intermediary. The deposits earn interest. The intermediary deposits that money in its tax pooling account with IR. The taxpayer may use the funds (deposits) in the future to satisfy their outstanding tax liabilities or may sell the funds to another taxpayer who is also a client of that tax pooling intermediary. The funds remain in the tax pool until the taxpayer directs the intermediary to transfer the funds to the taxpayer’s own IR account or to another taxpayer’s IR account. The taxpayer may also request for the funds to be refunded. If the taxpayer sells the funds, the intermediary will facilitate the sale for a fee. On the payment of the fee, the intermediary transfers the funds to the other taxpayer’s IR account, as at the date the money was originally deposited with the intermediary. The diagram below provides a simplified view of the tax pooling regime: In this example, Taxpayer A has deposited $100k into the tax pooling intermediary’s trust account. The intermediary (through the use of a trustee) deposits the money into the intermediary’s tax pooling account set up with IR. Taxpayer A then instructs the intermediary to sell its excess tax as it has overpaid. Taxpayer B, who has underpaid its tax, instructs the intermediary to purchase tax in order to meet its obligation with IR. The intermediary facilitates the transaction. Once the transaction is completed (i.e. Taxpayer B pays the $100k and fee) the $100k in the tax pooling account is transferred to Taxpayer B’s IR account as at the date that Taxpayer A deposited the money with the intermediary. There are a number of specific rules and provisions that limit the use of the tax pooling funds. One of the key restrictions is that taxpayers must access funds within 75 days of their terminal tax date in order to apply tax pooling funds against their provisional or income tax liabilities as at the effective date of the original deposit. The time limit is reduced to 60 days if the income tax liability relates to a reassessment. Note that there is no time restriction if the taxpayer is using their own deposited funds and they have filed a tax return. How to become a tax pooling intermediary A person that wants to act as a tax pooling intermediary must first get IR’s approval. The person may only apply to be a tax pooling intermediary if they are fit to apply. This means the person (or officer or principal) must not be a discharged or un-discharged bankrupt; nor have been convicted of an offence involving dishonesty; and must be eligible to be a company director. 5 5 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15R. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 11 Although IR is required to approve tax pooling intermediaries, it is under no obligation to oversee or audit the operation of tax pooling accounts and is not liable for any loss suffered by the taxpayer if the account is not properly operated. 6 In approving tax pooling intermediaries IR must be satisfied that the applicant can operate the tax pooling account correctly and will operate systems that will allow it to make payments and provide information in the format required by IR. 7 This means IR must be satisfied that the applicant has the requisite systems in place to protect personal information and payment details, which are obtained in the course of running the tax pooling account, and to keep a record of each taxpayer’s balance in the account. 8 In their application the prospective intermediary must undertake to inform the taxpayer, before acting as intermediary for a taxpayer, of IR’s role in relation to tax pooling and that it is fit to operate the tax pooling account using the appropriate system, outlined above. 9 The intermediary must also confirm to IR that it will establish a trust account into which it will pay the amounts received in its role as intermediary. The amounts paid by taxpayers are held on trust by the intermediary until they are transferred out of the pool, whether this is to another IR account or refunded to the taxpayer. Ceasing to be a tax pooling intermediary Although the intermediary may wind up the account at their discretion at any time, IR only has the power to require an intermediary to wind up their tax pooling account if the intermediary does not meet certain conditions. IR may require the intermediary to wind up its tax pooling account if: The tax pooling account has gone into deficit 6 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15P. 7 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15S(2). 8 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15S(1)(b). 9 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15S(1)(d). The intermediary’s actions are preventing a taxpayer from effectively managing their liabilities to pay provisional tax and UOMI The intermediary has been put into liquidation or receivership Fewer than 100 taxpayers are using the pooling account or are likely to be using the pooling account The intermediary has breached any of their obligations to establish and maintain a tax pooling or no longer meet the requirements to be fit to operate a tax pooling account (as outlined above). IR may require the pooling intermediary to be wound up immediately or may set a future date for the wind up. On the winding up of a tax pooling account, IR may refund the balance of the account to the former holder of the account (i.e. the tax pooling intermediary) or apply to the courts for directions on the disposal of the balance of the account. 10 10 Tax Administration Act 1994, section 15T(4). Tax Pooling – Summary Page 12 Key players in the tax pooling industry The number of intermediaries has grown since tax pooling was first introduced. It is expected that further players will continue to enter the market. Currently, there are six tax pooling intermediaries approved by the IR. They are: Tax Management New Zealand Ltd (TMNZ) Tax Pooling Solutions Ltd (TPS) Provisional Tax Finance Ltd (PTF) Electronic Tax Exchange Ltd (ETX) The New Zealand Tax Trading Company Ltd (NZTTC) Bailey Ingham. Five of the intermediaries operate as companies and they appear to only provide tax pooling services. The majority of the intermediaries have executive team members that have had previous experience in tax or in banking and finance. Transactions offered by the pooling intermediaries The following table outlines the transactions provided by each intermediary: ServiceTMNZNZTTCPTFTPSETX DepositYesYesYes\*Yes \*Yes\* Sale/PurchaseYesYesYesYesYes FinanceYesYesYesYes“Coming soon” SwapYesNoYesNoNo \* These intermediaries offer this service but do not separately market it. The transactions provided are briefly explained below. Tax Deposit Tax deposit, while marketed as a separate service by some of the intermediaries, is the key initial step that taxpayers must undertake if they wish to sell their excess tax payments, as only funds deposited with an intermediary may be sold. In effect tax deposits are tax payments made into an intermediary’s tax pool account instead of to IR directly. The taxpayer can then request these funds to be transferred from the tax pooling account to their own IR accounts and sell any surplus funds through the tax pool. The benefit of the deposit scheme is the flexibility the taxpayer has over their provisional tax obligations, and the access to more preferential interest rates as compared with UOMI. An additional benefit of depositing funds with an intermediary is that the taxpayer is able to request a refund of their overpayment at any time, compared to having to file a tax return before obtaining a refund of any overpaid tax from IR. Tax Pooling – Summary Page 13 Tax Sale / Purchase Tax sales and purchases were the key transaction types envisaged by IR when tax pooling was first introduced. That is, the ability for a taxpayer who has underpaid their tax for the year to purchase the tax from a taxpayer who has overpaid. In summary, a purchase will occur when the taxpayer has underpaid their provisional tax liability as the taxpayer benefits through reducing the interest payable on the underpaid tax liability. Taxpayers may also purchase tax if they have underpaid other types of tax (including income tax, GST, FBT and PAYE) under certain circumstances. A sale will occur when the taxpayer has overpaid their provisional tax liability as the taxpayer benefits by receiving a higher rate of interest on their overpayment compared to 1.75% offered by IR. Tax Finance When a tax pooling intermediary finances a tax payment, it effectively allows a taxpayer to select a date (or period) after the provisional tax due date to pay their provisional tax instalment. The taxpayer pays a finance charge upfront and the intermediary makes a deposit equal to the amount financed into the tax pooling account. That deposit is funded from intermediaries own funds or via lines of credit established with other financiers for that purposes. On the agreed date the taxpayer pays the intermediary the final tax due and the intermediary transfers the tax deposit into the taxpayers IR account. Tax Swap Where a taxpayer has overpaid at one provisional tax date and underpaid at another, the tax pool will allow them to swap the payments between provisional tax dates or with another taxpayer in order to even the payments out across the different dates. This enables the taxpayer to offset interest charges and either increase or reduce the amount of interest payable/receivable. The ability to use tax swap depends on whether the taxpayer has been depositing their tax payments into a tax pooling account, and whether there is tax available at those dates. This is essentially a combination of a sale and a purchase.
Regulatory Impact Statement Providing additional fmancial assistance to working families with newborns Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It summarises the analysis of options to increase financial assistance to families of newborns through the Parental Tax Credit element of the Working for Families (WFF) scheme. These are scheduled to be announced in Budget 2014, as part of a wider package of financial support measures for such families. Ministers wanted to explore various options to increase the amount of financial assistance to families during the first year of a child's life, as part of a wider Government objective of improving life outcomes for children. Ministers were interested in changes to support lower and middle income families, while minimising any impact on work incentives. Officials from the Treasury, the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment (MBIE), the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) and Inland Revenue first presented Ministers with a broad set of options covering various family situations. These options were narrowed following further discussion to those that could feasibly be considered (from a policy, fiscal and operational perspective) for inclusion in the 2014 Budget. As directed by Ministers, Inland Revenue's analysis then focused on options using the existing Parental Tax Credit element of the WFF scheme. Options involving the paid parental leave system and provision for beneficiary families were considered by MBIE and MSD respectively, and are not further addressed in this RIS. The RIS does not analyse the efficacy of providing financial support to families in improving life outcomes for children, nor does it analyse other (non-financial) options. A key constraint in the process was the need for Budget secrecy, which made consultation on options impossible. Further constraints related to the timefi-ame for analysis. The timeframe for providing advice was often short, especially given number of potential options under consideration and the introduction of new options late in the process. The policy options discussed in this RIS affect areas that the government has stated require a strong case before regulation is considered, because the options analysed alter incentives to work for beneficiary and working families. Officials consider that regulation is appropriate as it is the only means to achieve the desired objectives. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The proposed option does not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on businesses to innovate and invest, or override fundamental common law principles. Chris Gillion Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue 4 April 2014 • PPL payments up to a maximum of $488.17 per week before tax. • Payments generally made fortnightly, in period immediately preceding and following birth. • Employees with at least six months' continuous service with the same employer entitled to up to 14 weeks of employment protected PPL payments. • Self-employed entitled to up to 14 weeks of PPL payments, but no employment protection. • PTC maximum of $1,200 per child ($150 p/w). • Either paid as a lump sum after the end of the tax year of birth, or in regular instalment payments over 8 weeks (from date of application). • Eligibility based on status of the primary caregiver - usually the mother - for the 56 days (8 weeks) following birth. • Cannot be claimed if receiving either PPL, or a social assistance payment through the benefits system.1 Paid Parental Leave (PPL) Parental Tax Credit (PTC) STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current components of fmancial support for families with newborns 1. The primary financial support currently provided by the Government for families with newborns is either paid parental leave (PPL) or the Parental Tax Credit (PTC) element of the Working for Families (WFF) system. The key features of these are: 2. Taxpayers who are eligible for both PPL and PTC can choose which to claim, based on whatever is most advantageous to them. In most cases PPL will deliver more financial support, and for women who are employed PPL has the additional advantage of employment protection, facilitating a smooth re-entry into the workforce after birth. 3. The number of live births registered in New Zealand in the year to March 2012 was 60,860. The table below summarises the number of PPL and PTC recipients in relation to these births: Total funding in Recipients no. As °A of live Spending in the Payment 2013/14 (end Mar 2012) births 2011/12 (Actual) (main estimates) Paid Parental Leave 25,900 42% $157.6 m $176.0 m Parental Tax Credit 15,500 25% $18.9m $15.0 m Note: a small number of people can claim the paid parental leave on the adoption of a child aged under six years old. Source: IR and Budget Documents 4. Of the remaining 33% of births, approximately 25% are beneficiariesl, who do not qualify for either PTC or PPL. The rest are largely non-working mothers from higher incomes who do not qualify for either PTC or PPL payment. There are also a small number of families who do not claim either payment, even if they do qualify. 1 There is no other specific payment for beneficiaries on the birth of a newborn, although some parents may receive the Sole Parent Support payment. 2 Current components of Working for Families (WFF) 5. To receive WFF payments a person must be at least 16 years of age and also meet residency requirements. The amount of payments depend on the number of dependent children aged 18 or younger that are being cared for; the age of the child being cared for; the total family income; where the family income comes from; and any shared care arrangements. 6. The WFF scheme has four main components: Type of credit Family Tax Credit (FTC) Paid for Payment for each dependent child aged 18 or younger In-Work Tax Credit (IWTC) Payment for families who are in paid work Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) Payment made to working families with dependent children aged 18 or younger, so they have a minimum post-tax income each week Parental Tax Credit (PTC) Payment on birth of a new child 7. The FTC and IWTC are currently abated at 21.25 cents in the dollar when annual family income exceeds $36,350. The PTC is also abated at 21.25 cents in the dollar; however the amount of the abatement is calculated against 56 days of annualised income, rather than a full year's worth of income; this creates an effective PTC abatement rate of 3.26 cents. The MFTC is abated dollar for dollar until a family's income reaches $21,216 after tax. 8. FTC amounts are adjusted for inflation when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) movement cumulatively reaches 5%. MFTC amounts are reviewed each year to ensure incentives to move from benefit into work are maintained. IWTC and PTC amounts are reviewed every three years. Problem definition 9. The rationale for the proposed package of increased financial support for families of newborns in Budget 2014 draws on national and international evidence that: • poverty is one of the greatest risks to children's health and development • the forming of close early bonds between parent and child, breastfeeding in the first six months, and reducing parental stress especially in the early years is good for children in the short- and longer-term • there are generally extra demands on the family budget and reduced family income in the first year of a newborn's life, and • the labour supply of parents is relatively inelastic around the time a baby is born. 10. In the light of this, Ministers directed officials to look at options using the PTC element of the existing WFF scheme, to increase the financial support available to lower and middle income working families at the time a child is born. The problem considered in this analysis is how to increase the financial support provided to families with newborns through the PTC and how to best target additional PTC payments to lower and middle income families. 3 OBJECTIVES 11. The PTC proposals were assessed against Ministers' specific objectives for the Budget 2014 package of financial support for families with new-borns, namely to: • increase the amount of financial support available (the primary objective) • target this additional support to the period around the birth of a new child • target this additional support to lower and middle income families • minimise any impacts on work incentives.2 12. The level of administration and implementation costs and efforts were considered for each option; only options that could feasibly be implemented from an operational perspective by 1 April 2015 were pursued in any detail. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 13. In November 2013, a number of options were first presented to the Ministers of Finance, Labour and Revenue, and the Minister for Social Development, dealing with increasing the financial support for families with newborns as a whole. Following this, joint Ministers narrowed these potential options to a series of discrete options to take to Cabinet for Budget 2014. 14. This analysis summarises Inland Revenue officials' advice on the development of the options considered by joint Ministers from February 2014 involving the WFF scheme; options involving the PPL scheme, or beneficiary families are being considered by other agencies and do not form part of this analysis. 15. The WFF scheme has three main parameters or levers that are able to be changed without structurally altering the scheme: (i) the amount of each tax credit3; (ii) the abatement rate; (iii) the abatement threshold, being the family income level at which WFF tax credits start to abate. 16. The analysis below considers two options for changes to the PTC, using the first two of these levers. The abatement threshold (iii) for PTC is the same as that for the FTC and IWTC, so changes to this would have increased WFF payments for all families, not just families with newborns. Creating separate thresholds for PTC would have led to a multiple number of thresholds depending on the numbers and ages of dependent children; this would have required significant restructuring of the entire WFF support package for all families, and was therefore not considered feasible. 2 As noted at paragraph 11, new parents have a relatively inelastic labour supply. New parents, particularly mothers, do not readily respond to incentives to increase working hours. Therefore, unlike with other discussions of work incentives and the tax-benefit interface, the 'work incentive' impacts here are primarily concerned with maintaining a margin between PPL and PTC. Paid employment is a critical plank of the government's strategy to address poverty, so incentives that would encourage women to switch from PPL to a PTC payment would run counter to this. 3 Indexation can be another lever, to ensure that thresholds or rates are adjusted in line with inflation, or wage levels. In the context of this analysis, inflation adjustment is considered as part of lever (i). 4 17. A high-level assessment of the relevance of the tax credit amount lever and the abatement lever showed; given the nature of the PTC design, no critical trade-offs between the objectives were identified in completing this analysis. Lever/Objective Primary objective Secondary objectives Increase amount of financial support Minimise impacts on work incentives Target period around birth Target lower and middle- income families Status Quo No Credit amount lever (i) Yes Yes Yes No Abatement rate lever (ii) No Yes No Yes Credit amount (i) and abatement rate (ii) levers Yes Yes Yes Yes 18. Because the overarching objective was to increase the amount of payments made to families with newborns, the status quo (no changes to the PTC) and adjustments to the abatement rate (ii) were not separately analysed as it would not deliver this objective. Two options were taken forward for further analysis; option 1 considered the use of the credit amount lever only, while option 2 considered the use of both the credit amount and abatement rate levers. The status quo provided the baseline against which these options were measured. 19. Throughout this RIS we refer to lower, middle and high income families. For the purposes of this analysis only, these family groups are defined as: • Lower income: Income under the current abatement threshold of $36,350 • Middle income: Income above the current abatement threshold of $36,350, but below the threshold for the current top personal tax rate of $70,000. • Higher income: Income above the top personal tax rate threshold of $70,000. 20. These family groups have been defined according to administrative thresholds and are not intended to be seen as a definitive view of what it means to be a lower, middle or higher income family. They are illustrative only. Different family circumstances, special demands on the family budget, or larger numbers of children will mean some families on "middle" or even "higher" incomes may have limited means. Option 1 Increase the tax credit amount 21. This option would increase the PTC amount to $220 per week; eligibility and payment periods of either 8 or 10 weeks were considered for this initial analysis. Increase the amount of financial support available 22. Increasing the amount of PTC will increase the amount of financial support paid out to all families who receive PTC. 23. There is no single optimum level of payment, because the costs of a newborn will vary between families; the PTC is simply a contribution towards those costs. The existing PTC amount ($150 per week) has not been increased since it was introduced in October 1999. If it is assumed that the relative level of support the PTC provided in 1999 is an appropriate target, and that the costs of a newborn have increased in line with general inflation, an increase of 5 $220 per week is a starting point. This is based on the current forecast of CPI inflation between October 1999 and April 2015 (46.3%). Minimise the impacts on work incentives 24. Because parents can choose to claim either PPL or PTC, the maintenance of some margin between the newborn payment and PPL is necessary to maintain incentives for women to remain attached to the workforce. The 'minimum' PPL payment is around $142.50 before tax, which equates to a pre-tax total of $2,280. 4 To minimise workforce impacts, any maximum PTC payment should be less than this. 25. Taken together, the analysis in paragraphs 23 and 24 indicate a range for the maximum PTC amount of between $220 and $285 per week, based on the current 8 weeks of payment (i.e. $1,760 to $2,280 PTC in total). 26. Ministers indicated a preference for a weekly PTC amount of $220, and so this weekly figure is used for the remainder of this analysis. Targeting the period around birth 27. PTC entitlement is calculated on the status (eligibility) of the primary caregiver for the 56 days following the birth of the child, i.e. to be eligible the caregiver must not be in receipt of a welfare benefit on any given day. The PTC is paid pro-rata if the caregiver is only eligible for part of that period. 28. For any given total payment a longer eligibility period means a lower daily rate of entitlement build up. In this sense, the shorter the eligibility period the greater the payment is targeted around the birth. On the other hand, alignment with related policies, such as PPL (paid for 16 or 18 weeks) could reflect the time when mothers are not working as they need to recover and/or breastfeed. There is no conclusive evidence on the optimum eligibility period. 29. The other aspect of timing is the timing of the payments themselves. There is no single optimum payment period; for any given total a shorter payment period means a higher weekly/monthly rate. 30. At present the PTC can be received either as a lump sum after the end of the tax year of birth, or in instalment payments over 8 weeks. 5 A series of regular instalments in the first few weeks of a child's life will tend to be used as an income replacement measure, and to meet additional one-off expenditures associated with the newborn in the earliest weeks. Spreading payment over a longer timeframe might better reflect the time when mothers are not working, as discussed in paragraph 28. 31. However the amount to be paid overall must be factored in; for example a maximum total amount of $2,200 spread over the first 6 months of a child's life amounts to $84 per week; this is less beneficial as an income replacement measure, or in meeting additional expenditure, than doubling the weekly amount and paying it over a shorter 3 month period. 4 i This s based on a woman who works 10 hours a week, the minimum number of hours required for eligibility, at the minimum wage of $14.25 (effective from 1 April 2014), and received PPL for the full 16 weeks (as proposed under the PPL changes being developed by MBIE, to come into effect on 1 April 2015). 5 This 8 week payment period depends on the date the PTC application is made, and so could be any 8 week period within the first 5 months after birth. 6 32. Ministers were initially interested in exploring eligibility periods of either 8 or 10 weeks, so both weekly periods were used in this analysis. Targeting lower and middle-income families 33. The amount of the PTC does not influence the income thresholds from which the PTC entitlement starts to be abated, as illustrated in Table 2 but it does influence the point of full abatement.6 This is because, although the PTC is abated at 21.25 cents in the dollar, the amount of the abatement is calculated against 56 days of annualised income, rather than a full year's worth of income; this creates an effective PTC abatement rate of 3.26 cents7 . Or put another way, because the PTC abates last, from the point at which the PTC abatement starts, approximately $36,000 further income is required before the PTC is fully abated away Table 2: Income abatement thresholds for current and proposed PTC rates Number of children 1 2 3 4 PTC paid at $150/week for 8 weeks (abatement rate 3.26 cents) Maximum payment up to this income level 73,724 89,494 105,263 124,703 Payments fully abated at this income level 110,531 126,300 142,070 161,510 PTC paid at $220/week for 8 weeks (abatement rate 3.26 cents) Maximum payment up to this income level 73,724 89,494 105,263 124,703 Payments fully abated at this income level 127,712 143,482 159,251 178,691 PTC paid at $220/week for 10 weeks (abatement rate 4.075 cents) Maximum payment up to this income level 73,724 89,494 105,263 124,703 Payments fully abated at this income level 127,712 143,482 159,251 178,691 34. Increasing the amount of PTC to $220 per week, over either 8 or 10 weeks will bring in more higher-income families into the PTC net, i.e. 2-children families with incomes between $126,300 and $143,482 will now also receive some PTC, because the higher PTC amount will take longer to abate. Put another way, from the point at which the PTC abatement starts, around $54,000 of further income is required before this higher PTC amount is fully abated away. 35. An estimated 300 more higher-income families would be brought into the PTC net at a PTC rate of $220 per week over 8 or 10 weeks. This option does not affect the PTC entitlements of lower and middle income families, but to the extent that it extends the PTC to more higher-income families it does not meet the objective to target lower and middle income families. 6 Table 2 assumes that all of the children are aged under 12. If some of the children are older, then the FTC amount would be higher, and so the maximum level of income at which the PTC is fully abated would be higher, as PTC only begins to abate at the point at which all of the other WFFTCs that the family is entitled to have been fully abated. The table only shows the thresholds for families with up to 4 children; additional children in the family would increase the level of FTC, and so increase the abatement threshold. 7 Simply changing the amount of weeks the eligibility period, although increasing the total amount of PTC received, does not change the income thresholds for abatement cut-off purposes. The additional weeks of eligibility simply increase the number of weeks of income against which the PTC is abated, i.e. a 10 week eligibility period simply increases the effective abatement rate to 4.075 cents. 7 Option 2 Increase the PTC amount and adjust the abatement rate 36. The option would increase the PTC amount to $220 per week over either 8 or 10 weeks, and change the abatement formula so that the effective abatement rate is 21.25 cents. The analysis of the amount of financial support available, targeting the period around birth and workforce incentives are the same as set out for option 1. Targeting lower and middle-income families 37. Currently, because the PTC is only paid out in respect of the eight week period following birth, the abatement formula only considers 8 week's worth of annual income in determining the PTC abatement. This is in contrast to other WFF tax credits that are paid throughout the year and therefore abated against a full year's income. 38. Option 2 would adjust the abatement rate rules for PTC, so that fewer higher-income families would be pulled into the net, but with no impact on the income levels to which families would receive the maximum PTC amount (so lower and middle income families would be unaffected). For consistency with the rest of the WFF credits, this option was to achieve an effective PTC abatement rate of 21.25 cents Table 3: Income abatement thresholds various PTC amounts, if an effective 21.25 cent abatement rate applied Number of children 1 2 3 4 PTC paid at $220/week for 8 weeks = $1,760 Maximum payment up to this income level 73,724 89,494 105,263 124,703 Payments fully abated at this income level 82,006 97,776 113,545 132,985 PTC paid at $220/week for 10 weeks = $2,200 Maximum payment up to this income level 73,724 89,494 105,263 124,703 Payments fully abated at this income level 84,077 99,847 115,616 135,056 39. Such a change would means that approximately 400 higher-income families who would currently qualify for at least some of the PTC payment will no longer qualify; in addition the 300 higher income families who would otherwise become entitled to the increased PTC without this abatement change (see paragraph 35), will remain outside the PTC net. 40. There are two ways the PTC abatement rate can be effectively increased: i. Increase the 21.25 cents rate that nominally applies (only for PTC, not the other credits) ii. Increase the proportion of the annual income against which the PTC is actually abated. 41. The 21.25 cents nominal abatement rate is linked to the other WFF credits, so approach (i) was rejected as this would require having different nominal abatement rate for each credit. This would mean that any changes to abatement rates in future would have to be adjusted separately for each tax credit; this is a significant IT change, and is also likely to be more complex to explain to WFF customers. For these reasons, approach (ii) would be officials' preferred mechanism. 8 42. This change would apply only in respect of PTC claims for children born on or after the implementation date (1 April 2015). Therefore it would not impact on any higher-income families eligible for, or in receipt of the PTC, before that date. CONSULTATION 43. The need for Budget secrecy meant that no consultation was possible on these options, outside of the agencies developing this Budget initiative — namely the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 44. There will be no opportunity for post-announcement consultation. This is because the proposals are to be included in a bill to be introduced and passed on Budget day. This is because the proposed implementation date of 1 April 2015 necessitates the legislation being in place before November 2014 at the latest, to allow sufficient time for Inland Revenues systems, processes and guidance to be finalised. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 45. The options considered by officials, and discussed in the preceding sections are all broadly consistent with the stated objectives of Budget 2014, namely to provide fmancial additional support to working families. The PTC options are also fully consistent with the objectives of WFF scheme. Extent to which delivers objectives (relative ranking within each objective) Summary of Option Primary objective Secondary objectives Increase amount of financial support Minimise impacts on work incentives Target period around birth Totals Target lower and middle- income families Option la: 8 weeks PTC at $220 per week 3 3 4 1 11 Option la: 10 weeks PTC at $220 per week 4 4 3 1 12 Option 2a: 8 weeks PTC at $220 per week; adjust abatement formula for full year's income 1 3 4 4 12 Option 2b: 10 weeks PTC at $220 per week; adjust abatement formula for full year's income 2 4 3 4 13 Scale: Does not achieve objective I 2 3 4 Achieves objective to or achieves objective to greater extent lesser extent 46. On balance, option 2b is preferred. It delivers the highest overall increase to lower and middle income families (as defined at paragraph 19), and reduces the number of higher- income families receiving the PTC, thus rebalancing WFF expenditure. 9 Fiscal costs 47. Final decisions around the maximum payment parameters also need to take into account the Crown's broader fiscal position and the current economic conditions; these could not be modelled in the current analysis. The fiscal costs of each of the preferred option (2b) are is estimated at: $M 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17 2017/18 Costs of existing PTC scheme (8 weeks at $150/week) $15 $14 $13 $12 10 weeks PTC at $220 per week, plus adjustments to abatement thresholds $3.25 $13 $13 $13 IMPLEMENTATION 48. The PTC changes proposed under either option are to be implemented on 1 April 2015. Implementation employs the existing WFFTC framework and processes. 49. Both options will require changes to the existing PTC calculations within Inland Revenue's WFF system, which will include testing the IT coding for the new PTC payment to ensure the payments are correctly and accurately calculated and made for recipients. Under either option, the WFF system will need to be able to deal with paying out at two PTC rates/periods in the transitional year (i.e. the 15/16 tax year). Although PTC is only one element of WFF, each component of the payment system needs to be tested to ensure there is no impact to the wider WFF population (approximately 602,000 people). 50. Changes to the PTC will be incorporated as part of Inland Revenue's annual WFF application cycle. This includes updating any forms, threshold tables and calculators, as well as updating customer guidance and providing staff information about the changes. Part of this process also involves communicating to families any changes to WFF eligibility and amounts. The WFF/PTC application process and information requested from parents of newborns will not change. There will be no additional compliance costs for affected families. 51. Inland Revenue has prepared a high-level impact analysis co stings analysis for the proposed changes to PTC. Additional funding to make these changes will be sought as part of Budget 2014. Inland Revenue is confident that it can deliver the changes for both options within the timeframe, on the basis of its current work programme. 52. There is always a potential risk that any change, addition or reprioritisation of Inland Revenue's work programme within the next few months could impact (delay) the implementation of these PTC changes; this will need to be managed through discussion with relevant Ministers on the comparative trade-offs. 10 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 53. There is a statutory requirement under the Income Tax Act 2007 for the Minister of Revenue and the Minister for Social Development and Employment to review the amount of the PTC every three years. The next statutory review is due in June 2017, and will review the rate of PTC against changes in inflation, the level of the other WFF tax credits, and the interface of the PTC rate with the paid parental leave rates. 54. There are other no plans to specifically and separately monitor, evaluate or review the proposed PTC changes for Budget 2014. The post-implementation phase of the generic tax policy process will help to identify any remedial issues that arise post-Budget. Any issues identified in this way would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme, as necessary. 11
Regulatory Impact Statement Review of cheque duty Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The question addressed in this statement is whether cheque duty is a worthwhile tax. Cheque duty is the one remaining transaction duty. Other duties such as estate, gift, stamp and credit card transaction duties have been repealed since 1988, mainly because they had become outmoded and ineffective as revenue raising methods. Cheque duty applies to bills of exchange (most commonly cheques) at a rate of 5 cents per bill of exchange. The view reached in this RIS is that cheque duty should be repealed. Cheque duty is easy to avoid, since closely substitutable methods of payment, such as cash or electronic transactions, are not subject to any duty. Additionally, revenue from cheque duty has been declining and the current trend suggests that the costs of the duty are likely to outweigh its benefits over time. It is therefore an inefficient and distortionary tax. Previous reviews of the tax system have also examined this question, such as the (McLeod) Tax Review 2001, which recommended that cheque duty be repealed for similar reasons. The key objectives of the current review are to improve the overall equity, efficiency and coherency of the tax system. The class of taxpayers likely to be affected are banks, printers of cheques and cheque users. We note that our preferred option of repealing cheque duty would benefit businesses, non- profit organisations and individuals that still use cheques as a payment method. It would also reduce compliance costs, particularly for banks and printers of cheques. Due to time constraints and Budget secrecy, limited consultation was undertaken on the proposed options. Inland Revenue consulted the New Zealand Bankers Association (NZBA) on the practical implications of repealing cheque duty. NZBA indicated that there is general support for the repeal. However, some banks asked for some lead-in time - a period of time between announcement and repeal - to adjust their IT systems. Also, some banks expressed a preference for the repeal to take effect from the first day of a quarter, in order to tie-in with current cheque duty return processes. NZBA indicated that a repeal date of 1 July 2014 would be fme. This feedback led to us discarding as an option an implementation approach which would have repealed cheque duty from the date of Royal assent of a Budget day bill. The Treasury were involved in the policy development of the options discussed in this RIS. There are no significant constraints, caveats or uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. None of the policy options considered impair private property rights, restrict market competition, or override fundamental common law principles. Mike Nutsfor Policy Manag , olicy and Strategy Inland Revenue 18 March 2014 2 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Cheque duty rules and administration 1. Cheque duty applies to bills of exchange, such as cheques and promissory notes, at a rate of 5 cents per bill of exchange. 2. Cheque duty is usually paid to Inland Revenue by banks and licensed printers, which pass on the cost to their customers. Licensed banks file cheque duty returns and pay cheque duty on a quarterly basis, and licensed printers file cheque duty returns and pay cheque duty on a monthly basis. 3. Additionally, Inland Revenue may grant any person a license authorising the printing of cheques upon application and payment of cheque duty payable. The applicant must nominate a printer and, on the grant of a licence, Inland Revenue issues the nominated printer an authority to print the prepaid cheques to which the licence relates. 4. When cheque duty has not been prepaid on a bill of exchange, it must be duly stamped (by affixing a postage stamp or stamps and cancelling each stamp) by the drawer or maker of the bill. This includes, for example, when an overseas bill of exchange becomes payable in New Zealand. The revenue from postage stamps goes to New Zealand Post rather than directly to the Crown. 5. Inland Revenue may refund cheque duty that has been paid in relation to cheques that have not been used or printed, upon application in writing within 8 years after the date of payment of the duty, but no refunds less than $1 can be made. Banks receive an effective refund via a deduction from their quarterly payment of cheque duty. 6. Inland Revenue currently administers the collection of cheque duty through its transactional customer services team. Inland Revenue interacts directly with 41 active cheque duty producers and suppliers. There is no interaction between Inland Revenue and the general public in relation to cheque duty. Status quo 7. Cheque duty is the one remaining transaction duty. No duty applies to alternative methods of payment, such as cash, electronic transactions (for example, EFTPOS or via internet banking), or credit card transactions. 8. Cheque use has been steadily declining; cheque duty raised $17 million in 1991/92 and $10 million in 2001/02, but now only raises about $4 million per annum. Technological advances have led to the introduction of various methods of electronic payments. The increasing popularity of these alternatives to cheques is more likely due to them being more convenient, faster and more secure methods of payment, rather than tax-motivated substitution (given the very low rate of cheque duty). 9. Based on current volumes and resources involved, the administration of cheque duty forms a small percentage of Inland Revenue's processing operations. 3 Problem definition 10. Inland Revenue considers that cheque duty is now no longer a worthwhile tax. Cheque duty is easy to avoid, since closely substitutable methods of payment, such as cash or electronic transactions, are not subject to any duty. Additionally, revenue from cheque duty has been declining and the current trend in cheque use suggests that the costs of the duty are likely to outweigh the revenue generated over time. It is therefore an inefficient and distortionary tax. That said, the very low rate of cheque duty (5 cents per transaction) suggests that its distortionary effect is likely to be small. 11. Cheque duty is the one remaining transaction duty. Other duties such as estate, gift, stamp and credit card transaction duties have been repealed since 1988, mainly because they had become outmoded and ineffective as revenue raising methods. 12. The Government-appointed but independent (McLeod) Tax Review 2001 recommended that cheque duty be repealed, citing the fact that cheque duty is easily avoided by using alternative methods of payment and that, at the time of the review, cheque duty only raised about $10 million per annum. At that time, repeal of cheque duty was not considered a priority for fiscal reasons. The case for repeal is stronger today. OBJECTIVES 13. The objectives of the review of cheque duty are to: a) Improve the overall efficiency of the tax system by ensuring that the economic, administrative and compliance costs associated with a tax are kept to a minimum. b) Improve the overall fairness of the tax system by ensuring that similarly situated taxpayers are taxed in the same way. c) Ensure that the benefits of cheque duty outweigh its associated costs going forward. d) Ensure coherency of the tax system. 14. We note that there may need to be a trade-off between the objective of improving overall efficiency of the tax system, which is about keeping to an absolute minimum the costs imposed by the tax system, and improving the overall fairness of the tax system. For example, broadening the base on which a duty applies may improve equity amongst similarly situated taxpayers, but it may also reduce the overall efficiency of the tax system. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 15. Three options have been considered for addressing the problems and achieving the stated objectives. These options are: • Option one: Retain the status quo. • Option two: Repeal cheque duty. 4 • Option three: Broaden the base by applying a duty to a broader range of transaction types. 5 Ne t imp ac t rn I) .,- 0 ,.0 g ;-., o 0 A •0 ,i) •Ti E 8 0 • . • •-■ '41 -0 0 -0 cn +-■ > 0 .. -4-J a) 0 -10 -0 tcl RI cn cn ,w U CI {:. 4 Eq u ity an d r is ks 0 0 a) 7) g (1) — ••0 cl) 0.) ••••■ t = 0 I. 0 CID t 0 0 ›, c?Cis 7id 1 44 ." 0 '7ii ..■ M 0 ..c , a) 0 0 1-. s ... c4 E :...-,) sa, '..2. z3 0 t.C/ o ..o FA (15 rn 0 bj) 'S .5 0 -•-■ > 75 ... a) c. -0 0 I.

There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts associated with any of the options considered above. Net impact of all options 17. The preferred option to repeal cheque duty (option two) addresses the problem by removing an outmoded and inefficient means of raising revenue. It also achieves all of the objectives — that is, it ensures the overall equity, efficiency and coherency of the tax system. 18. Inland Revenue does not support options one and three because they do not address the problem and fail to achieve some or all of the objectives. CONSULTATION 19. Given time constraints and the fact this matter was being progressed as part of Budget 2014, only limited consultation was undertaken. Inland Revenue consulted the New Zealand Bankers Association (NZBA) on the practical implications of repealing cheque duty. NZBA sought feedback on this matter from several banks. While all banks canvassed by NZBA are supportive of the repeal, some banks said that they have legacy IT systems, and that the repeal becoming effective on the date of Royal assent may cause problems for them. Those banks expressed a preference for cheque duty to be repealed with effect from a set date in the future, to allow them some lead-in time to manage the transition from a systems perspective. Also, some banks expressed a preference for the repeal to take effect from the first day of a quarter, in order to tie-in with current cheque duty return processes. NZBA indicated that a repeal date of 1 July 2014 (the first day of the next quarter following Budget 2014) would allow banks sufficient lead-in time to manage the transition. 20. The Treasury was consulted and agrees with our conclusions and recommendations. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 21. Inland Revenue recommends that cheque duty be repealed, as: • the duty no longer raises substantial revenue and the revenue raised is in decline; and • cheque duty is easy to avoid, since closely substitutable transaction types (such as cash, EFTPOS, intern& banking and credit card transactions) are not subject to any duty. It is therefore inefficient and has a small distortionary effect. 22. Transaction duties are a relic of the time before GST was introduced in 1986. As the trend since the late 1980s has been to repeal transaction duties, we consider the repeal of cheque duty to be preferable to broadening the base by applying a duty to a broader range of transaction types. Furthermore, repealing cheque duty would reduce administrative and compliance costs. Introducing other duties would have the opposite effect. 9 23. Based on Ministers' desire to consider any repeal as part of Budget 2014 with an announcement on Budget day, Inland Revenue's preference is that the repeal is announced on Budget day with an application date for repeal of 1 April 2016. IMPLEMENTATION 24. The status quo would not require legislation to implement. Option two and option three would require changes to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Shortly after the bill giving effect to the repeal of cheque duty receives Royal assent, Inland Revenue will issue a Special Report explaining the effect of the amendments. Approaches to implementing the repeal of cheque duty considered 25. Based on Ministers' desire to announce any repeal of cheque duty at Budget 2014, we considered various approaches to implementing the repeal of cheque duty. This required consideration of three key issues: • the effective date of repeal; • the availability of refunds of prepaid cheque duty; and • the legislative vehicle for the repeal. 26. We were mindful of the potential trade-offs in making decisions in relation to these issues. They included: • The longer the period between announcement and repeal, affected parties will have more lead-in time, enabling them to better manage their transition to the new environment. However, this will also enable these groups to seek refunds for their surplus prepaid cheques, which increases the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cost. • The availability of refunds beyond the effective date of repeal arguably improves fairness but would also have a fiscal cost, administrative resource implications, and impose compliance costs on banks. • The choice of legislative vehicle between a Budget day bill and the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014 involves trading-off certainty about the repeal against the level of on-going consultation that can be undertaken with affected parties on the practical implications of the repeal of cheque duty and the opportunity for parliamentary consideration. This choice could influence the public reaction to the change. 27. On the basis of the potential trade-offs, we considered three main approaches to repealing cheque duty. They were: • Repeal cheque duty immediately — approach 1. • Repeal cheque duty from 1 July 2014 — approach 2. • Repeal cheque duty from 1 April 2016 — approach 3. 10 Repeal immediately — approach 1 28. This approach repeals cheque duty with effect from the date of Royal assent of a Budget day bill, with no refunds available from then on for cheques for which cheque duty has been prepaid that have not been used or printed. 29. The main advantages of this approach are that it is clean and certain that cheque duty is being repealed and it provides cheque users with immediate relief from the duty. 30. The main downsides of this approach are: • The potential for there to be a negative public reaction to not giving refunds. • Possible transitional issues (for example, for banks in adjusting systems) due to the lack of lead-in time. • Higher fiscal costs would arise from the 2014/15 fiscal year as this option features an earlier repeal date. • Limited consultation on the impacts of repealing cheque duty and a truncated parliamentary process. Repeal from 1 July 2014 — approach 2 31. This approach repeals cheque duty with effect from 1 July 2014, with no refunds available from then on for cheques for which cheque duty has been prepaid that have not been used or printed. Refunds would be available up until 30 June 2014. The legislative vehicle would be a Budget day bill. 32. The main advantages of this approach are: • Banks will have some lead-in time to adjust their IT systems. • The 1 July repeal date allows banks and licensed printers to complete a full cycle for their final cheque duty return. • Cheque users will receive relief from cheque duty relatively promptly. • The use of a Budget day bill and the short period of time before the repeal takes effect provide certainty about the repeal. 33. The main disadvantages are: • The potential for there to be a negative public reaction to not giving refunds from 1 July 2014. • Limited consultation on the impacts of repealing cheque duty and a truncated parliamentary process. 11 Repeal from 1 April 2016 — approach 3 34. Under this approach, cheque duty would be repealed from 1 April 2016, with no refunds available from then on for cheques for which cheque duty has been prepaid that have not been used or printed. Refunds would be available up until 31 March 2016. The legislative vehicle would be the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014. 35. This approach has the following advantages: • It allows a reasonable lead-in time, which would enable all affected parties (banks and their customers, licensed printers and their customers, temporary licensees, and Inland Revenue) to better manage the transition. • The availability of refunds of prepaid cheque duty over the period in between Budget 2014 and 1 April 2016 would mitigate the potential public perception of unfairness that may be caused by not giving or significantly restricting the availability of refunds. • The use of the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014 would enable the proposal to go through the full parliamentary process, including the select committee stage. Any issues with the proposed approach could be raised in public submissions. 36. Given the relatively long time period between announcement and legislative repeal, the main downsides to this approach are: • Cheque users will continue to incur the cost of the duty for significantly longer. • A potential perception that the Government is not serious about repealing the duty. Potential variations to main approaches 37. We also considered but discounted two potential variations to these main approaches around the availability of refunds of prepaid cheque duty on cheques that have not been used or printed. Removing refundability prior to repeal date — variation 1 38. We considered removing the ability to seek refunds in between the date of Royal assent and the date of repeal (applicable to approaches 2 and 3). This would have the following advantages: • It would reduce uncertainty about the fiscal cost of the repeal as a consequence of the lack of empirical data on the number of cheques for which cheque duty has been prepaid that have not been used or printed. • It would avoid compliance costs for banks associated with any increase in customers seeking a refund of prepaid cheque duty on unused cheques, which they may otherwise temporarily experience. 39. The main disadvantage of doing this is that, because cheque duty is in economic substance a tax on transactions using a particular type of instrument, not refunding prepaid duty when no dutiable transaction has taken place has the potential to create a perception of unfairness. 12 40. We consider that the fairness reasons for continuing to allow refunds up until the date of repeal outweigh the advantages of removing the ability to seek refunds in between the date of Royal assent and the date of repeal. Allowing a fixed refund period — variation 2 41. We also considered continuing to allow refunds of prepaid cheque duty to be sought for a fixed period (for example, six months) after cheque duty is repealed. 42. The advantage of doing this is that it improves fairness as it seems fair for prepaid cheque duty to be refunded where no dutiable transaction has taken place. 43. The disadvantages of doing this are as follows: • It would be likely to increase the fiscal cost and uncertainty around the fiscal cost. • It would necessitate Inland Revenue committing resources to administering cheque duty for a longer period. • It would impose additional compliance costs on banks associated with customers seeking a refund of prepaid cheque duty on unused cheques. 44. We consider that there are reasonable grounds for not continuing to allow refunds of prepaid cheque duty for a fixed period following repeal under each of approaches 1 to 3, for the reasons outlined below: • Approach 1: In addition to the disadvantages outlined in paragraph 43, continuing to allow refunds after the date of repeal could create practical difficulties in the case of cheque duty being repealed immediately. This is because banks may not have had time to have ordered and had printed cheque books containing cheques without an inscription indicating that the cheque duty has been paid. Consequently, in the short- term following repeal, banks may not be in a position to supply customers with cheque books containing cheques without an inscription indicating that the cheque duty has been paid. • Approach 2: We consider that, on balance, the disadvantages of continuing to allow refunds after the date of repeal outweigh the advantages under approach 2, especially since this approach allows a month and a half for refunds to be sought between announcement and the date of repeal. This should be enough time for those most inequitably affected by the repeal to seek a refund. Although this is a significantly shorter period of time between announcement and repeal than under approach 3, cheque users receive the benefit of earlier relief from cheque duty under approach 2. • Approach 3: We consider that, on balance, the disadvantages of continuing to allow refunds after the date of repeal outweigh the advantages under approach 3, as there would be more than sufficient time for refunds to be sought prior to the date of repeal. Preferred approach - conclusion 45. Managing the repeal of cheque duty would have minimal administrative impacts for Inland Revenue. Cheque duty is managed via a standalone purpose-built application. This 13 sits outside of Inland Revenue's FIRST mainframe system and, as such, decommissioning the application would be a straight-forward procedure. 46. Inland Revenue and the Treasury prefer approach 3 (that is, repealing cheque duty from 1 April 2016, via the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014, with no refunds of prepaid cheque duty available from the date of repeal). Our preference is for the effective date of repeal to be a sufficiently long time after announcement so as to give ample time for all affected parties to seamlessly manage the transition. Furthermore, we prefer to allow refunds to be continued to be sought in relation to prepaid cheque duty up until the date of repeal. Refunds can currently be sought for cheque duty that has been paid in relation to cheques that have not been used or printed, within 8 years after the date of payment of the duty. Cheque duty is in economic substance a tax on transactions using a particular type of instrument. If no dutiable transaction takes place, refunding the prepaid duty makes sense. There is the potential for there to be a perception of unfairness if the current availability of refunds was suddenly removed or significantly restricted. The case for having a period for refunds beyond the date of repeal is weaker under approach 3, as there is more than sufficient time for refunds to be sought prior to the repeal date. 47. We consider using the next available taxation bill after Budget 2014 as the legislative vehicle for repeal to be preferable to a Budget day bill, as it would enable the proposal to go through the full parliamentary process, including the select committee stage. Any issues with the proposed approach could be raised in public submissions. 48. The proposed repeal of cheque duty would reduce compliance costs for banks, printers of cheques and the printers' customers, as they would no longer have to apply to Inland Revenue for licences authorising the printing or supply of bill of exchange forms prepaid with cheque duty, or make payments of cheque duty to Inland Revenue. Additionally, banks and printers of cheques would no longer have to complete and file the quarterly/monthly returns that accompany their payments of cheque duty to Inland Revenue. 49. However, under our preferred approach, in the short-term (that is, between announcement and the date of repeal) banks may temporarily experience an increase in customers seeking a refund of prepaid cheque duty on unused cheques. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 50. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the repeal of cheque duty. If any detailed concerns are raised in relation to the repeal, Inland Revenue will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process. 51. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP contemplates the implementation and review stage, which can involve post- implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to have its intended effect would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 14
Regulatory Impact Statement Reform of tax treatment of non-resident fishing crews Agency disclosure statement This Regulatory Impact Statement (RIS) has been prepared by Inland Revenue. The problem addressed is the unsuitability of the current income tax treatment for non- resident members of fishing crews. This treatment results in over-taxation, is unnecessarily complex and imposes additional compliance costs on the affected taxpayers. The proposed solution will mean that the non-resident members of fishing crews are taxed at the correct rate and are not required to file a tax return. The class of taxpayers likely to be affected is limited to the non-resident members of fishing crews and their employers. Targeted consultation with the industry and other interested bodies has been undertaken on the policy proposal, which is intended to ensure compliance while making payment of tax easier and fairer for non-resident crews. Feedback from the consultation has been positive overall. The received feedback helped to shape the preferred policy solution - that is, the introduction of the new tax mechanism for non-resident fishing crews. All submitters supported the introduction of the flat tax rate on the New Zealand-sourced income of non-resident members of fishing crews, and the removal of the requirement on them to file returns. The majority of submitters proposed that all members of non-resident fishing crews be subject to the same tax mechanism, including the flat tax rate. Several submitters requested clarification on how to determine what portion of income is subject to New Zealand tax. It is proposed that the same mechanism should apply to all members of the crew, to minimise their compliance costs and Inland Revenue' s administrative costs. It is important that, to give effect to the proposed solution, these amendments are passed at the earliest available opportunity, to provide for certainty of tax treatment of the members of non-resident fishing crews. There are no significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning the regulatory analysis undertaken. The preferred solution does not impose additional costs on businesses, impair private property rights, restrict market competition, reduce the incentives on bus~and in st, or override fundamental common law principles. Peter Frawley Policy Manager Inland Revenue 09 May 2014 1 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION 1. A number ofNew Zealand fishing companies bring in non-resident crews to work either on the companies' own vessels or on vessels that are chartered from foreign operators. The members of these crews are non-resident for tax purposes. Approximately 1,000 to 2,000 non-resident crew members are employed by these companies each year. 2. The non-resident crew members are typically flown into New Zealand and start their employment shortly after arrival. Their term of employment can last from several weeks to several months. Their work includes fishing, landing fish at ports, and doing other employment-related tasks as may be required by their employers (for example, performing maintenance of the vessels or loading them with supplies while on shore). They work mostly in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) 1 ofNew Zealand, beyond the Territorial Sea 2 ; and spend a limited amount of time within New Zealand's territorial limits 3 at any time of their engagement with the fishing company. It has been estimated that many of the non-resident crew members spend approximately 20% of the time they are employed within New Zealand's territorial limits. 3. The Government has decided to change the management regime for foreign charter vessels (FCVs) and introduced the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, which is promoted by the Minister for Primary Industries and has had its second reading. It is expected that the bill will be passed by the end ofMay 2014. 4. The Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Amendment Bill includes a requirement that all FCV s have to be flagged as New Zealand vessels ("reflagging") by May 2016. The companies utilising reflagged FCVs will need to comply with New Zealand employment laws and regulations, including meeting their tax obligations. 5. Prior to reflagging, most of the members of non-resident fishing crews were employed by overseas employers. Following reflagging, New Zealand companies will become the employers of the crews. The crew members remain non-resident for tax purposes, and as such they will be taxable on their New Zealand-sourced income only. New Zealand- sourced income forms a part of their total income, and represents the amount of income that can be apportioned to time spent within New Zealand's territorial limits. 6. For the majority of New Zealand-based salary and wage earners, the current PAYE mechanism provides accurate tax deductions during the year, thereby reducing the need for these taxpayers to file end-of-year tax returns. In addition, there are domestic service providers who reduce the compliance costs involved in filing an end-of-year return, such as tax refund intermediaries. 7. However, applying the existing PAYE taxation mechanism to non-resident members of the crews would result in over-taxation of their income, as the crew members work for part of the year only. They would also need to file tax returns to be able to access refunds of overpaid tax. However, most of the non-resident crews leave New Zealand within 1 Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) comprises an area which extends from the coast to 200 nautical miles (370 km), and includes the Territorial Sea. 2 Territorial Sea is the belt of coastal waters extending 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) from the New Zealand coast. 3 Territorial limits of New Zealand, for the purposes of this RIS, include both the land and the Territorial Sea. 2 days of the end of their engagement with the fishing companies. They would face significant difficulties in filing tax returns and receiving their refunds while based overseas. Additionally, many may not have knowledge of the relevant processes or the ability to access specialist services to assist them with filing tax returns. 8. Therefore, the problem addressed by this RIS is that the current income taxation mechanism (that is, the use of the tax code "M" and annual filing of a tax return) is not suitable for non-resident members of fishing crews, as it results in over-taxation, 1s unnecessarily complex and imposes additional compliance costs on these taxpayers. OBJECTIVES 9. The objectives are to: • increase the accuracy of tax deductions during the year for members of non-resident fishing crews • minimise compliance costs to the members of non-resident fishing crews • minimise administrative costs to Inland Revenue (by ensuring that the solution 1s feasible and can be implemented in a timely and a cost-effective manner). 10. It is acknowledged that there were trade-offs to be considered between the objectives. The preferred solution proposes a flat rate of 10.5% for all members of non-resident fishing crews. The application of this rate indicates the trade-off between accuracy of tax deductions, compliance and administrative costs. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. There are two options considered in this RIS: • Retaining status quo: this would include using the annualised tax rates, which are accurate for full-year earnings only, and the need to file an income tax return at year's end to obtain any refund. • Introducing new tax rules: these would involve a flat tax deduction rate and simplifying the tax obligations for members of non-resident fishing crews. A tax code taxing the earnings at the correct rate will be used, thereby removing the need or the requirement to file a tax return. Suggestions of methods to calculate the New Zealand-sourced portion of incomes of members of non-resident fishing crews were given careful consideration. However, they were dismissed because of their overall complexity. These suggestions are discussed in more detail below. Status quo 12. This option would involve members of non-resident fishing crews using the standard "M" tax code or applying for a special tax code ("STC"). If the M tax code is used, the members of fishing crews will be overtaxed, because this tax code assumes that an employee works for a full year. They would need to file a tax return at the year's end to 3 obtain a refund of the overpaid tax. If an STC tax code is used, the members of fishing crews will need to apply for the code before their first wage payment and to file a tax return at the year's end. Introducing the new taxation mechanism for non-resident fishing crews (preferred option) 13. This option would involve applying a flat 10.5% tax rate to the earnings of non-resident crew members, which would be final (unless a member chooses to file a return). The flat 10.5% rate would apply to the New Zealand-sourced portion of income of non-resident crews, and this portion would need to be calculated by employers based on the actual percentage of time spent by their employees within New Zealand' s territorial limits. 14. The flat 10.5% reflects the fact that the annual New Zealand-sourced income of the overwhelming majority of non-resident fishing crews is less than $14,000. This 10.5% flat rate corresponds to the rate charged on the same income earned by New Zealand residents. 15. There are a very small number of people in these non-resident fishing crews who earn annual New Zealand-sourced income above $14,000. The new taxation mechanism and the flat 10.5% tax rate will also apply to these members, for reasons of reduced compliance and administrative costs. A similar scheme already exists in relation to non- resident seasonal workers under the recognised seasonal employment scheme, under which all workers subject to the scheme are taxed at the same 10.5% flat rate even though a small percentage of them earn incomes higher than those of the majority. 16. ACC earner premium deducted would be based on the New Zealand-sourced income of the non-resident crew members, with the applicable rate being the rate in force at the time ofthe deduction. 17. The requirement to file a tax return would be removed. Although non-resident members of fishing crews will be able to file end-of-year tax returns if they wish to do so, it is not expected that they will do so to a significant degree. This is because the withholding rate of 10.5% will be the correct final rate in nearly all cases. 4 18. The following table provides an impact analysis ofboth options: Option Meets objectives Fiscal impacts Compliance Administrative impacts Net Impacts Status quo Only meets one of The net fiscal gain is Additional compliance costs imposed due to inaccurate tax This option is This option does not address the the three calculated at $0.6m, the deductions during the year, requiring fishing crew to file adm inistratively feasible. problem definition, only pattially objectives same as for the option annual tax returns to get a refund.

The costs associated with implementing of this option would be minor. 5 Social, environmental or cultural impacts of both options 19. There are no social, environmental or cultural impacts ofthe options. The groups primarily affected by the amendments proposed are the members of non-resident fishing crews. Consultation 20. Targeted consultation was undertaken with approximately 800 representatives of the New Zealand fishing industry, on the proposed tax regime to be put in place to ensure compliance while making payment oftax easier and fairer for non-resident crew under the new reflagging regime. Feedback from the consultation has been positive overall. The received feedback helped to shape the preferred policy solution- that is, the introduction of the new tax mechanism for non-resident fishing crews. 21. Submissions were received from six submitters: Independent Fisheries Limited, Sanford Limited, Sealord Group Limited, Solander Maritime Limited, Talleys Fisheries Limited, and the New Zealand Council ofTrade Unions. The Treasury and the Ministry for Primary Industries have also been consulted. 22. All submitters supported the introduction of the 10.5% flat tax rate on New Zealand- sourced income of non-resident members of fishing crews, and that the requirement to file tax returns for the members of non-resident fishing crews be removed. 23. In relation to the ACC earner premium, some submitters stated that the applicable rate should be that in force at time of the deduction from wages, and that it should not be set at a 1. 7% flat rate. This submission has been accepted. 24. Further in relation to the ACC earner premium and the ACC employer contribution, some submitters stated that it should not be payable, as they use private insurers instead. This submission has been declined because, in accordance with the Accident Compensation Act 2001, employers have to deduct the ACC earner premium fi:om wages paid to employees, and Inland Revenue has to forward this premium to the Accident Compensation Corporation. As to the ACC employer contribution, this is the sole responsibility of the Accident Compensation Corporation. 25. The majority of submitters proposed that all non-resident crew members, including captains, be subject to the same mechanism, including the 10.5% flat tax rate. Although captains earn incomes higher than those ofthe rest ofthe non-resident crews, the majority of submitters advocated for equal tax treatment of captains to reduce compliance costs on the captains and minimise administrative costs to their employers and to Inland Revenue. 26. Several submitters asked for clarification on how to determine what portion of income is subject to New Zealand tax. New Zealand fishing companies that use non-resident fishing crews engage them on different bases, and the duration of employment contracts can differ from several weeks to several months. 27. One submitter proposed a "rolling average" method, under which the portion of the New Zealand-sourced income in any current year is calculated on the basis ofthe data from the previous five income years. This submission was declined because of its overall complexity: if the submission was accepted, recently established fishing companies would 6 not be able to use it, because of the lack of data. Additionally, using the "rolling average" method would require recalculation of the portion of time spent by non-resident fishing crews within New Zealand's territorial limits. Therefore, it is doubtful that this method would result in reduced compliance costs. 28. To accommodate all circumstances, the portion of income that is sourced in New Zealand and is therefore subject to New Zealand tax should be based on the actual percentage of time spent by employees within New Zealand's territorial limits. Conclusions and recommendations 29. Introducing the new mechanism for members of non-resident fishing crews is the preferred option because it is an effective and simple solution. It achieves the objective of ensuring that the members of non-resident fishing crews are taxed at the correct tax rate and are not required to file tax returns. It also ensures that the implementation of the new tax mechanism is administratively feasible and can be done in a timely and cost-effective manner by Inland Revenue. 30. The status quo is not favoured because it is likely to involve unnecessary complexity for the members of non-resident fishing crews, as well as overtaxing their earnings. Implementation 31. The amendments will be included in the Fisheries (Foreign Charter Vessels and Other Matters) Amendment Bill, or will form part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances and Remedial Matters) Bill, by way of a Supplementary Order Paper at the Cmmnittee of the Whole House stage of the relevant bill. It is essential that these amendments are passed at the earliest available opportunity, to provide for certainty of tax treatment ofthe members of non-resident fishing crews. 32. The necessary legislative changes will be made to the Income Tax Act 2007 and Tax Administration Act 1994 to put this taxation mechanism into effect, with application from 1 October 2014. 33. There should be no significant implementation issues with the amendments. Inland Revenue will communicate the change in the rules through existing channels, including updating its guides. 34. The new rules will be administered by Inland Revenue as part of its business as usual activities. Monitoring, evaluation and review 35. There are no specific plans to monitor, evaluate and review the changes under the Income Tax Act 2007. If any concerns are raised, officials will determine whether there are substantive grounds for review under the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Inland Revenue will administer the new regime as part of its "Business as Usual". 36. In general, Inland Revenue's monitoring, evaluation and review of new legislation takes place under the GTPP. The GTPP is a multi-stage tax policy process that has been used to 7 design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. The final stage in the GTPP is the implementation and the review stage, which involves post-implementation review of the legislation, and the identification of any remedial issues. Opportunities for external issues to be addressed are also built into this stage. In practice, any changes identified as necessary for the new legislation to apply as intended would generally be added to the Tax Policy Work Programme, and proposals would go through the GTPP. 8
Regulatory Impact Statement Amateur sports promoters' tax exemption and sporting trusts Agency Disclosure Statement This Regulatory Impact Statement has been prepared by Inland Revenue. It provides an analysis of options to detennine whether trusts should be included in the ambit of the current income tax exemption for amateur sports promoters. Currently, trusts are not eligible for the income tax exemption for amateur sports promoters in the Income Tax Act 2007. Trusts are treated differently to other legal forms (such as a company) even though they may have the same or similar sporting purposes and meet the other requirements of the exemption. There is no policy justification for excluding trusts from the ambit of the income tax exemption in the modern environment. The question that this RIS seeks to address is whether the current tax treatment of amateur sports promoters aligns with current policy intentions. As a matter of principle, tax exemptions should be applied consistently to organisations with the same objects and purposes, regardless of their legal form. Therefore, the preferred option is to amend the law to confirm that trusts who otherwise meet the requirements of the exemption may be eligible for the exemption. Ministers have held limited discussions with sporting trusts and their tax advisers to understand the nature and extent ofthe problem and what options were available to address it. We believe this level of consultation was appropriate given the nature and size of the problem. The Treasury and Sport New Zealand were also consulted during the policy development process. There are no environmental or cultural impacts from these recommended changes. There are no other significant constraints, caveats and uncertainties concerning this regulatory impact analysis. The preferred option would not restrict market competition, reduce the incentives for businesses to innovate and invest, unduly impair private property rights or override fundamental common law principles. /2( /2t:'¥ Mike Nutsford } Policy Manage olicy and Strategy Inland Revenue 9 April2014 STATUS QUO AND PROBLEM DEFINITION Current law 1. Section CW 46 of the Income Tax Act provides that the income derived by a "club, society or association" established mainly to promote an amateur game or sport is exempt income. The game or sport must be conducted for the recreation or entertainment of the general public, and no part of the funds is available for the pecuniary profit of a member, proprietor or shareholder. 2. Inland Revenue's current interpretation is that section CW 46 does not apply to "trusts" that have been established for the purposes of promoting amateur sport. This is on the basis that a trust is not a "club, society, or association". The result of this interpretation is that a trust that has been established to promote an amateur game or sport, and that otherwise meets the requirements of section CW 46, is treated differently from other entities established with an identical purpose. The problem 3. The problem is that the current law does not align with current policy settings. 4. Inland Revenue's review of the policy history of section CW 46 found no material that directly addressed the question of whether trusts were explicitly considered when the exemption was introduced in 1933. However, there is policy documentation associated with the 1948 amendment to section CW 46 that suggests that the types of bodies intended to benefit from the tax exemption included district and national boxing associations; clubs and associations connected with cricket, tennis, golf, rugby and association football; and generally any entity or organisation established for the promotion of any amateur game or sport. 5. The policy documentation seemed to focus on the purpose rather than the legal form of the entity carrying out that purpose. It may be that trusts were not specifically considered at the time because the trust form was not a common vehicle for carrying out promotion of amateur sporting activities. The proliferation of trusts has been a relatively recent occurrence. 6. We consider that, in the modern environment, there is no policy basis for excluding trusts from the amateur sports promoters' income tax exemption. As a matter of principle, tax exemptions should be applied consistently to organisations with the same objects and purposes, regardless oftheir legal form. 7. Recently, there have been several calls from the sporting community for the Minister for Sport and Recreation and the Minister of Revenue to prioritise an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to address an anomaly in relation to the tax treatment of sporting trusts. Advice received from some tax practitioners who act for these sporting trusts is that community-based Auckland sporting trusts currently rely on section CW 46, and if Inland Revenue were to pursue these trusts, they are likely to be exposed to unexpected and significant taxation liabilities. 2 8. There are 20,593 entities currently relying on the amateur sport promoters' exemption and 152 of them have a legal form of a trust. It appears that Inland Revenue has in the past accepted trusts as meeting the eligibility requirements of the amateur sport promoters' exemption. Therefore, the effect of Inland Revenue's current interpretation is that these entities would no longer be eligible for the exemption. 9. Inland Revenue has also undertaken a sample review of the current sporting trusts that are not currently relying on the amateur sport promoters' exemption but who might be eligible for the exemption if trusts were included. The review indicated that these entities pay little or no tax currently. This may be due to the fact that these entities are eligible for the $1,000 deduction for non-profit organisations and some might qualify for a tax exemption as charity. OBJECTIVES 10. The objectives ofthe current examination are: • To provide certainty of tax treatment for organisations who undertake activities relating to amateur sports promotion. • To provide fair and consistent tax outcomes for amateur sports promoters with different legal structures. REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS 11. Inland Revenue considers there is only one feasible option for addressing the current problem - that is, to change the law. The status quo and non-regulatory options would not have been feasible as Inland Revenue's view of the existing law is well-settled and clear. 12. The two options assessed below are: • Option I: status quo which is to retain the existing law. Under this option the law would remain unchanged. Sporting trusts would continue not to be eligible for the income tax exemption for amateur sports promoters; or • Option 2: change the law (preferred option). Under this option, the section CW 46 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would be amended to include sporting trusts and the amendment would be retrospective in nature. The retrospective amendment ensures that sporting trusts that have relied on the exemption will be unaffected by Inland Revenue's current interpretation. Analysis 13. The table below summarises for each option which of the objectives it meets as well as the economic, fiscal, administrative, and compliance impacts. 3 Option Objectives met or Economic impact Compliance and Net impacts partly met and fiscal impacts administrative impacts Option 1 This option meets No discernible Increased tax and The status quo is the objective of economic impacts compliance costs not sustainable as it Status quo, which certainty but not for approximately leads to unfair is to retain the fairness 152 entities as they outcomes as trusts existing law move from being are treated tax-exempt to differently to other taxpaying entities legal forms Trusts might also incur compliance costs by restructuring into an eligible entity to access the exemption Increased administrative costs for Inland Revenue Option 2 This option meets No There will be both This option will both objectives discernible administrative provide certainty Change law by econom1c costs for Inland for sporting trusts including sporting impacts Revenue and and improve the trusts in the income compliance costs equity between tax exemption for Sporting trusts that for sporting trusts sporting trusts and Amateur sports have not relied on in situations where other le gal promoters the exemption sporting trusts who structures involved could do so after do not currently in amateur sports the proposed rely on the promotion change, we note exemption seek that the fiscal cost Inland Revenue's would be negligible confirmation that for this group they are eligible for because most of the exemption. these entities would However, the currently be relying administrative cost on other tax implications arising exemptions.

Inland Revenue and Ministers have held limited discussions with sporting trusts and their tax advisers to understand the nature and extent of the problem and what options were available to address it. 16. It was noted in these discussions that there are community-based Auckland sporting trusts currently relying on section CW 46, and if Inland Revenue were to pursue these trusts, they are likely to be exposed to unexpected and significant taxation liabilities. They also considered that the only way to address the anomaly is to change the law to enable trusts who meet the purpose and technical requirements of the exemption to be eligible for the exemption. We believe this level of consultation was appropriate given the nature and size of the problem. 17. The Treasury and Sport New Zealand were consulted during the po !icy development process. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 18. The question that this RIS seeks to address is whether the current tax treatment of amateur sp01is promoters aligns with current policy intentions. As a matter of principle, tax exemptions should be applied consistently to organisations with the same objects and purposes, regardless of their legal form. We believe the only feasible way to align the current legislation with current po !icy intentions is to change the law (option two) -that is, to amend the law to confirm that trusts may be eligible for the income tax exemption for amateur sports promoters. 19. Furthermore, we consider that the amendment should be retrospective in nature on the basis that it will give current sp01iing trusts that are relying on section CW 46 certainty that their tax-exempt status is preserved. We consider that it is sufficient for the amendment to apply for the past four income years, which corresponds to the time in which the Cmmnissioner of Inland Revenue can reassess tax liabilities. IMPLEMENTATION 20. Implementing the proposed change will require an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is reco1mnended that the necessary amendments be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill by way of a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP). That SOP would be tabled at the Cmmnittee of the Whole House stage. This stage may occur as early as 6 May 2014. 21. Inland Revenue recommends that the amendment takes effect retrospectively for the past four income years, which corresponds to the time in which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can reassess tax liabilities. 22. The Minister of Revenue and the Minister for Sport and Recreation will issue a press statement announcing the proposal, when the SOP is introduced. 5 MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REVIEW 23. Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 24. The final step in the process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post-implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Opportunities for external consultation are also built into this stage. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 6
Page 1 June 2014 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Cheque duty repeal This special report provides early information on the impending abolition of cheque duty. The repeal of cheque duty is provided for by the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014, which received Royal assent on 19 May 2014. Information in this special report precedes coverage of the new legislation that will be published in the July 2014 edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Sections 1 to 5 of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014; sections 2, 76 to 86 and 86F of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; sections 144 and 184A(5)(d) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 From 1 July 2014, cheque duty will no longer be payable on cheques printed or supplied by a bank to its customers. Additionally, from 1 July 2014, cheque duty will not be payable on bills of exchange for which cheque duty has not been prepaid. Background Cheque duty applies to bills of exchange (most commonly cheques) at a rate of 5 cents per bill of exchange. The Government recently decided that cheque duty should be repealed, as:  the duty no longer raises substantial revenue and the revenue raised is in decline; and  cheque duty is easy to avoid, since closely substitutable transaction types (such as cash, EFTPOS, internet banking and credit card transactions) are not subject to any duty. It is therefore inefficient and has a small distortionary effect. The Government decided that it wanted to relieve cheque users of the duty as soon as practicable. The application date of 1 July 2014 was chosen for the repeal because it tied into the return cycle for cheque duty purposes. Repealing legislation was included as Part 1 of the Budget Measures (Miscellaneous Fiscal Matters) Bill, introduced on 15 May 2014. This bill was divided at the committee of the whole House stage, with Part 1 becoming the Cheque Duty Repeal Bill. The Cheque Duty Repeal Bill received Royal assent on 19 May 2014. Page 2 Key features  Cheque duty will not be payable on a bill of exchange drawn or made on or after 1 July 2014.  Cheque duty will not be payable by banks on cheques supplied to their customers on or after 1 July 2014.  Cheque duty will not be payable on cheques printed on or after 1 July 2014.  Banks and printers of cheques, which were licensed under the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 for the quarter or month ended 30 June 2014, will be required to file a final cheque duty return and make a final payment of cheque duty for that period by 21 July 2014.  Licensed printers of cheques or temporary licensees who apply in writing to Inland Revenue by 21 July 2014 for a refund of cheque duty they have paid within the last eight years may be refunded in relation to cheques that have not been printed, or unused cheques that have been destroyed before 1 July 2014.  Banks that were licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 during the quarter ended 30 June 2014 will be able to claim, as a deduction from their final payment of cheque duty, an effective refund of cheque duty they have paid within the last eight years in relation to cheques that have not been used and have been destroyed by the bank during the quarter ended 30 June 2014. This includes any cheques they have sent to their customers but were defaced or spoiled before the customer used them. Application dates Cheque duty is repealed from 1 July 2014. Some provisions will remain in force until 21 July 2014, the due date for final cheque duty returns, payments and refund applications. These provisions are necessary to ensure that banks and printers of cheques file their final cheque duty return and make payment for the period ending 30 June 2014, and will enable applications for refunds of cheque duty to be made. Detailed analysis Removal of liability to pay cheque duty There are three categories of persons that currently pay cheque duty to Inland Revenue:  Licensed banks;  Licensed printers of cheques; and  Temporary licensees. The effect of the provisions of the Cheque Duty Repeal Act 2014 on each of these categories is explained below. Page 3 Licensed banks A bank that is licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 will have its licence cancelled on 1 July 2014. From 1 July 2014, cheque duty will not be payable on cheques the bank supplies to its customers or procures on its own behalf. A bank that was licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 during the quarter ended 30 June 2014 will be required to file a final cheque duty return (IR 193) and make a final payment of cheque duty for that quarter by 21 July 2014. Licensed printers of cheques A printer that is licensed under section 82 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 will have its licence cancelled on 1 July 2014. From 1 July 2014, cheque duty will not be payable on cheques a printer prints for the use of its customers or on its own behalf. A printer that was licensed under section 82 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 during the month ended 30 June 2014 will be required to file a final cheque duty return (IR 191) and make a final payment of cheque duty (if any is payable) for that month by 21 July 2014. Temporary licensees A person who has a temporary licence granted under section 83 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 authorising the printing and use of cheques prepaid with cheque duty will have their licence cancelled on 1 July 2014. A printer that has an authority to print the prepaid cheques to which such a licence relates will also have its authority cancelled on 1 July 2014. Removal of liability when cheque duty has not been prepaid Currently, if cheque duty has not been prepaid on a bill of exchange, the bill of exchange must be duly stamped (by affixing a postage stamp or stamps for the amount of cheque duty payable on the bill, cancelling each stamp, and stating on the bill the true date of cancellation) by:  the drawer or maker of the bill, if the bill of exchange is drawn or made in New Zealand; or  the first holder of the bill in New Zealand, for a bill of exchange drawn or made outside New Zealand. Cheque duty will not be payable on a bill of exchange drawn or made in New Zealand from 1 July 2014. Additionally, from 1 July 2014, for a bill of exchange drawn or made outside New Zealand, cheque duty will not be payable by the first holder of the bill in New Zealand before the holder further acts on the bill. Page 4 Termination of agreements for exemption from cheque duty Currently, Inland Revenue has the power, under section 80 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, to enter into a written agreement with specified bodies exempting them from paying cheque duty. Instead, a sum equivalent to the cheque duty that otherwise would have been payable must be paid to Inland Revenue on dates specified in the agreement. All agreements under section 80 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 will be terminated on 1 July 2014. Any sum accrued (but not yet paid) under the agreement by the date of termination will remain payable by the date specified in the agreement. Refunds of cheque duty Cheque duty may be refunded to those that paid cheque duty as a licensed printer of cheques or as a temporary licensee, upon application. Application must be made in writing to Inland Revenue’s Duties Unit by 21 July 2014 for a refund of cheque duty paid within the last eight years in relation to cheques that have not been printed, or unused cheques that have been destroyed before 1 July 2014. The minimum refund is $1. Licensed banks cannot make an application to Inland Revenue for a refund of cheque duty. Instead, when banks that were licensed during the quarter ended 30 June 2014 file their final cheque duty return by 21 July 2014, they will be able to deduct (from the amount of cheque duty payable for the quarter) the cheque duty they have paid (within the last eight years) on cheques that have not been used and have been destroyed by the bank during the quarter ended 30 June 2014. This includes any cheques they have sent to their customers that were defaced or spoiled before the customer used them. Offences specific to cheque duty There are several criminal offences (and associated penalties) under section 144 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that relate specifically to the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The following offences, which will become redundant upon the repeal of cheque duty, will be repealed on 1 July 2014:  failure to comply with a provision of section 84 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971;  being licensed under section 83 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, or being a printer authorised under that section, and failing to comply with a provision of that section, or of a licence or authority granted under that section; and  without first being licensed or authorised under Part 6 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 to do so, printing on a bill of exchange or bill of exchange form an inscription indicating that the cheque duty for the bill or form has been paid. Page 5 The following offences will remain in force from 1 July 2014:  being a bank licensed under section 81 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, failing to comply with a provision of that section or of any licence granted under that section; and  being a printer licensed under section 82 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971, failing to comply with a provision of that section or of a licence granted under that section. However, from 1 July 2014, a bank or printer that has had its licence cancelled on 1 July 2014 because of the repealing legislation will be treated as being licensed (under the applicable section), for the purposes of these two offences. This ensures that these two existing offences continue to apply in respect of non-compliance with the requirement for these banks and printers to file a final cheque duty return and make a final payment of cheque duty by 21 July 2014. The two remaining offences will be repealed on 22 July 2014 following the 21 July 2014 due date for final cheque duty returns to be filed and payments of cheque duty made. Cheque duty repeal – questions we’ve been asked Q: Can cheques printed/issued after 30 June 2014 continue to say “Cheque duty paid” on them for some time until the pre-printed base stock is exhausted and printers have made the necessary changes? A: Yes. After cheque duty has been repealed, it will not be an offence to print or issue cheques indicating that cheque duty has been paid. These cheques will still be able to be used. Q: Will Inland Revenue continue to administer a licensing regime for printers of cheques after cheque duty has been repealed? A: No. The purpose of the requirement for printers to be licensed by Inland Revenue in order for them to be allowed to print cheques prepaid with cheque duty is to protect the integrity of the collection of cheque duty. Once cheque duty is repealed, this need for Inland Revenue to administer a licensing regime for printers of cheques will no longer exist. If the licensing regime provided any other benefits, these were purely incidental.
June 2014 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Employee allowances This special report provides early information on changes to the tax rules that deal with the taxation of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure. The changes were introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Emplo yee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill enacted on 30 June 2014. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in the August edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Sections CE 1, CE 1B, CE 1C, CE 1D, CE 1E, CE 5, CW 16B, CW 16C, CW 16D, CW 16E, CW 16F, CW 17, CW 17CB, CW 17CC, CX 19, CZ 23, CZ 29, CZ 30 and CZ 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Changes have been made to the taxation of emplo yer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments made by employers to cover employee expenditure. From 1 April 2015, a new set of rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 replaces the previous rules applying to accommodation, allowances and payments. The rules can be applied retrospectively in some cases. These changes are intended to bring greater clarity and cohesion to the rules, making it easier for taxpayers to understand and comply with their obligations. Key features The key changes are: Accommodation • time limits on when accommodation provided in relation to out-of-town secondments and capital projects is non-taxable (up to two years for secondments and three years for capital projects); Page 1 • a special transitional rule for Canterbury earthquake recovery projects; • a multiple workplace rule that exempts accommodation provided when an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis; • an exemption for accommodation provided when an employee is required to attend a meeting, training course or conference as part of their jo b that requires at least an overnight stay; • confirmat ion that the taxable value of accommodation provided is the market rental value, less any rent paid by the employee and any adjustment for business use of the accommodation; • specific exclusions from the definit io n of “accommodation”; • a specific valuation rule for accommodation supplied by religious bodies to their ministers (confirming a longstanding administrative practice); • a specific valuation rule for accommodation provided by the New Zealand Defence Force to personnel, reflecting the specific limitations imposed on these properties; and • capping the taxable value of employer-funded accommodation as part of an overseas posting at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity that the employee would live in if in New Zealand. Meals • exempting meal payments linked to work travel, subject to a three-month upper time limit at a particular work location; • exempting without time limit meal payments and light refreshments outside of work-related travel, such as at conferences. Clothing • payments provided to cover the cost of distinctive work clothing, such as uniforms, will be exempt (mirroring the treatment under the fringe benefit tax rules); • payments to meet the costs of plain clothes allowances paid to members of a uniformed service who are required to wear ordinary clothing instead of their uniform will also be exempt, provided certain conditions are met. Other • a power allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to issue a determination in relation to an expenditure payment made to a wide group or class of employees, determining the extent to which the particular type of expense payment is taxable. A determination will be binding on the Commissioner but not the taxpayer, meaning it will act as a safe harbour. Page 2 Background Over recent years there have been so me significant concerns around the tax treatment of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances, reimbursements and payments by employers to cover employee expenditure (generically referred to as employee expenditure payments). Previous tax legislation could lead to impractical outcomes that may have differed fro m the way employers applied the rules in practice. Under the previous rules, when an employee expenditure payment was made, provided it was to cover a work expense, it was not taxable, as long as there was no private, domestic or capital element to the expense. This treatment matched the general deductibility rules in the legislation. However, when there was a private or domestic element in the linked expense, that element was taxable. This was because it was considered to be in effect an alternative to receiving more salary or wages, which would be taxed. An expense is private or domestic in nature if it is intended to further some personal purpose or provide a private or domestic benefit. As meals, accommodation and normal clothing are inherently private benefits, the starting position under tax law is that any employee expenditure payment to cover these sorts of expenses should be taxed. In many instances, however, the private aspect is either incidental to the business objective or is minimal or hard to measure, and apportionment between the private and employment purpose is not practical given the compliance costs associated with separating out the relative elements. Accordingly, under the new rules, specific exemption provisions apply the principle that the private amount should be ignored when it is low in value or hard to measure, and is not provided as a substitute for salary or wages. The new rules were developed after significant consultation, both leading up to the release of the November 2012 issues paper, Reviewing the tax treatment of employee allowances and other expenditure payments, and subsequently. A total of 27 submissions were received on the suggestions in the officials’ issues paper. Most focussed on the tax treatment of accommodation expenses, and establishing a boundary between private and work-related expenditure. Subsequently, Inland Revenue officials carried out further consultation with key stakeholders, including the Corporate Taxpayers Group, New Zealand Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority. The main area of concern was that any new rules should encompass not only work-related secondments but also employee involvement in longer-term projects. Those projects included work on the Canterbury earthquake recovery and projects in other locations throughout New Zealand (for example, the ultra-fast broadband roll-out, dam rebuilds and other major water storage projects, and road building projects). The legislat io n introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Bill took this feedback into account. Page 3 The Finance and Expenditure Committee received 25 written submissions (from 20 submitters) on the employee allowances provisions in the bill. Generally, submitters were supportive of the overall aims of the changes, subject to areas where clarifications or amendments were sought. As with the earlier consultation, the majority of submissions were in relation to the accommodation rules. The Committee recommended the following changes: • Four exceptions where accommodation provided in connection with employment would not be subject to tax, to allow for situations involving shift work or remote workplaces when it is considered it would be inappropriate to tax accommodation provided in connection with employment. The exceptions cover mobile workplaces such as ships, trucks or oil rigs, a station in Antarctica, lodging provided for shift workers such as fire-fighters, ambulance staff and care-givers, and accommodation provided at remote locations where an employee is expected to “fly in and out”, such as mines in Australia. • A regulation-making power so other exceptions can be made in future – while the exceptions provided in the legislation are considered reasonably comprehensive, there may be unforeseen situations that arise when it would be inappropriate for work-related accommodation to be taxed. • Allow uneven apportionment of shared accommodation if the employees involved and their employer agree it is reasonable – for example, to reflect a difference in the size of their rooms. • Refine and simplify the valuation rule for accommodation provided by churches to ministers of religion. • Amend the rule regarding accommodation provided in relat ion to secondments or capital projects to better allow for situations when expectations about the length of secondment change. • Include snack foods within exempt “light refreshments” and remove the requirement for an employee to work at least seven hours in order to be ent it led to exempt light refreshments. • Allow application of the new work-related meal rules to be backdated to 1 April 2011, provided the employer has not treated the work-related meals as taxable, to allow the status quo to continue without the need to reopen tax positions (provided they fall within the new rules). Application dates The majorit y o f the amendments apply fro m 1 April 2015. However, employers have the option to backdate the accommodation rules to accommodation provided fro m 1 January 2011 provided they have not taken a tax posit ion before 6 December 2012 that the accommodation was taxable. Similarly, employers have the option to apply the work-related meal rules from 1 April 2011, provided they have not already taken a tax position that the expenditure is taxable. Page 4 Other exceptions: • The distinctive work clothing rule, which applies from 1 July 2013. • The transitional rules for Canterbury earthquake-related accommodation, which are treated as coming into force on 4 September 2010. • The transitional rule for New Zealand Defence Force-provided accommodation, which is treated as coming into force on 6 December 2012. Detailed analysis The main taxing provisions for accommodation remain in section CE 1, which deals with amounts derived in connection with employment. This section includes a definit ion o f “accommodation” which includes board or lodging, and the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof), whether permanent or temporary. The inclusive aspect of the definition of “accommodation” is unchanged from the previous rules. Ordinarily, “board or lodging” can refer to the provision of the employee’s meals and somewhere to sleep. When an employee is provided with a self-contained living space with most of the facilities necessary for independent living, what is provided is the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof). We expect, in practice, that in most cases what is provided is the use of a house or living premises (or part thereof). Exclusions from the definition of “accommodation” Under the new rules the definit io n o f “accommodation” in section CE 1 has been modified by introducing four specific exclusions involving shift work or remote workplaces, namely: • a berth, room or other lodging provided on a mobile workplace such as a ship, truck or oil rig; • a station in Antarctica; • lodging provided for shift workers such as fire-fighters, ambulance staff and care-givers when they are periodically required to sleep at their workplace, and the accommodation is provided only for the duration of the performance of the duties; and • accommodation provided at remote locations outside New Zealand, such as mines in Australia, where an employee is expected to “fly in and fly out”. In addition, section CE 1(4) enables the Governor-General, by Order in Council, to make regulations to add to the types of accommodation that are excluded from the definit ion o f “accommodation”. While the exceptions provided are considered reasonably comprehensive, there may be other situations that arise in future when it would also be inappropriate for work-related accommodation to be taxed. Page 5 Section CE 1 includes an expanded definition of “emplo yer” to ensure that accommodation provided by an overseas employer is covered. The expanded definition also covers situations when an employee is seconded by their employer (Company A) to another company (Company B), and the accommodation is provided by Company B, but the employee remains employed by and paid by Company A. “Accommodation” that is tax-exempt When the accommodation falls within the statutory definition of “accommodation” it may still be exempt from tax. The new rules specifically set out a number of exemptions. 1. Employee accommodation – out-of-town secondments and projects Emplo yer-provided accommodation or an accommodation payment provided because an employee needs to work at a new work location (and that location is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their home) is tax exempt provided the fo llo wing condit io ns are met: • there is eit her a reasonable expectation that the employee’s secondment to that work location will be for a period of two years or less, in which case the payment will be exempt for up to two years; or • the move is to work on a project of limited duration whose principal purpose is the creation, enhancement or demolition of a capital asset and the employee’s involvement in that project is expected to be for no more than three years, in which case the maximum exemption period is three years. If the move is to work on Canterbury earthquake recovery projects, the maximum period is extended to five years if the employee starts work in the period commencing on 4 September 2010 and ending on 31 March 2015, and to four years if the employee starts work in the period commencing 1 April 2015 and ending 31 March 2016. The maximum period reverts to three years if the employee starts work on or after 1 April 2016. Example 1 Adam is an accountant who has worked for his employer in Auckland for 10 years where he lives with his family. He is sent by his employer to New Plymouth for three months to carry out an audit of a large client before returning to the Auckland office. Adam’s employer reimburses his hotel costs in New Plymouth. As Adam’s employer expects him to work in New Plymouth for less than two years, the payment that Adam receives reimbursing him for his accommodation costs in New Plymouth is exempt income. Example 2 Bill lives in Wellington. His job is moved permanently to Auckland but he chooses not to move his family and commutes on a weekly basis, returning to Wellington at the weekend. Bill’s employer pays him an accommodation allowance towards his Auckland accommodation costs. Bill and his employer expect he will work at the Auckland workplace for more than two years. The accommodation allowance is not tax exempt under the two-year rule. Page 6 Accommodation linked to long-term projects of limited duration The maximum exempt period of three years allowed for involvement in longer-term projects takes into account certain business practices, particularly in the construction industry. The employees might be housed at or near the construction site, might share accommodation and might be employed on a “fly in/fly out” basis so would not be relocating. Employees may be recruited specifically from overseas with no intention that they ever relocate permanently to New Zealand. Example 3 Eddie is seconded by his employer to work on a dam construction project for a client in a remote area of the North Island. Because of the scale of the project, the number of workers and the remoteness of the location, Eddie’s employer sets up an accommodation facility to house its employees. The dam project is expected to take around five years to complete. However, Eddie’s employer expects him to work on the project for only the first two and a half years. Eddie is working on a project involving the construction of a capital asset so the three-year upper time limit applies. His employer expects him to be working at the distant work location for less than three years so the value of the accommodation is exempt. While the projects covered by the three-year maximum exemption will often relate to the construction industry, they may also involve, for example, upgrades of existing infrastructure and information technology development and implementation. The duration of the project can be longer than three years as the test is based on the time the employee is involved in the project, rather than the length of the project. The project will also have to satisfy the following requirements: • creation of a capital asset – the principal aim of the project will have to be the creation of a capital asset of some form, whether a new capital asset, a replacement of an existing asset, an upgrade, or refurbishment; • employment duties specific to the project – the employee will need to be engaged exclusively on project work (bar incidental activities); and • the project must involve work for a client not related to the employer. When does the exemption cease? The payment or the emplo yer-provided accommodation will cease to be tax-exempt before the respective maximum period if any of the following occur: • the employer pays the employee’s costs associated with buying a house in or near the new work location, as an eligible relocation expense; • there is a change in the expectation that the employee will be at the new location for, as relevant, a maximum of two years or three years; or • the employee’s involvement in the secondment or project comes to an end before the maximum time is up. Page 7 Example 4 Donna works for an employer in Auckland. Her employer sends her to work in Hamilton for an expected 18-month period. After four months, Donna decides that she wants to relocate permanently to Hamilton and her employer agrees to make her job there permanent. Donna’s employer has agreed to pay her an accommodation allowance for the first six months after arrival. Up to the four-month point, Donna’s employer’s expectation was that she would not be working in Hamilton for more than two years, and payments to cover accommodation up to that point are exempt under the two-year rule. But given the expectation is now that Donna will be working in Hamilton for more than two years, payments to cover Donna’s accommodation after four months would be taxable. The point in time at which an expectation is treated as having changed is when the employer has a firm expectation that the secondment or role on the project will last longer than initially expected. This may be evidenced by modification in the employee’s terms of employment, but in many cases there may not be a written agreement. Instead, there may be other documentation such as board minutes, planning documents, correspondence with the third party for whom the employer is carrying out the capital project, and so on, that will demonstrate that the expectation has changed. What if the expected period initially exceeds the time limit but subsequently reduces? If a secondment is initially expected to exceed the relevant two or three years, it will be subject to tax. However, if this expectation changes during the course of the secondment, and the total period will be less than the relevant time limit, the payment or emplo yer-provided accommodation becomes tax-exempt from the date the expectation changes. The payment or employer-provided accommodation up to the date the expectation changes remains taxable (there is no retrospective exemption following the change in expectation). Example 5 Sam lives in Napier. His employer sends him to Tauranga to set up and manage a new office. The initial expectation is that Sam will be in Tauranga for two years and six months. Sam’s employer provides him with accommodation in Tauranga. The accommodation will be taxable as the secondment is expected to exceed two years. One year into the secondment Sam’s employer decides that Sam only needs to stay in Tauranga another six months as the company has found someone to run the office on a permanent basis. As the expectation of the total secondment duration is now less than two years (18 months total), the final six months of the accommodation provided to Sam are exempt from tax. The first 12 months, before the change in expectation, remain taxable. Page 8 Residence and reasonable daily travelling distance To qualify for the accommodation exemptions, an employee must be moving to a workplace that is not within reasonable daily travelling distance of their residence. “Residence” and “reasonable daily travelling distance” are not defined. In this context (as in section CW 17B, in relation to relocation payments) “residence” refers to the employee’s home immediately before the secondment. The distance test is assessed in relation to that residence. The concept of “reasonable daily travelling distance” also appears in section CW 17B. Following the introduction of that provision, guidance on the meaning of “reasonable daily travelling distance” was published in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 21, No 9 (December 2009), page 6. This guidance is also applicable to the accommodation exemptions. Relationship with the relocation payments rule If an employee is not eligible for the secondment or capital project exemption, they may still qualify for an accommodation exemption for up to three months under section CW 17B and Determination 09/04 (provided the relevant criteria are met). Sections CW 16C(1)(c) and CW 16C(2)(c) provide that eligibility for the section CW 16B exemption ends if an employee receives a relocation payment under sectio n CW 17B in relation to the costs associated with settling the purchase of a new home. Anti-avoidance rules The rules are subject to certain conditions to protect against abuse: • The exemption does not apply if accommodation is provided under an explicit salary trade-off arrangement. • There is an anti-avoidance rule to prevent behaviour intended simply to restart the respective time limit. New employees The exemptions described above apply to accommodation provided to existing emplo yees, and to new employees in specific instances. New employees qualify for the three-year exemption, subject to the same conditions as existing employees, including that the work is on a project of limited duration and their contract is for a period of three years or less. This ensures there is no disparit y between the treatment of new and existing employees working on the same project. Page 9 New employees only qualify for the two-year exemption when: • the emplo yee is newly recruited to work at a particular work location but is then sent to work at another work location temporarily – for example, an individual is recruited to work in Auckland but is then sent to work in Dunedin for a mont h before returning to Auckland; or • an employee working for one employer is seconded to work for another employer on a temporary basis, with the expectation that the employee will return to work for the original employer – for example, an individual working for an Australian accountancy firm is sent to work for an affiliated New Zealand firm in Auckland for 18 months. A more restrictive approach is taken for new employees under the two-year rule compared with the three-year rule because the scope for behavioural changes to the way new employees are remunerated is considered to be greater when fewer limitations are in place. The existing rules applying to tax-exempt relocatio n payments will continue to be available to these new employees. Exceptional circumstances There is restricted ability to extend the thresholds in exceptional circumstances. Exceptional circumstances are confined to those that are outside the control of the employer and employee, such as a natural disaster or medical emergency, that mean the employee has to stay at the work location beyond the maximum tax-free time threshold. The time limit can be extended for as long as the employee is unable to leave the work location because of the exceptional circumstance. Accommodation linked to Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work Given the special nature and scale of the Canterbury earthquake reconstruction work, there is a transitional rule (new section CZ 29) for emplo yer-provided or paid accommodation for emplo yees working on Canterbury earthquake reconstruction projects over the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2019. a) When the employment duties of the emplo yee require them to work in greater Christchurch on a project or projects for rebuilding or recovery work arising out of the Canterbury earthquakes, the time limits in the section CW 16B(5) definition of “project of limited duration” are effectively replaced by the following: • five years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 4 September 2010 to 31 March 2015; • four years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016; and • three years when the employee’s date of arrival is in the period from 1 April 2016 onwards, for arrivals up to 31 March 2019. The normal three-year rule will apply to Canterbury rebuild and recovery work fro m 1 April 2019. Page 10 b) When the date of arrival in “greater Christchurch” (as defined in the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011) is in the period from 4 September 2010 (the date of the first earthquake) to 31 March 2015, the time limit will be applied by reference to the time the employee works continuously in greater Christchurch rather than to any expectation. For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer’s expectation. This approach also applies more generally for out-of-town secondments and projects (see section CZ 30) so that for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2015, the relevant time limit is applied by reference to the time the employee works continuously at the distant location rather than to any expectation. For other periods, the time limits apply based on the employer’s expectation. 2. Employee accommodation – ongoing multiple work places When an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis the accommodation or accommodation payment is tax-exempt without an upper time limit (section CW 16F). There are a number of circumstances in which an employee has to work at more than one workplace on an ongoing basis. These may be because of the nature of their duties or because the additional workplaces are beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from their home. This could be the case, for example, for senior managers of large organisations. In these circumstances there is an exempt ion for emplo yer- provided accommodation and accommodation payments, without an upper time limit, given that there will be genuine ongoing additional costs in such cases. (If the employee has multiple work places for a limited period, the two or three-year time limit-based exemptions may also apply.) Example 6 Andrew manages two offices, one in Christchurch and one in Dunedin. He works in Christchurch two days a week and in Dunedin for three days a week. His home is in Dunedin. Andrew has more than one ongoing work location. When he works in Christchurch, he is beyond reasonable daily travelling distance from his home in Dunedin. An accommodation payment to cover his hotel costs when staying in Christchurch is not taxable. The Christchurch accommodation is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. The Dunedin accommodation is not tax exempt. The multiple workplace rule can also apply when an employee is sent on a short-term business trip to another location. In these circumstances the employee will continue to have ongoing duties at their normal place of work while they are working at the other work location during the business trip. Page 11 Example 7 Carmen is chief executive of a large group of companies based in Auckland. The company has offices in a number of cities across New Zealand. Each month Carmen visits one of these offices as part of her management duties. Typically these visits can last up to a week and her employer arranges and pays for her accommodation. When Carmen is visiting the offices away from Auckland she has more than one ongoing workplace for the duration of her visit. The accommodation while working at those offices is exempt under the multiple workplace rule. 3. Employee accommodation – meetings, conferences and training courses When an employee needs to attend a work-related meeting, conference or training course that requires at least an overnight stay, the accommodation or accommodation payment is tax-exempt without an upper time limit (section CW 16D). While the need for accommodation would normally arise because the work-related meeting, conference or training course is beyond reasonable daily traveling distance from the employee’s home, this need not be the case. Some courses may be held locally but may require employees to stay overnight for reasons such as networking and team-building. Section CW 16D, therefore, covers both local and distant accommodation situations by extending the definition of “period of continuous work” to specifically include a location that is not distant from the employee’s regular workplace (see section CW 16D(4)). It is possible, depending on the circumstances, that the mult iple workplace exemption or the two or three-year time-based exemption could also apply. Accommodation for necessary travel in connection with performance of duties Section CW 16D exempts both accommodation at the location of the conference, training course, or work-related meeting and any accommodation for necessary travel in connection with the performance of the employee’s duties in connection with their attendance. This means that if a stopover is required in travelling to or from the location, accommodation at that stopover will also be exempt. Example 8 Matt is required to travel to London for an international conference. The timing of available flights means it is necessary for Matt to stay in Hong Kong for a night on the way to London between flights. The Hong Kong accommodation will be exempt, along with the accommodation in London for the duration of the conference. Page 12 Example 9 Sophie works in Auckland. Her employer requires her to attend a meeting in Canberra that starts early in the morning. No direct flights are available from Auckland to Canberra and the first flight from Auckland on the day of the meeting would not reach Sydney in time to catch the necessary connecting flight to Canberra. Sophie could either: a) fly to Canberra the day before (in which case the accommodation would be exempt under section CW 16D(1)(c)(i) or (ii)); or b) fl y t o Sydney and stay the night then take the first morning flight from Sydney to Canberra (in which case the Sydney accommodation would be exempt under section CW 16D(1)(c)(iii)). Accommodation for necessary travel in connection with secondments and capital projects As with meetings, conferences and training courses, accommodation for necessary travel to and from a distant workplace in relation to secondments and capital projects is also exempt (see section CW 16B(1)(c)(iii)). Taxable employee accommodation – determining its value When emplo yer-provided accommodation, accommodation allowances and other payments for accommodation are taxable, the amendments to sections CE 1 and CE 1B, and new sections CE 1C, CE 1D and CE 1E specify how to determine their taxable value. The taxable value of the accommodation continues to be linked to market rental value but will be subject to certain adjust ments and exceptions as fo llows: • The taxable value is confirmed as market rental value when accommodation is provided by the employer, less any rent paid by the employee and any adjustment for business/work use of the premises. There is also an adjustment when employees share accommodation, to avoid over-taxation. • The taxable value of employer-funded accommodation provided to employees as part of an overseas posting is capped at the average or median rental value for accommodation in the vicinity where the employee would live if in New Zealand (section CE 1C). This cap, which is of significance to employees who remain tax-resident in New Zealand, recognises that the market rental value of accommodation in overseas locations can be disproportionately high compared with that which an employee might occupy if working in New Zealand. • There is a specific rule to confirm that the market value is discounted in the case of accommodation provided to New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) personnel to reflect the specific limitations imposed on these properties (section CE 1D). Page 13 • There is also a specific valuat ion rule for accommodation supplied by religious bodies to their ministers (section CE 1E). A long-standing administrative practice has capped the benefit of church supplied accommodation at 10% of ministers’ st ipends. This longstanding practice has been incorporated into the legislation, subject to the amount to which this treatment applies being capped at a reasonable rental value that is commensurate with the duties of the minister and the location in which the minister performs his or her duties. This rule is intended to apply across a wide variety of churches. Apportionment of taxable value between employees when accommodation is shared Generally, when more than one employee shares the accommodation provided by their emplo yer, the taxable amount is eit her: • apportioned equally between the employees; or • if the employer and employees agree, apportioned between the employees on some other reasonable basis such as one employee having a larger room. Separate rules apply for ministers of religion. Example 10 Two employees share a house provided by their employer, with a weekly rental value of $300. They are each taxed on $150. Example 11 Three employees share a house with a weekly rental of $400. One employee has a much smaller room than the others and they all agree with their employer that the employee with the smaller room will be taxed on $100 and the other two employees will be taxed on $150 each. Work use of accommodation The deduction from the taxable amount when part of the accommodation is used for work purposes reflects current practice and the amendment is merely intended to clarify and confirm that approach. To qualify, a clearly identifiable part of the accommodation needs to be used “wholly or mainly” for work purposes related to the employee’s employment or service. The accommodation does not need to be used solely for work purposes to meet the “wholly or mainly” test, but it must at least be used predominantly for work purposes, and its primary purpose must be work-related. Any non-work-related use must be temporary or sporadic, or otherwise minor (such as using an office for checking personal emails or a family member occasionally using it for personal projects). The deduction is determined by apportioning between the business and private use. Page 14 Example 12 An employer provides an employee with accommodation with a market rental value of $500 a week. The employee has set up one of the bedrooms as an office, and it is usually only used as an office. However, the office has a couch that is also a fold-out bed. On occasion, when the employee has house guests, the office is also temporarily used as a place for the house guest to sleep. As the office is one- tenth of the total floor area of the accommodation, $50 is deducted from the weekly taxable amount. Accommodation for employees working overseas The exception to the general valuation rules allowing the use of a New Zealand-based value rather than the market value of the overseas accommodation applies not only to emplo yer-provided accommodation but also when the employer makes an accommodation payment for the employee’s accommodation costs at the overseas locat ion. In establishing the value of the comparable New Zealand property, regard must be had to the location where the employee would be likely to be working for the emplo yer, the equivalent accommodation the person would be likely to occupy if living in New Zealand, and the average or median market rental values at or near that New Zealand work location. Example 13 Zoe is seconded by her employer to Brussels for three years and is provided with a flat for the duration of her secondment. The rent paid by the employer is equivalent to $50,000 a year. Zoe would normally work in central Wellington if working in New Zealand, and would be likely to be living in a two- bedroom house in Thorndon where an average annual rental value would be $24,000. Zoe is taxed on an accommodation value of $24,000 per year. When there is more than one location in New Zealand where the employee could work for the emplo yer, a New Zealand-wide valuation can be used. There is a choice of using either the average market rental value or the median market rental value for the whole of New Zealand. There is a range of sources available to help determine average or median market rental values; for example, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment website http://www.dbh.govt.nz/market-rent provides market rental statistics based on bonds lodged with its Building and Housing Group. Accommodation provided to Defence Force personnel The valuation rule for accommodation provided to NZDF personnel is that, up to 31 March 2015, the rent currently being paid is treated as the market rental value (section CZ 31) and, after that date, the market rental value is the lesser of (i) the market rental value for the accommodation and (ii) the market rent for the national NZDF benchmark property of that type less a discount (section CE 1D). Page 15 Given the requirement for NZDF personnel to accept a posting anywhere in New Zealand, the NZDF has historically considered it appropriate to take a national approach to considering market rental value of NZDF accommodation. The deployment of personnel is concentrated around the central North Island, and therefore national benchmark properties have previously been assessed by reference to accommodation in the area of Linton Camp. Linton also offers a representative range of NZDF housing stock, reasonable access to amenities and a stable basis for rental comparison purposes. The benchmark properties, their market value and the discount will be determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and the Chief of Defence Force in consultat io n with a registered valuer. The determination of these matters must be reviewed every three years, at the instigation of either the Commissioner of Inland Revenue or the Chief of the Defence Force. Accommodation provided by religious bodies to ministers of religion The specific rule for accommodation provided to ministers of religion is given by the following formula: remuneration x (1 – adjustment) + excess rental where: remuneration is the amount that equals 10% of the remuneration that the minister receives for the income year for the performance of their duties as a minister; adjustment is the part of the value of the accommodation that is apportioned to work-related use, expressed as a decimal fraction of the total value of the accommodation. To be eligible for apportionment, the minister needs to use the relevant part of the accommodation wholly or mainly for work purposes. If more than one minister of religion lives in the accommodation, the adjustment is apportioned equally between them; excess rental is the amount (that is not less than zero) that is the difference between the accommodation’s market rental value for the income year and the market rental value for the income year of accommodation that is reasonably commensurate with the duties of the person as a minister and for the location in which they perform their duties. A “minister of religion” is defined “as a person who is ordained, commissioned, appointed or otherwise holds an office or position, regardless of their title or designation, as a minister of a religious denomination or community that meets the charitable purpose of the advancement or religion and whose duties are related mainly to the practice, study, teaching or advancement of religious beliefs; and whose accommodation is an integral part of performing their duties”. Page 16 The definition specifically excludes a member of a religious society or order who is covered by the exemption in section CW 25. That exemption relates to board and lodging provided to members of religious societies and orders whose sole occupation is service in a society or order and who are not paid for their service. The specific valuation rule for accommodation provided to ministers of religion therefore supplements, rather than replaces, the existing exemption in section CW 25. The requirement that a minister’s church-provided accommodation is used as an integral part of performing the minister’s duties refers to the expectation underlying a minister’s pastoral duties that some parishioners might visit their home, irrespective of whether this happens in practice. There is no intention that ministers need to measure such use. If the accommodation is provided for only part of the year, the calculations of the value are done with reference to that part of the year. Further guidance on determining taxable value During submissions to the Finance and Expenditure Committee, some submitters raised questions about how market rental value would be ascertained, particularly in relat ion to specific situat ions when accommodation is provided at the place of work, such as accommodation provided to staff at boarding schools. To assist emplo yers, Inland Revenue will be issuing operational guidance on the valuation of employer- provided accommodation. Payments to cover employee meals Employers typically meet an employee’s meal costs when linked to work-related duties. This recognises that these meals may be more expensive for the employee than normal meal costs at home. Under previous rules, when an employer reimbursed the cost of a work-related meal, the amount saved by the employee (their normal expenditure on the meal) was arguably taxable. 1 However, it would not be practical to carry out an apportionment each time a meal payment is made, so a more practical approach that better matches business practice was needed, given that these meal payments are generally not provided as a substitute for taxable salary. Section CW 17CB introduces two specific exemptions: • An exemption of up to three months for meal payments if the employee is required to work away fro m their normal work location because they are travelling on business. This may be for a specific short-term, work-related journey or for a longer period such as a secondment to a distant work location. 1 However, see application dates for new rules set out earlier. Page 17 • Payments to cover working meals and light refreshments when working off the employer’s premises are exempt without any upper time limit. In both circumstances, when the exemption applies, the full amount of any meal payment will be exempt. The exemption includes reimbursement payments and meal allowances. These rules do not affect the existing exemptions in section CW 17C that apply to overtime meal payments and sustenance allowances. Likewise, the direct provisio n o f a meal by an employer remains subject to the fringe benefit tax rules (including any “on premises” exemption) rather than the new rules. The rules that limit emplo yers’ deductions of entertainment expenses also continue to apply. Calculating the three-month time limit The three-month time limit runs from the date the employee starts working at the workplace and extends for as long as the employee works continuously at that locat ion. Example 14 Vernon normally works in Christchurch but is sent by his employer to work in the employer’s Nelson office for a period of six months. Vernon’s employer pays him a meal allowance for the duration of the secondment. The meal allowance is exempt for the first three months and taxable for the remainder of the secondment. If the employee is sent away from their normal workplace and for the period they are away does not have a fixed work base, but instead works at a variety of locations and works out of an accommodation base (a single accommodation location, away from their normal residence, from which they travel to the various workplaces), then the time limit will apply from the date at which they arrive at the accommodation base. Example 15 Bruce normally lives in Napier. He is sent by his employer to work on an infrastructure project that requires him to work in a variety of locations around the Waikato. Rather than moving to each location, Bruce rents a house to use as a base from which he can travel to those locations each day as required. The three-month time limit applies from the date Bruce moves to the rented accommodation. In determining whether the employee is working continuously at a particular location, periods when away from the location for personal reasons such as leave and weekend breaks and short breaks that are required for work purposes will be disregarded. The payment will not be exempt when it is paid by way of a salary trade-off. Page 18 Working meals and light refreshments at or near the employee’s normal work location Payments to cover meal expenses for a working meal near the employee’s work location will be exempt in certain circumstances. For example, this will include lunches at conferences or training courses near their normal work location. The expense will only be exempt if the employee attends the meal because of the nature of the duties of the job. The meal expense will not be exempt if it is provided as a salary trade-off. The amendments will also introduce an exemption for payments for light refreshments (in the form of snack food such as biscuits and fruit, or liquid refreshments such as tea or coffee), when the following criteria are met: • the nature of an employee’s employment duties mean they have to be away fro m the emplo yer’s premises for most of the day; • the employer would normally provide the refreshments to the employee on the day; and • it is not practicable for the employer to provide the refreshments on the day. Example 16 Jane normally works in an office where her employer provides tea and coffee for employees while working. Jane is required to spend two days out of the office staffing a recruitment stand for her employer at a local employment expo. During her attendance at the expo, it is not practical for Jane’s employer to provide her with tea or coffee. A payment made by Jane’s employer to cover tea or coffee in these circumstances will be exempt. Application of new rules to past periods As noted earlier, employers can apply the new accommodation and meal rules to periods before 1 April 2015 in certain circumstances. In the case of accommodation, the rules can be backdated for accommodation provided or expenditure incurred from 1 January 2011 provided the employer has not taken a tax position before 6 December 2012 that the accommodation or accommodation payment is taxable. Similarly, employers have the option to apply the work-related meal rules from 1 April 2011, provided they have not already taken a tax position that the expenditure is taxable. This means in some situations amounts that were treated as taxable income will become exempt income, resulting in a refund to the employee. 2 2 If the employee owes tax, the amount that would be refunded will first be used to offset the tax owing. Page 19 Example 17 Anna lives and works in Hamilton. In January 2013 she was sent on a 15-month secondment to Blenheim. The secondment was expected to last 15 months, and did, in fact, last 15 months. Her employer paid for her accommodation in Blenheim and treated these payments as taxable. Under the new rules the accommodation would be exempt from tax. Anna’s employer may now elect to backdate the application of the new rules to exempt the payments, meaning a refund of the tax paid on the accommodation can be claimed. Example 18 Grace lives and works in Invercargill. In February 2011 her employer sent her on secondment to New Plymouth to assist with setting up a new site. The secondment was expected to last 18 months, but in fact lasted 20 months as the new site progressed slightly behind schedule. Grace’s employer provided her with an accommodation allowance which was treated as taxable, with PAYE deducted. Grace’s employer is unable to backdate the new provisions because although the accommodation allowance would be exempt under the new rules and was provided after 1 January 2011, it was treated as taxable before 6 December 2012. Backdating can be applied on an employee-by-employee basis. Accordingly, when the employer agrees to backdate the new rules, the employer should indicate to Inland Revenue which employees and which tax years they have chosen to apply this option to, and the employees’ new gross earnings and the tax-exempt amounts. They should also provide each employee with a letter confirming they have chosen this treatment, setting out the new gross earnings details and the amount that is now tax-exempt for each tax year. The employee will then need to make a request to Inland Revenue to amend their IR3 return or personal tax summary assessment or, if necessary, request a personal tax summary. Employees should note that the income adjustments described above will affect their social assistance entitlements and obligations (such as Working for Families, child support and student loan repayments). For example, if as a result of the adjustment it is found that the employee’s student loan repayments have been too high, the employee should indicate whether they want the repayments refunded to them or treated as voluntary repayments. Example 19 Jon was on an out-of-town secondment for two years with accommodation provided Monday to Friday at a cost of $300 per week. Jon’s employer had originally treated the accommodation as tax exempt as Jon returned home every weekend to his family. Jon’s employer provided a voluntary disclosure and treated the accommodation for the last 12 months as taxable income. Jon’s salary was $75,000 on top of which his employer paid the additional PAYE of $150 per week, being the grossed up amount of the accommodation, increasing his earnings by a total of $450 per week. Jon’s employer agrees to apply the new rules to his accommodation making the cost of the accommodation – $300 per week – tax exempt. Jon’s employer provides him with a letter confirming the details to amend his return. Jon sends a copy of the letter and requests that the Commissioner amends his return to reduce his taxable income and issue a refund of the overpaid tax. Page 20 Any requests for amendments, voluntary disclosures or case-specific queries can be sent to: accommodation@ird.govt.nz Payments to cover “distinctive clothing” Under the previous general rules used to determine whether a payment or allowance is taxable, expenditure incurred on the purchase and maintenance of clothing is normally a private expense. Case law has confirmed that there is an exception to this general approach when the particular clothing is “necessary and peculiar” to the employee’s occupation. This has been taken to include a uniform, or specialist clothing that is not reasonably suitable for private use. Examples include uniforms worn by nursing staff, members of the armed forces and police officers. However, ordinary clothing of a particular style or colour which could reasonably be worn outside the job would not be treated as a uniform. Specialist clothing might include overalls and protective clothing worn for health and safety reasons. When an employer directly provides and/or maintains work-related clothing instead of paying an allowance, rather than relying on case law, the fringe benefit tax rules specifically include a distinctive work clothing exemption (see section CX 30). Applying this same approach to clothing allowances will provide consistency in this area. New section CW 17CC makes it clear that an allowance to cover the cost of buying and maintaining distinctive work clothing is not taxable income. “Distinctive work clothing” is defined drawing on the fringe benefit tax definit io n in section CX 30(2) to mean a single item of clothing, that: • is worn by an employee as, or as part of, a uniform that can be identified with the employer: – through the permanent and prominent display of a name, logo, or other identification that the employer regularly uses in carrying on their activit y or undertaking; or – because of the colour scheme, pattern, or style is readily associated with the emplo yer; and • is worn in the course of, or as an incident, of employment; and • is not clothing that employees would normally wear for private purposes. The distinctive clothing exemption also covers plain clothes allowances that were in place on 1 July 2013 and paid to uniformed personnel who are required to wear plain clothes in order to carry out their duties. This is in line with a longstanding expectation that a portion of the plain clothes allowance paid to police officers is non- taxable, based on the specific circumstances involved. This exempt ion applies only when: • the emplo yer provides a uniform to its emplo yees to wear when performing the duties o f their emplo yment; Page 21 • despite the fact that the employee has been provided with a uniform, it is a requirement of their current job with the same employer that they do not wear that uniform but instead need to wear plain clothes; • the plain clothes allowance was in place at 1 July 2013; • historically, the plain clothes allowance was part of a larger plain clothes amount the employer paid to employees, the balance being a taxable amount that was subsequently included in the taxable salary of employees receiving the plain clothes amount, under the employer’s general terms and condit ions; and • the employer’s general terms and conditions of employment continue to provide for the payment of a plain clothes allowance. Payments in relation to the purchase and maintenance of other clothing continue to be subject to the general rules for determining when a payment that does not have its own exemption rules is tax-exempt. General rule for determining taxable portion of other expenditure payments For the most part, beyond the specific payments discussed earlier in relat ion to accommodation and meals and distinctive clothing where the need for particular rules have been identified, the previous general rule for establishing the taxable part of an employee expenditure payment has worked satisfactorily. However, some further clarit y around what the rule involves was merited. Furthermore, there is still a possibility that at some time in the future the general rule may not be able to provide an appropriate outcome for another particular type of payment. There are advantages in having a mechanism to handle this other than through specific legislative amendment. Nexus test – clarification of the approach Under the general approach set out in section CW 17, the expenditure being paid to or on behalf of the employee is exempt income o f the emplo yee provided it is incurred in connection with the employee’s employment or service and the employee would be allowed a deduction in respect of that amount if the limitation on employees claiming deductions (the employment limitation) did not exist. This is often referred to as the “nexus test”. It effectively means that a payment is exempt provided it is not of a private, domestic or capital nature. This is not confined to actual expenditure. Section CW 17 allows an emplo yer to make a reasonable estimate of the expenditure likely to be incurred. These rules generally satisfactorily deal with the vast majority of expenses that do not have their own rule. The changes are simply aimed at providing greater clarity about what the nexus test involves by providing further detail of what is considered expenditure incurred, or an amount paid, in connection with an employee’s emplo yment or service. Page 22 New section CW 17(2B) provides that to qualify as expenditure that is incurred in connection with an employee’s employment or service, it has to be incurred because the employee is performing an obligation required by their employment or service, and the employee earns income through the performance of the obligation, and the expenditure is necessary in the performance of the obligation. This does not remove the requirement to consider whether the employee would have received a deduction for the amount but for the employment limitation, which necessarily incorporates consideration of whether the capital or private limitations apply. Commissioner determination power A new power enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to issue a determination (under section 91AAT of the Tax Administration Act 1994) in respect of a payment made to a wide group or class of employees. This does not dispense with the general requirements of section CW 17 but rather, in situations where it is hard to measure the precise private or capital portion of the expense, the Commissioner may determine the extent to which on average the amount is exempt income by setting a percentage that represents the extent to which the payment for the particular type of expense, based on a reasonable estimate, is taxable. This determination-making power is discretionary. Before deciding to issue a determination, the Commissioner needs to be satisfied that the payment not only affects a large group or class of employees but also that the average private or capital benefit likely to be received is hard to measure, and that the payment is not paid as a substitute for salary or wages (see section CW 17(2C)). The power is only available in respect of payments made to a wide group of employees to ensure that the cases in which the Commissioner issues a determination are of sufficient importance to the wider business co mmunit y. This is likely to mean an employee expenditure payment that is commonly provided across a wide spectrum of businesses. It may include an employee expenditure payment provided in a specific industry if it covers many emplo yees. Any determination issued will be binding on the Commissioner but not the taxpayer, which means that it will act as a safe harbour. If the employer or employee has evidence to demonstrate that in their particular circumstance some other apportionment is appropriate under the section CW 17 general rule, the taxpayer will still be able to apply that apportionment. Expenditure on account of an employee When an employer reimburses or otherwise meets a specific employee expense, this is an emplo yee expenditure payment known as “expenditure on account of an emplo yee”. The statutory definition is very widely drawn, so there is a comprehensive list of exclusions from the definition. These include two general exclusions that covered employee expenditure payments in general. Page 23 The first general exclusion (section CE 5(3)(a) – which remains unchanged) excludes payments to third parties or to employees for expenditure incurred by those emplo yees in deriving their employment income. The second general exclusion (section CE 5(3)(c)) excluded payments made by employers to employees for expenses that an employee had incurred and paid for on their employer’s behalf, when the expenses were the employer’s liability. An example would be when the employee buys a box of photocopying paper on the employer’s behalf on the basis that the employer will reimburse them. There have been a number of significant changes to the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” since it was first introduced in 1985. As a result, the general exclusions have been amended and expanded and it was no longer clear how the two exclusions should apply in relation to each other. Arguably, there was some overlap, which the amended provisio n is designed to remove. The general exclusion in section CE 5(3)(c) has been amended so that it excludes expenditure from being “expenditure on account of an employee” when: • the particular payment does not already fall wit hin the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion (this ensures the section CE 5(3)(a) exclusion takes priority); • the expense covered by the payment is incurred by or on behalf of the emplo yee’s employer; and • the expense has been paid for by the employee on their employer’s behalf. Other matters A number of minor technical amendments have been made to support the wider changes to the rules governing the tax treatment of employer-provided accommodation, accommodation payments, and other allowances and payments by emplo yers to cover emplo yee expenditure. The amendments cover changes to definitions, headings and cross-references to ensure compatibility with other taxing rules. Page 24
