Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This ruling has been applied for by Tortis-International Fund. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CD 14, CD 18(1) and 18(2). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and continued operation of a unit trust known as Tortis-International Fund (“Tortis-INTL” or the “Fund” or the “Trust”) pursuant to a Deed of Trust dated 16 December 1996 and amended on 18 February 1997, 31 July 2000, 16 August 2001 and 12 July 2002 (the “Trust Deed”), and the Prospectus for the Fund dated 11 September 2006 (the “Prospectus”). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1 The Fund invests in the securities of those companies that make up the TOWER Global Index (the “Global Index” or the “Index”). The Global Index is a customised version of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index (the “MSCI World Index”). The Fund has been designed to provide investors with comprehensive coverage of global equities. 2 Tortis-INTL is a unit trust in terms of the Unit Trusts Act 1960 and meets the definition of a “unit trust” contained in section OB 1. 3 Tortis-INTL is a New Zealand tax resident. The trustee of Tortis-INTL is the Public Trustee (the “Trustee”). The manager of Tortis-INTL is TOWER Managed Funds Investments Limited (previously known under the name “TOWER Trust Services Limited”) (the “Manager”). The investment manager of the Fund is State Street Global Advisors, Australia, Limited (the “Investment Manager” or “State Street”). 4 The investment policy of the Fund is set out in clause 82.1 of the Trust Deed. It states: Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 2 of 19 82. The investment policy of the Trust shall be: 82.1 to only invest the Fund (other than the Cash Pool and Unmarketable Accumulations) in Index Shares in a manner that replicates the Adjusted MSCI and to only enter into transactions that are necessary to give effect to that policy; 82.2 to invest the Cash Pool in deposits with banks registered under the Reserve Bank Act 1989 or other debt obligations or in the TOWER FirstRate Account upon terms that will allow the Manager to pay the anticipated Liabilities of the Fund and to manage the redemption of Units and the liquidity of the Trust; 82.3 to invest Unmarketable Accumulations in Derivatives until the total value of investment in Derivatives reaches a Marketable Amount whereupon the Derivatives will be realised and the proceeds invested in accordance with clause 82.1 or 82.2; and 82.4 to not take any action to hedge or manage foreign exchange risks or exposures that arise from the Investments being held in non New Zealand currencies. 5 The investment objectives of the Fund are as follows: • To track the adjusted MSCI Index, called the TOWER Global Index, to provide broad international coverage of approximately 1,000 companies; • The Global Index includes only “grey listed” countries to New Zealand, so that double taxation issues do not occur. These include companies resident in the United Sates, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, Japan, and Australia. These companies provide coverage of 80% of all international companies contained within the total MSCI Index; • The Investment Manager cannot diversify investments of the Fund, or take prudent steps in respect of the mix of the Fund’s investments. 6 The Trust Deed states that: It is not the Fund or the Trustee’s intention to profit from holding, acquiring or selling constituent company securities. 7 Tortis-INTL is an open fund and new investors are able to subscribe for units from time to time. The beneficial interest in Tortis-INTL is divided into units. Each unit confers an equal interest in Tortis-INTL (other than a fractional unit which will confer a proportionate interest) but does not confer any interest in any particular part of the fund or any particular investment of the fund. 8 Tortis-INTL has confirmed that all aspects of the previous rulings (BR Prv 96/135, BR Prv 96/136, BR Prv 01/15 and BR Prv 04/22), relating to the Fund, have been complied with. There has been no change to the Trust Deed of the Fund (except for the changes noted above), nor any change to the management or operation of the Fund since its establishment. The MSCI World Index 9 The TOWER Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index.

The document MSCI Global Investable Market Indices Methodology: Index Construction Objectives, Guiding Principles and Methodology for the MSCI Global Investable Market Indices and Plan for the Transition of the Current MSCI Standard and Small Cap Indices dated and effective from 28 March 2007 (“the Methodology Book”) states the objective of MSCI, with respect to its Equity Index Series, as being the construction of global benchmark indices which serve as a gauge for measuring performance of a market and investment strategy, effective research tools for purposes such as strategic asset allocation, and as the basis for investment vehicles designed to replicate the performance of a market or to implement and manage an investment policy. MSCI consistently applies its equity index construction and maintenance methodology across regions and developed and emerging markets, making it possible to aggregate individual country and industry indices to create meaningful regional and composite benchmark indices. 12. The MSCI Standard Index Series adjusts the market capitalisation of index constituents for free float and targets for index inclusion 85% of free float- adjusted market capitalisation in each industry group, in each country. Currently, MSCI calculates the Standard Index Series for 48 countries globally in the developed and the emerging markets. 13. As of December 2003, the MSCI World Index comprises the 23 developed market country indices. 14. The Methodology Book describes MSCI’s index construction objective (see paragraph 11 above), guiding principles, and the methodology for the Standard Index Series. Guiding principles 15. MSCI adheres to the following principles in the design and implementation of its index construction and maintenance methodology: • Broad and fair representation of the total underlying market; • Investability and replicability; • Consistent application of the methodology across all markets; • Continuity and relatively low turnover while reflecting the evolution of the markets in a timely fashion; Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 4 of 19 • Disciplined approach: principles, rules and guidelines to ensure all decisions MSCI makes are consistent with a benchmark index; • Transparency; • Independence and objectivity. Index construction process 16. The index construction process involves: • Defining the equity universe – about 99% of the world’s total equity market capitalisation is included; • Adjusting the total market capitalisation of securities in the universe for free float available to foreign investors; • Classifying the universe of securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard; • Selecting securities for inclusion according to MSCI’s index construction rules and guidelines. Index constituent eligibility rules and guidelines 17. MSCI targets an 85% free float-adjusted market representation level within each industry group, within each country. The security selection process within each industry group is based on the careful analysis of: • Each company's business activities and the diversification that its securities would bring to the index. • The size (based on free float-adjusted market capitalisation) and liquidity of securities. All other things being equal, MSCI targets for inclusion the most sizeable and liquid securities in an industry group. In addition, securities that do not meet the minimum size guidelines and/or securities with inadequate liquidity are not considered for inclusion. • The estimated free float for the company and its individual share classes. Only securities of companies with an estimated overall and/or security free float greater than 15% are, in general, considered for inclusion. The only exception is where not including a security of a large company would compromise the index’s ability to fully and fairly represent the characteristics of the underlying market. 18. Differences in the structure of industries, and other considerations, may lead to over- or under-representation in certain industries. In these cases, the indices Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 5 of 19 are constructed with a view to minimising the divergence between the industry group representation achieved in the index and the 85% representation guideline. Maintaining the MSCI Standard Index Series 19. The MSCI Standard Index Series is maintained with the objective of reflecting, on a timely basis, the evolution of the underlying equity markets. Emphasis is also placed on continuity, replicability and on minimising turnover in the indices. Overall, index maintenance can be described by three broad categories of implementation of changes: • Annual full country index reviews that systematically reassess the various dimensions of the equity universe for all countries and are conducted on a fixed annual timetable. • Quarterly index reviews, aimed at promptly reflecting other significant market events. • Ongoing event-related changes, such as mergers and . acquisitions, which are generally implemented in the indices rapidly as they occur. Potential changes in the status of countries (standalone, emerging, developed) follow their own separate timetables. These changes are normally implemented in one or more phases at the regular annual full country index review and quarterly index review dates. In this Ruling, index maintenance is referred to as Structural Change (quarterly and annual review changes) and Market Driven Change (ongoing event-related changes). The Adjusted MSCI World Index: the TOWER Global Index 20. The Global Index is a customised version of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index replicates the MSCI World Index, with one qualification: it only contains grey list countries, which comprise at least 2% of the MSCI World Index. The Global Index does not alter the MSCI World Index in any other way. 21. If any of the countries included in the Global Index leave the grey list then securities held in companies resident in that country will be immediately divested. If any company in which Tortis-INTL holds securities ceases to be resident in a grey list country, then securities held in that company will be immediately divested.

The Fund offers two classes of units: Class A and Class B. Class A units are standard retail units. Class B units are issued on exactly the same terms as Class A units, however holders of Class B units, due to the size of their investment, are able to negotiate reduced management and trustee fees. Date of Adjustments 23. The Fund is rebalanced in the following circumstances: • If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and • Due to the Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and • If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. 24. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. Rights Issues 25. The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of rights issues. 26. In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. Mergers, Takeovers and Share Buy-backs 27. The Global Index may be adjusted from time to time because of mergers, takeovers or share buy-backs. 28. With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 7 of 19 practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted. The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. 29. The Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of a Index Company. Cash investments held by the Fund 30. Although it is not an objective of the Fund to hold cash, the Manager and the Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) may hold cash to facilitate the easier administration of the Fund. The cash held by the Manager and the Investment Manager is on “call”. Wherever possible, the Manager will enter into futures contracts to cover the cash held by the Fund. This is known as “equitised cash”. 31. The Investment Manager (on behalf of the Fund) will hold cash in the following circumstances: • Following the sale of securities in the course of tracking the Index, pending the reinvestment of that cash; • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request for withdrawal by a Manager on behalf of a unit holder; • To accumulate the minimum amount of cash required to allow for minimum trade sizes and to obtain a reasonable representation of the number of securities on the Index, which is presently $US3 million (“the minimum investment level”). 32. The Investment Manager may hold up to an amount equivalent to the minimum investment level in cash (including both free and equitised cash). This threshold may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • for up to 10 working days preceding a MSCI structural change; • for up to 3 working days after a MSCI structural change; or • for up to 10 working days prior to a pending withdrawal in respect of which it has received a withdrawal request. 33. In addition to any funds held by the Investment Manager, the Manager may hold cash. The amount of cash held by the Manager will not be greater than Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 8 of 19 what strictly arises out of the circumstances described below, and in any event will not exceed 2% of the total assets of the Fund. Those circumstances are: • Following a contribution to the Fund, pending the investment of that contribution; • Following the sale of securities to meet a request to redeem units in cash; and • To fund the expenses, fees and taxation for the Fund; 34. The 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager may be exceeded in the following circumstances: • For up to one business day if there is rapid inflow to the Fund, or the Fund has notice of a substantial pending withdrawal ; • For up to one calendar month if the Manager receives a formal notice of a forthcoming obligation of subsequent performance (ie, payment due on partly paid shares) affecting the constituent securities in the Index; or • For up to one calendar month if the Manager is aware of a forthcoming distribution to unit holders at the scheduled date of distribution. 35. However, in any event, if the 2% threshold of cash held by the Manager is exceeded, the Fund will take immediate action to remedy the situation within the shortest practicable time. 36. At all times, there is a limit on the total cash (including cash held by the Manager and free and equitised cash held by the Investment Manager) which is the greater of 5% of the total value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the total value of the Fund and the minimum investment level (except if there is a significant withdrawal or investment). 37. The Investment Manager will use best endeavours to equitise all cash, subject to futures contract size constraints. 38. The following futures contracts are currently used: Country Contract Australia SPI200 Canada S&P/TSE60 Japan Nikkei 225, TOPIX Germany DAX United Kingdom FTSE100 United States S&P500 Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 9 of 19 39. In the event that alternative futures contracts in one or more markets enable improved tracking of the Global Index, or that one or more of the above contracts ceases to exist, the Investment Manager will use such alternative contract or contracts. Hedging 40. The Fund does not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non-New Zealand currencies. Foreign Currencies 41. The Investment Manager may enter into spot foreign exchange contracts where these are necessary in order to purchase or divest the foreign currencies necessary to purchase or dispose of Index securities. These contracts are not speculative and are settled within 2 business days. Borrowing 42. The Fund may only borrow in the following circumstances: • To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; • Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; • To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or • For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. Events that trigger acquisitions or realisations 43. The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 10 of 19 • If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; • If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; • Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; • Transferring securities to a unit holder if the unit holder redeems units for securities; • If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. Issue and redemption of Units 44. Investors wishing to subscribe for units may do so for cash or, alternatively, above a certain prescribed level, investors may subscribe for units by transferring to Tortis-INTL an appropriately weighted basket of securities, and will receive units in Tortis-INTL in exchange. 45. When a unit holder wishes to dispose of an investment in the Fund, the unit holder is able to elect that the units be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager. Notwithstanding any provision in the Prospectus or the Deed of Trust, it is the invariable practice of the Fund that where such an election is made by the unit holder, the units will be either redeemed by the Trustee, or repurchased by the Manager, in strict accordance with that election. In the absence of an election by the unit holder, the units will in all instances be repurchased by the Manager. Where units are repurchased by the Manager, the price paid to the unit holder by the Manager will be the same amount as would be received by the unit holder if the unit holder had elected the direct redemption method. In all instances where units are repurchased by the Manager, whether pursuant to an election by a unit holder or not, the Manager will redeem those units with the Trustee for the same price as paid to the unit holder. 46. A unit holder may redeem units subject to the conditions in Article C of the Trust Deed. Article C gives the Manager a discretion to refuse to redeem units where the amount to be redeemed is less than the minimum number acceptable by the Manager at that time. Currently the Manager has set a minimum withdrawal at $500. Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 11 of 19 47. Unit prices may be published in newspapers. Tortis-INTL has an Internet site which will be used principally to publish prices at which the Manager will repurchase or redeem units, and as a means for transferring units only by purchase from the Manager, and redemption or repurchase by the Manager. Same day unit redemption policy 48. When units are repurchased, the Manager is required to pay the aggregate value of the units to the investor within 21 business days of the relevant time (as described in the Trust Deed). However when possible the Fund operates a same day unit redemption policy. The Fund will endeavour to redeem the units requested by any unit holder and redeem and pay for those units on the same day as the unit holder's request is made. 49. If the Fund has insufficient cash in the cash pool, the Fund will always in the first instance attempt to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds in order to meet the redemption request. In situations where the Fund is not able to borrow such sufficient funds, the Fund may suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund. The only exception to the Fund always attempting to borrow in the first instance where a redemption request is made and there is insufficient cash in the cash pool, is where a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unit holders. In such a case the Fund will always suspend the withdrawal of units. Suspension of issuing and redeeming units 50. A suspension from issuing or redeeming units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) may be necessary in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: (1) if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; (2) if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; (3) where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; or (4) where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 12 of 19 and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unit holders; or (5) in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. Where suspension occurs because of termination of the Fund, the suspension will be for a maximum of 3 months from the giving of the notice to terminate by the Manager. In other circumstances, if a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. The Fund has suspended the issuing and redeeming of units only once, for 3 days after the World Trade Center was destroyed, as the US market was closed and so valuations were not available. Assumption made by the Commissioner This ruling is subject to the following assumption: (a) That the re-issued Prospectus dated 11 September 2006 is the same in all material respects as the Prospectus dated 11 September 2003. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is subject to the following conditions: (a) The predetermined rules used by the Investment Manager to ascertain the Global Index constituents, and the predetermined rules used by MSCI to calculate the MSCI World Index, will not be made with or influenced by any intention of seeking higher rates of return or capital growth. (b) No material changes will be made to the way in which the Global Index tracks the MSCI World Index. Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 13 of 19 (c) No material changes will be made to the way in which MSCI constructs and maintains the MSCI World Index. (d) The proportion of Tortis-INTL’s assets to be held as cash (including all “free” cash and “equitised” cash) will not exceed what is strictly necessary in order to fulfil the purposes stated in paragraph 30 of this ruling, and will not in any event exceed the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. This condition will not be regarded as being breached if, pending investment of contributions or disbursement of withdrawal proceeds, the Fund is forced to hold cash in excess of the greater of 5% of the value of the Fund and the sum of 2% of the value of the Fund and the minimum investment level. The Fund will immediately invest or disburse such cash, except where immediate investment to track the Index is not possible due to the unavailability of appropriate equities, in which case the excess cash may be held for only so long as is strictly necessary and in any event no longer than two business days. (e) When the cash held by the Investment Manager reaches the minimum investment level (presently $US 3 million), it will be immediately applied to track the Index. (f) The Investment Manager will rebalance the Fund in the following circumstances: i. If any security, any country index, or the entire Index has a deviation of greater than +/- 0.5% of the total Fund; and ii. Due to Structural Changes in the MSCI, currently quarterly; and iii. If there is a Market Driven Change such as a merger, takeover, new listing or reduction or increase in capital affecting any Index company on the Global Index. Such rebalancing will occur as soon as possible after the above events have occurred and in any event within 2 business days. (g) When rebalancing the Fund the Investment Manager will use its best endeavours to track the Index as exactly as possible. Any rebalancing of the Fund that does not achieve an exact match of the Index will only occur where it is not possible to obtain or sell the securities necessary to exactly replicate the Index. In any case the tracking deviation will not exceed 1% of the value of the Fund. (h) In the event of any rights issue by an Index Company, the Manager will hold the entitlement if the entitlement is included in the Index. If the entitlement is not included in the Index, but the securities the subject of the entitlement will be immediately included in the Index, the Manager will retain the entitlement and take up the securities. If the Manager does not know whether the securities the subject of the entitlement will be included in the Index the Manager will sell the Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 14 of 19 entitlement at the earliest possible time and reinvest the proceeds in the Index Companies to track the Index. (i) With the exception of any situation where shares in an Index company are compulsorily acquired pursuant to any companies legislation, listing rules or takeover code requirements, in the event of a merger or takeover of an Index Company, the Manager will adjust the Fund portfolio at a time as close as practicably possible to the time the Index is adjusted (but in any event within 2 business days). The Fund will not accept an offer unless as a consequence of not accepting the offer the Fund would track the Index less accurately than if it had accepted the offer. (j) The Fund Manager will not elect to participate in a share buy-back scheme of any Index Company. (k) When the Fund is given the option of re-investing its dividends into any Index Company, the Fund invariably accepts the cash dividend. (l) The Fund can only borrow in the following circumstances: i. To temporarily fund the redemption of units when the cash pool has insufficient funds; this borrowing must be repaid as soon as possible, and in any event any such borrowing will be repaid within three business days; ii. Where a security is sold and another purchased and a settlement mismatch occurs resulting in the Fund becoming inadvertently overdrawn, and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; iii. To temporarily fund the purchase of securities in order to rebalance following a merger, where pursuant to the merger payment due to the Fund for securities that have been disposed of has been delayed (such delay being beyond the control of the Fund), and in this event for no longer than strictly necessary; or iv. For advances (not to exceed total borrowings of $5,000) by the Manager to the Fund to meet expenses of the Fund, where the Manager’s expense account is insufficient to enable the Manager to meet such expenses. (m) The Fund will not take any action to hedge or remove foreign currency risks or exposures that arise from the investments of the Fund in non-New Zealand currencies. (n) The Fund will only sell or otherwise dispose of securities in the following circumstances: Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 15 of 19 i. If the Fund is voluntarily or involuntarily wound up; ii. If there is a change in the Index composition due to either Structural Changes or Market Driven Changes so that the composition of the Fund no longer tracks the Index, or when the Fund is otherwise required to buy and sell securities to rebalance the Fund in order to maintain tracking; iii. Funding redemptions to the extent that these cannot be met out of cash held by the Fund; iv. Transferring securities to a unit holder if the unit holder redeems units for securities; v. If there is a claim on the Trustee in respect of the Fund that cannot be met by the cash held by the Fund or cash held in the Manager’s expense account. (o) The Fund will not be wound up with a view to enhancing the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. This condition will not be breached if: i the Manager decides to wind up the Fund for reasons unrelated to the performance of the investments of the Fund; or ii if the unit holders independently resolve to wind up the Fund. (p) This Ruling shall cease to apply if at any time: i. there is a unit holder, or two or more unit holders that are associated with each other, or are acting in concert in relation to their investments in the Fund, who hold/s more than 75% of the issued units of the Fund; and ii. if that unit holder, or one or more of such unit holders, ordinarily hold securities on revenue account or the disposal of securities by that unit holder, or one or more of such unit holders, would ordinarily give rise to gross income for income tax purposes. For the purposes of this condition unit holders are associated with each other if they are “associated persons” within the meaning of section OD 7 or OD 8(3). (q) This Ruling only applies while this Fund remains a widely-held trust (as that term is defined in section OB 1), and the Fund units are offered to the public. (r) Apart from the Trust Deed and the Prospectus of the Fund that were supplied to Inland Revenue as part of the application for Ruling BR Prd 04/07, there is no agreement, arrangement or understanding between the Fund or the Trustee or the Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 16 of 19 Manager (or any party acting on behalf of the Fund) and any unit holder (or any person associated with or acting on behalf of any unit holder) regarding the control of the Fund, the nature and timing of its investments, or the timing of the investing or withdrawal of funds. This condition shall not be regarded as breached by virtue only of: i. the fact that a unit holder has the ability to invest, or withdraw at any time; and/or ii. the entry into of any agreement, arrangement or understanding contemplated by the Trust Deed for the purpose of enabling investment or withdrawal; and/or iii. the appointment by the Trustee of the Manager; and/or iv. any agreement, arrangement or understanding entered into by the Trustee in a capacity other than as trustee of the Fund, or the Manager in a capacity other than as manager of the Fund, in the ordinary course of the Trustee or the Manager conducting an independent investment advisory or investment portfolio management business. (s) The Fund will not exercise any voting rights associated with the holding of Index Company securities. (t) If the Fund is resettled this Ruling shall not apply from the date of resettlement. The Fund will not be resettled in order to enhance the performance of the Fund or to minimise losses of the Fund in any way. (u) The Fund will not be involved in any securities lending. (v) The Fund will not utilise the power to suspend the issuing or redeeming of units (including any deferral notice with regard to Class B units) except in exceptional circumstances, being the following situations: i. if the Fund is to be terminated and notice has been given to the Trustee pursuant to clause 198 of the Trust Deed; ii. if extreme financial, political, or economic conditions occur and prevent the acquisition or redemption of Index Shares from the Stock Exchanges on which those Index Shares are listed; iii. where the Fund has received redemption requests that exceed the available cash pool and the Fund is unable to borrow (on suitable commercial terms) sufficient funds to meet such redemption requests; Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 17 of 19 iv. where there is insufficient cash in the cash pool and a redemption request is made by a unit holder who holds 5% or more of the value of the Fund and to borrow rather than suspend the withdrawal of units in the Fund would prejudice other unit holders; or v. in the case of any deferral notice in respect of class B units, the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions may prejudice the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. Where suspension occurs because of termination of the Fund, the suspension will be for a maximum of 3 months from the giving of the notice to terminate by the Manager. In other circumstances, if a suspension from issuing or redeeming units occurs, the period of suspension will not exceed 3 business days, except if the situation is beyond the control of the Manager of the Fund, in which case the suspension shall be only for such period as is strictly necessary for the Fund or the Manager to recover from that event. However in the case of a deferral notice, with regard to Class B units, the period of the deferral notice may be extended until the Trustee reasonably forms the opinion that to fund redemptions is no longer prejudicial to the Fund’s obligations to Class A unit holders. (w) The Manager will not redeem units as a means of correcting tracking errors. (x) The Trustee will not exercise its power under clause 87.7 of the Trust Deed to promote or carry on any scheme or undertaking in any country upon such terms and conditions as the Trustee deems fit. (y) The Fund will not invest in derivatives, with the exception of futures contracts entered into for the purposes of tracking the Index and spot foreign exchange contracts (which have a settlement period of no longer than two business days) to acquire or dispose of the necessary foreign currency so as to purchase or dispose of Index securities. (z) The Manager has the power to purchase units from unit holders when unit holders wish to redeem their units. The Manager will always use this power when the unit holder specifically requests that the Manager purchase the units and in any instance where the unit holder does not specifically request that the Trustee redeem the units. The Manager will not purchase units from any unit holder, where to do so would be inconsistent with the unit holder’s election to redeem their units with the Trustee. The Manager will not use this power to enhance the profit of the Fund. (aa) The Global Index will only include countries that are listed in Schedule 3, Part A.

(mm) The Fund will continue to track the MSCI World Index as in their previous rulings until at least 30 September 2007. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumption and any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Large Enterprises - Binding Rulings \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 14/01/2008 19 of 19 • Income distributed by the Trustee will be treated as a dividend pursuant to section CD 3(1). • Any amount received by unit holders on redemption of units in the Fund will be excluded from the definition of dividend in sections CD 2 to CD 13, by section CD 14, to the extent that that amount does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share cancelled. The Commissioner is satisfied that, in terms of section CD 14(2), the distribution is not in lieu of the payment of dividends. The procedure of publicising buy-back and redemption prices on the Internet does not constitute a “recognised exchange” in terms of the definition of that phrase in section OB 1. • If the Fund is liquidated, sections CD 18(1) and 18(2) will apply. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 1 July 2007 until 30 September 2007. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18 th day of October 2007.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 08/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Restaurant Brands Limited. Taxation Laws This Ruling applies in respect of: • Sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) and the definition of “income from employment” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 for periods up to and including 31 March 2008. • Sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) and the definition of “income from employment” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for the periods from 1 April 2008. • The definition of “taxable activity” in section 6, and the definition of “employment under any contract of service” in section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a recurring arrangement in terms of section 91E(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 involving the engagement of delivery drivers by Restaurant Brands Limited (“RBL”) pursuant to the Delivery Driver Contract (dated September 2006), and in accordance with information in the Delivery Driver Handbook (dated September 2006), and the standard practice information provided to Inland Revenue in the ruling application (dated 10 October 2007) (collectively referred to as “the relevant documents”), to deliver RBL products to RBL customers. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Relationship between RBL and its delivery drivers 1. RBL prepares and sells a range of “fast food” products via its Pizza Hut business. RBL sells its products through a chain of restaurants and provides a delivery service to its customers at some of these restaurants. RBL engages the services of delivery drivers to deliver its products to its customers from its Pizza Hut stores. 2. The relationship between the Delivery Drivers (owner drivers) and Pizza Hut are governed by the following documents: • The “Delivery Driver Contract” dated September 2006 which includes the following: • An outline of delivery driver payments (clause 7); • A form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (schedule B); and 2 • The driver uniform policy (schedule C); • The “Delivery Driver Handbook” dated September 2006 which incorporates the following: • The guideline on “Delivery Driver Payments”; • A form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (Schedule B); and • The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements”; • The guideline on “Making a Delivery”; • The “CHAMPS ” guidelines on dealing with a customer; and • The “Standard Practice Information” provided to Inland Revenue in the rulings application. 3. In some cases, in-store employees make home deliveries for Pizza Hut stores from time to time, while also carrying out employment duties in-store. These employees are contracted with RBL under employment contracts and are not remunerated separately for the delivery services performed. Terms of the Delivery Driver Contract 4. Under the terms of the Delivery Driver Contract the delivery driver agrees to: (a) use only the motor vehicles detailed in the Driver/Vehicle details as provided in Schedule B to the contract in the performance of the contract (clause 3.1(d)); (b) ensure the performance of the delivery services in a safe, proper and courteous manner in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Delivery Driver Handbook as varied from time to time (clause 3.1) (attention is drawn to any delivery driver guidelines issued by RBL from time to time); (c) be responsible for all costs and expenses of the driver’s business including the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining all delivery vehicles (clause 4.1(b)); (d) immediately refer any discrepancies on delivery with regards to collection of monies and delivery records to RBL (clause 5.1(a)); (e) at the end of each delivery period provide to RBL’s authorised representative: • a complete account and record in the format specified by RBL (clause 5.1(b)(i)); and • all monies collected by the delivery driver from customers of RBL during the course of that delivery period (clause 5.1(b)(ii)); (f) be responsible to account for any cheques, credit card slips or monies received on behalf of RBL as soon as possible and make good any shortfall (clause 5.1(c)); 3 (g) be liable for, and indemnify RBL against, any liability, loss, claim or proceedings arising out of or relating to the use of the Contractor’s vehicles in the provision of delivery services (clause 8.1); (h) maintain throughout the continuance of the agreement, at their own expense: • ACC contributions, where the delivery drivers engage employees to perform services under the contract, make the appropriate ACC employer contribution as required on behalf of those employees (if any) (clause 8.1(a)); (i) a minimum of Third Party Property Damage Liability Insurance in respect of the vehicle (clause 8.1(b)); (j) wear any uniforms provided by RBL and ensure their proper care and maintenance. A $30 deposit is retained out of the first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on return of the uniform in good conditions (fair wear and tear excepted) (clause 9.1); (k) provide and wear any additional uniform items as may be requested by RBL (e.g. black trousers) (clause 9.1); (l) provide a float of $20 for the purpose of making change during each delivery period (clause 9.2); (m) return upon request, clean and in good condition uniforms and delivery pouches. Failure to do so will entitle RBL to deduct the replacement cost from any monies owing to the delivery driver (clause 9.3); and (n) produce to RBL’s authorised representative documents that are necessary in the opinion of RBL to establish that the delivery driver has complied and continues to comply with their obligations under the contract (clause 10). 5. The delivery driver is not liable to take out any insurance or be responsible for loss or damage to the products delivered (as long as the loss or damage does not result from the delivery driver’s wilful default, negligence or breach of the Contract) (clause 8.3). 6. The delivery driver may not assign their rights under the contract without the prior written consent of RBL (clause 1.3). 7. In terms of RBL’s obligations under the Delivery Driver Contract: (a) The engagement of the delivery driver does not commit RBL to a guarantee of any minimum remuneration (clause 1.2); (b) RBL also reserves the right to engage the services of other contractors (clause 1.4); (c) RBL agrees to pay the delivery driver: 4 • for services on a per delivery basis (from 30 September 2006 an all inclusive payment of $5 per delivery including GST if any) (clause 7); • within 14 days of submission of an invoice for services (clause 6.1); (d) RBL is not responsible for any vehicle damage sustained as a result of the delivery driver’s negligence or omission (clause 8); (e) Products carried by the delivery driver shall be at the risk of RBL (clause 8.3); (f) The uniforms and delivery pouches remain the property of RBL (clause 9.3). 8. Under clause 1.2 either party may terminate the Delivery Driver Contract upon notice to the other party at the conclusion of any delivery. 9. The legal relationship between the delivery driver and RBL is described as that of “principal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee” (clause 2.1). Delivery Driver Payments 10. Clause 7 of the guideline on “Delivery Driver Payments” states that the delivery drivers will be reimbursed at the current delivery payment rate per delivery, at a maximum of two deliveries per round trip. 11. In the case of a mistake and redelivery is required, the delivery driver will receive another delivery payment if the mistake was through no fault of their own. 12. The following are examples of delivery driver payments/reimbursements that are available. The delivery drivers receive payments/ reimbursements for: • redeliveries that have resulted through overdue order complaints, only if the initial order was logged out from the restaurant (i.e. order has left the restaurant) after 20 minute timeframe has lapsed; • redelivery due to wrongly supplied delivery details (e.g. wrong address/ phone number supplied by RBL to the delivery driver); • delivery of hoax orders or orders cancelled after the product has left the restaurant (the product must be returned to the restaurant); • redelivery due to miscellaneous circumstances outside the delivery driver’s control; • cost of phone calls made to customers or back to the restaurant from a payphone. 5 13. The delivery drivers do not receive payments/ reimbursements for: • three or more home deliveries per delivery round, RBL policy is a maximum of two, • complaints indicating driver’s mishandling of the order (e.g. pizza has been dropped by the delivery driver), • redelivery due to the delivery driver not finding the address where the original delivery details are correct (where possible delivery drivers are required to call from a pay phone to clarify the delivery details), • cost of cell phone calls to the customer or back to the restaurant, • redelivery due to missing items off the order (e.g. missing garlic bread). \[It is the delivery driver’s responsibility to check that they have the entire order before leaving the restaurant\], • transporting stock between stores, stock transfers are the shift manager’s responsibility, and not the delivery driver’s responsibility. 14. Delivery drivers are not guaranteed any minimum per hour delivery payment. Uniform Requirements 15. Schedule C to the Delivery Driver Contract sets out the uniform requirements for delivery drivers to adhere to health regulations and Pizza Huts professional standards. Key points of the requirements are listed below: • Pizza Hut hat – to be kept clean and worn with visor at front; • Pizza Hut Shirt – to be clean, free from wrinkles, tucked in and with a minimum of 1 button done up; • Name tag – to be visible to customers at all times; • Pizza Hut black trousers – to be clean and properly fitted; • A wedding band and a watch is the only allowable jewellery • A clean undershirt may be worn under the uniform. To be black or navy and contain no visible print. 16. Schedule C also states that drivers must practice good daily hygiene. 17. There is also a comment “REMEMBER TO DELIVERY CUSTOMERS YOU ARE PIZZA HUT!” Notice of Taxation Requirements 18. The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements” is a guide contained in the Delivery Driver Handbook which states that: • The delivery driver is not an employee of RBL; • The delivery driver should seek independent taxation advice to understand their rights and obligations; • PAYE will not be deducted from payments for deliveries; 6 • The gross values of all payments received by the delivery driver for deliveries must be included in the delivery driver’s annual income tax return; • The delivery driver must calculate and pay their earner premium at the end of the year when they file their tax return; • The delivery driver may be liable to pay provisional tax; and • The delivery driver must register for GST if the delivery driver has income of $40,000 or more. Making a delivery 19. The guidelines on “Making a Delivery” have suggestions for the manner in which deliveries are to be made, handling customer complaints, and what to do in the event of emergencies. CHAMPS – guidelines on dealing with a customer 20. The CHAMPS guidelines on dealing with a customer includes a problem solving method and actions to take when certain scenarios arise (e.g., if the order has missing items). Standard Practice Information 21. The delivery drivers are not: • entitled to overtime or sick pay; • required to belong to any union; • able to supervise employees of RBL; • able to access RBL’s administration or support services, however they do have access to staff toilets and product discounts; • advertising for work nor do they have their own client base, however there is no restriction for them doing this. 22. Also, the delivery drivers: • are able to decide the hours they work (provided work is expected to be available). It is standard practice that the delivery drivers make themselves available for rostered hours; • provide their own vehicles and associated equipment; • are free to work for another principal; • must hold an appropriate drivers’ license. 23. RBL trains the delivery drivers as to the manner in which deliveries are made. The delivery drivers are instructed as to what geographical area they will work in. 24. RBL employees take orders over the phone and decide the delivery sequence of the orders. A maximum of two orders can be delivered at any one time (to ensure quality control of the product). 7 25. From time to time RBL may pay at its discretion the delivery drivers a minimum of two deliveries per hour during certain hours, in order to ensure minimum coverage for RBL during quiet periods. 26. Although the delivery driver may find his or her own replacement driver, in practice this does not happen and generally another delivery driver is used by RBL. 27. RBL is currently reviewing the implementation of an incentive scheme, which will apply only to certain delivery drivers for maintaining delivery standards and will not be offered to in-store drivers or employees. The incentive payments are not contractually guaranteed and are not part of an ongoing arrangement. Relationship between RBL’s employees (employed under a different contract) and delivery drivers 28. In certain cases employees of RBL may, from time to time, be required to perform delivery services. Where this is the case, the employees also do other tasks (i.e. making the pizzas, cleaning etc). In contrast, delivery drivers are contracted purely to deliver pizzas and are not asked to perform other tasks. 29. No other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, have a bearing on the conclusions reached in this Ruling. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The terms of the relevant documents entered into by RBL and the delivery driver is exactly the same as those provided to the Inland Revenue in the Ruling application dated 10 October 2007, except in relation to the following clauses of the Delivery Driver Contract (dated September 2006) where the basic uniform and hygiene requirements, number of days or dollar amounts (as appropriate) may vary from time to time: • Clause 6, which states that RBL agrees to pay the delivery drivers within 14 days of submission of an invoice. • Clause 7, which states the rate per delivery as a gross amount of $5. • Clause 9.1, which states that a $30 deposit will be retained out of the delivery driver’s first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on the return of the uniform in good condition. • Clause 9.2, which provides that a float of $20 be carried by the delivery driver; • Schedule C, which specifies the current uniform and hygiene requirements. (b) RBL will provide the delivery drivers with the notice of taxation requirements at the commencement of the contract and advise the delivery drivers that as independent contractors they are required to comply with their own income tax, GST and ACC obligations. 8 (c) The actual relationship between RBL and the delivery driver is, and will continue to be during the period this Ruling applies, in accordance with the terms of the relevant documents in all material respects. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Income Tax Act 2007, payments made by RBL to the delivery driver are not “income from employment” as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so the driver is not prevented from claiming deductions under these sections by reason only that the driver earns “income from employment”; and • For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by the driver to RBL will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of the GST Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act as they are not made under “contracts of service”. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 26 October 2006 until 26 October 2009. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of April 2008. Paul Mason Investigations Manager, Assurance
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 08/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by StockCo Limited (“StockCo”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, DA 1(1), DA 2, EA 3, EC 6 to EC 27, EC 32 to EC 37, and EJ 10, subpart EW, and sections FA 6 to FA 11, FA 12, and GC 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of specified or high-priced livestock (“Stock”) on the terms provided in the Deed of Stock Lease (the “Lease”) entered into by StockCo, StockCo Holdings Limited (“StockCo Holdings”) and StockCo Residual Limited (“StockCo Residual”) (together the Group Companies”) and farmers and people entering the farming industry (together the “customers”) for these customers to use in a farming business. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1 This Arrangement involves sale and lease back transactions of Stock whereby StockCo purchases the Stock, usually dairy and beef cattle and sheep, from a farmer (or third party) and then leases that Stock back to the farmer. Once the Lease is executed, StockCo assigns the Lease income to StockCo Holdings , and sells the residual value of the Stock to StockCo Residual. At the end of the Lease (“the Lease Termination Date”), the farmer may ask to purchase the Stock for its residual value. StockCo Residual is under no obligation to accept that offer. 2 The Group Companies are in the business of Stock leasing and financing. 2 Summary 3 StockCo has identified a market for Stock leasing in the farming industry. As at 2 September 2008, StockCo has entered into more than 100 Stock leasing transactions with various farmers. It estimates that over the next 12 months it is likely to enter into at least another 100 transactions. 4 Leases result from either one or a combination of the following two transactions: • StockCo and the farmer enter into a sale and lease back transaction (for all or part of the farmer’s Stock), whereby StockCo buys Stock from the farmer and then leases it back to the farmer. • StockCo purchases Stock from a third party, at the farmer’s request, and then leases it to the farmer. 5 The purpose of the Arrangement is for the farmers to realise capital that was tied up in Stock, retire external debt, or fund the expansion of herds, land and/or the business as a result of proceeds from the sale of their Stock. This type of Arrangement can also assist new farmers in setting up a business, as capital set-up costs can be a barrier for new farmers wanting to enter the market. This type of Arrangement also gives farmers certainty of income and expenditure that is not guaranteed under the current Stock valuation methods. 6 Farmers are responsible for maintaining the Stock and in the event of any loss of Stock, must pay the remainder of the value of that animal in full to StockCo. Should farmers seek and gain permission to cull stock, they may do so throughout the life of the Lease. In doing so, the Lease requires that the farmers act as agents for StockCo and any proceeds from the cull are returned to StockCo. 7 After the termination of the Lease, farmers may offer to purchase the Stock. However, StockCo Residual is under no obligation to accept those offers (see clause 13 of the Lease reproduced in paragraph 19). If the farmers do not purchase the Stock after the Lease expires, StockCo Residual endeavours to sell the Stock for at least the residual value of the animal, within 30 days of the Lease expiry date. Any difference between the sale price and Residual Value is paid by StockCo Residual or the farmer so the net proceeds StockCo Residual receives are exactly the market value of the Stock at the Lease expiry date. 8 Clause 2 of the Lease sets out the purchase and ownership provisions in relation to the initial sale of the Stock to StockCo. 2. PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF THE STOCK. (a) We will purchase the relevant Stock for the Purchase Price on the Commencement Date. (b) We will EITHER: (i) Purchase the Stock from you for the Purchase Price and will create a buyer generated invoice and will pay the Purchase Price to you on the Commencement Date or on any other agreed settlement date; OR 3 (ii) Purchase the Stock from another person's and provide the same to you on the Commencement Date or any other agreed settlement date; OR (iii) Undertake a combination of purchase methods set out in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) and (ii) above. (c) You covenant that the Stock will upon acquisition pursuant to this Deed be our absolute property free from any security interest and other encumbrance. You will do all things necessary and further warrant that pursuant to the transfers under clause 2(b) clear title to all of the stock referred to in the Stock Schedule has been or will be transferred to us free of any security interest or other encumbrance. (d) You covenant that the Stock Schedule is accurate, the Stock is located on the Land and the Stock is healthy and free from disease. (e) Legal and beneficial ownership of the Stock, free of any security interest or other encumbrance will be deemed to be transferred to us on the Commencement Date, We own the Stock. 9 Clause 3 sets out the general lease of Stock provisions: 3. LEASE OF THE STOCK. On completion of the purchase contemplated in clause 2, we will lease the Stock to you for the Term in consideration of you paying the Lease Payments, and subject to the covenants, conditions, terms, reservations and restrictions contained in this Deed, and the following clauses will apply to the Lease. 10 Once the Lease is executed, the farmers must make lease payments based on their individual cash flow. This means that dairy farmers typically make payments from December through May and dry stock farmers typically make lease payments from February through May each year of the Lease. 11 Existing farmers would enter into this Arrangement to access capital, to retire debt or to purchase additional Stock or land, or to expand their business. Such leases also help new farmers set up a business, as leases require much less start up capital than is required to purchase stock. At the end of the transaction, farmers may offer to purchase the Stock they have leased. However, StockCo Residual is under no obligation to accept those offers (see clause 13 of the Lease reproduced in paragraph 19). 12 The length of each Lease may vary up to a maximum lease period of five years for cattle and four years for sheep. Supplementary leases may be entered into in respect of replacement and/or additional Stock. Use, treatment and obligations of farmers in respect of the Stock 13 Clause 4 of the Lease provides for the protection of StockCo’s interest in the Stock and the circumstances under which the farmers have enjoyment over the Stock without interruption or disturbance from StockCo. 4. PROTECTION AND QUIET ENJOYMENT (a) You must protect our ownership of the Stock and not attempt to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, or deal with the Stock, in any way other than in accordance with this Deed. You will not use, or attempt to use, the Stock as security for any loans or other obligation, sell or part with possession of any Stock otherwise than in accordance with this Deed, or register, attempt to register or allow to be registered, any security 4 interest on the Personal Property Securities Register in respect of the Stock. (b) As long as you make all Lease Payments and duly and punctually observe and perform all your obligations under this Deed, you may peaceably possess and enjoy the Stock without interruption or disturbance from us on the terms contained in this Deed. 14 Clause 8 of the Lease contains provisions relating to the farmers expected use and maintenance of the leased Stock: 8. USE AND MAINTENANCE OF STOCK (a) You will farm the Stock according to the best principles of good animal husbandry and take all possible care for the safety, well-being and security of the Stock and maintain the Stock's number, quality and type. (b) All costs regarding the farming, health, levies, taxes and any other maintenance or compliance costs are payable by you. (c) We may, at any time, determine whether you are in compliance with clause 8(a) and may employ such consultants or persons as in our absolute discretion we think fit to assist in making that determination. You must reimburse us for any fees paid by us to any such persons upon receipt of a written demand, and will pay any fees due direct to any such persons upon request by us. Any determination by us that you are not in compliance with clause 8(a) will in the absence of manifest error be final and binding on you. 15 Clause 9 of the Lease sets out the actions the farmers must take if there is a loss of any leased Stock. 9. STOCK LOSSES. (a) If requested by us, following the death or loss of any Stock you will immediately notify us of such death or loss setting out the circumstances in which such death or loss took place and whether remedial steps have been taken to protect the remainder of the Stock. If requested by us, you will forthwith produce a report certified by a Veterinary Surgeon as to the fact and cause(s) of death. (b) When Stock dies or is lost, irrespective of the cause of death or loss, you are responsible for the value thereof and you will either: (i) replace the Stock with similar stock, ensuring continuing compliance with clause 8; or (ii) pay to us by way of liquidated damages an amount equal to the total agreed lease payments relating to the Stock, less any lease payments received to date and less any rebate which we may in our absolute discretion allow you. (c) You are responsible for the removal and disposal of any Stock which has died. 16 Clause 10 of the Lease sets out the farmer’s rights and obligations in relation to annual culls, replacement and variations of leased Stock. 10.

Clause 13 of the Lease sets out the termination provisions: 13. TERMINATION. At the expiry or earlier termination of this Deed you must, at your cost, deliver to us the Stock forthwith, and in any event within 5 business days. (a) If you fail to deliver the Stock to us in the time period specified, we may collect and remove the Stock from any property where we believe the Stock may be located, and you hereby licence us to do so, and you will be liable to us for any cost, loss, expense or liability in so collecting and removing the Stock.

The farmer may offer to purchase the Stock, but StockCo Residual is under no obligation to accept that offer. 21 Once the sale of Stock has taken place, if the net proceeds (the gross income from the sale less any expenditure) are less than Residual Value, the farmer pays the difference between the net proceeds and the Residual Value, to StockCo Residual. Alternatively if the net proceeds are greater than the Residual Value, StockCo Residual pays the farmer the difference between the net proceeds and Residual Value. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The customer is in the “business” (as defined by section YA 1) of farming. b) The customer has entered into the Lease for the sole purpose of undertaking a farming business and intends to use the leased Stock in the production of assessable income. c) The Stock becomes the property of the customer only if the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date, subject to approval by StockCo. 7 d) The lease payments are genuine, arm’s length amounts for the possession and use of the Stock. e) At the time the lease is entered into the Residual Value of the Stock is a reasonable, and the parties best, estimate of the likely market value of the Stock at the Lease Termination Date. f) The customer is not in the “business” (as defined in section YA 1) of selling or exchanging leases. g) At the time of entering into each Lease, the customer does not intend to dispose of the Lease. h) The customer is not carrying on or undertaking a scheme of trading leases entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. i) The Stock, when purchased by the customer after the Lease Termination Date, are not used in, or as part of, a Stock dealing “business” (as defined in section YA 1). j) The customers will enter into the Leases for one or a number of the following reasons which are, in each case, the main reasons for entering into the Arrangement: • The need to refinance livestock already owned for further investment in the farming business or to retire existing debt; • The need for certainty of cash flows through structuring the lease payments; • The need for certainty of income and expenditure; and/or • The need to reduce the initial level of cash required to enter the farming industry or to purchase new livestock. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The Stock lease payments are deductible under section DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in section DA 2 apply to prevent deductibility, provided that: (i) no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction in section DA 1(1); and (ii) the income arising from the Arrangement is derived by the customer in New Zealand. • The valuation provisions in sections EC 6 to EC 27 apply to the customer when the “specified Stock” (as defined in section YA 1) is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. 8 • The valuation provisions in sections EC 32 to EC 37 apply to the customer when the “high-priced Stock” (as defined in section YA 1) is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. • The cost price of the “specified livestock” (as defined in section YA 1) for the purposes of sections EC 6 to EC 27, for customers purchasing that Stock at the end of the Lease, is the Residual Value stated in the Lease. • The cost price of the “high-priced livestock” (as defined in section YA 1) for the purposes of sections EC 32 to EC 37, for customers purchasing that Stock at the end of the Lease, is the Residual Value stated in the Lease. • At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, section EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year. • The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement. • Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement as the Lease is not an operating lease. • Sections FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement as the Lease is not a finance lease. • Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement as the Lease is not a hire purchase agreement. • Section GC 1 does not apply to any sale of the livestock to the customer at the Lease Termination Date. • Section BG 1 will not apply to negate or vary any of the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2008 and ending on 31 March 2011. This Ruling is signed by me on the 20 th day of November 2008. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

CMS UK receives X% of the maintenance revenue and X% of the development revenue. Agreements between CMS and its New Zealand customers The contracts and schedules governing the relationship between CMS and its New Zealand customers are the: • General Terms and Conditions of Business (“General Terms”); • Licence Specific Agreement, including: Schedule 1; Schedule 2; and Schedule 3; 3 • Software Management Specific Agreement (“SMS Agreement”) (originally entitled the Maintenance and Systems Management Agreement, which is materially the same), including: Schedule 1; and Schedule 2; • Professional Services Specific Agreement (“PSS Agreement”) (originally entitled the Development Services Specific Agreement, which is materially the same), including the: Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development) (originally entitled the Schedule of Development Work, which is materially the same). General Terms and Conditions of Business CMS and the customer enter into the General Terms, which govern the provision of services and products to CMS’s customers. Separate documents govern the specific requirements that CMS and the customer contract to have performed. The specific terms most relevant for our purposes are contained in the Licence Specific Agreement (discussed in paragraphs 0–21). The General Terms provide that if a Specific Agreement and the General Terms are inconsistent, the Specific Agreement will prevail. 2. Specific Agreement(s) 2.1 Any Specific Agreement(s) submitted by CMS to the Client is subject to these General Terms. In the event of any inconsistency between a Specific Agreement and these General Terms the terms of the Specific Agreement shall prevail. The other terms in the General Terms include confidentiality, liability, copyright, risk insurance, termination and other general matters. Licence Specific Agreement CMS enters into the Licence Specific Agreement with its customers. The Licence Specific Agreement has three schedules. Schedule 1 of the Licence Specific Agreement stipulates which NOVA program modules CMS will provide, the maximum number of concurrent users that may use NOVA, and that CMS will supply NOVA implementation and development services to the customer. V. SERVICES CMS shall supply to the Client the following estimated services in relation to the Computer System:- 1. Implementation X man days 2. Development The development services under this Agreement are provided under the terms of the Development Services Specific Agreement. At the commencement of a project, CMS assesses how many days it will need to implement NOVA for the customer. Following commercial negotiation, CMS and the customer agree how much the customer will pay for the 4 implementation services. NOVA implementation times differ depending on the level of complexity. CMS negotiates payment terms for implementation services with the customer. These terms vary, depending on the circumstances of each deal. Usually, payments are required as the services are performed. Schedule 2 of the Licence Specific Agreement governs the delivery date and commencement of services. Schedule 3 of the Licence Specific Agreement details the charges for the NOVA software and charges for implementation. SERVICES and CLIENT ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS Notwithstanding anything contained within the Licence Specific Agreement to the Contrary CMS has agreed to provide the Services listed in Schedule 1 Paragraph V at a fixed price of $X This is made up of: Implementation X days @ NZ$X per day. All implementation is physically performed in New Zealand except for very small amounts of implementation which are physically performed outside New Zealand . Software Management Specific Agreement The SMS Agreement is between CMS and its customer. Under this agreement, CMS undertakes to carry out certain maintenance services. The agreement has two schedules. Schedule 1 of the SMS Agreement governs the severity level categorisation of any maintenance requested or the type of any enhancement requested. The schedule also governs CMS’s target response times to requests. Schedule 2 of the SMS Agreement states the charges for the monthly maintenance services CMS provides to its customers. These monthly maintenance services can include: • software maintenance services • equipment (including maintenance) • systems and facilities management service • NOVA network service With the exception of software maintenance services, some customers may choose to source these services themselves and therefore will not be charged by CMS. Some of the NOVA network services CMS supplies constitute “telecommunications services” (as defined in the Act). Customers who choose to source network services and equipment rental directly handle almost all facilities management requirements themselves. CMS provides only a few basic facilities management services as part of its maintenance services. Professional Services Specific Agreement 5 CMS and the customer enter into a PSS Agreement, which states the process by which the customer may request development services. The PSS Agreement defines “professional services” as: “Professional services” means the implementation, installation and/or development services more particularly described in the Schedule of Work The PSS Agreement includes a Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development). Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development) The Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development) contains the contract price for the requested man-days of implementation services to the customer. Implementation services relate to implementing and configuring services in respect of the software (NOVA). The Schedule of Work also contains a separate contract price for man-days of development services to the customer. Development services relate to programming and related professional services in respect of the software. Before CMS agrees to any development work, it undertakes a workshop with the customer to determine the amount of development required to address the customer’s particular development requirements. After this workshop, CMS assesses the number of “man-days” required for development. After commercial negotiation, CMS reaches agreement with the customer about how much the customer will pay for development services. When the agreement is reached, CMS delivers the standard NOVA software so the implementation project and development services can start. Customers are likely to require CMS to provide development services after NOVA “goes live”, for example, for additional functionality or for further reports to be prepared. Under clause 2.1 of the Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development), CMS agrees to provide a negotiated number of man-days for implementation services. 2. DESCRIPTION AND USE OF IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES 2.1 In consideration of the Contract Price, set forth in clause 4.1 below CMS agrees to provide the following (estimated) number of Man-days of implementation professional services to the Client.- Number of Man-days Project Management X Implementation Consultants X Technical Consultants X Training Consultants X These services are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Implementation Services”. ... 2.3 The Implementation Services relate only to implementing and configuration services in respect of the software and/or Programs known as NOVA and associated activities. The Implementation Services are more particularity described in Annex 1 of this Schedule of Work. 6 CMS also provides a negotiated amount of man-days for development work. 3. DESCRIPTION AND USE OF DEVELOPMENT SERVICES 3.1 In consideration of the Contract Price, set forth in clause 4.2 below CMS agrees to provide the following (estimated) number of Man-days of development services to the Client.- Type Number of Man-days Development Services X These services are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Development Services”. The customer agrees to pay CMS for these man-days. CMS negotiates payment terms for development services with the customer. Terms vary, depending on the circumstances of each deal. Usually, payments are required as the services are performed. 4. PAYMENT TERMS & PRICE INCREASES 4.1 The Contract Price for the provision of Implementation Services referred to herein is for a fixed price of $X (plus applicable GST) which shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Annex 3 part A. 4.2 The Contract Price for the provision of Development Services referred to herein is for a fixed price of $X (plus applicable GST) which shall be payable in accordance with the terms of Annex 3 part B. In summary, CMS enters into a series of contracts and schedules with a customer. These contracts and schedules provide the implementation, professional and network services that CMS will supply to the customer and the price the customer will pay. Some of these services are carried out in New Zealand, while some are carried out outside New Zealand. Services performed in New Zealand The services performed in New Zealand are as follows. Service Governing Agreement Almost all Implementation Licence Specific Agreement First line support SMS Agreement Systems and facilities management SMS Agreement Reports development PSS Agreement; Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development) 7 Services performed outside New Zealand The services performed outside New Zealand are as follows. Service Governing Agreement Some development services Schedule of Work (Implementation and Development) Almost all of the software SMS Agreement maintenance services Some of the NOVA network services SMS Agreement Almost all implementation is carried out in New Zealand. Some development services are carried out overseas, as are almost all the software maintenance services. NOVA is an off-the-shelf product, so needs to be customised to meet additional customer requirements. The customer enters into the above contracts with CMS to supply these services. CMS then contacts CMS UK and details the services required and modifications to be made. CMS UK then contracts other CMS companies to make these modifications and carry out these services. Some NOVA network services (which include “telecommunications services” (as defined in the Act)) are also carried out overseas. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions. a) The network services, development services and software maintenance services apportioned at a 0% GST rate are physically performed outside New Zealand. b) The network services, development services and software maintenance services physically performed outside New Zealand and charged at a 0% GST rate are indicated on any invoices provided to the New Zealand resident customer. c) CMS UK and CMS do not have an agency relationship. d) The services physically performed outside New Zealand are priced on an arm’s length, market basis. e) The services physically performed in New Zealand are priced on an arm’s length, market basis. f) CMS contracts to have some services physically performed outside New Zealand for the following reasons: (i) There are economies of scale in having a centralised development centre outside New Zealand; and (ii) There are lower development costs in having services physically performed outside New Zealand. 8 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows. • The supply by CMS of network services, development services, and software maintenance services to its New Zealand customers may be charged at a 0% GST rate to the extent that those services are physically performed outside New Zealand, provided those services are not “telecommunications services” (as defined in section 2). • Section 8(4B) does not apply to the supply of services by CMS to its New Zealand customers. • Section 76 does not apply to negate or vary any of the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 March 2008 and ending on 31 October 2011. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4 th day of December 2008. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel 9
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 08/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited (“NZBL”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2004 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections GD 1, EA 3, EJ 9, FC 8, FC 9, FC 10, EC 38 to EC 48, DA 1, DA 2, and BG 1 and subpart EW. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the leasing of a thoroughbred breed of horse (“bloodstock”) on the terms provided in the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement (“Bloodstock Agreement”) entered into by NZBL and its customers for customers to use in breeding bloodstock progeny. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Purpose of the Arrangement 1. NZBL, New Zealand Bloodstock Limited (“NZB”), New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited (“NZB Finance”) and New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited (“NZB Progeny”) are all 100% owned subsidiaries of New Zealand Bloodstock Holdings Limited (“NZB Holdings”). Together, they are referred to in this ruling as the “NZB Group”. 2. NZB established NZBL to expand its business and increase sales of bloodstock in New Zealand by making investment in the bloodstock industry more attractive to existing and new entrants. The availability of leasing reduces the initial level of cash required by existing and new entrants to the bloodstock business to acquire bloodstock. The leasing arrangement gives the customers the opportunity to participate in the business of breeding bloodstock by leasing the bloodstock. NZB is contractually entitled to provide the auctioning services for any progeny of the bloodstock. The benefit for the NZB Group from the leasing arrangement is that NZB gets the commissions from selling the bloodstock and the commissions from any sale of progeny from the bloodstock, in addition to NZBL’s right to receive the lease payments. Sourcing of the bloodstock 3. NZBL acquires new bloodstock from third party owners, and then leases this bloodstock to the customer. Alternatively, the customer purchases the new bloodstock from the third party owner, sells it to NZBL, and then leases the 2 bloodstock from NZBL. This helps to protect NZBL from involvement in any subsequent contractual claims regarding the purchase of the bloodstock from the third party owner. In both cases, the parties contemplate the transaction as a whole at the outset. In either case, the customer sources the bloodstock, drawing on bloodstock consulting, freight, and insurance services provided by NZB. 4. NZBL may also acquire bloodstock that is already owned by the customer, either through an earlier purchase or because it is homebred (the “already owned bloodstock”) and the proceeds or sale of the already owned bloodstock are only used for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business. 5. It is agreed in the Bloodstock Agreement that the customer may purchase the bloodstock at the end of the lease. The Bloodstock Agreement describes the Arrangement: WHEREAS A. The Lessee has requested the Lessor to purchase the Animal described in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter called ‘the Animal’) and upon purchase thereof to lease and, if required, to re-sell the Animal to the Lessee in accordance with the terms hereof. B. The Lessor has purchased the Animal and has agreed to lease the Animal to the Lessee and the Lessee has agreed to lease the Animal with the right to purchase it upon the terms and conditions more particularly outlined herein. C. The Animal secures the payment or performance of the Lessee’s obligations hereunder and this Agreement creates a security interest in the Animal in terms of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. D. The Lessor has agreed to this Lease to Purchase Agreement for the specific purpose of assisting the Lessee in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale by adding to its inventory and upon the basis that the Lessee, if it wishes to sell the leased animal or, if a mare, the progeny thereof, will sell the same through the bloodstock auctions conducted by its parent company New Zealand Bloodstock Limited. E. The Lessee has entered into this agreement for the purpose of obtaining breeding stock to use in the Lessee’s business of bloodstock breeding for sale. 3 Lease particulars 6. The terms and duration of leases are based on individual requirements, credit risk, and potential breeding expectations. Lease periods may vary but a typical lease term is three years for fillies or mares and two years for colts or stallions. Lease assignment 7. When the lease is executed, NZBL assigns the lease to NZB Finance for the discounted value of the cash flow. The discount is equivalent to the market rate offered by third party companies providing such financing facilities. The assignment is on a non-recourse basis, and NZBL is not liable to NZB Finance in the event of default by the lessee. The Notice of Assignment describes this assignment as: TAKE NOTICE that on the New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited being the Lessor under the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement between it and you as Lessee has absolutely assigned all of its right title and interest therein as Lessor as follows (a) To New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited a duly incorporated company having its principal place of business at Karaka Sales Centre, Hingaia Road, Papakura, New Zealand all of its rights and obligations relating to the leasing of the Animal under the said Agreement and without limiting the generality of the foregoing all of the rights of the Lessor to receive payments of rental as and when they shall become due or other monies payable under the said Agreement by the Lessee to the Lessor or in respect of the Lessor enforcing such rights and receiving such payments as are prescribed by the said Agreement. You are directed to pay all payments of rental due under the said Agreement and all other payments due in respect of the lease of the Animal therein described to the said New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited and in future to deal with that company in respect of all matters pertaining to the leasing arrangement under the said Agreement. Residual Value 8. The bloodstock has a defined Residual Value under the Bloodstock Agreement. The Residual Value is an estimate (at the time the lease is signed) of the value the bloodstock will have at the end of the lease. The term “Residual Value” is defined in the Bloodstock Agreement as: ‘Residual value’ means the amount specified in the Schedule hereto as such being a pre-estimate of the value of the Animal upon the expiry of this Lease. Bloodstock assignment 9. After the lease has been entered into and assigned to NZB Finance, NZBL assigns the title to the bloodstock to NZB Progeny. Because the Residual Value, if realised at all, is not realised by NZB Progeny until the end of the lease, NZB Progeny pays to NZBL the discounted value of the residual value payment. The discounted value is calculated using market rates materially the same as those used by third party companies providing financial facilities. 4 10. Transferring the bloodstock titles to NZB Progeny gives additional asset protection benefit to the New Zealand Bloodstock group. In this way the group’s interest in the bloodstock is separated and protected from the day to day business activities of NZB, NZB Finance and NZB Leasing. The Notice of Assignment from NZBL to the lessee describes this assignment as: TAKE NOTICE that on the New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited being the Lessor under the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement between it and you as Lessee has absolutely assigned all of its right title and interest therein as Lessor as follows (a) ... (b) To New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited a duly incorporated company having its principal place of business at Karaka Sales Centre, Hingaia Road, Papakura, New Zealand all of its rights and obligations relating to the title to and property in the Animal and the right to receive payment of the Residual value outlined in the said Agreement and any other monies due under the said Agreement in respect of the title to or ownership of the Animal. You are directed to pay the amount of Residual Value of the Animal on the date payable under the said Agreement to New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited and in future to deal with that company in respect of all matters relating to the ownership and wellbeing of the Animal(s). Lease Termination Date 11. The “Lease Termination Date” is the date on which the lease ends. The customer may purchase the bloodstock on the Lease Termination Date for the Residual Value. If the customer does exercise their option to purchase the bloodstock, NZB Progeny will transfer title to the customer in return for payment of the Residual Value. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The customer is in the “business” (as defined in section OB 1) of breeding bloodstock. b) Where the bloodstock is already owned bloodstock, the customers will enter into the Bloodstock Agreement for one or both of the following reasons which are, in each case, the main reason or reasons for entering into the Arrangement: • The need to refinance bloodstock already owned for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business; and/or • The need for certainty of cash inflows for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business through the sale of the bloodstock to NZBL. c) Where the bloodstock is new bloodstock, the customers will enter into the Bloodstock Agreement for one or a number of the following reasons which are, in each case, the main reason or reasons for entering into the Arrangement: 5 • The need to refinance bloodstock already owned for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business; • The need for certainty of cash outflows through structuring the lease payments; and/or • The need to reduce the initial level of cash required to enter the bloodstock breeding business or to purchase new bloodstock. d) The customer has not entered into two or more consecutive or successive leases (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(iv) of the “lease” definition in section OB 1, if the reference to “the same personal property lease asset” is read as a reference to “the same bloodstock”) of the same bloodstock. e) The customer has entered into the Bloodstock Agreement for the sole purpose of breeding from the leased bloodstock and intends to use the leased bloodstock in deriving the assessable income. f) The lease payments are genuine, arm’s length amounts for the possession and use of the bloodstock. g) The leased bloodstock is mature for use in breeding and is capable of being used for breeding at all times during the period to which each lease payment relates. h) Any racing undertaken by the leased bloodstock is incidental to the actual use of the bloodstock for breeding during the lease term. i) The Residual Value of the bloodstock is a reasonable, and the parties’ best, estimate of the likely market value of the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. j) The bloodstock becomes the property of the customer only when the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. k) No consideration is paid for the option to purchase the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. l) The customer is not in the “business”, as defined in section OB 1, of selling or exchanging leases. m) At the time of entering into the Bloodstock Agreement, the customer does not intend to dispose of the lease. n) The customer is not carrying on or undertaking a scheme of trading leases entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • The bloodstock lease payments are deductible under section DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in section DA 2 apply, provided that: 6 (i) no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction in section DA 1(1); and (ii) the income arising from the Arrangement is derived by the customer in New Zealand. • At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, section EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year. • The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement. • Section EJ 9 does not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not an operating lease. • Sections FC 8A to FC 8I do not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not a finance lease. • Sections FC 9 and FC 10 do not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not a hire purchase agreement. • The valuation and specified write-down provisions in sections EC 38 to EC 48 apply to the customer when the bloodstock is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. • The “cost price” of the bloodstock for the purposes of sections EC 38 to EC 48 is the Residual Value stated in the Bloodstock Agreement. • Section GD 1 does not apply to the sale of the bloodstock to the customer. • Section BG 1 will not apply to the Arrangement to negate or vary any of the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 5 December 2007 and ending on 5 December 2012. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18 th day of December 2008. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

Taxation Law All Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CW 36 The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the payment of a scholarship by the Institute to students enrolled in the ‘Te Wananga Whakairo Rakau O Aotearoa’ or a Diploma in traditional Whakairo course. Further details of the arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1. The Institute was established by the New Zealand Maori Arts & Crafts Institute Act 1963. Under that Act, the purpose of the Institute is to operate as a showcase for Maoritanga with an emphasis on displaying aspects of Maori culture to tourists. It is also charged under the Act with furthering the development of carving in a traditional manner. 2. The Institute has awarded two types of certificate since 1967:  The New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Diploma; and  The New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Certificate. 3. In 1994 a “needs analysis” of the Institute was undertaken. It was decided to focus activities on training and educating Maori. Accordingly since 1996 the Institute has offered a three year Diploma course in Maori carving (called ‘Te Wananga Whakairo Rakau O Aotearoa’ or a Diploma in Traditional Whakairo). The content of the Diploma has been modularised and Certificates are awarded for the successful completion of each of the 14 modules. The 14 modules are: Module 1 = Introduction to Maori Art Module 2 = Tool Technology Module 3 = Tool care and maintenance Module 4 = Manufacture Patuki Module 5 = Manufacture Tekoteko Employer enquiries 0800 443 553 All other enquiries 0800 443 773 INFOexpress 0800 257 777 Module 6 = Introduction to Maori Design Module 7 = Tribal Styles Module 8 = Nga patu o te Riri (combat clubs) Module 9 = Nga Rakau o te Riri (combat staffs) Module 10 = Nga waka mauri Module 11 = Taonga Whakatautau Module 12 = Taonga Puoro (musical instruments) Module 13 = Hanga Whare Module 14 = Hanga waka 4.

The Scholarship Agreement (“the Agreement”) and Scholarship Policy (“the Policy”) 5. The Institute offers a limited number of scholarships to assist students (“Tauira”) while they are undertaking their studies. The Scholarship Agreement entered into between the Institute and its Tauira has the following features:  Each scholarship is for the amount of $18,200.00 per annum paid in weekly sums over a three year term. The amount of the annual scholarship payments may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index.  The Agreement sets out the hours of class attendance required by the Tauira. Terms and study periods are also specified.  The Agreement states that the Institute will provide a uniform and tools, for the Tauira.  Any carvings or other items produced by the Tauira in the course of their studies are the property of the Institute. 6. The Scholarship payments aim to help cover the living costs of Tauira. Tauira have generally moved from their tribal area, are young and have very few assets. All costs of training, protective clothing, tools, equipment and raw materials are covered by the Institute. 7. The Institute also has a scholarship policy which is set out below: SCHOLARSHIP POLICY (i). The Maori Arts and Crafts Institute now offers Student scholarships to successful applicants to Te Wananga Whakairo.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 09/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Income Securities Limited (“BNZIS”) Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CX 56(3) and GB 35. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement involved the raising of capital by Bank of New Zealand (“BNZ”) and National Australia Bank Limited (“NAB”). BNZIS issued perpetual non- cumulative shares (“BNZIS Shares”) to members of the public (“BNZIS Shareholders”). BNZIS lent the proceeds raised from the issue to BNZ Income Management Limited (“BNZIM”). BNZIM invested the proceeds of that loan (“BNZIM Loan”) in perpetual preference shares issued by BNZ (“BNZ Preference Shares”), and, in turn, BNZ used the proceeds for general corporate purposes. There was, at the time the Arrangement was entered into, and is no intention on the part of the Board of Directors of BNZ and/or NAB that the BNZ and/or NAB would promote the acquisition of BNZIS Shares by providing investors with a loan or other financing from any of the companies in the BNZ or NAB group. This Ruling does not apply to any investor who or which has funded the acquisition of BNZIS Shares by means of borrowing or other financing from any of the companies in the BNZ or NAB group of companies, where such borrowing or other financing was part of an express agreement or arrangement (whether in writing or otherwise) with such entity that the proceeds of some or all of such borrowing or other financing would be used for the purposes of acquiring BNZIS Shares. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The material terms of the transactions comprising the Arrangement are governed by the following documents (which were provided to Inland Revenue on either 11 April 2008 or 22 July 2008): • BNZIM Loan Agreement, dated 25 February 2008, between BNZIS and BNZIM; • BNZIS Deed Poll, dated 25 February 2008, entered into by BNZIS in favour of the BNZIS shareholders; • Security Trust Deed, dated 25 February 2008, between BNZIM, BNZIS and New Zealand Permanent Trustees Limited; • Constitution of BNZ; • Constitution of BNZIS; • Committed Cash Advances Facility Agreement, between BNZ and BNZIS, dated 25 February 2008; • Administration Agreement, between BNZ and BNZIS, dated 25 February 2008. 2. Also provided to Inland Revenue on 11 April 2008 was a copy of the Combined Investment Statement and Prospectus regarding the Offer of Perpetual Non-cumulative Shares by BNZIS, dated 25 February 2008 (“Prospectus”). 3. The Arrangement is summarised in the diagram below and discussed in subsequent paragraphs. NAB 4. The Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (“APRA”) currently treats the BNZIS Shares as innovative residual tier 1 capital for NAB on a level 2 basis. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand currently treats the BNZ Preference Shares as tier 1 capital for BNZ. BNZIS Incorporation of BNZIS 5. BNZIS is a special purpose company incorporated on 29 January 2008 under the Companies Act 1993 and intended to be tax resident solely in New Zealand. BNZIS was incorporated with 100 ordinary shares of $1.00 each, all of which are held by National Equities Limited (“NEL”). NEL is a 100% subsidiary of NAB and is incorporated and tax resident in Australia. BNZIS subsequently issued a further 10,500,000 ordinary shares to NEL. NEL NAGNZ BNZIM BNZIS BNZ Investors Australia New Zealand 100% 100% 100% BNZ Preference Shares Dividends BNZIM Loan 100% Other payments Interest Dividends on BNZIS Shares BNZIS Shares 2 It issued a further tranche of 50,468 ordinary shares to NEL on 29 May 2008 to cover additional establishment costs in excess of the initial ordinary share issues. 6. The ordinary shares carry all of the voting rights in BNZIS but carry no right to a distribution in any circumstances. 7. Under the relevant accounting standards, BNZIS is a member of the NAB consolidated group (“NAB Group”). BNZIS Constitution 8. BNZIS has no power to carry on any business or activity other than that described in the BNZIS Constitution, which was lodged with the Companies Office on 25 February 2008. 9. Clause 4.1 of the BNZIS Constitution states: Limitation on Business: The only business or activity which the Company may carry on is to: (a) issue and maintain in existence perpetual non-cumulative shares, including listing (and maintaining a listing of) those shares on any stock or securities exchange in New Zealand or elsewhere; (b) advance the proceeds of perpetual non-cumulative shares to BNZIM, or a Related Company of that company pursuant to one or more loan agreements; (c) enter into the Administration Agreement, the Committed Cash Advance Facility Agreement, the Security Trust Deed, the Loan Agreement, the Registration Agreement and the Deed Poll (and any other administration agreements, committed cash advance facility agreements, security trust deeds, loan agreements, registration agreements and/or deed polls in connection with the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares); (d) do all other things reasonably incidental to the activities referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and this Constitution. The Company has no power to: (e) carry on any other business or activity; or (f) apply amounts received by way of interest on, or repayment of, the loans referred to in paragraph (b) for any purpose other than in payments to the holders of the perpetual non-cumulative shares, meeting costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and maintenance in existence of perpetual non-cumulative shares and making income and other tax payments to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department. 10. BNZIS elected to be a portfolio investment entity (“PIE”, as defined in section YA 1) with a commencement date of 28 March 2008. 11. Under the BNZIS Constitution, the directors of BNZIS are granted powers to take all steps considered necessary or desirable to ensure BNZIS continues to be eligible to be a PIE and qualify as a “portfolio listed company” (“PLC”, as defined in section YA 1) under the requirements set out in the Act . These requirements include (but are not limited to): • rejecting applications for, or transfers of, BNZIS Shares (clauses 6.16 and 6.17 of the Constitution); • deeming any BNZIS Shares held that exceed the “investor interest size” requirements specified in the Act to be held by the BNZIS Shareholder on trust for any company in the NAB Group appointed by BNZIS and allowing such shares to be sold by that company (clause 6.17 of the Constitution); • allowing BNZIS to request any BNZIS Shareholder to provide such information as it may require to determine whether BNZIS continues to 3 meet the PLC requirements set out in the Act and, where holders do not provide such information within relevant periods, providing that the relevant BNZIS Shares are held on trust by the holder thereof for any company in the NAB Group appointed by BNZIS and allowing such shares to be sold by that company (clause 6.17 of the Constitution). • taking any of the steps in clause 6.18 of the Constitution to ensure any breach of the “investor interest size” requirement is remedied within the period specified in the Act. BNZIS Shares 12. BNZIS issued the BNZIS Shares under a public offer in New Zealand pursuant to the Prospectus referred to at paragraph 2. Clause 1.4 of the Prospectus states: 1.4 OFFER IN NEW ZEALAND ONLY The Shares are being offered only to New Zealand residents and no offer is being made outside New Zealand. Accordingly, this Offer Document does not constitute an offer of the Shares in any jurisdiction other than New Zealand. No action has been or will be taken by BNZIS which would permit an offer of the Shares, or possession or distribution of any offering material, in any other country or jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required (other than New Zealand). The Shares may only be offered for sale or sold in conformity with all applicable laws and regulations in any jurisdiction in which they are offered, sold or delivered. No person may purchase, offer, sell, distribute or deliver any Shares, or have in its possession, publish, deliver or distribute to any person, any offering material or any documents in connection with the Shares, in any jurisdiction other than in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Unless otherwise agreed with BNZIS, any person or entity applying for Shares is deemed to represent that they are not in a jurisdiction which prohibits the making of an offer of this kind and are not acting for a person in such a jurisdiction. 13. The public offer was of up to 350,000,000 BNZIS Shares at an issue price of $1 per share, with the right to accept over-subscriptions of a further $350,000,000. In total, 449,730,000 BNZIS Shares were issued pursuant to the offer, for a total subscription price of $449,730,000. Of these shares, 5,000 (the minimum parcel) have been subscribed for and are held by NEL. 14. The offer of the BNZIS Shares to the public in New Zealand closed on 25 March 2008. The issue date of the BNZIS Shares was 28 March 2008, and the date of initial quotation and trading on the debt securities market (the “NZDX”) operated by New Zealand Exchange Limited (“NZX”) was 31 March 2008. Although the BNZIS Shares are not debt securities for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, the NZX has given certain rulings on, and waivers of, the Listing Rules in relation to the listing of the BNZIS Shares on the NZDX. The BNZIS Shares are freely transferable, subject to certain ownership limitations. 15. The BNZIS Shares are perpetual, non-cumulative shares and have no fixed term, although the commercial expectation is that the funding raised by means of the issue of the BNZIS Shares will be in place for an initial five- year period, with extensions of further five-year periods, if desired. This is subject to potential exercise of the call option referred to in paragraph 45. The BNZIS Shares are not redeemable at the option of BNZIS or the BNZIS Shareholders, and in no circumstances will there be any conversion of the BNZIS Shares to ordinary shares. 16. The BNZIS Shares are non-voting shares, other than in respect of amendments that relate to the rights, privileges, limitations and conditions 4 attaching to them, meetings convened in relation to BNZIS’s liquidation in certain circumstances and certain proceedings under the Security Trust Deed and the BNZIS Deed Poll (clause 6.22 of the BNZIS Constitution). 17. The BNZIS Shares (under clause 6.1 of the BNZIS Constitution) give BNZIS Shareholders the right to a quarterly dividend that is equal to a fixed percentage of the issue price per annum for the first five years as determined in accordance with the following formula: issue price × dividend rate × (1-t) 4 18. The elements referred to in the formula in paragraph 17 are as set out below. (a) The issue price is $1. (b) The dividend rate is the aggregate of the five-year swap rate (adjusted, as necessary, to a quarterly rate) and the margin (being 2.20%). (c) “t” is: (i) for the period to the first dividend payment date (on 28 June 2008), 30%; and (ii) otherwise, the weighted average basic rate of New Zealand income tax applicable to BNZIS during the period ending on the relevant quarterly dividend payment date. 19. At the expiry of the first five-year period, there will be a further five-year rate set by reference to the then applicable five-year swap rate, such rate setting to take place two business days before that expiry date (but with no change to the margin). The same process will apply at the end of the second and subsequent five-year periods. 20. On liquidation, the BNZIS Shares give the right to a pro rata share of any surplus after liquidation of BNZIS’s assets and payment of its debts, in priority and to the exclusion of the holders of other classes of shares of BNZIS other than shares expressed to rank equally in liquidation of BNZIS. 21. The Prospectus states: Cash to pay dividends on the Shares will be derived by BNZIS from interest it receives on its loan to BNZIM. 22. Payment of dividends on the BNZIS Shares will not occur if a Dividend Payment Condition occurs. Clause 6.5 of the BNZIS Constitution defines Dividend Payment Condition as any of the following conditions: (a) the Directors in their sole discretion do not resolve to pay the Dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date; (b) without limiting section 52(1) of the \[Companies\] Act \[1993\], the Directors are not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Company will satisfy the solvency test (as defined in section 4 of the \[Companies\] Act \[1993\]) immediately after the payment of the Dividend; (c) unless APRA otherwise agrees: (i) after payment of the Dividend (which for the purposes of this calculation includes both the Dividend Amount in respect of the relevant Dividend and an amount equal to the Imputation Credits to be attached to the Dividend on the basis that the Dividend is Fully Credited), the APRA Prudential Capital Ratio or the APRA Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the NAB Group (on an APRA Level 2 or, if applicable, APRA Level 3 5 basis) would cease to comply with APRA’s then current capital adequacy guidelines, as they are applied to the NAB Group at the time; or (ii) the amount of the Dividend (which for the purposes of this calculation includes both the Dividend Amount in respect of the relevant Dividend and an amount equal to the Imputation Credits to be attached to the Dividend on the basis that the Dividend is Fully Credited) would exceed the Distributable Profits of the NAB Group as at the relevant Dividend Payment Date; or (d) APRA otherwise objects to the payment of the Dividend by the Company. 23. Dividends paid on the BNZIS Shares will not be cumulative, and holders of the BNZIS Shares have no right to put BNZIS into liquidation for their non- payment (clause 6.6 of the BNZIS Constitution). 24. Many of the above features of the BNZIS Shares are required to ensure APRA treats the BNZIS Shares as innovative residual tier 1 capital for the NAB Group on a level 2 basis. 25. It is intended that the dividends will be fully imputed to the holders of the BNZIS Shares. Under the BNZIS Deed Poll, BNZIS covenants that, if it fails to fully impute dividends paid to the holders, it will compensate the holders for the additional tax cost incurred by the holders as a result of that failure. Clause 2 of the BNZIS Deed Poll states: COVENANT TO PAY BNZIS irrevocably covenants and agrees in favour of each Holder that, if BNZIS fails to attach sufficient Imputation Credits to any Dividend it pays on a Dividend Payment Date so that the Dividend is Fully Credited, then, subject to clause 3, it will pay to each Holder, within 10 Business Days of its receipt of the Holder’s certificate, the amount that the Holder certifies in writing is necessary to compensate the Holder, on an after tax basis, for any additional tax cost the Holder suffers or incurs (or will suffer or incur) as a result of that failure, other than tax withheld by the Holder from a payment to another person. BNZIM Loan Details of the BNZIM Loan 26. BNZIS used the proceeds of the issue of the BNZIS Shares to make the BNZIM Loan to BNZIM. BNZIM is a company incorporated in New Zealand on 11 February 2008. BNZIM is expected to be resident for tax purposes in New Zealand. All of the shares in BNZIM are held by National Australia Group (NZ) Limited (“NAGNZ”), also a company incorporated in and tax resident in New Zealand. NAGNZ is the immediate holding company of BNZ and holds all of the ordinary shares issued in BNZ. 27. The BNZIM Loan is a perpetual loan (ie, it has no fixed maturity date). The principal amount of the BNZIM Loan is equal to the subscription amount for the BNZIS Shares. The BNZIM Loan is the only material asset of BNZIS and at least 90 percent of the income BNZIS derives will be interest from the BNZIM Loan. 28. Clause 4 of the BNZIM Loan Agreement provides that the BNZIM Loan pays interest quarterly. Interest is calculated in accordance with the following formula as defined in clause 1.1 of the Loan Agreement: loan amount × interest rate 4 29. The interest rate is the aggregate of the five-year swap rate (adjusted, as necessary, to a quarterly rate) plus the margin (being 2.20%). 6 30. At the expiry of the first five-year period, there will be a further five-year rate set by reference to the then applicable five-year swap rate, such rate setting to take place two business days before that expiry date (but with no change to the margin). The same process will apply at the end of the second and subsequent five-year periods. 31. The terms of the BNZIM Loan also oblige BNZIM to pay ongoing expenses incurred by BNZIS (such as expenses for services provided to it by BNZ or its auditors, and any net interest on short-term funding arrangements between it and BNZ). 32. Under clause 4.3 of the BNZIM Loan Agreement, interest on the BNZIM Loan will not be payable in respect of a quarterly interest period if an Interest Payment Condition applies. These conditions are if: • payment of the corresponding dividend by BNZIS would breach certain APRA requirements or exceed the NAB Group’s distributable profits; • the payment of the interest would result in BNZIM failing to satisfy the solvency test under the Companies Act 1993; • the directors of BNZIS would not be satisfied on reasonable grounds that BNZIS would satisfy the solvency test under the Companies Act 1993 immediately on payment of the corresponding dividend by BNZIS; or • APRA otherwise objects to BNZIS making the corresponding dividend payment. 33. If and to the extent that all or any part of any interest on the BNZIM Loan is not paid because any of the above Interest Payment Conditions apply, BNZIM shall have no obligation to pay interesting respect of the relevant interest period and BNZIS’s right to such amount will be cancelled. 34. As with the dividends on the BNZIS Shares, interest on the BNZIM Loan is not cumulative. 35. BNZIM invested the proceeds of the BNZIM Loan in BNZ Preference Shares (see paragraph 42). Because dividends on the BNZ Preference Shares will be paid on an after-tax basis, BNZIM will have a cash shortfall and will require additional funds to meet the interest payments on the BNZIM Loan. It is proposed that this cash shortfall be funded primarily by way of BNZ (or other profit-making companies in the BNZ group) making cash payments to BNZIM in exchange for loss-offset elections. Repayment of BNZIM Loan 36. The BNZIM Loan is repayable at the option of BNZIM at any time on or after five years from the anniversary of the BNZIM Loan, or following the occurrence of a Regulatory Event, a Loan Repayment Event, the Call (see paragraph 45), or a Tax Event (clause 6.1 of the BNZIM Loan Agreement). 37. BNZIM must repay the BNZIM Loan in whole following the redemption, buy back, or acquisition of BNZ Preference Shares. In this regard, clause 6.2 of the BNZIM Loan Agreement states: The Borrower shall repay the Loan (in whole but not in part) together with any unpaid interest (accrued since the last Interest Payment Date) calculated at the applicable Interest Rate on the number of days elapsed since the last Interest Payment Date and on the basis of 7 a 365 day year, immediately following the redemption, buy back or acquisition of the BNZ PPS. 38. Following the occurrence of a Transfer Event (as described in paragraph 39), BNZIM will repay the BNZIM Loan by transferring the BNZ Preference Shares to BNZIS. Such transfer will be deemed to be in full satisfaction of BNZIM’s obligations under the BNZIM Loan Agreement. 39. Transfer Events are defined in clause 1.1 of the BNZIM Loan Agreement: Transfer Event means the occurrence of an APRA Event, a Liquidation Event, a Distribution Non-Payment Event or a BNZ Distribution Event. Broadly, the Transfer Events comprise: • NAB failing to meet certain APRA requirements or being subject to the Australian equivalent of statutory management; • non-payment of interest where the conditions to payment of interest under the BNZIM Loan have been satisfied; • BNZIS, BNZIM, or BNZ going into liquidation or statutory management; and • BNZ paying an ordinary dividend when it has not paid dividends on the BNZ Preference Shares. 40. BNZIS’s rights under the BNZIM Loan are limited in recourse to the BNZ Preference Shares, distributions on those BNZ Preference Shares or the proceeds of their sale (clause 10 of the BNZIM Loan and the definition of “Collateral” in clause 3.1 of the Security Trust Deed). BNZIS does not have recourse to any other assets of BNZIM. 41. BNZIM’s obligation to transfer the BNZ Preference Shares to BNZIS is secured by a security interest over the BNZ Preference Shares in favour of the trustee under the Security Trust Deed. BNZ Preference Shares 42. BNZIM invested the funds raised from the BNZIM Loan in subscription for the BNZ Preference Shares. These shares: • on a liquidation of BNZ, rank in priority to ordinary shares issued by BNZ and have a right to receive an amount equal to their issue price plus the dividend accrued from the last dividend payment date (clause 25.9 of the BNZ Constitution); • are non-voting shares, except as to certain matters such as matters affecting their rights, privileges, or limitations (clause 25.10 of the BNZ Constitution); • pay a dividend on generally the same basis as the BNZIS Shares pay a dividend (but including the condition that directors of BNZ must be satisfied that payment of the dividend will not cause BNZ’s capital ratios to cease complying with Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s then current capital adequacy requirements) (clause 25.5 of the BNZ Constitution); and • have a right to such dividend in priority to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares issued by BNZ (clause 25.2 of the BNZ Constitution). 8 43. If a dividend is not paid on the BNZ Preference Shares on a dividend payment date, BNZ is not permitted to declare or make any distributions or payments on, or with respect to, any other shares in the capital of BNZ that rank equally with or junior to the BNZ Preference Shares (other than pro rata payments or distributions on shares that rank equally with the BNZ Preference Shares) unless and until: • BNZ has paid dividends in full on the BNZ Preference Shares on two consecutive dividend payment dates immediately following that dividend payment date; or • the call over the BNZIS Shares is exercised and the BNZIS Shares have been transferred in accordance with the terms of the call. 44. BNZ used the funds obtained by way of the issue of the BNZ Preference Shares for general business purposes, which may have included using them to repatriate funds back to the NAB Group in Australia. Any such repatriation may be by way of a dividend, a share or loan repayment, or another mechanism. Termination: Call over BNZIS Shares 45. Under the terms of the BNZIS Shares, NAB is granted a call option (“the Call”) over the BNZIS Shares, which it can exercise subject to its obtaining APRA’s prior written approval. Clause 6.9 of the BNZIS Constitution states that NAB has this right in the following circumstances: (a) on the Initial Call Date (or on any Dividend Payment Date falling after that date, as specified in the Call Notice); (b) at any time following a redemption, buy back or acquisition of the BNZ PPS; or (c) at any time after the occurrence of a Regulatory Event, a Loan Repayment Event or a Tax Event. 46. The Call may be exercised before the fifth anniversary on the happening of certain events that, broadly speaking, diminish the benefits to the NAB Group of the BNZIS Shares being on issue. These are referred to as Regulatory Events and Tax Events. The Call may also be exercised if certain other structurally significant events affecting BNZIS or BNZIM occur, referred to as Loan Repayment Events, or the BNZ Preference Shares are redeemed, bought back or acquired. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) During the period of the Ruling, the BNZIS Shares will be listed on the NZDX or another “recognised exchange” as defined in section YA 1. b) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS is not treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. c) During the period of the Ruling, ordinary shares in BNZIS will only be held by a person who also holds BNZIS Shares. d) During the period of the Ruling, each holder of a BNZIS Share has rights in relation to all the proceeds from the BNZIM Loan. 9 e) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS will be an “ICA company” as defined in section YA 1. f) During the period of the Ruling, any distributions made by BNZIS in respect of the BNZIS Shares will be fully credited for the purposes of section CD 43(26) of the Act to the extent permitted by the imputation credits that the directors of BNZIS determine are available. g) During the period of the Ruling, income derived by BNZIS will to the extent of 90 percent or more be derived from interest it receives on its loan to BNZIM. h) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS will not cancel the election it has made to be a PIE under section HL 11. i) During the period of the Ruling, the Constitution of BNZIS will not be materially altered or amended from the version provided to Inland Revenue on 11 April 2008 (as part of the application for a binding ruling) in a manner that relates to the eligibility requirements to be a PIE and a PLC set out in the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • A distribution in respect of the BNZIS Shares is “excluded income” under section CX 56(3) of a holder of the BNZIS Shares who is: (i) A New Zealand resident who is a natural person or a trustee and who does not elect to include the amount of such distributions in that holder’s return of income for the applicable year; and (ii) A person not referred to in paragraph (i) above to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is not fully imputed as described in section RF 9(2). • Section GB 35 does not apply to the Arrangement. • Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate the above conclusions The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 28 March 2008 and ending on 28 March 2013.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 09/07 This is a product ruling made under section 91E of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Persons to whom the Ruling applies (“the Applicants”) This Ruling has been applied for by: • Coöperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank B.A. (“Rabobank Nederland”); and • Rabo Capital Securities Limited (“Rabo Capital”) Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CX 56, GB 35 and BG 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the raising of capital by Rabo Capital and Rabobank Nederland. Rabo Capital has offered to the public (in New Zealand and to investors in other jurisdictions where they may be lawfully offered) New Zealand dollar denominated, perpetual, non-cumulative, non-voting preference shares (“PIE Capital Securities”) of up to $200 million (with the option to accept unlimited oversubscriptions at its discretion). Rabo Capital has accepted applications of $280 million. The PIE Capital Securities will be listed on the New Zealand Debt Market (“NZDX”). Rabo Capital will use the funds raised from the issue of the PIE Capital Securities to invest in capital securities issued by Rabobank Nederland (“Underlying Securities”) on or about the issue date of the PIE Capital Securities. Rabobank Nederland will use these funds for its banking business. Some of the funds may be used in its New Zealand business. The Board of Directors of Rabo Capital and/or the Supervisory Board of Rabobank Nederland have no intention that Rabo Capital and/or Rabobank Nederland promote the acquisition of PIE Capital Securities by providing holders of PIE Capital Securities or prospective holders with a loan or other financing from any of the companies in the Rabo Capital or Rabobank Nederland Group. This Ruling does not apply to any holder of PIE Capital Securities who or which has funded the acquisition of PIE Capital Securities by means of borrowing or other financing from any of the companies in the Rabobank group of companies, where such borrowing or other financing was part of an express agreement or arrangement (whether in writing or otherwise) with such company that the proceeds of some or all of such borrowing or other financing would be used for the purposes of acquiring PIE Capital Securities. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1 1 Parties to the Arrangement are: • Rabobank Nederland, a co-operative entity incorporated under Dutch law and tax resident in the Netherlands; • Rabo Capital, a limited liability company incorporated under New Zealand law which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank Nederland; and • Holders of PIE Capital Securities. 2 The transactions comprising the Arrangement are governed by documents that were provided to Inland Revenue on 2 April , 22 April or 24 April 2009. The documents are: • Agency Agreement between Rabo Capital, Rabobank Nederland and Computershare Investor Services Limited (“Registrar”) dated 16 April 2009 (“Agency Agreement”); • Terms and Conditions of the Underlying Securities set out in Exhibit A of the Agency Agreement; • Constitution of Rabo Capital registered with the New Zealand Companies Office on 27 April 2009 (“the Constitution”); • Terms and Conditions of the PIE Capital Securities attached as the Appendix to the Constitution (“PIE Conditions”); • Investment Statement for the purposes of the Securities Act 1987 for the offer of PIE Capital Securities, dated 17 April 2009 (“the Investment Statement”); • NZX Regulation Decision dated 17 April 2009; and • Listing Agreement NZDX Market between Rabo Capital and NZX Limited (“NZX”). 3 The Arrangement is summarised in the diagram below: 2 NZ Branch Investors: Holders of PIE Capital Securities Rabo Capital Rabobank Nederland New Zealand Netherlands NZ$280 m PIE Capital Securities Rabo Nederland holds 100% of voting shares in Rabo Capital NZ$280 m Underlying Securities in Rabobank Nederland NZ$ Interest NZ$ Dividends on PIE Capital Securities and Imputation Credits 4 The PIE Capital Securities and the Underlying Securities will constitute Tier 1 Capital of the Rabobank Group (comprising Rabobank Nederland together with its branches, consolidated subsidiaries and local member banks, including Rabo Capital) for the purposes of the Dutch Central Bank, which is the home prudential authority for Rabobank Nederland. Rabo Capital Incorporation of Rabo Capital 5 Rabo Capital is a special purpose company incorporated on 15 April 2009 under the Companies Act 1993 with 1000 $1 ordinary shares, all of which are held by Rabobank Nederland. Rabobank Nederland is a co-operative entity incorporated under Dutch law and tax resident in the Netherlands. 6 The ordinary shares carry all the voting rights in Rabo Capital but the holder of the ordinary shares is not, by virtue of that holding, entitled to participate in any dividend or distribution (including by way of a return of capital) made by Rabo Capital. Rabo Capital Constitution 7 Rabo Capital has no power to carry on any business or activity other than that described in the Constitution. 8 Clause 5.1 of the Constitution states: 3 5.1 Limitation on Business: The only business or activity which the Company may carry on is to: (a) issue and maintain in existence PIE Capital Securities, including listing (and maintaining a listing of) those shares on any stock or securities exchange in New Zealand or elsewhere; (b) use the proceeds of PIE Capital Securities to subscribe for perpetual Tier 1 bonds issued by Rabobank Nederland, or a related company of Rabobank Nederland; (c) enter into the Agency Agreement and the Security Trust Deed (and any other administration agreements, security trust deeds, registration agreements and/or deed polls in connection with the issue of PIE Capital Securities); and (d) do all other things reasonably incidental to the activities referred to in sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (c) above and this Constitution. The Company has no power to: (e) carry on any other business or activity; or (f) apply amounts received by way of interest on, or repayment of, the bonds referred to in sub-paragraph (b) above for any purpose other than in payments to Holders, meeting costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and maintenance in existence of PIE Capital Securities and making income and other tax payments to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department. 9 Rabo Capital elected to be a “portfolio listed company” (“PLC”) under the “portfolio investment entity” (“PIE”) regime on 22 April 2009, with a commencement date of 27 May 2009. 10 Under the Constitution, Rabo Capital may take all steps it considers necessary or desirable to ensure it continues to be eligible as a PIE and a PLC or otherwise to comply with the requirements of the Act relating to PIEs. These requirements include (but are not limited to): • refusing to register the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities; • treating the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities as void (ab initio or from such other date as Rabo Capital may decide in its complete discretion) (clause 3(i) (ii) of the PIE Conditions); • deeming any PIE Capital Securities held that would result in any holder (or where the holder is a nominee their beneficial owner) exceeding the maximum holding that an investor may hold in Rabo Capital in order for it to meet the PIE eligibility requirements in the Act, to be held by the holder of the PIE Capital Securities on trust for any member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and allowing such member full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities, including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clause 3(i) (ii) of the PIE Conditions); • allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to request any holder (or any person associated with that holder) of PIE Capital Securities to provide such information or evidence as it may require to determine whether Rabo Capital is eligible or continues to be eligible as a PIE and qualify as a PLC and, where holders do not provide such information within specified time periods, deeming that such holder’s 4 (or where the holder is a nominee, such beneficial owner’s) PIE Capital Securities are held on trust for a member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and such member of the Rabobank Group shall have full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clauses 3(i) (iii) and (iv) of the PIE Conditions); • allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to take any of the steps in clause 3(i) (v) of the PIE Conditions to ensure that any breach of the PIE regime “investor interest size” requirement is remedied within the period required by the Act. PIE Capital Securities 11 Rabo Capital offered PIE Capital Securities with a face value of $1 each to the public in New Zealand for $1 per security. The minimum holding amount is $5,000. The offer which opened on 27 April 2009 and closed on 22 May 2009, was available to retail and institutional investors. Rabobank Nederland subscribed $5,000 for 5,000 PIE Capital Securities. 12 On 25 May 2009 Rabo Capital accepted a total of $280 million in applications. 13 Rabo Capital has entered into a Listing Agreement with NZX for the PIE Capital Securities to be quoted on the NZDX (the debt security market operated by NZX). Although the PIE Capital Securities are not debt securities for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, NZX Regulation has given certain rulings and waivers from the NZDX Listing Rules in relation to the listing of the PIE Capital Securities on the NZDX. 14 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual non-cumulative non-voting preference shares of Rabo Capital and shall at all time rank pari passu and without any preference among themselves (clause 4(a) of the PIE Conditions). They are direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of Rabo Capital and are not guaranteed by Rabobank Nederland or any other person. 15 Dividends will be paid on the PIE Capital Securities quarterly in arrears on the “Initial Rate Dividend Payment Date”, with the first dividend payment date scheduled to occur on 18 June 2009 (clause 5(c) of the PIE Conditions). 16 The dividend amount is the amount of cash payable to holders of PIE Capital Securities on the relevant dividend payment date. The dividend amount for each dividend period from 18 June 2009 to 18 June 2019 is calculated as follows: face value x dividend rate x (1-t) 4 Where “t” is the weighted basic rate of New Zealand corporate income tax expressed as a percentage applicable to Rabo Capital (currently 30 percent) during the period ending on the relevant dividend payment date. The “dividend rate” used to calculate the dividend amount will be as follows: 5 (a) for the first 10 years, the initial rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the benchmark rate (the five-year swap rate), which will be reset after five years; and (b) thereafter, the floating rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the three-month bank bill rate, which is reset quarterly. 17 The Investment Statement contains the following statement, relating to dividends payable on the PIE Capital Securities (at page 6): Dividend: The PIE Capital Securities will pay a non-cumulative dividend. Dividend Amounts are scheduled to be paid quarterly on each 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 18 December. The Dividend Amount is the cash component of the dividend and is a proportion of the amount calculated using the Dividend Rate. Dividend Amounts payable on the PIE Capital Securities will be paid to the person registered as the Holder on the relevant Record Date (including in relation to the first Dividend Amount payable). Initial Dividend Rate: The initial Dividend Rate will be set for an initial period of approximately 5 years from the Issue Date to 18 June 2014 at the greater of: • the Minimum Initial Rate, which is 8% per annum; and • the Benchmark Rate on 25 May 2009 plus the Margin. Dividend Rate reset: The Dividend Rate will be reset for a further 5 years on 18 June 2014 at the prevailing Benchmark Rate plus the Margin. From 18 June 2019 the Dividend Rate will reset quarterly, at the 90 day bank bill rate plus the Margin. 18 On 25 May 2009 the dividend rate for the period until 18 June 2014, incorporating the margin (which has been set at 3.75 percent per annum) and the swap rate, was set at 8.7864 percent per annum. 19 Rabo Capital will attach imputation credits to distributions made to holders of PIE Capital Securities to the maximum extent permitted by the imputation credits available. The Investment Statement contains the following statement (at page 11): Imputation Credits The Issuer will attach imputation credits to Dividend Amounts to the extent permitted by the imputation credits that the directors of the Issuer determine are available. It is expected that dividends will have imputation credits fully attached to a Dividend Amount (30/70th of the Dividend Amount assuming a corporate tax rate of 30%). If the Issuer does not fully impute a Dividend Amount, this may trigger an Exchange Event and the PIE Capital Securities may, at the Issuer's option, exchange into the Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. Alternatively, the Issuer may, at its discretion, put in place an arrangement to reimburse Holders who are adversely affected by the dividends not being fully imputed. Underlying Securities 20 Rabo Capital will use the funds raised from the issue of PIE Capital Securities to invest in Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland on or about the issue date of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying 6 Securities are interest-bearing, unsecured, perpetual, non-cumulative subordinated bonds. The principal amount of the Underlying Securities will be equal to the subscription amount of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying Securities will have terms conforming substantially to the terms of the PIE Capital Securities. However, the Underlying Securities will be bonds paying interest rather than shares paying imputed dividends. The Underlying Securities will be the only material asset of Rabo Capital and at least 90 percent of the income Rabo Capital will derive will be interest from its investment in the Underlying Securities. 21 Rabobank Nederland will use the funds raised from the issue of Underlying Securities for its banking business. The funds are not being raised specifically for the purposes of Rabobank Nederland’s New Zealand branch (“NZ Branch”), although Rabobank Nederland may “on-lend” some of the funds raised to NZ Branch. 22 Interest received by Rabo Capital on the Underlying Securities will constitute assessable income for Rabo Capital. Termination of Arrangement 23 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual securities that have no scheduled repayment date, but the PIE Capital Securities will be redeemed in the following circumstances (among others). The circumstances are set out in clause 8 of the PIE Conditions and are: (a) if Rabo Capital exercises the option contained in clause 8(c) of the PIE Conditions and elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities on the “First Call Date” which is specified as being 18 June 2019 or on any dividend payment date thereafter; (b) if, as a result of a Netherlands tax law change, there is more than an insubstantial risk that additional amounts are payable under the Underlying Securities or interest payable on the Underlying Securities would not be deductible to Rabobank Nederland for Netherlands tax purposes and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (c) if the Dutch Central Bank notifies Rabo Capital that the PIE Capital Securities may not be included in consolidated Tier 1 Capital of the Rabobank Group and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (d) where the Underlying Securities are redeemed; or (e) on the occurrence of certain “Exchange Events” the PIE Capital Securities may be, at the option of Rabo Capital either cancelled and exchanged for Underlying Securities with a face value equal to the face value of the PIE Capital Securities or redeemed. The types of circumstances that would constitute an “Exchange Event” are described in the “Definitions” section of the PIE Conditions and summarised in the Investment Statement as follows (at page 12): Exchange Events On the occurrence of certain events (each an “Exchange Event”) the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, exchange into the Underlying 7 Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. The Exchange Events are: (a) if the Dutch Central Bank requires that all PIE Capital Securities must be issued directly by Rabobank Nederland; or (b) an Insolvency Event in relation to the Issuer or Rabobank Nederland; or (c) a default by the Issuer for more than 30 days in the payment of Dividend Amounts or Redemption Amounts (other than relating to an administrative error) in respect of any of the PIE Capital Securities; or (d) any of the following events that the Issuer determines in its absolute discretion is an Exchange Event; (i) an Increased Costs Event; or (ii) any Tax Law Change which has or is expected to have the effect that the anticipated tax outcomes for the Issuer or for Holders as at the Issue Date are adversely affected (as determined by the Issuer); or (iii) the Issuer does not impute a Dividend Amount at the maximum imputation ratio under the Tax Act and an arrangement is not in place, or in the Issuer's opinion is not expected to be in place, within 90 Business Days of the relevant Dividend Payment Date to fully reimburse Holders who are adversely affected; or (iv) the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department has indicated that it will not provide or renew a satisfactory binding ruling or rulings (as determined by the Issuer) confirming the anticipated tax implications of the transaction for the Issuer and the Holders. Upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event, Holders of the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, receive Underlying Securities in a principal amount equal to the Redemption Amount of each Holder's PIE Capital Securities at the relevant time or have their PIE Capital Securities redeemed. Prior to the distribution to Holders of the Underlying Securities or redemption, any Outstanding Amounts and any surplus amounts (after accounting for the Outstanding Amounts and the distribution of the Underlying Securities) held by the Issuer will be paid out pro rata to Holders. Administration Costs 24 It is expected that Rabo Capital will pay for ongoing costs and expenses related to the issue of PIE Capital Securities. If Rabo Capital has insufficient funds with which to pay these costs and expenses, Rabobank Nederland will reimburse Rabo Capital for the costs and expenses. Because of this arrangement, it is unlikely Rabo Capital will pay an administration fee to Rabobank Nederland, but in the event that any administration fee is paid in the future, such administration fee will not exceed an arm’s length amount. 25 The New Zealand branch of Rabobank Nederland (“NZ Branch”) will provide a liquidity facility to Rabo Capital pursuant to which Rabo Capital may request advances of up to NZ$10 million from NZ Branch. Any interest paid by Rabo Capital to NZ Branch pursuant to the liquidity facility will be on arm’s length terms or, if not on arm’s length terms, on terms that are in favour of Rabo Capital. It is expected that money from this funding facility will only be used to pay tax or other expenses of Rabo Capital if it has insufficient available funds before receiving income under the Underlying Securities. There is no intention on the part of the Board of Directors of Rabo Capital and/or the Supervisory Board of Rabobank 8 Nederland that Rabo Capital, Rabobank Nederland and/or NZ Branch would be paid any of the income that should otherwise be paid to the holders of PIE Capital Securities. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) This Product Ruling will cease to apply if the Binding Private Ruling (BR Prv 09/40) issued in respect of the Rabo Capital PIE regime Arrangement no longer applies or Rabo Capital ceases to be eligible to be a PIE and a PLC. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement as follows: • Distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to holders of PIE Capital Securities will constitute excluded income of a New Zealand tax resident holder who is a natural person or a trustee and who does not include the amount as income in their return of income for the income year, pursuant to section CX 56(3)(a). • Where section CX 56(3)(a) does not apply, distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to holders of the PIE Capital Securities will be excluded income of a holder to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is more than the amount of the distribution that is fully imputed (as described in section RF 9(2)) pursuant to section CX 56(3)(b)(i). • Section GB 35 does not apply to the Arrangement. • Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 27 May 2009 and ending on 30 June 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on 16th day of June 2009 Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings) 9
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 09/09 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Air New Zealand Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections CA 1(2), CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, CB 5, CE 1, CX 2(1), CX 2(2), EW 3, EW 5(21), and EW 31. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the accruing by a Member of the Air New Zealand Airpoints Programme of Airpoints Dollars provided by Air New Zealand as a result of expenditure incurred by the Member's employer on the Member's work related travel and the redemption of those Airpoints Dollars for air travel and other rewards ("Rewards"). The Arrangement does not include employees of Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries (as they are not entitled to accrue Airpoints Dollars in respect of work related travel). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Capitalised terms are defined in the Airpoints Members' Guide as provided to the Commissioner on 13 May 2009. 1. Air New Zealand operates a loyalty scheme known as the "Airpoints Programme", referred to in this Ruling as the Programme. Under the Programme, Airpoints Dollars accrue to Members by reference to the value of the fare paid and region of the world travelled, and Airpoints Dollars have a value identical to dollars on redemption for Rewards. Airpoints Dollars may also accrue to Members from expenditure incurred on goods and services sold by scheme partners ("Partners"), for example hotels and hire car companies. 2. Airpoints Dollars accruing to or accumulated by a Member can be used by them to purchase an equivalent dollar value of travel or to purchase other Air New Zealand products (such as Koru Club membership), or hotel accommodation, travel insurance, car hire and other rewards ("Rewards"). 3. The terms and conditions of the Programme are contained in the Airpoints Members' Guide provided to the Commissioner on 13 May 2009 ("Terms and Conditions"). Employees of Air New Zealand's commercial customers 4. Employees of Air New Zealand's commercial customers may accrue Airpoints Dollars on travel undertaken for work purposes and paid for by their employer. The employer may pay for this travel by paying Air New Zealand for the tickets that are issued to the employee, or by reimbursing the employee for payments made by them. Any such employees wishing to accrue Airpoints Dollars would first need to become an Airpoints Member. 5. Airpoints Dollars accrue to Members by virtue of a Member's individual membership. The employer may pay the $50 membership fee, by either reimbursing the employee or paying on the employee’s behalf. 6. Members' employers will not provide any consideration to Air New Zealand for Airpoints Dollars provided to those Members. Air New Zealand will not provide discounts (other than an ordinarily available discount for corporate customers provided for reasons unrelated to Airpoints Dollars) to corporate customers who request that Airpoints Dollars not be issued to their employees in respect of work related travel. 7. Employers have no influence over the Airpoints Dollars to be provided to Members (except to the extent that they purchase air travel). Airpoints Dollars will accrue to Members on the basis provided for in the Terms and Conditions, regardless of whether travel is undertaken for private purposes or for work related purposes and regardless of who pays for the travel. Airpoints Dollars accrue and are redeemed for Rewards on the same basis for any Member of the Programme, irrespective of the Member's employer. Airpoints Membership 8. Airpoints Membership is available to residents of all countries. 9. The Membership joining fee is a cost of NZ$50 for New Zealand residents and AU$50 for Australian Members. Residents of all other countries will be charged the local currency equivalent of NZ$50. This fee may not be paid for using Airpoints Dollars and must be paid for in cash. 10. Complimentary Membership is available to eligible first class and business class passengers who have paid for and travelled Business Premier class on Air New Zealand Operated Flights for international Sectors. Complimentary Membership is available to current fully paid-up members of Air New Zealand Koru Club. 11. Each Member may maintain only one Account. Membership is not transferable. 12. No individual Member's Account information or details will be discussed or amended or transacted unless the Member's correct Membership number along with their Personal Access Code is first quoted. 13. The Membership Card is used to assist in the earning of Airpoints Dollars and to obtain access to or the provision of Rewards. The Member agrees that his/her signing of a Card and/or quoting his/her Membership number to Air New Zealand or to any of its Partners, employees or agents for the purposes of the Airpoints Programme means that he/she has read and understood the Terms and Conditions of the Airpoints Programme and accepts them. 14. Air New Zealand reserves the right to cancel a Member's Membership in the Programme at any time without notice and without giving a reason for so doing. Air New Zealand will not provide any consideration for Airpoints Dollars earned but not redeemed at the time of termination of Membership. 15. Membership will terminate on the death of a Member. Airpoints Dollars or any other benefits earned but not redeemed at the time of death will be 2 cancelled with no consideration. Transfer of Airpoints Dollars on the death of a Member is permitted in the situation set out in clause 8.8.2 in accordance with clause 8.5 of the Terms and Conditions (see paragraphs 31 to 32 below). Earning Airpoints Dollars 16. Airpoints Dollars may be earned through expenditure on Air New Zealand and Partner Airline flights and on goods and services purchased from non- airline Partners (including car rental, hotel accommodation, GlobalPlus accounts and travel insurance). Transfer of credit card points/credits into Airpoints Dollars is available in some cases. Airpoints Dollars are provided by Air New Zealand regardless of whether the entitlement arises from the purchase of Air New Zealand or Partners' goods and services. Using Airpoints Dollars 17. Rewards may be paid for using Airpoints Dollars. One Airpoints Dollar has the equivalent value of $1 in relation to the number of Airpoints Dollars required to acquire Rewards. A combination of Airpoints Dollars and cash for the acquisition of a Reward is not permitted, unless otherwise specified in writing by Air New Zealand. 18. Airpoints Dollars may be used to obtain Reward flights with Air New Zealand and Partner Airlines. Any Reward ticket that is cancelled and is refundable will be refunded by a re-crediting of Airpoints Dollars. Taxes, levies, or surcharges cannot be paid for using Airpoints Dollars and must be paid for in cash. The only exception to this is where the published fare is inclusive of taxes, levies and/or surcharges, for example on Air New Zealand Operated Flights within New Zealand or where the published fare is inclusive of insurance and fuel charges. 19. Non-flight and non-airline Rewards are available, subject to the applicable Partner's terms and conditions where those Rewards are not provided by Air New Zealand. Rewards include Koru Club membership, car hire and hotel accommodation. GlobalPlus Credit Card customers may have the ability to redeem their Airpoints Dollars on a limited range of other non-airline products (such as holiday passes, wine and CD vouchers). Non-convertibility 20. Under the Terms and Conditions, Airpoints Dollars and Rewards cannot be redeemed, sold, assigned, gifted or otherwise transferred by a Member for cash or other consideration. The relevant clauses of the Terms and Conditions in this respect are as follows. 21. Clause 3.1.24 of the Terms and Conditions states: In accepting a Reward, you agree that (subject to these Terms and Conditions and in particular the Gifting provisions in clauses 4 below and 3.4.3.10 and 3.4.4.11) you won't combine any Rewards with anyone else or sell, assign or otherwise transfer the right to a Reward to anyone else. Air New Zealand has the right to ask you for proof that you have complied with this clause in addition to any evidence required in accordance with clause 12. 22. Clause 3.1.25 of the Terms and Conditions states: Rewards offered by Partners will be on the applicable Partner's terms. If you redeem a Reward in conjunction with any other loyalty programme (where such 3 programme has our consent to use Airpoints Dollars) you agree that you won't combine any Rewards with anyone else or sell, assign or otherwise transfer Rewards for Cash or anything else. Air New Zealand is not responsible for Reward offers by Partners or their conditions, or for the Partners' performance or provision of such Rewards. 23. Clause 4.1.8 of the Terms and Conditions states: You must not receive any Cash or other consideration as payment for any Rewards you gift. 24. Clause 9.7 of the Terms and Conditions states: Notwithstanding any other provision in these Terms and Conditions or the terms and conditions of any other loyalty programme offered by a Partner and/or authorised by Air New Zealand, you can't redeem for Cash or sell your Airpoints Dollars and/or Rewards or assign or transfer them for Cash or any other consideration. 25. Clause 15.5 of the Terms and Conditions states: Airpoints Dollars may not be used to acquire any goods or services other than in conjunction with: • the Air New Zealand Airpoints Programme in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. • any other loyalty programme, that we have given written consent to use Airpoints Dollars and in accordance with such loyalty programme's terms and conditions. 26. Clause 15.6 of the Terms and Conditions states: Airpoints Dollars are not convertible into Cash. Any Rewards offered by Partners or any use of Airpoints Dollars in conjunction either with the Programme or with any other loyalty programme that we have authorised the use of Airpoints Dollars in conjunction with, are subject to the restriction that you can't sell, assign or transfer any Rewards or Airpoints Dollars for Cash or any other consideration. 27. If a Member cancels a refundable Ticket, then in accordance with clause 3.1.16 the refund will be a re-credit of the Airpoints Dollars to the Member's Account. Airpoints Dollars may also be re-credited if an Upgrade for which Airpoints Dollars were redeemed is not available. Gifting 28. Gifting is the process whereby a Member authorises the deduction of Airpoints Dollars from his/her account where such Airpoints Dollars are redeemed to provide a person resident in the same Household as the Member with a Ticket for Reward Travel or for Non-Airline Rewards. Companion Tickets may not be Gifted. 29. Gold, Gold Elite Members (Members who have accrued a specified number of Airpoints Dollars from qualifying flights) or GlobalPlus Platinum cardholders are additionally entitled to nominate as giftees two individual persons who do not need to reside in the same Household as the Gold Elite Member. 30. Air New Zealand will monitor each Member's Gifting Register to ensure that no fraudulent activities occur. 4 Transfer of Airpoints Dollars 31. Clause 8.5 provides for the transfer for Airpoints Dollars in accordance with clauses 1.4.5.1 and 11.4.1. Clause 1.4.5.1 provides as follows: 1.4.5.1 Transfer of credit cards points/credit transfers to Airpoints Dollars are only available in certain countries – and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and those of the relevant credit card issuer. Please contact your credit card issuer for full details including details on membership eligibility and transfer fees. 32. Clause 11.4.1.1 provides that Airpoints Dollars may be transferred between parties in accordance with clauses 11.4.1.2 and 11.4.1.3, which provide as follows: 11.4.1.2 If the Nominated Earner of a joint Global Plus branded credit card (including a joint GlobalPlus Business Card) or, a joint GlobalPlus Home Loan account or a joint BNZ Credit Card dies, 100% of the Airpoints Dollars accrued from that person’s joint account, and that have not yet been redeemed, may be transferred from the Nominated Earner’s Airpoints Account to the other joint account holder’s Airpoints Account, once the BNZ has provided verification to us of the Member’s death and type of bank account. 11.2.1.3 In the case of either separation or divorce, 50% of the Airpoints Dollars accrued from a joint GlobalPlus branded credit card (including a joint GlobalPlus Business Card) or, a joint GlobalPlus Home Loan account or a joint BNZ credit card, and which have not yet been redeemed, may be transferred from one joint account holder’s Member’s Account – as long as both Members ask for the transaction. The Membership details and PAC numbers for both Members must be sent to the Air New Zealand Contract Centre with supporting documentation from the solicitor of the Member from whose Account the Airpoints Dollars will be transferred. Once the Air New Zealand Contact Centre has received and verified the documentation, the relevant Airpoints Dollars that have not already been redeemed for Rewards will be equally divided and distributed into the relevant Member’ Accounts.

Air New Zealand will not provide any consideration for Airpoints Dollars earned but not redeemed at the time of termination of the Programme. Access to other benefits 38. Under no circumstances are the Terms and Conditions interchangeable with those of the Air New Zealand Koru Club or any other club or loyalty programme operated by Air New Zealand or any of its Partners. Membership of the Programme does not give access to the benefits of any other Air New Zealand club, facility or loyalty programme unless so stated in the conditions of membership of such other club, facility or loyalty programme. Changes to the Programme 39. The Terms and Conditions may be amended at any time, pursuant to clause 9.1 of the Terms and Conditions. Ruling not applicable to other loyalty programmes 40. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax treatment of any other loyalty programme to which, in accordance with clauses 15.5 and 15.6 of the Terms and Conditions, Air New Zealand has given written consent to use Airpoints Dollars in accordance with the terms and conditions of that other loyalty programme. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) Under no circumstances will the Terms and Conditions allow Airpoints Dollars or Rewards (including any goods or services received from redeeming Rewards such as vouchers) to be redeemed for cash or sold, assigned or transferred by a Member for cash or other consideration. b) In any circumstance where a Reward is cancelled or unavailable or where for any other reason the Member is entitled to a refund of Airpoints Dollars, the refund is by way of re-crediting to the Member's Account the Airpoints Dollars redeemed by the Member for that Reward. c) Employees of Air New Zealand and its subsidiaries cannot accrue Airpoints for work related travel. d) Membership of the Programme is a contract between a Member and Air New 6 Zealand.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 09/10 This product ruling is made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“the College”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CW 36. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of the Payments (which are made monthly) by the College to the Registrars, for the Registrars’ participation in Stage One of the General Practice Education Programme (“the Course”), on terms and conditions that are materially the same as those contained in the following three documents (received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit on 18 June 2009):  Letter of Appointment of Registrar, dated 15 August 2008: the letter supplied to the Registrar, by the College, as an agreement of the respective obligations of each party.  Stage 1: General Practice Education Programme Stage One Handbook 2009: the detailed handbook of the aims, structure and syllabus of the Course.  Stage 1: General Practice Education Programme Stage One Terms and Conditions 2009: the terms and conditions to be agreed between the College and all Registrars enrolled in the General Practice Education Programme, Stage One. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The College was formed in 1974, and obtained a Royal Charter in 1979. The mission of the College is to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the provision of high-quality general practice care. 2. The main purpose of the College is to provide postgraduate general practice education to qualified doctors. 3. The objects and powers of the College (as set out in clause 5.1 of the July 2008 document entitled “The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners: Rules”) are to: (a) promote in all ways the highest standards in general practice in New Zealand; (b) sustain and improve the professional competence of members of the medical profession who are engaged in general practice in New Zealand; (c) encourage, strengthen and engage in vocational training for general practice; (d) conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for continuing education of general practitioners; (e) encourage and assist in the provision of a high standard of teaching and training for all undergraduate medical students in the field of general practice in New Zealand; (f) promote activities that encourage the care of members and their families; (g) encourage and provide for the training of future teachers of general practice; (h) inform the public in New Zealand about general practice and primary health care issues; (i) conduct, direct, encourage, support or provide for research in matters relating to general practice; (j) publish and encourage publication of journals, reports and treatises on matters relating to general practice and allied subjects; (k) grant diplomas and other certification of proficiency in general practice or any related subject, whether upon examination, thesis, outstanding work or upon other grounds which may be considered sufficient; (l) establish a register of members of the College and to publish and revise the same from time to time; (m) acquire, establish, provide and maintain such land and buildings as are deemed necessary and to deal with or dispose of the same with a view to promoting the objects of the College; (n) acquire and receive property of any kind whether by way of gift, devise, bequest or otherwise howsoever to be applied solely towards the objects of the College provided that no portion thereof shall be paid or transferred directly or indirectly by way of profit to members of the College, but this shall not prevent a member being reimbursed for professional services; (o) apply annual dues received from members to defray the expenses of the College, and for such other objects as may be deemed proper by the Council; and (p) undertake all such other lawful acts and things as are incidental or conducive to the attainment of the foregoing objects. 4. The College runs the General Practice Education Programme (“the GPEP”) created from the objectives of the College and based on its commitment to maintaining and supporting standards of excellence among general practitioner s. It is viewed as a significant part of a comprehensive cycle of 2 vocational and professional education provided by the College, and leads to a Fellow of the Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“FRNZCGP”) qualification. 5. The Course is a 42-week practice-based training course established by the College as Stage One of its GPEP. The 42 weeks are divided into two attachments of 21 weeks. The Course is placed at “year nine” of a doctor’s standard educational path to gaining the FRNZCGP qualification. The GPEP is regarded as encompassing years nine to eleven of this “path”. 6. It is stated by the College (at page 10 of the Stage 1: GPEP 2009 Handbook) that the general aims of the Course are to:  improve the health of New Zealanders through the provision of a GPEP which achieves a level of competence sufficient to maintain independent general practice;  promote high standards of general practice in New Zealand by ensuring those entering general practice are vocationally trained;  ensure Registrars understand the principles of general practice and develop the skills required for continuing professional development and lifelong learning;  develop and foster a group of general practice teachers and teaching practices which play a full part in the education of doctors for general practice; and  foster an understanding of general practice within the medical profession and primary care purchasers. 7. The Course involves various aspects of training that a Registrar is to complete. Essentially, a Registrar is assigned to a “teaching practice”. Each teaching practice is a general practice medical centre for which the College has contracted with a general practitioner to be the Registrar’s teacher. The general practitioner teacher (“the Teacher”) holds vocational registration and is paid by the College under a separate contract. 8. The standard week for a Registrar under the Course is broken up as follows:  Eight half-days per week attendance at the teaching practice to which they are assigned, consisting of: - Patient contact. The conditions in respect of this are that a Registrar is to participate in between 5 and 13 patient consultations per half day. In the early weeks of the attachment, to relieve possible pressure on a Registrar, each consultation is to be for a generous period of 20–30 minutes. - The Registrar having at least 1 hour and 30 minutes of direct contact teaching time with the Teacher per week, to include discussion, observation, review and feedback.  T he equivalent of 36 full days in total for attending seminars and workshop s that are provided and organised by the College. Registrars are required to “satisfactorily” attend and participate in 3 these seminars and workshops, and are responsible for organising/presenting part of the programme within these seminars and workshops. 9. The Payments a Registrar receives from the College are allocated from the funding the College receives from the Clinical Training Agency (“the CTA”). There are no restrictions on Registrars in relation to earning income from other sources. The total dollar value of the Payments is as follows (Registrars being paid monthly amounts during the period of the Course, the aggregate of which equals that total amount): Level For the 42-week course Annualised (before tax) 1 $42,679 $52,841 2 $45,303 $56,089 10. Part-time Registrars receive 7/10 pro rata Payments, which are paid over the 12 months of their attachment (or according to some other arrangement as negotiated with the Group Manager, Education). The total dollar value of pro rata Payments is as follows: Level 52 weeks 1 $36,988 2 $50,900 11. Whether the Payments are set at the first or second level is dependent on the level of prior medical experience of a Registrar. However, these amounts are set at a level to provide for the maintenance of the Registrars’ standard of living while undertaking the Course. The Payments are at a level lower than that which a doctor with similar experience in appropriate employment would earn during the period of the Course. 12. A doctor who wishes to attend the Course as a Registrar applies to the College at the appropriate time. From the total number of applicants, the College undertakes a selection process to accept only the number of Registrars for which it has funding. 13. Registrars are selected on merit-based criteria, the College taking the perspective of selecting Registrars who will benefit the community in the long term. These criteria include:  the intention to enter general practice;  experience in various areas of medicine;  a demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing priority health areas;  a demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing rural health issues; and  a demonstrated commitment to general practice addressing Maori health issues. 14. The College initiates an agreement with each individual doctor before the doctor becomes a Registrar in the Course. 4 15. The obligations of Registrars are contained in the GPEP Stage One Terms and Conditions 2009, which include (among others) that the Registrar:  satisfactorily attends, and fully participates in, 80 percent of the seminars and workshops, including the communications skills workshop;  completes the “attachment” to teaching practices, and the assessments thereon;  be involved in patient contact, by having 5 to 13 consultations with patients per half day;  undertakes review sessions with the attachment Teacher each day; and  contributes a vignette (a written case study on a specified topic) to the Programme. 16. In exchange for undertaking the above, the Registrars receive from the College the Payments. 17. The College Education Advisory Committee is responsible for setting the educational philosophy and mission statement for its GPEP. 18. With regard to the Course content, the College has developed a curriculum for general practice training in consultation with College Members and Fellows, and with the CTA to ensure that government health priority areas are reflected in the educational programmes. 19. The College determines, in consultation with its Registrars, the methods of delivery for its programme for Stage One. The content of seminars and workshops is based on the syllabus for the Course and the specific learning needs of Registrars. The College also determines the structure of the programme. Materials for the programme are provided by the College and purchased from funding provided by the CTA. Seminars and workshops are held on premises hired by the College for that purpose. 20. Each Registrar’s activities while undertaking the Course reflect the agreement reached between the Registrar and their Teacher as to how the Course syllabus will, in their view, be best achieved for that Registrar. Each Registrar’s activities are therefore designed to enable them to implement their agreed learning programme. A Registrar’s performance of these activities may assist the operation of their Teacher’s practice, but the activities are not designed to achieve this. 21. The Course is designed to teach Registrars to translate prior learning to a community-based, primary health team context, as well as to teach them new skills in relation to (among other things) the clinical, communication and professional needs of general practice. 22. The College is responsible for setting the Primex examination (sat at the end of the Course) and, in doing so, sets the standards for entry into Stage II and ultimately for vocational registration. The College also determines the structure and timing of the teaching programme. Furthermor e, the College determines the outputs of Registrars in terms of 5 6 assignments, research projects, presentations and other learning activities. 23. The College selects Teachers to the programme who meet several specific criteria. These include: holding vocational registration with the Medical Council, being a Fellow of the College, and being assessed by the College as being competent and able to provide excellent education to a Registrar. The Teachers are contracted by the College to provide teaching services within the calendar year of the programme. All Teachers must undertake ongoing professional development activities while they remain a Teacher. 24. Medical educators (contracted by the College) are responsible for maintaining contact with the Teachers during the programme and resolving any difficulties that may arise. They do so primarily through meetings and practice visits with Teachers. The medical educators are kept informed by Teachers on the progress of Registrars. 25. The College devotes the majority of its resources (staff, funding and other assets) to the administration and running of the GPEP and the continuing education of doctors in general practice. More than 50 percent of the College’s resources are attributed to the GPEP. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The Payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are not grants made under regulations made under section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for that section. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows:  The Payments made to the Registrars under the Arrangement are exempt income under section CW 36. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 January 2010 and ending on 31 March 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6 th day of November 2009.

PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 09/11 This product ruling is made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by The Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners (“the College”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CW 36. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of the Payments (which are made monthly) by the College to the Trainees, for the Trainees’ participation in the Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme (“the Rural Course”), on terms and conditions that are materially the same as those contained in the following three documents (received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit on 18 June 2009):  Letter of Appointment of Trainee, dated 7 January 2009: the letter supplied to the Trainee, by the College, as an agreement of the respective obligations of each party.  Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme Handbook: Revised August 2006: the detailed handbook of the aims, structure and syllabus of the Rural Course.  Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme Terms and Conditions: Revised August 2006: the terms and conditions to be agreed between the College and all Trainees enrolled in the Rural Course. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The College was formed in 1974, and obtained a Royal Charter in 1979. The mission of the College is to improve the health of all New Zealanders through the provision of high-quality general practice care. 2. The main purpose of the College is to provide postgraduate general practice education to qualified doctors. 3.

The College runs the Postgraduate Rural General Practice Education Programme (“the Rural Course”) created from the objectives of the College and based on its commitment to maintaining and supporting standards of excellence among general practitioners. It is viewed as a significant part of a comprehensive cycle of vocational and professional education provided by the College. 5. The Rural Course is a 13 week practice-based training course established by the College, although the length of the course may sometimes be conducted over a period of 12 weeks or 14 weeks. The Rural Course is one part of the house surgeon’s training programme, and is the first part of the general practice education pathway. 6. It is stated by the College (at page 9 of the Course Handbook: Revised August 2006) that the general aims of the Rural Course are to enable the Trainees to:  experience and participate in rural general practice in a supportive rural general practice environment;  acquire medical knowledge and expertise in a rural general practice context;  enhance their interpersonal and communication skills, particularly in relation to patient consultations;  develop an understanding of the general practitioner/hospital interface and the interface between health professionals in the rural sector;  gain an understanding of the relevant cultural context including Maori and rural culture;  develop collegial and peer associations and linkages; and  develop an understanding of the pathway to a career in general practice. 7. The Rural Course involves various aspects of training that a Trainee is to complete. Essentially, a Trainee is assigned to a “teaching practice” for 3 months. Each teaching practice, which must rank 35 or more on the Ministry of Health’s “rural ranking scale”, is a general practice medical centre for which the College has contracted with a general practitioner to be the Trainee’s teacher. The general practitioner teacher (“the Teacher”) holds vocational registration and is paid by the College under a separate contract. 3 8. The Rural Course involves Trainees entering a planned and managed learning environment achieved through the interactions between the Trainee, the Teacher and patients, as well as interactions with other health professionals in the local area, and it includes support and guidance to ensure that learning occurs, and that a representative experience is obtained. 9. Trainees are formatively assessed during the Rural Course, and they receive a final assessment from the Teacher. This assessment is available to the resident medical officer coordinator as part of the Trainee’s house surgeon training. Trainees completing the programme receive a certificate of completion of this part of their overall training. 10. The standard week for a Trainee undertaking the Rural Course consists almost entirely of patient contact within the teaching practice to which they are assigned. Trainees can also expect to have, on average, two hours each week of “protected teaching time” with the Teacher, sitting in on consultations, and group seminars. In addition to this, Trainees are required to complete a minimum of three “out of hours” supervised sessions. Given that Trainees are geographically distributed throughout New Zealand they attend teleconference (rather than face-to-face) seminars. 11. The Payments a Trainee receives from the College are allocated from the funding the College receives from the Clinical Training Agency (“the CTA”). The CTA has the mandate to purchase educational programmes that will ensure an adequate and stable future workforce. The CTA funds activities based on requirements in respect of the future workforce, and it is expressly prohibited from funding based on current service needs. The CTA undergoes extensive health sector consultation to ensure that all the programmes it funds (including the Rural Course) meet identified training needs. 12. The dollar value of the Payments is $12,500, being paid monthly during the period of the Rural Course (and representing an annualised payment of approximately $50,000). This amount is set at a level to provide for the maintenance of the Trainees’ standard of living while undertaking the Rural Course. The Payments are at a level lower than that which a doctor with similar experience in appropriate employment would earn during the period of the Rural Course. 13. A doctor who wishes to attend the Rural Course as a Trainee applies to the College at the appropriate time. From the total number of applicants, the College undertakes a selection process to accept only the number of Trainees for which it has funding. 14. Trainees are selected on merit-based criteria, the College taking the perspective of selecting Trainees who will benefit the community in the long term. These criteria include whether the applicant has:  a firm intention to enter general practice and continue general practice vocational education; and  completed hospital runs relevant to general practice. 4 15. The College initiates an agreement with each individual doctor before the doctor becomes a Trainee in the Rural Course. 16. The obligations of Trainees are contained in the Course Terms and Conditions: Revised August 2006. In exchange for undertaking this, Trainees receive from the College the Payments. 17. The College Education Advisory Committee is responsible for setting the educational philosophy and mission statement for the Rural Course. 18. With regard to the Rural Course content, the College has developed a curriculum for general practice training in consultation with College Members and Fellows, and with the CTA to ensure that government health priority areas are reflected in the educational programmes. 19. The College determines, in consultation with its Trainees, the methods of delivery for its programme. The College also determines the structure of the programme. Materials for the programme are provided by the College and purchased from funding provided by the CTA. 20. Each Trainee’s activities while undertaking the Rural Course reflect the agreement reached between the Trainee and their Teacher as to how the Rural Course syllabus will, in their view, be best achieved for that Trainee. Each Trainee’s activities are therefore designed to enable them to implement their agreed learning programme. A Trainee’s performance of these activities may assist the operation of their Teacher’s practice, but the activities are not designed to achieve this. As Trainees are unable to work independently without the presence of a supervisor, they are not in the position of providing services. 21. The College selects Teachers to the programme who meet several specific criteria. These include: holding general registration with the Medical Council, being a Fellow of the College, and being assessed by the College as being competent and able to provide excellent education to a Trainee. The Teachers are contracted by the College to provide teaching services within the calendar year of the programme. All Teachers must undertake ongoing professional development activities while they remain a Teacher. 22. Medical educators (contracted by the College) are responsible for maintaining contact with the Teachers during the programme and resolving any difficulties that may arise. They do so primarily through meetings, phone calls, emails and practice visits with Teachers. The medical educators are kept informed by Teachers on the progress of Trainees. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The Payments made to the Trainees under the Arrangement are not grants made under regulations made under section 303 of the Education Act 1989, or any enactment in substitution for that section. 5 6 How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows:  The Payments made to the Trainees under the Arrangement are exempt income under section CW 36. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 January 2010 and ending on 31 March 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6 th day of November 2009.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 09/12 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BNZ Income Securities 2 Limited (“BNZIS 2”). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, CX 56(3), GA 1 and GB 35. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement involved the raising of capital by Bank of New Zealand Limited (“BNZ”) and its parent company National Australia Bank Limited (“NAB”). BNZIS 2 issued perpetual non-cumulative shares (“BNZIS 2 Shares”) to members of the public (“BNZIS 2 Shareholders”). BNZIS 2 lent the proceeds raised from the issue to BNZ Income Management Limited (“BNZIM”) under the BNZIM Loan Agreement. BNZIM invested the proceeds of that Loan (“BNZIM Loan”) in perpetual preference shares issued by BNZ (“2009 BNZ PPS”) and, in turn, the BNZ used the proceeds for general corporate purposes. There was, at the time the Arrangement was entered into, and is no intention on the part of the Board of Directors of the BNZ and/or NAB that BNZ and/or NAB would promote the acquisition of BNZIS 2 Shares by providing investors with a loan or other financing from any of the companies in the BNZ or NAB Consolidated Group (“NAB Group”). This Ruling does not apply to any investor who, or which, has funded the acquisition of BNZIS 2 Shares by means of borrowing or other financing from any of the companies in the BNZ or NAB Group of companies, where such borrowing or other financing was part of an express agreement or arrangement (whether in writing or otherwise) with such entity that the proceeds of some or all of such borrowing or other financing would be used for the purposes of acquiring BNZIS 2 Shares.

BNZIS 2 was incorporated with 100 ordinary shares of $1 each, all of which are held by NEL. NEL is a 100 percent subsidiary of NAB and is incorporated and tax resident in Australia. BNZIS 2 subsequently issued a further 6,800,000 ordinary shares to NEL. On 29 September 2009 a further tranche of 135,431 $1 ordinary shares was issued to NEL to cover additional establishment costs in excess of the initial ordinary share issues. 7. The ordinary shares carry all of the voting rights in BNZIS 2 but carry no right to a distribution in any circumstances. 8. Under the relevant accounting standards, BNZIS 2 is a member of the NAB Group. BNZIS 2 Constitution 9. BNZIS 2 has no power to carry on any business or activity other than that described in the BNZIS 2 Constitution, which was lodged with the Companies Office on 14 May 2009. 10. Clause 4.1 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution states: 3 Limitation on Business: The only business or activity which the Company may carry on is to: (a) issue and maintain in existence perpetual non-cumulative shares, including listing (and maintaining a listing of) those shares on any stock or securities exchange in New Zealand or elsewhere; (b) advance the proceeds of perpetual non-cumulative shares to BNZIM, or a Related Company of that company pursuant to one or more loan agreements; (c) enter into the Administration Agreement, the Committed Cash Advance Facility Agreement, the Security Trust Deed, the Loan Agreement, the Registration Agreement and the Deed Poll (and any other administration agreements, committed cash advance facility agreements, security trust deeds, loan agreements, registration agreements and/or deed polls in connection with the issue of perpetual non-cumulative shares); (d) do all other things reasonably incidental to the activities referred to in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and this Constitution. The Company has no power to: (e) carry on any other business or activity; or (f) apply amounts received by way of interest on, or repayment of, the loans referred to in paragraph (b) for any purpose other than in payments to the holders of the perpetual non-cumulative shares, meeting costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and maintenance in existence of perpetual non-cumulative shares and making income and other tax payments to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department. 11. BNZIS 2 elected to be a “portfolio listed company” (“PLC”) under the “portfolio investment entity” (“PIE”) regime (as those terms are defined in section YA 1) with a commencement date of 26 June 2009. 12. To ensure compliance with the PIE regime, the BNZIS 2 Constitution contains certain restrictions on the percentage of the BNZIS 2 Shares that can be held by a person and their associates. Under the BNZIS 2 Constitution, the directors of BNZIS 2 may take the following steps if these restrictions are breached (or would be breached were a transfer permitted to be effected). These steps include:  rejecting applications for, or transfers of, BNZIS 2 Shares (clauses 6.16 and 6.17 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution);  treating the transfer of any BNZIS 2 Shares as void (ab initio or from such other date as BNZIS 2 may decide in its complete discretion) (clause 6.17 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution);  deeming any BNZIS 2 Shares held that exceed the “investor interest size” requirements specified in the Act to be held by the BNZIS 2 Shareholder on trust for any company in the NAB Group appointed by BNZIS 2, and allowing such shares to be sold by that company (clause 6.17 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution);  allowing BNZIS 2 to request any BNZIS 2 Shareholder to provide such information as it may require to determine whether BNZIS 2 continues to meet the PLC requirements set out in the Act and, where holders do not provide such information within relevant time periods, providing that the relevant BNZIS 2 Shares are held on trust by the holder thereof for any company in the NAB Group appointed by BNZIS 2 and allowing such shares to be sold by that company (clause 6.17 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution). 4  taking any of the steps in clause 6.18 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution to ensure any breach of the “investor interest size” requirement is remedied within the period specified in the Act. 13 The BNZIS 2 Constitution was amended from the version provided to Inland Revenue (refer paragraph 2 above) effective from 29 October 2009, so that in accordance with market practice the Record Date for payment of dividends to BNZIS 2 Shareholders is 10 days, rather than 10 business days, before Dividend Payment Date. The revised definition of “Record Date” in the BNZIS 2 Constitution is as follows: "Record Date" means 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 18 December of each calendar year, or if that date is not a Business Day, the preceding Business Day, or such other date as the Directors may determine in respect of any Dividend; BNZIS 2 Shares 14. BNZIS 2 offered BNZIS 2 Shares with an issue price of $1 each to members of the public in New Zealand under the Prospectus referred to at paragraph 3 above. The minimum holding amount was $5,000. The offer – which opened on 26 May 2009 and closed on 23 June 2009 was available to both retail and institutional investors. In total 260,000,000 BNZIS 2 Shares were issued under the offer, for a total subscription price of $260,000,000. Of these shares, 5,000 (the minimum parcel) have been subscribed for and are held by NEL. 15. The issue date of the BNZIS 2 Shares was 26 June 2009, and the date of initial quotation and trading on the debt securities market (the “NZDX”) operated by the NZX was 1 July 2009. Although the BNZIS 2 Shares are not debt securities for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, the NZX has given certain rulings on, and waivers of, the Listing Rules in relation to the listing of the BNZIS 2 Shares on the NZDX. The BNZIS 2 Shares are freely transferable, subject to certain ownership limitations. 16. The BNZIS 2 Shares are perpetual, non-cumulative shares and have no fixed term, although the commercial expectation is that the funding raised by means of the issue of the BNZIS 2 Shares will be in place for an initial five-year period, with extensions of further five-year periods, if desired. This is subject to potential exercise of the call option (“Call”) referred to in paragraph 46 below. The BNZIS 2 Shares are not redeemable at the option of BNZIS 2 or the BNZIS 2 Shareholders, and in no circumstances will there be any conversion of the BNZIS 2 Shares to ordinary shares. 17. The BNZIS 2 Shares are non-voting shares, other than in respect of amendments that relate to the rights, privileges, limitations and conditions attaching to them, meetings convened in relation to BNZIS 2’s liquidation in certain circumstances and certain proceedings under the Security Trust Deed and the BNZIS 2 Deed Poll (clause 6.22 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution). 18. Under the terms of the BNZIS 2 Shares as set out in clause 6 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution, the BNZIS 2 Shares give BNZIS 2 Shareholders the right to a quarterly dividend, with the Dividend Amount (as defined in clause 6.1 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution) payable on each BNZIS 2 Share, for the first five years being calculated in accordance with the following formulae: 5 (a) in respect of the first dividend period: Issue Price x Dividend Rate x 365 X x (1-t) (b) in respect of a dividend period other than the first dividend period: Issue Price x Dividend Rate x (1-t) 4 Where: The issue price is $1.00; "Dividend Rate" is the aggregate of the five-year swap rate (adjusted as necessary, to a quarterly rate) and the Margin (being 4.09 percent); "t" is (in each case) the weighted average basic rate of New Zealand income tax applicable to BNZIS 2 during the period ending on the relevant Dividend Payment Date; and "X" is the number of days from (and including) the Issue Date to (but excluding) 28 September 2009. 19. At the expiry of the first five-year period, there will be a further five-year rate set by reference to the five-year swap rate two business days prior to that expiry date (but with no change to the Margin of 4.09 percent). The same process will apply at the end of the second and each subsequent five-year period. 20. On a liquidation of BNZIS 2, the BNZIS 2 Shares give the right to a pro rata share of any surplus after liquidation of BNZIS 2’s assets and payment of its debts, in priority and to the exclusion of, the holders of other classes of shares of BNZIS 2 (including any ordinary shares) other than shares expressed to rank equally in a liquidation of BNZIS 2 (under clause 6.8 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution). 21. The Prospectus stated (at page 8): Use of Proceeds ... Interest payable by BNZIM to BNZIS 2 on the Loan will be the source of cash for BNZIS 2 to pay Dividends to investors. The primary sources of cash for BNZIM to pay interest on the Loan to BNZIS 2 are dividends from BNZ on the 2009 BNZ PPS and other payments received from BNZ (including interest payments on its cash balances with BNZ and tax loss offset payments it receives from BNZ). ... How will Dividends be funded? Cash to pay Dividends on the Shares will be derived by BNZIS 2 from interest it receives on its Loan to BNZIM. The most likely reasons for the directors of BNZIS 2 not declaring a Dividend would be the failure of BNZ to make a distribution or other payment to BNZIM (meaning that BNZIM will have insufficient income to enable it to pay interest on its Loan from BNZIS 2), or a deterioration in the financial condition of the NAB Group, which might lead to the application of a payment condition or to the regulator of Australian banks, APRA, prohibiting the payment of dividends by the NAB Group. 6 22. Payment of dividends on the BNZIS 2 Shares will not occur if a Dividend Payment Condition occurs. Clause 6.5 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution defines Dividend Payment Condition as any of the following conditions: (a) the Directors in their sole discretion do not resolve to pay the Dividend on the relevant Dividend Payment Date; (b) without limiting section 52(1) of the \[Companies\] Act \[1993\], the Directors are not satisfied on reasonable grounds that the Company will satisfy the solvency test (as defined in section 4 of the \[Companies\] Act \[1993\]) immediately after the payment of the Dividend; (c) unless APRA otherwise agrees: (i) after payment of the Dividend (which for the purposes of this calculation includes both the Dividend Amount in respect of the relevant Dividend and an amount equal to the Imputation Credits to be attached to the Dividend, on the basis that the Dividend is Fully-Credited), the APRA Prudential Capital Ratio or the APRA Tier 1 Capital Ratio of the NAB Group (on an APRA Level 2 or, if applicable, APRA Level 3 basis) would cease to comply with APRA’s then current capital adequacy guidelines, as they are applied to the NAB Group at the time; or (ii) the amount of the Dividend (which for the purposes of this calculation includes both the Dividend Amount in respect of the relevant Dividend and an amount equal to the Imputation Credits to be attached to the Dividend, on the basis that the Dividend is Fully-Credited) would exceed the Distributable Profits of the NAB Group as at the relevant Dividend Payment Date; or (d) APRA otherwise objects to the payment of the Dividend by the Company. 23. Dividends paid on the BNZIS 2 Shares will not be cumulative, and holders of the BNZIS 2 Shares have no right to put BNZIS 2 into liquidation for their non-payment (clause 6.6 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution). 24. Many of the above features of the BNZIS 2 Shares are required to ensure that the BNZIS 2 Shares are treated by APRA as innovative residual tier 1 capital for the NAB Group on a level 2 basis. 25. The BNZIS 2 Constitution provides that all dividends shall be fully credited. Relevant provisions from the Constitution are as follows: 6.1 Definitions ... “Fully-Credited” means, in relation to a Dividend, that Imputation Credits are validly attached to the Dividend, so that the imputation ratio of the Dividend is the maximum imputation ratio permitted by law. 6.3 Dividend to be Fully-Credited: All Dividend Amounts shall be Fully- Credited. 26. BNZIS 2 is party to the BNZIS 2 Deed Poll in favour of the holders of the BNZIS 2 Shares. Under the BNZIS 2 Deed Poll, BNZIS 2 covenants that, if it fails to fully impute dividends paid to the holders, it will compensate the holders for the additional tax cost incurred by the holders as a result of that failure. Clause 2 of the BNZIS 2 Deed Poll states: COVENANT TO PAY BNZIS 2 irrevocably covenants and agrees in favour of each Holder that, if BNZIS 2 fails to attach sufficient Imputation Credits to any Dividend it pays on a Dividend Payment Date so that the Dividend is Fully-Credited, then, subject to clause 3, it will pay to each Holder, within 10 Business Days of its receipt of the Holder’s certificate, the amount that the Holder certifies in writing is necessary to 7 compensate the Holder, on an after tax basis, for any additional tax cost the Holder suffers or incurs (or will suffer or incur) as a result of that failure, other than tax withheld by the Holder from a payment to another person. BNZIM Loan Details of the BNZIM Loan 27. The proceeds of the issue of the BNZIS 2 Shares were used by BNZIS 2 to make the BNZIM Loan to BNZIM. BNZIM is a company incorporated in New Zealand on 11 February 2008. BNZIM is expected to be resident for tax purposes in New Zealand. All of the shares in BNZIM are held by NAGNZ, also a company incorporated and tax resident in New Zealand. NAGNZ is the immediate holding company of BNZ and holds all of the ordinary shares issued in BNZ. 28. The BNZIM Loan is a perpetual loan (ie, it has no fixed maturity date). The principal amount of the BNZIM Loan is equal to the subscription amount for the BNZIS 2 Shares (being $260 million). The BNZIM Loan is the only material asset of BNZIS 2, and at least 90 percent of the income BNZIS 2 derives will be interest from the BNZIM Loan. 29. Clause 4 of the Loan Agreement provides that interest is payable on the BNZIM Loan at the Interest Rate in equal quarterly instalments on each Interest Payment Date (being 28 March, 28 June, 28 September and 28 December in each calendar year) with the first Interest Payment Date being 28 September 2009. The Interest Amount is calculated in accordance with the following formulae as defined in clause 1.1 of the Loan Agreement: (i) in respect of the first Interest Period: Loan x Interest Rate x 365 X (ii) in respect of an Interest Period other than the first Interest Period Loan x Interest rate 4 Where: “Loan” means the principal amount advanced to BNZIM by BNZIS 2 on the Advance Date; “Interest Rate” is (in each case): (a) in respect of the period from (and including) the Advance Date to (but excluding) the first Rate Start Date, the aggregate of the Benchmark Rate and the Margin; and (b) in respect of the subsequent periods from (and including) a Rate Start Date to (but excluding) the immediately succeeding Rate Start date, a fixed rate that is equal to the aggregate of the Reset Benchmark Rate applying on that first mentioned date and the Margin; “Benchmark Rate” is the five-year swap rate (adjusted, as necessary to a quarterly rate); 8 “Margin” is 4.09 percent; “Rate Start Date” means 28 June 2014 and, thereafter, each five-yearly date falling after that date; and “X” is the number of days from (and including) the Advance Date of the BNZIM Loan to (but excluding) 28 September 2009. 30. At the expiry of the first five-year period, there will be a further five-year rate set by reference to the then applicable five-year swap rate, such rate setting to take place two business days before that expiry date (but with no change to the Margin). The same process will apply at the end of the second and subsequent five-year periods. 31. The terms of the BNZIM Loan also oblige BNZIM, in consideration for BNZIS 2 making the Loan, to pay on-going expenses incurred by BNZIS 2 (such as expenses for services provided to it by BNZ or its auditors, and any net interest on short-term funding arrangements between it and BNZ) (clause 9 of the Loan Agreement). 32. Under clause 4.3 of the Loan Agreement, interest on the BNZIM Loan will not be payable in respect of a quarterly interest period if an Interest Payment Condition applies. These conditions are if:  payment of the corresponding dividend by BNZIS 2 would breach certain APRA requirements or exceed the NAB Group’s distributable profits;  the payment of the interest would result in BNZIM failing to satisfy the solvency test under the Companies Act 1993;  the directors of BNZIS 2 would not be satisfied on reasonable grounds that BNZIS 2 would satisfy the solvency test under the Companies Act 1993 immediately on payment of the corresponding dividend by BNZIS 2; or  APRA otherwise objects to BNZIS 2 making the corresponding dividend payment. 33. If, and to the extent that all or any part of any interest on the BNZIM Loan is not paid because any of the above Interest Payment Conditions apply, BNZIM shall have no obligation to pay the Interest Amount in respect of the relevant Interest Period, the unpaid amount shall not accumulate interest or be capitalised and added to the Loan, and BNZIS 2’s right to such amount shall be cancelled absolutely. 34. As with the dividends on the BNZIS 2 Shares, interest on the BNZIM Loan is not cumulative. 35. BNZIM invested the proceeds of the BNZIM Loan in the 2009 BNZ PPS (refer paragraph 41 below). Because dividends on the 2009 BNZ PPS will be paid on an after-tax basis, BNZIM will have a cash shortfall and will require additional funds to meet the interest payments on the BNZIM Loan. This cash shortfall will be funded primarily by way of BNZ (or other profit-making companies in the BNZ Group) making cash payments to BNZIM in exchange for loss-offset elections, whereby BNZIM will elect to offset its tax losses against BNZ’s taxable income. 9 Repayment of BNZIM Loan 36. Clause 6.1 of the Loan Agreement provides that the BNZIM Loan is repayable at the option of BNZIM at any time on or after 28 June 2014, or following the occurrence of a Regulatory Event, a Loan Repayment Event, a Call (refer paragraph 46) or a Tax Event (as these terms are defined in clause 1.1 of the Loan Agreement). 37. BNZIM must repay the BNZIM Loan in whole following the redemption, buy back, or acquisition of the 2009 BNZ PPS. In this regard, clause 6.2 of the Loan Agreement states: The Borrower shall repay the Loan (in whole but not in part) together with any unpaid interest (accrued since the last Interest Payment Date) calculated at the applicable Interest Rate on the number of days elapsed since the last Interest Payment Date and on the basis of a 365-day year, immediately following the redemption, buy back or acquisition of the 2009 BNZ PPS. 38. Following the occurrence of a Transfer Event (as described in paragraph 38 below), BNZIM will repay the BNZIM Loan by transferring the 2009 BNZ PPS to BNZIS 2. Such a transfer shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of BNZIM’s obligations under the Loan Agreement. 39. Transfer Events are defined in clause 1.1 of the Loan Agreement as follows: Transfer Event means the occurrence of an APRA Event, a Liquidation Event, a Distribution Non-Payment Event or a BNZ Distribution Event; Broadly, Transfer Events comprise:  NAB failing to meet certain APRA requirements or being subject to the Australian equivalent of statutory management;  non-payment of interest where the conditions to payment of interest under the BNZIM Loan have been satisfied;  BNZIS 2, BNZIM, or BNZ going into liquidation or statutory management; and  BNZ paying an ordinary dividend when it has not paid dividends on the 2009 BNZ PPS. 40. BNZIS 2’s rights under the BNZIM Loan are limited in recourse to the 2009 BNZ PPS, distributions on those 2009 BNZ PPS, or the proceeds of their sale (clause 10 of the Loan Agreement and the definition of “Collateral” in clause 3.1 of the Security Trust Deed). BNZIS 2 does not have recourse to any other assets of BNZIM. 41. BNZIM’s obligation to transfer the 2009 BNZ PPS to BNZIS 2 is secured by a security interest over the 2009 BNZ PPS in favour of the Trustee under the Security Trust Deed. 2009 BNZ PPS 42. BNZIM applied the proceeds of the BNZIM Loan to subscribe for $260 million 2009 BNZ PPS issued by BNZ. These shares:  on a liquidation of BNZ, rank in priority to ordinary shares and equally with the preference shares issued by BNZ in March 2008 for the BNZIS transaction (BNZ PPS) and have a right to receive an amount equal to 10 their issue price plus the dividend accrued from the last dividend payment date (clause 26.9 of the BNZ Constitution);  are non-voting shares, except as to certain matters such as those affecting their rights, privileges, or limitations (clause 26.10 of the BNZ Constitution);  pay a dividend on generally the same basis as the BNZIS 2 Shares pay a dividend (but including the condition that directors of BNZ must be satisfied that payment of the dividend will not cause BNZ’s capital ratios to cease complying with RBNZ’s then current capital adequacy requirements) (clause 26.5 of the BNZ Constitution); and  have a right to such a dividend in priority to the payment of dividends on the ordinary shares issued by BNZ (clause 26.2 of the BNZ Constitution). They rank equally with the BNZ PPS for dividend purposes. 43. In the event that a dividend is not paid on the 2009 BNZ PPS on a dividend payment date, BNZ is not permitted to declare or make any distributions or payments on, or with respect to, any other shares in the capital of BNZ that rank equally with or junior to the 2009 BNZ PPS (other than pro rata payments or distributions on shares that rank equally with the 2009 BNZ PPS) unless and until:  BNZ has paid dividends in full on the 2009 BNZ PPS on two consecutive dividend payment dates immediately following that dividend payment date; or  the Call over the BNZIS 2 Shares is exercised and the BNZIS 2 Shares have been transferred in accordance with the terms of the Call. 44. BNZ used the funds obtained by way of the issue of the 2009 BNZ PPS for general business purposes, which may have included using them to repatriate funds back to the NAB Group in Australia. Any such repatriation may be by way of a dividend, a share or loan repayment, or another mechanism. 45. BNZ and BNZIM are both members of the BNZ “consolidated imputation group” (as defined in section YA 1). Termination - Call over BNZIS 2 Shares 46. Under the terms of clauses 6.9 to 6.11 of the BNZIS 2 Constitution (and subject to it having obtained the prior written approval of APRA) NAB has the right, on the fifth anniversary of the issue of the BNZIS 2 Shares (the “Initial Call Date”, being 28 June 2014) and on any quarterly dividend payment date thereafter, at a price equal to their issue price plus the dividend accrued from the last dividend payment date, to give a Call Notice to all BNZIS 2 Shareholders requiring those holders to transfer all their BNZIS 2 Shares to NAB or a nominated member of the NAB Group (other than BNZIS 2). 47. The Call may be exercised before the fifth anniversary upon the happening of certain events that, broadly speaking, diminish the benefits to the NAB Group of the BNZIS 2 Shares being on issue. These are referred to as Regulatory Events and Tax Events. The Call may also be exercised if certain other structurally significant events affecting BNZIS 2 or BNZIM occur, referred to as Loan Repayment Events, or the 2009 BNZ PPS are redeemed, bought back or acquired. 11 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) During the period of the Ruling, the BNZIS 2 Shares will be listed on the NZDX or another “recognised exchange” as defined in section YA 1. b) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS 2 is not treated under a double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. c) During the period of the Ruling, ordinary shares in BNZIS 2 will only be held by a person who also holds BNZIS 2 Shares. d) During the period of the Ruling, each BNZIS 2 Shareholder has rights in relation to all the proceeds from the BNZIM Loan. e) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS 2 will be an “ICA company” as defined in section YA 1. f) During the period of the Ruling, any distributions made by BNZIS 2 in respect of the BNZIS 2 Shares will be fully credited for the purposes of section CD 43(26) of the Act to the extent permitted by the imputation credits that the directors of BNZIS 2 determine are available. g) During the period of the Ruling, income derived by BNZIS 2 will to the extent of 90 percent or more be derived from interest it receives on its loan to BNZIM. h) During the period of the Ruling, BNZIS 2 will not cancel the election it has made to be a PIE under section HL 11. i) During the period of the Ruling, the Constitution of BNZIS 2 will not be materially altered or amended from the version provided to Inland Revenue on 18 August 2009 (as part of the application for a binding ruling) in a manner that relates to the eligibility requirements to be a PIE and a PLC set out in the Act. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  A distribution in respect of the BNZIS 2 Shares is “excluded income” under section CX 56(3) of a holder of the BNZIS 2 Shares who is: (i) A New Zealand resident who is a natural person or a trustee and who does not elect to include the amount of such distributions in that holder’s return of income for the applicable year; and (ii) A person not referred to in paragraph (i) above to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is not fully imputed as described in section RF 9(2).  Section GB 35 does no t apply to the Arrangement. 12 13  Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 26 June 2009 and ending on 30 June 2014.

The Company has no power to: (e) carry on any other business or activity; or (f) apply amounts received by way of interest on, or repayment of, the bonds referred to in sub-paragraph (b) above for any purpose other than in payments to Holders, meeting costs and expenses incurred in connection with the issuance and maintenance in existence of PIE Capital Securities and making income and other tax payments to the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department. 9 Rabo Capital elected to be a “portfolio listed company” (“PLC”) under the “portfolio investment entity” (“PIE”) regime on 22 April 2009, with a commencement date of 27 May 2009. 10 Under the Constitution, Rabo Capital may take all steps it considers necessary or desirable to ensure it continues to be eligible as a PIE and a PLC or otherwise to comply with the requirements of the Act relating to PIEs. These requirements include (but are not limited to):  refusing to register the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities;  treating the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities as void (ab initio or from such other date as Rabo Capital may decide in its complete discretion) (clause 3(i) (ii) of the PIE Conditions);  deeming any PIE Capital Securities held that would result in any holder (or where the holder is a nominee their beneficial owner) exceeding the maximum holding that an investor may hold in Rabo Capital in order for it to meet the PIE eligibility requirements in the Act, to be held by the holder of the PIE Capital Securities on trust for any member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and allowing such member full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities, including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clause 3(i) (ii) of the PIE Conditions);  allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to request any holder (or any person associated with that holder) of PIE Capital Securities to provide such information or evidence as it may require to determine whether Rabo Capital is eligible or continues to be eligible as a PIE and qualify as a PLC and, where holders do not provide such 4 information within specified time periods, deeming that such holder’s (or where the holder is a nominee, such beneficial owner’s) PIE Capital Securities are held on trust for a member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and such member of the Rabobank Group shall have full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clauses 3(i) (iii) and (iv) of the PIE Conditions);  allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to take any of the steps in clause 3(i) (v) of the PIE Conditions to ensure that any breach of the PIE regime “investor interest size” requirement is remedied within the period required by the Act. PIE Capital Securities 11 Rabo Capital offered PIE Capital Securities with a face value of $1 each to the public in New Zealand for $1 per security. The minimum holding amount is $5,000. The offer which opened on 27 April 2009 and closed on 22 May 2009, was available to retail and institutional investors. Rabobank Nederland acquired 5,000 PIE Capital Securities on 5 February 2010. 12 On 25 May 2009 Rabo Capital accepted a total of $280 million in applications. 13 Rabo Capital has entered into a Listing Agreement with NZX for the PIE Capital Securities to be quoted on the NZDX (the debt security market operated by NZX). Although the PIE Capital Securities are not debt securities for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, NZX Regulation has given certain rulings and waivers from the NZDX Listing Rules in relation to the listing of the PIE Capital Securities on the NZDX. 14 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual non-cumulative non-voting preference shares of Rabo Capital and shall at all time rank pari passu and without any preference among themselves (clause 4(a) of the PIE Conditions). They are direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of Rabo Capital and are not guaranteed by Rabobank Nederland or any other person. 15 Dividends will be paid on the PIE Capital Securities quarterly in arrears on the “Initial Rate Dividend Payment Date”, with the first dividend payment date scheduled to occur on 18 June 2009 (clause 5(c) of the PIE Conditions). 16 The dividend amount is the amount of cash payable to holders of PIE Capital Securities on the relevant dividend payment date. The dividend amount for each dividend period from 18 June 2009 to 18 June 2019 is calculated as follows: face value x dividend rate x (1-t) 4 Where “t” is the weighted basic rate of New Zealand corporate income tax expressed as a percentage applicable to Rabo Capital (currently 30 percent) during the period ending on the relevant dividend payment date. The “dividend rate” used to calculate the dividend amount will be as follows: 5 (a) for the first 10 years, the initial rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the benchmark rate (the five-year swap rate), which will be reset after five years; and (b) thereafter, the floating rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the three-month bank bill rate, which is reset quarterly. 17 The Investment Statement contains the following statement, relating to dividends payable on the PIE Capital Securities (at page 6): Dividend: The PIE Capital Securities will pay a non-cumulative dividend. Dividend Amounts are scheduled to be paid quarterly on each 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 18 December. The Dividend Amount is the cash component of the dividend and is a proportion of the amount calculated using the Dividend Rate. Dividend Amounts payable on the PIE Capital Securities will be paid to the person registered as the Holder on the relevant Record Date (including in relation to the first Dividend Amount payable). Initial Dividend Rate: The initial Dividend Rate will be set for an initial period of approximately 5 years from the Issue Date to 18 June 2014 at the greater of:  the Minimum Initial Rate, which is 8% per annum; and  the Benchmark Rate on 25 May 2009 plus the Margin. Dividend Rate reset: The Dividend Rate will be reset for a further 5 years on 18 June 2014 at the prevailing Benchmark Rate plus the Margin. From 18 June 2019 the Dividend Rate will reset quarterly, at the 90 day bank bill rate plus the Margin. 18 On 25 May 2009 the dividend rate for the period until 18 June 2014, incorporating the margin (which has been set at 3.75 percent per annum) and the swap rate, was set at 8.7864 percent per annum. 19 Rabo Capital will attach imputation credits to distributions made to holders of PIE Capital Securities to the maximum extent permitted by the imputation credits available. The Investment Statement contains the following statement (at page 11): Imputation Credits The Issuer will attach imputation credits to Dividend Amounts to the extent permitted by the imputation credits that the directors of the Issuer determine are available. It is expected that dividends will have imputation credits fully attached to a Dividend Amount (30/70th of the Dividend Amount assuming a corporate tax rate of 30%). If the Issuer does not fully impute a Dividend Amount, this may trigger an Exchange Event and the PIE Capital Securities may, at the Issuer's option, exchange into the Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. Alternatively, the Issuer may, at its discretion, put in place an arrangement to reimburse Holders who are adversely affected by the dividends not being fully imputed. Underlying Securities 20 Rabo Capital will use the funds raised from the issue of PIE Capital Securities to invest in Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland 6 on or about the issue date of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying Securities are interest-bearing, unsecured, perpetual, non-cumulative subordinated bonds. The principal amount of the Underlying Securities will be equal to the subscription amount of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying Securities will have terms conforming substantially to the terms of the PIE Capital Securities. However, the Underlying Securities will be bonds paying interest rather than shares paying imputed dividends. The Underlying Securities will be the only material asset of Rabo Capital and at least 90 percent of the income Rabo Capital will derive will be interest from its investment in the Underlying Securities. 21 Rabobank Nederland will use the funds raised from the issue of Underlying Securities for its banking business. The funds are not being raised specifically for the purposes of Rabobank Nederland’s New Zealand branch (“NZ Branch”), although Rabobank Nederland may “on-lend” some of the funds raised to NZ Branch. 22 Interest received by Rabo Capital on the Underlying Securities will constitute assessable income for Rabo Capital. Termination of Arrangement 23 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual securities that have no scheduled repayment date, but the PIE Capital Securities will be redeemed in the following circumstances (among others). The circumstances are set out in clause 8 of the PIE Conditions and are: (a) if Rabo Capital exercises the option contained in clause 8(c) of the PIE Conditions and elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities on the “First Call Date” which is specified as being 18 June 2019 or on any dividend payment date thereafter; (b) if, as a result of a Netherlands tax law change, there is more than an insubstantial risk that additional amounts are payable under the Underlying Securities or interest payable on the Underlying Securities would not be deductible to Rabobank Nederland for Netherlands tax purposes and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (c) if the Dutch Central Bank notifies Rabo Capital that the PIE Capital Securities may not be included in consolidated Tier 1 Capital of the Rabobank Group and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (d) where the Underlying Securities are redeemed; or (e) on the occurrence of certain “Exchange Events” the PIE Capital Securities may be, at the option of Rabo Capital either cancelled and exchanged for Underlying Securities with a face value equal to the face value of the PIE Capital Securities or redeemed. The types of circumstances that would constitute an “Exchange Event” are described in the “Definitions” section of the PIE Conditions and summarised in the Investment Statement as follows (at page 12): Exchange Events On the occurrence of certain events (each an “Exchange Event”) the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, exchange into the Underlying 7 Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. The Exchange Events are: (a) if the Dutch Central Bank requires that all PIE Capital Securities must be issued directly by Rabobank Nederland; or (b) an Insolvency Event in relation to the Issuer or Rabobank Nederland; or (c) a default by the Issuer for more than 30 days in the payment of Dividend Amounts or Redemption Amounts (other than relating to an administrative error) in respect of any of the PIE Capital Securities; or (d) any of the following events that the Issuer determines in its absolute discretion is an Exchange Event; (i) an Increased Costs Event; or (ii) any Tax Law Change which has or is expected to have the effect that the anticipated tax outcomes for the Issuer or for Holders as at the Issue Date are adversely affected (as determined by the Issuer); or (iii) the Issuer does not impute a Dividend Amount at the maximum imputation ratio under the Tax Act and an arrangement is not in place, or in the Issuer's opinion is not expected to be in place, within 90 Business Days of the relevant Dividend Payment Date to fully reimburse Holders who are adversely affected; or (iv) the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department has indicated that it will not provide or renew a satisfactory binding ruling or rulings (as determined by the Issuer) confirming the anticipated tax implications of the transaction for the Issuer and the Holders. Upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event, Holders of the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, receive Underlying Securities in a principal amount equal to the Redemption Amount of each Holder's PIE Capital Securities at the relevant time or have their PIE Capital Securities redeemed. Prior to the distribution to Holders of the Underlying Securities or redemption, any Outstanding Amounts and any surplus amounts (after accounting for the Outstanding Amounts and the distribution of the Underlying Securities) held by the Issuer will be paid out pro rata to Holders. Administration Costs 24 It is expected that Rabo Capital will pay for ongoing costs and expenses related to the issue of PIE Capital Securities. If Rabo Capital has insufficient funds with which to pay these costs and expenses, Rabobank Nederland will reimburse Rabo Capital for the costs and expenses. Because of this arrangement, it is unlikely Rabo Capital will pay an administration fee to Rabobank Nederland, but in the event that any administration fee is paid in the future, such administration fee will not exceed an arm’s length amount. 25 The New Zealand branch of Rabobank Nederland (“NZ Branch”) will provide a liquidity facility to Rabo Capital pursuant to which Rabo Capital may request advances of up to NZ$10 million from NZ Branch. Any interest paid by Rabo Capital to NZ Branch pursuant to the liquidity facility will be on arm’s length terms or, if not on arm’s length terms, on terms that are in favour of Rabo Capital. It is expected that money from this funding facility will only be used to pay tax or other expenses of Rabo Capital if it has insufficient available funds before receiving income under the Underlying Securities. There is no intention on the part of the Board of Directors of Rabo Capital and/or the Supervisory Board of Rabobank 8 9 Nederland that Rabo Capital, Rabobank Nederland and/or NZ Branch would be paid any of the income that should otherwise be paid to the holders of PIE Capital Securities. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) This Product Ruling will cease to apply if the Binding Private Ruling (BR Prv 10/05) issued in respect of the Rabo Capital PIE regime Arrangement no longer applies or Rabo Capital ceases to be eligible to be a PIE and a PLC. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement as follows:  Distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to holders of PIE Capital Securities will constitute excluded income of a New Zealand tax resident holder who is a natural person or a trustee and who does not include the amount as income in their return of income for the income year, pursuant to section CX 56(3)(a).  Where section CX 56(3)(a) does not apply, distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to holders of the PIE Capital Securities will be excluded income of a holder to the extent to which the amount of the distribution is more than the amount of the distribution that is fully imputed (as described in section RF 9(2)) pursuant to section CX 56(3)(b)(i).  Section GB 35 does not apply to the Arrangement.  Section BG 1 does not apply to vary or negate the above conclusions. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 27 May 2009 and ending on 30 June 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 12 th day of March 2010. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 10/03 This is a Product Ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) has applied for this Ruling. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) sections BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1, RE 1 to RE 6, RE 10, RF 2, RF 3 and RF 4; (b) sections 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA); and (c) the definition of “disposition of property” in section 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 (EGDA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product (TotalMoney) that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may be only individuals, companies, or trusts. TotalMoney involves the creation of new types of accounts that must be in a group of accounts, and the facility to elect to group any number of these new types of accounts into one or more groups for the purpose of either “pooling” or “offsetting” the account balances. “Pooling” involves the aggregation of account credit balances for the purpose of determining the interest rate that will apply to the calculation and crediting of interest to each account balance. “Offsetting” involves the aggregation of account balances for the purpose of calculating the amount of interest debited to a lending facility account balance. The Arrangement is set out in the documents listed below, copies of which were received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit, Inland Revenue, on 12 February 2010: • Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Personal Customers; • Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies and Trusts; • Bank of New Zealand Facility Master Agreement; and • Letter of Advice – TotalMoney Home Loan. Additional changes will be made to the documents listed in the first two bullet points above to enable business customers to use TotalMoney in the manner described below. For example, the reference to TotalMoney not being available for business purposes in clause 5 of each of these documents will be removed. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in paragraphs 1 to 28 below. 1. TotalMoney is a package of accounts and loans that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may be only individuals, companies, or trusts. 2. Customers in general have a range of accounts with BNZ, including transaction accounts, savings accounts, and various loan accounts. Loan accounts may be only table, non-table, tailored, principal and interest, interest only, fixed or floating home loan accounts, or business loan accounts. 3. Interest under a TotalMoney loan account cannot be capitalised, for example, by virtue of a “mortgage holiday”. TotalMoney allows customers to group or aggregate these accounts for the purposes of either “pooling” or “offsetting” the account balances. Primary features of TotalMoney 4. The primary features of TotalMoney are the “pooling” and “offsetting” features. These features operate in the manner described below. Pooling (a) The pooling aspect of TotalMoney can operate when there are several transaction accounts with credit balances. Interest on these credit balance accounts is calculated and paid having regard to the cumulative credit balance of all transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the pooling feature. Interest-bearing accounts usually attract interest in accordance with interest rate brackets that apply to the balance of each relevant individual account. (b) The cumulative credit balance is calculated purely for BNZ to ascertain the relevant interest rate tier applicable to the relevant accounts. The separate funds are not actually transferred to one account before the interest is calculated. BNZ calculates interest by reference to the applicable interest rate tier that applies to the accumulated balance. Offsetting (a) With the offset feature of TotalMoney, interest on a lending facility or facilities within the group is calculated and paid by the customer on the difference between the lending facility balances and the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the offset feature. Under the terms and conditions agreed between BNZ and its customers for TotalMoney, BNZ pays no interest on the credit balances that are “offset” against the lending facility. 2 (b) The “offsetting” is only for the purpose of calculating the balance of the lending facility or facilities on which interest is payable, or, where the credit balances nominated for the “offset” feature exceed the balance of the lending facility, the balance of the credit balances on which interest is receivable. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or “netting” of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. 5. Every transaction account in a TotalMoney group must be selected to either “pool” or “offset”. That is, customers can choose whether some or all of their transaction accounts with credit balances are “pooled” (in which case BNZ will pay interest to those accounts) or “offset” against the product lending facility. By default all accounts will be set to the “offset” feature unless changed to “pooled” (by the customer or BNZ on the customer’s instructions) except where the customer has no loan account (in which case the customer’s TotalMoney accounts will automatically “pool”). 6. TotalMoney does not provide a facility for existing accounts. TotalMoney involves the creation of a new type of account. To participate in TotalMoney, a customer must open specific TotalMoney accounts that are particular to the TotalMoney product. Customers may convert an existing non-TotalMoney transaction or savings account that they have with BNZ to a new TotalMoney account. However, the customer must agree that the existing terms and conditions that apply to those accounts cease to apply, and are replaced by the TotalMoney Terms and Conditions. 7. In relation to the new TotalMoney accounts, the customer can select and change between that account participating in either the “offset” or the “pooling” features at any time and for any period. Pooling – further detail 8. BNZ has a contractual obligation to pay interest to each transaction account with a credit balance participating in the pooling feature, based on the applicable interest rate tier that applies based on the total cumulative balance of all accounts being “pooled”. In accordance with its usual business practice, BNZ makes a separate determination in relation to withholding tax on each interest payment made to each account. 9. The benefit of the “pooling” feature for customers is that they can earn more interest by combining smaller balances and reaching higher interest- rate tiers and still maintain their money in separate accounts for separate purposes. The customer may consider this an advantageous way to manage their money. 10. Account owners have full deposit and withdrawal access to their transaction accounts. Overdraft facilities may be available in relation to these accounts. However, any overdraft balance is ignored for “pooling” purposes. BNZ charges debit interest on the overdrawn balance of any account. The overdrawn balance does not reduce the “pooled” balance of the accounts with credit balances when BNZ is calculating interest in relation to those accounts. Offsetting – further detail 3 11. Where one loan account is in the group, the interest payable on the loan account is calculated by reference to the balance of the loan account less the credit balances of accounts set to the “offset” feature. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of TotalMoney documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of BNZ’s computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting, or transfer of funds, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. “Offsetting” occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 12. For example, in the case of a loan account that would otherwise be the same as a standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years with a “minimum payment”, there will be no provision for the amount of interest saved under “offsetting” to reduce the “minimum payment”. The effect of “offsetting” is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the “minimum payment”. In either case, the term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. In the case of a non-table loan, interest payments will be reduced by “offsetting”, principal repayments will not change, and the loan term will not reduce. 13. Where there is more than one loan account in the group, the default position is that the loan accounts in the group are given a default priority; namely, the oldest loan account in the group will receive the highest priority. However, the customer may elect two or more of those loan accounts to be prioritised for “offsetting” purposes. The loan account with the highest priority will receive the benefit of “offsetting” first, and it is only where the credit balances of transaction accounts set to offset exceed the balance of that highest priority loan account that the next highest priority loan account balance is offset, and so on. 14. If the total credit balances of the transaction accounts set to “offset” are greater than the total debit balance of the loan accounts, credit interest will be applied to the difference and paid on a prorated basis to the credit balance accounts in accordance with the balance of those accounts (essentially in line with the “pooling” feature of TotalMoney). 15. BNZ calculates interest daily. If, during a month, BNZ has both an entitlement to receive interest (that is, the balance of participating loan accounts exceeds the balance of all transaction accounts set to the offset feature) and, at another point in the month, BNZ has an obligation to pay interest (that is, the balance of transaction accounts set to offset exceeds the balance of the relevant loan accounts), then the two interest payments are made and are not set-off. 16. The “offsetting” feature of TotalMoney essentially offers the same benefits to customers as offered by a revolving credit loan (such as BNZ’s “Rapid Repay” product) in terms of lower interest costs and a shorter time to repay the loan. However, this feature overcomes a primary perceived disadvantage of a revolving credit loan, because it allows customers to retain separate account balances (which customers may prefer when managing their finances). 17. Where a customer has a TotalMoney loan account, this account must be grouped with at least one other TotalMoney transaction account. 18. There is no arrangement between the customers who have grouped their accounts which provides for the loan account owner(s) to make a 4 payment(s) to the transaction account owner(s) in consideration for the transaction account owner(s) electing the “offset” feature of TotalMoney. Terms and Conditions for the TotalMoney loan products 19. Each of BNZ’s home loans is explained in a collection of documents. These documents include primarily a Facility Master Agreement (which is a standard form master document that contains generic provisions that apply to all BNZ home loan facilities), and a Letter of Advice (which contains particular and specific provisions in relation to the home loan facility being made available to the customer). The Letter of Advice is produced from a computer system that contains a master list of possible provisions that can apply to BNZ’s home loans. Under this system, the provisions applicable to a particular home loan are selected, collated, and produced in a document. 20. The TotalMoney product home loans are also documented in a Facility Master Agreement and Letter of Advice. Customers may also enter into another Letter of Advice if they want to be able to redraw amounts that they have repaid under a fixed home loan at a later stage. The Facility Master Agreement is the standard document that applies to all BNZ home loans. The Letter of Advice contains only small differences compared with the Letter of Advice for other loans, primarily relating to branding (that is, the name BNZ has given to this particular form of home loan) and the interest calculation in relation to the variable rate components of the home loan (to account for the “offset” feature of TotalMoney). 21. Table loans provide for regular payments and a set date when they will be paid off. Most payments early in the loan term comprise interest, while most of the payments later in the term comprise repayments of the principal. Non-table loans have two separate repayments, one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay the same amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. 22. The documentation for a TotalMoney standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years will largely be the same as that for current BNZ home loan facilities that are standard variable rate table home loans over 20 years. The only differences are; branding (the name on the Letter of Advice), the interest calculation (which provides for the effect of the “offset”), and, in relation to table loans, the provision stating that where the loan has the benefit of the “offset” to reduce the interest cost, the “minimum payment” specified for the loan will not decrease because of any interest savings but instead the loan term will reduce. In relation to this latter point, under a non-table loan, any interest saving (whether arising as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate for the loan because of a general decrease in interest rates, or because of the offset feature), would result in either a reduction of the interest repayment of the loan or a reduction in the loan term (if the original repayment amount is maintained despite the interest saving). In relation to a TotalMoney product home loan that is a table home loan, a reduction is allowed only in the loan term. Groups 23. TotalMoney is based on a group of participating accounts. Groups can be comprised of one of the following categories only: 5 (a) Natural persons: (i) The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto, and civil union couples, and any of their children may be combined as part of one group. (ii) For example, the various accounts of one natural person, Jane, or, the various accounts (individual or joint) of Jane and her husband John and their child Joe. The group is not limited to residents of New Zealand. (b) One company or one trust: (i) Multiple accounts of one company (including a qualifying company or loss attributing qualifying company) or one trust may be combined as part of a group. Only one entity can be in a group at any time. (ii) Accounts of different entities (including the entity and any related individual) cannot be pooled or offset. Business rules will be implemented to specify those companies and trusts entitled to use TotalMoney. 24. A customer may be a resident or non-resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. However, where a group of accounts consists of accounts owned by more than one legal person, BNZ will obtain representations from the owners of those accounts that the owners do not have multiple residency status. That is, where more than one legal person is participating in a group of accounts, either all persons must be residents of New Zealand for tax purposes or all persons must be non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. Business purposes 25. When TotalMoney was established, customers were contractually prohibited from using TotalMoney for business purposes. BNZ is removing the prohibition on the business use of TotalMoney. BNZ intends to extend the availability of TotalMoney to business customers to give them the same tools for managing their financial affairs as it gives to personal customers. 26. In the period following the introduction of TotalMoney, BNZ’s staff noted that operating multiple accounts enables a business customer to set aside funds for specific purposes (for example, GST, provisional tax, payroll and other costs), while obtaining the benefits of pooling and offsetting. The greater visibility that customers have of their funds when they are not held in one overall transactional account is expected to bring cash management benefits to some customers. Essentially, the benefits that TotalMoney brings to retail customers are equally valid for business customers. BNZ considers that making TotalMoney available to those customers will provide BNZ with a competitive advantage in an important market segment. 27. Under the terms and conditions applicable to TotalMoney, customers will be able to use TotalMoney accounts for business purposes, which means that, in future, customers will be able to group business and non-business 6 product accounts. This will mean that a sole trader, for example, will be able to group their business and non-business accounts. BNZ’s objectives 28. BNZ’s objectives in providing TotalMoney are to: (a) increase its market share, particularly in relation to home loans and transaction-type accounts; (b) increase the proportion of its home loans that are charged variable interest rates; (c) increase customer satisfaction and customer retention; and (d) improve its brand awareness and be seen as a market leader. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: (a) All interest rates related to the TotalMoney product are arm’s length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: Gift duty • In relation to a group where the participating accounts are owned by different legal persons, where a credit balance account owned by one person is offset against the loan account balance of another person, with the effect that the interest liability of that other person is less, there is no “disposition of property” for the purposes of section 2 of the EGDA and gift duty cannot apply. Financial arrangements rules • When a credit balance of a transaction account and a debit balance of a loan account are “offset”, there is no amount of consideration paid or payable by virtue of that “offset” for the purposes of the calculation of income and expenditure under sections EW 15 and EW 31 of the “financial arrangements rules” (as defined in section EW 1(2)).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 of 10 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 10/02 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Persons who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Restaurant Brands Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the 2007 Income Tax Act unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: • Sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) and the definition of “income from employment” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. • The definition of “taxable activity” in section 6, and the definition of “employment under any contract of service” in section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a recurring arrangement in terms of section 91E(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 involving the engagement of delivery drivers by Restaurant Brands Limited (“RBL”) pursuant to the Delivery Driver Contract, completion of Certification S5, and in accordance with information in the Delivery Driver Handbook, and the standard practice information provided to Inland Revenue in the ruling application (dated 8 December 2009) and by email on 22 January 2010 (collectively referred to as “the relevant documents”), to deliver RBL products to RBL customers. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Relationship between RBL and its delivery drivers 1. RBL prepares and sells a range of “fast food” products via its Pizza Hut business. RBL sells its products through a chain of restaurants and provides a delivery service to its customers at some of these restaurants. RBL engages the services of delivery drivers to deliver its products to its customers from its Pizza Hut stores. 2. The relationship between the Delivery Drivers (owner drivers) and Pizza Hut are governed by the following documents: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 2 of 10 • The “Delivery Driver Contract” which includes the following: • An outline of delivery driver payments (clause 7); • A form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (schedule B); and • The driver uniform policy (schedule C); • The “Delivery Driver Handbook” which incorporates the following: • The guideline on “Delivery Driver Payments”; • A form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (schedule B): • The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements”; • The guideline on “Making a Delivery”; • The “CHAMPS ” guidelines on dealing with a customer; • The “Certification S5” which drivers are required to complete to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in the following areas: • Driver’s role in CHAMPS; • Service Standards; • Driver Safety and Security. • The “Standard Practice Information” provided to Inland Revenue in the rulings applications. 3. Changes to the terms of the Delivery Driver contract and the Deliver Driver Handbook are communicated to Area Managers and Store Managers by RBL Head Office by email. This is in turn communicated to the Delivery Drivers verbally with reference to the email received from RBL Head Office. No physical amendment is made to the Delivery Driver Contract entered into with each respective driver. Refer to paragraph (a) of the “Conditions Stipulated by the Commissioner” (page 9 of this ruling). 4. In some cases, in-store employees make home deliveries for Pizza Hut stores from time to time, while also carrying out employment duties in-store. These employees are contracted with RBL under employment contracts and are paid a taxable allowance for making the deliveries but are not remunerated separately for the delivery services performed. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 3 of 10 Terms of the Delivery Driver Contract 5. Under the terms of the Delivery Driver Contract the delivery driver agrees to: (a) use only the motor vehicles detailed in the Driver/Vehicle details as provided in Schedule B to the contract in the performance of the contract (clause 3.1(d)); (b) ensure the performance of the delivery services in a safe, proper and courteous manner in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Delivery Driver Handbook as varied from time to time (clause 3.1) (attention is drawn to any delivery driver guidelines issued by RBL from time to time); (c) be responsible for all costs and expenses of the driver’s business including the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining all delivery vehicles (clause 4.1(b)); (d) immediately refer any discrepancies on delivery with regards to collection of monies and delivery records to RBL (clause 5.1(a)); (e) at the end of each delivery period provide to RBL’s authorised representative: • a complete account and record in the format specified by RBL (clause 5.1(b)(i)); and • all monies collected by the delivery driver from customers of RBL during the course of that delivery period (clause 5.1(b)(ii)); (f) be responsible to account for any cheques, credit card slips or monies received on behalf of RBL as soon as possible and make good any shortfall (clause 5.1(c)); (g) be liable for, and indemnify RBL against, any liability, loss, claim or proceedings arising out of or relating to the use of the Contractor’s vehicles in the provision of delivery services (clause 8.1); (h) maintain throughout the continuance of the agreement, at their own expense ACC contributions, where the delivery drivers engage employees to perform services under the contract, make the appropriate ACC employer contribution as required on behalf of those employees (if any) (clause 8.1(a)); (i) a minimum of Third Party Property Damage Liability Insurance in respect of the vehicle (clause 8.1(b)); (j) wear any uniforms provided by RBL and ensure their proper care and maintenance. A $30 deposit is retained out of the first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on return of the uniform in good conditions (fair wear and tear excepted) (clause 9.1); \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 4 of 10 (k) provide and wear any additional uniform items as may be requested by RBL (e.g. black trousers) (clause 9.1); (l) provide a float of $20 for the purpose of making change during each delivery period (clause 9.2); (m) return upon request, clean and in good condition uniforms and delivery pouches. Failure to do so will entitle RBL to deduct the replacement cost from any monies owing to the delivery driver (clause 9.3); and (n) produce to RBL’s authorised representative documents that are necessary in the opinion of RBL to establish that the delivery driver has complied and continues to comply with their obligations under the contract (clause 10). 6. The delivery driver is not liable to take out any insurance or be responsible for loss or damage to the products delivered (as long as the loss or damage does not result from the delivery driver’s wilful default, negligence or breach of the Contract) (clause 8.3). 7. The delivery driver may not assign their rights under the contract without the prior written consent of RBL (clause 1.3). 8. In terms of RBL’s obligations under the Delivery Driver Contract: (a) The engagement of the delivery driver does not commit RBL to a guarantee of any minimum remuneration (clause 1.2); (b) RBL also reserves the right to engage the services of other contractors (clause 1.4); (c) RBL agrees to pay the delivery driver: • for services on a per delivery basis an all inclusive payment of $5 per delivery including GST (clause 7); (effective from 20 May 2008 an all inclusive payment of $5.10 per delivery for new drivers, $5.20 per delivery for drivers who have completed 6 months of service and $5.30 per delivery for drivers who have completed 12 months or more of service, all including GST (if any)); • within 14 days of submission of an invoice for services (clause 6.1); (d) RBL is not responsible for any vehicle damage sustained as a result of the delivery driver’s negligence or omission (clause 8); (e) Products carried by the delivery driver shall be at the risk of RBL (clause 8.3); (f) The uniforms and delivery pouches remain the property of RBL (clause 9.3). \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 5 of 10 9. Under clause 1.2 either party may terminate the Delivery Driver Contract upon notice to the other party at the conclusion of any delivery. 10. The legal relationship between the delivery driver and RBL is described as that of “principal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee” (clause 2.1). Delivery Driver Payments 11. Clause 7 of the guideline on “Delivery Driver Payments” states that the delivery drivers will be reimbursed at the current delivery payment rate per delivery, at a maximum of two deliveries per round trip. 12. In the case of a mistake and redelivery is required, the delivery driver will receive another delivery payment if the mistake was through no fault of their own. 13. The following are examples of delivery driver payments/reimbursements that are available. The delivery drivers receive payments/ reimbursements for: • redeliveries that have resulted through overdue order complaints, only if the initial order was logged out from the restaurant (i.e. order has left the restaurant) after 20 minute timeframe has lapsed; • redelivery due to wrongly supplied delivery details (e.g. wrong address/ phone number supplied by RBL to the delivery driver); • delivery of hoax orders or orders cancelled after the product has left the restaurant (the product must be returned to the restaurant); • redelivery due to miscellaneous circumstances outside the delivery driver’s control; • cost of phone calls made to customers or back to the restaurant from a payphone. 14. The delivery drivers do not receive payments/ reimbursements for: • three or more home deliveries per delivery round, RBL policy is a maximum of two, • complaints indicating driver’s mishandling of the order (e.g. pizza has been dropped by the delivery driver), • redelivery due to the delivery driver not finding the address where the original delivery details are correct (where possible delivery drivers are required to call from a pay phone to clarify the delivery details), • cost of cell phone calls to the customer or back to the restaurant, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 6 of 10 • redelivery due to missing items off the order (e.g. missing garlic bread). \[It is the delivery driver’s responsibility to check that they have the entire order before leaving the restaurant\], • transporting stock between stores, stock transfers are the shift manager’s responsibility, and not the delivery driver’s responsibility. 15. Delivery drivers are not guaranteed any minimum per hour delivery payment. Uniform Requirements 16. Schedule C to the Delivery Driver Contract sets out the uniform requirements for delivery drivers to adhere to health regulations and Pizza Huts professional standards. Key points of the requirements are listed below: • Pizza Hut hat – to be kept clean and worn with visor at front; • Pizza Hut Shirt – to be clean, free from wrinkles, tucked in and with a minimum of 1 button done up; • Name tag – to be visible to customers at all times; • Pizza Hut black trousers – to be clean and properly fitted; • A wedding band and a watch is the only allowable jewellery; and • A clean undershirt may be worn under the uniform. To be black or navy and contain no visible print. 17. Schedule C also states that drivers must practice good daily hygiene. 18. There is also a comment “REMEMBER TO DELIVERY CUSTOMERS YOU ARE PIZZA HUT!” Notice of Taxation Requirements 19. The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements” is a guide contained in the Delivery Driver Handbook which states that: • The delivery driver is not an employee of RBL; • The delivery driver should seek independent taxation advice to understand their rights and obligations; • PAYE will not be deducted from payments for deliveries; • The gross values of all payments received by the delivery driver for deliveries must be included in the delivery driver’s annual income tax return; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 7 of 10 • The delivery driver must calculate and pay their earner premium at the end of the year when they file their tax return; • The delivery driver may be liable to pay provisional tax; and • The delivery driver must register for GST if the delivery driver has income of $40,000 or more (please note, the Delivery Driver handbook has not been updated to reflect the current GST threshold of $60,000, however, it has been verbally communicated to the Delivery Drivers). Making a delivery 20. The guidelines on “Making a Delivery” have suggestions for the manner in which deliveries are to be made, handling customer complaints, and what to do in the event of emergencies. CHAMPS – guidelines on dealing with a customer 21. The CHAMPS guidelines on dealing with a customer includes a problem solving method and actions to take when certain scenarios arise (e.g., if the order has missing items). Certification S5 – Serving Delivery Customers 22. The Delivery Drivers are required to complete and pass this certification to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in the following areas: • Drivers role in CHAMPS; • Service standards; • Driver Safety and Security. Any questions that are incorrect are re-done by the drivers and re-marked by the trainers until the correct answer is recorded and understood by the incumbent delivery driver. Standard Practice Information 23. The delivery drivers are not: • entitled to overtime or sick pay; • required to belong to any union; • able to supervise employees of RBL; • able to access RBL’s administration or support services, however they do have access to staff toilets and product discounts; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 8 of 10 • advertising for work nor do they have their own client base, however there is no restriction for them doing this. 24. Also, the delivery drivers: • are able to decide the hours they work (provided work is expected to be available). It is standard practice that the delivery drivers make themselves available for rostered hours; • provide their own vehicles and associated equipment; • are free to work for another principal; • must hold an appropriate drivers’ license. 25. RBL trains the delivery drivers as to the manner in which deliveries are made. The delivery drivers are instructed as to what geographical area they will work in. 26. RBL employees take orders over the phone and decide the delivery sequence of the orders. A maximum of two orders can be delivered at any one time (to ensure quality control of the product). 27. From time to time RBL may pay at its discretion the delivery drivers a minimum of two deliveries per hour during certain hours, in order to ensure minimum coverage for RBL during quiet periods. 28. Although the delivery driver may find his or her own replacement driver, in practice this does not happen and generally another delivery driver is used by RBL. Relationship between RBL’s employees (employed under a different contract) and delivery drivers 29. In certain cases, employees of RBL may from time to time, be required to perform delivery services. The employees are paid a (taxable allowance) per delivery. Where this is the case, the employees also do other tasks (i.e. making the pizzas, cleaning etc). In contrast, delivery drivers are contracted purely to deliver pizzas and are not asked to perform other tasks. 30. No other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, have a bearing on the conclusions reached in this Ruling. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 9 of 10 Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The terms of the relevant documents entered into by RBL and the delivery driver is exactly the same as those provided to the Inland Revenue in the Ruling application dated 8 December 2009 and by email dated 22 January 2010, except in relation to the following clauses of the Delivery Driver Contract where the basic uniform and hygiene requirements, number of days or dollar amounts (as appropriate) may vary from time to time: • Clause 6, which states that RBL agrees to pay the delivery drivers within 14 days of submission of an invoice. • Clause 7, which states the rate per delivery as a gross amount of $5. • Clause 9.1, which states that a $30 deposit will be retained out of the delivery driver’s first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on the return of the uniform in good condition. • Clause 9.2, which provides that a float of $20 be carried by the delivery driver; • Schedule C, which specifies the current uniform and hygiene requirements. (b) RBL will provide the delivery drivers with the notice of taxation requirements at the commencement of the contract and advise the delivery drivers that as independent contractors they are required to comply with their own income tax, GST and ACC obligations. (c) The actual relationship between RBL and the delivery driver is, and will continue to be during the period this Ruling applies, in accordance with the terms of the relevant documents in all material respects. How the Taxation Laws applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws applies to the Arrangement as follows: • For the purposes of sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) of the Act, payments made by RBL to the delivery driver are not “income from employment” as defined in section YA 1 of the Act, so the driver is not prevented from claiming deductions under these sections by reason only that the driver earns “income from employment”; and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 10 of 10 • For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by the driver to RBL will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of the GST Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act as they are not made under “contracts of service”. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 26 October 2009 and ending on 26 October 2013. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of March 2010. Ross Baxter Investigations Manager, Assurance
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 11/03 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Bank of New Zealand. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CA 1(2), CC 3, CC 4, CC 7, and HM 36. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the offering by Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) of Fly Buys points to Fly Buys members who invest in either of two portfolio investment entity (PIE) funds promoted by BNZ (the BNZ Term PIE and the BNZ Cash PIE, collectively the Funds). This Ruling does not apply to Fly Buys members who habitually redeem Fly Buys points for rewards and then sell the rewards, who redeem Fly Buys points for the purpose of selling rewards, or who receive the relevant Fly Buys points in the course of carrying on a business. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. BNZ Investment Services Limited (the Manager) which is a wholly owned subsidiary of BNZ, is the Issuer and Manager of each Fund. Each Fund is a unit trust established under, and as defined in, the Unit Trusts Act 1960. A prospectus for the Funds has been registered with the Registrar of Companies. An investment statement for each Fund is available from any BNZ store. The respective investment statements set out the terms of the Funds. 2. Customers can invest in each Fund by filling out the relevant application form (provided in the respective investment statement) and depositing money into the account of a person (currently BNZ Investment Services Nominees Limited) nominated by the Trustee of the Funds (New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited). On acceptance of the application form, and clearance of the deposit made in the nominated account, the Manager will subsequently issue units to the investors in that Fund. Each Fund is a multi-rate PIE through which investors are taxed based on their prescribed investor rate (PIR). Key features of the Funds 3. The relevant terms applying to both Funds include the following:  Each Fund invests solely in a New Zealand dollar interest bearing account with BNZ.  An investment made in the Funds does not represent a bank deposit or other liability of BNZ.  An investor does not have a direct interest in any particular deposit made by a Fund with BNZ.  For their investment, investors acquire units in the Funds. Each unit represents an undivided beneficial interest in the assets of the Fund as a whole and does not give the investor an interest in any particular property of the Fund.  An investor and their associated persons cannot hold more than 20% of the units in either Fund.  Payments can be made at any BNZ store or with any BNZ Partner.  Selling and transferring units in the Funds to another person is permitted only with the Manager’s approval. In the Manager’s opinion there is no established market for sales or transfers.  An investor’s units in a Fund are recorded in the investor’s name.  A unit of each Fund has a fixed price of $1. 4. Terms specific to the Term PIE include the following:  Investments are not term deposits but operate similarly.  Each unit is issued for an agreed term and for an agreed rate of return. At the time of investing an investor must select either a maturity date or term for the investment.  A minimum of $5,000 must be maintained in each investment (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time).  Throughout the term of the investment, distribution dates will be calculated based on the frequency of returns selected on the application form.  Investors’ returns are always made by the issue of further units in the Term PIE. Investors can elect that these units be redeemed with the proceeds being paid into a nominated account.  An investor cannot withdraw their investment before the maturity date except in exceptional circumstances and the Manager agrees at its discretion. A break fee will apply for early withdrawals. 5. Terms specific to the Cash PIE include the following:  The initial investment by an investor must be at least $1,000 (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time). The investor may make further investments at any time 2 provided that each further investment is at least $250 (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time).  An investor can withdraw all or part of their investment at any time (subject to the minimum balance requirement of the Cash PIE noted below). If an investor withdraws part of their investment, the Manager may deem the investor to have requested to withdraw also the number of units (if any) required to be cancelled to reflect tax paid or payable by the Fund on income attributed to the investor at their notified PIR. No exit fees are currently payable. The minimum amount that an investor can withdraw from the Fund is $500 (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time).  An investor must maintain at least $1,000 worth of units (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time) unless the investor wishes to withdraw their entire investment. The Manager can require redemption of all remaining units should the investment fall below $1,000 (or other such amount as the Manager may prescribe from time to time).  Returns are distributed to investors on a monthly basis by the issue of further units in the Cash PIE.  The interest rate payable on the Cash PIE’s deposits is the main factor that will affect investors’ returns. As at the date of this Ruling, no fees are payable by investors in the Cash PIE. Fly Buys 6. Fly Buys is New Zealand’s largest loyalty programme. Fly Buys is administered by Loyalty New Zealand Limited (Loyalty NZ) which is jointly owned by BNZ, Foodstuffs Ventures (NZ) Limited, IAG New Zealand Limited, and Z Energy Limited, each company having a 25% shareholding. BNZ and Loyalty NZ are therefore not associated persons (as defined in s YB 2). 7. More than 70% of New Zealand households actively engage in the Fly Buys programme and it has high brand recognition with New Zealand consumers. 8. Membership of Fly Buys is free. Under the programme, Fly Buys points are recorded in a member’s points record for qualifying purchases of goods and services from participating retailers. At the date of this Ruling, the programme has over 40 participating retailers. 9. Each participating retailer and Loyalty NZ agree on the level of Fly Buys points that may be awarded to members by Loyalty NZ. By way of example, as at the date of this Ruling, Z Energy Limited awards 1 point per 20 litres of fuel purchased, New World awards 1 point per $25 spent, and Contact Energy awards 1 point per $50 spent. Participating retailers may also offer bonus points from time to time. 10. From time to time, Loyalty NZ provides members with a points summary setting out the opening points balance, points recorded and deducted during the period, and the closing points balance. 3 11. A member who has sufficient points credited with the Fly Buys programme may request a reward from the then current reward schedule made available by Loyalty NZ. Requests must be made by the member personally, in a way specified by Loyalty NZ from time to time. The number of points required to claim a reward is subject to change without notice. In the reward schedule as at the date of this Ruling, a member requires a minimum of 80 points to claim a reward. All rewards are subject to availability. Kinds of reward include: accommodation, appliances, books, electronics, flights, food and drink, music, tools, and toys. At Loyalty NZ’s option, rewards are posted or delivered to the address of the member, or made available for collection at a location notified to the member. The number of points for redemption of a reward claimed is deducted from the balance in the member’s points record, with the oldest points being deducted first. Points that are awarded but not used by a member within 36 months expire, and are deducted from the balance in the member’s points record. 12. Fly Buys points cannot be sold, transferred, or assigned for cash or other consideration under the Fly Buys Terms and Conditions. The Fly Buys Terms and Conditions do not, however, prohibit rewards received from being sold, transferred, or assigned for cash or other consideration. Fly Buys points cannot be redeemed for, or refunded in, cash. Fly Buys and BNZ 13. As at the date of this Ruling, BNZ offers Fly Buys points on several of its products (the level of which may change from time to time) as follows: Credit Cards Classic Visa or MasterCard $50 spend on purchases = 1 point Classic American Express $25 spend on purchases = 1 point Gold Visa or MasterCard $40 spend on purchases = 1 point Gold American Express $20 spend on purchases = 1 point All Blacks Master Card $40 spend on purchases = 1 point BNZ Platinum Visa 20 Platinum reward points = 1 point Insurance Life insurance, travel insurance $20 spend on premiums = 1 point and general insurance Home Loans (annual average balance) Less than $50,000 108 points per year $50,000 - $149,999 408 points per year More than $149,999 1008 points per year Out of the Box Banking 50 points per banking combo selected Foreign Exchange NZ$100 = 1 point Fly Buys and the Funds 14. Under the Arrangement, BNZ will offer Fly Buys points to Fly Buys members who invest in either Fund. Those Fly Buys points will be credited to the member’s points record by Loyalty NZ at the direction of BNZ. Fly Buys points may be offered to investors in several ways (all, none, or some of which may be offered at any time). The ways of awarding Fly Buys points that form part of this Arrangement are by awarding:  points on opening a new investment in a Fund; 4  points on re-investing a maturing Term PIE investment into a new Term PIE investment;  points to investors who choose to receive their investment information online;  points on an annual basis assuming the minimum balance is maintained;  points on a points per unit held basis;  points annually based on the average balance for the year;  points on a monthly basis based on the average balance per month;  points when an investor reaches a certain saving hurdle in addition to any points awarded per dollar invested;  points based on the term of the investment;  points to investors who set up regular investment amounts by automatic payment or other regular contribution method. 15. From time to time, BNZ may also consider additional ways to award Fly Buys points in respect of each Fund. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax treatment of other ways of awarding Fly Buys points. 16. The Funds pay a market rate of return on amounts invested with them, independently of any Fly Buys points awarded. Investors in each Fund will be entitled to receive the same pre-tax rate of return on their units in the Fund, regardless of whether they hold a Fly Buys membership. Investors who are not Fly Buys members or members who do not provide their membership number to the Manager will not receive points, and will not receive any other reward from BNZ or Loyalty NZ in lieu of the points. A member cannot require BNZ or Loyalty NZ to pay a cash amount in substitution for points. 17. At present, the cost to BNZ of the Fly Buys points awarded to the investors in a Fund, do not impact on the rate of return BNZ pays to a Fund (and therefore the rate of return a Fund pays to individual investors). In any event, the cost to BNZ of awarding Fly Buys points will only ever be taken into account in determining the rate of return payable by BNZ to the Fund to the extent the total costs incurred by BNZ in relation to the Fund are taken into account in determining that rate and the costs associated with the award of Fly Buys points are included in those total costs. 18. An investment in each Fund is a separate contractual arrangement to a member’s Fly Buys membership and each one can (and does) exist without the other. BNZ and Loyalty NZ reserve the right to withdraw or amend any points offer at any time, and this does not affect a member’s return from their investment in each Fund or give them any contractual basis to terminate that investment. Members have no recourse against the Fund if the advertised points are not awarded because of the failure of Loyalty NZ. 5 How Fly Buys points will be awarded 19. Investors in each Fund who are Fly Buys members will be able to record their Fly Buys membership number on their application form. The Manager will pass this information on to BNZ. The Manager (and therefore each Fund and the underlying investors) does not have any additional costs associated with the award of points. 20. BNZ will send regular data to Loyalty NZ to enable the points to be awarded to each Fly Buys member for the relevant period. (This information will include Fly Buys points in relation to the Funds, and any other BNZ product offering Fly Buys points.) Loyalty NZ, through its relationship with the Fly Buys member, will credit the requisite number of points to the member’s points record. 21. Points awarded by all participating retailers are recorded in a similar manner. The points awarded by BNZ to a Fly Buys member will accumulate alongside points awarded to that member from other participating retailers. At this point the points are homogenous. Fly Buys does, however, track when points are awarded to measure whether the points have expired. 22. BNZ will share with Loyalty NZ the revenue generated by investors purchasing units in each Fund, in consideration for Loyalty NZ promoting, and for the administration of, the Fly Buys programme. 23. It is possible that from time to time BNZ may promote a product with a bonus level of points (e.g. on initial investment). The total volume of Fly Buys points awarded under the Arrangement to an investor in an income year and any reward those points may be redeemed for are not significant compared with the return to the investor from their investment in the Funds. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner T his Ru ling is made subject to the following conditions: a) Each Fund pays a market rate of return to investors. b) The award of Fly Buys points will only ever be taken into account in determining the rate of return payable by BNZ to each Fund (and therefore the rate of return each Fund pays to its individual investors) to the extent the total costs incurred by BNZ in relation to the Fund’s deposit with BNZ are taken into account in determining that rate and the costs associated with the award of Fly Buys points are included in those total costs. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  No income arises to a Fly Buys member under s CA 1(2) when the member receives Fly Buys points. 6 7  No income arises to a Fly Buys member under s CC 3(1) when the member receives Fly Buys points.  No interest income arises to a Fly Buys member under s CC 4(1) when the member receives Fly Buys points.  No deemed interest income arises to a Fly Buys member under s CC 7 when the member receives Fly Buys points.  The award of Fly Buys points is not attributed PIE income for an investor under s HM 36. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 23 September 2011 and ending on 30 September 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 22 nd day of July 2011. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 11/04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling (“the Applicant”) This Ruling has been applied for by Kiwibank Limited (“Kiwibank”). Taxation laws This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1, RE 1 to RE 10, RF 2, RF 3 and RF 4 of the Income Tax Act 2007; (b) ss 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971; (c) the s 2 definition of “disposition of property” in the Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968. Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product that Kiwibank intends to offer to its customers. The product is to be marketed as the Kiwibank Offset Mortgage. For the purposes of this application, the Kiwibank Offset Mortgage is referred to as “the product” or “the Arrangement”. The product allows a customer to elect that interest payable by the customer on a loan made by Kiwibank should be calculated by offsetting the balance of the loan against the aggregate credit balances of certain nominated transaction and savings and investments bank accounts (hereafter referred to as “credit accounts”) held by either that customer or, certain other eligible persons. Interest is payable on the net notional balance of these combined accounts. This Ruling does not consider the tax consequences of any arrangement under which a credit account holder agrees to offset his or her credit account balance against another person's home loan account balance in return for valuable consideration. Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. 2 Background 1. The product is a new feature that Kiwibank is seeking to offer to new and existing customers. The product is intended to enhance Kiwibank’s competitiveness and to give Kiwibank customers a new way to manage their money. The product can affect the way in which interest is calculated on home loans offered by Kiwibank that have an agreed fixed periodic repayment arrangement (also referred to as the “table portion” of a home loan). 2. Kiwibank also offers home loans with a revolving credit feature whereby amounts can be repaid or re-borrowed at any time provided the principal, interest, fees and costs on the home loans do not exceed the specified maximum credit limit (also referred to as the “revolving portion” of a home loan). The product does not apply to “revolving portion” home loans. 3. In overall commercial terms, the economic consequences for a customer of using the product, or using a revolving portion home loan product bearing a variable interest rate, are broadly the same. 4. Currently, customers of Kiwibank may elect for their table portion home loan to have one or more of three components: fixed, variable, and construction components. 5. The “fixed component” of the home loan is subject to a fixed interest rate for a fixed term. Customers may repay all or part of a fixed component at any time, although in certain circumstances they may be charged with a fixed rate break cost for making any repayment that exceeds an early repayment limit agreed with Kiwibank. 6. The “variable component” of the home loan is subject to a variable interest rate. Customers may repay all or part of a variable component of a home loan at any time without any break costs. 7. The “construction component” of the home loan is available where the home loan is obtained for the purpose of buying land and building a house on it or renovating a house on land the borrower already owns. The construction component of the home loan is subject to a variable interest rate and can be borrowed in stages (as opposed to a fixed or variable component which must be borrowed in a lump sum). 8. Kiwibank recognises that customers may have a range of accounts, including various deposit and loan accounts. Therefore, Kiwibank is introducing with the product a new component called an “offset variable component”, 9. When a customer elects that all or part of a home loan is to have an offset variable component, interest accruing on that home loan, or that portion of the home loan, is to be calculated by reference to a notional balance. The notional balance is calculated by offsetting the debit balance of the offset variable component of the home loan against the total credit balances of nominated everyday banking and savings and investments accounts (referred to as the “credit accounts”). This lowers the interest payable and the variable component of the home loan. Therefore, it results in a greater proportion of a customer’s regular loan repayments being applied in reduction of the principal of the offset variable component of the home loan. 10. This new feature effectively treats a group of accounts in a collective or aggregated manner for the purposes of calculating interest accrued on the 3 offset variable component of the home loan. This new feature is intended to make the Kiwibank overall banking relationship more attractive to current and potential customers. 11. Outlined in this section are the primaryfeatures of the product: • interest calculations • eligibility requirements • other features • terms and conditions • groups of account Interest calculations Calculations of interest on an offset variable component of a home loan 12. Interest payable on an offset variable component of the nominated home loan is calculated by reference to a notional balance. This notional balance is determined, for the purposes of that calculation only, by reducing the balance of the offset variable component of the home loan by the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts. 13. The rate of interest applicable to the product is the “offset variable interest rate” that is specified from time to time to be applicable to the product. The offset variable interest rate is one of several different rates that Kiwibank uses under its Home Loan Terms and Conditions. The offset variable interest rate may be above or below Kiwibank’s variable interest rate. Initially, the offset variable interest rate will be set below the variable interest rate to attract new customers. 14. Interest is not calculated separately in respect of each account and then offset. Instead, a net notional balance is calculated across all the relevant accounts. The notional balance equals the offset variable component of the home loan less (ie, “offset” against) the credit balances of up to eight nominated credit accounts. Interest is then payable on that net balance at the offset variable interest rate. This is the case as a matter of law (in terms of the terms of contractual relationship under the Home Loan Agreement and the terms and conditions applicable to home loans offered by Kiwibank) and as a matter of practice (in terms of Kiwibank’s computer and accounting systems). 15. The offsetting is solely for the purpose of calculating the notional balance on which interest is calculated. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or “netting” of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. Importantly, the customer has no legal entitlement to interest on credit balances. This is the case, even if the customer’s total credit balances exceed the customer’s home loan balance. 16. Interest is calculated on a daily basis and is debited to the home loan account on a regular basis. Loan repayments are credited periodically into the home loan accounts, which will pay the periodic interest and reduce the principal outstanding. Such payments are made from a Kiwibank account that the customer has selected. This account may be an account that the customer has nominated to participate in the product. 4 17. The offsetting aspect of the product essentially offers the same economic benefits to customers as a revolving portion home loan in terms of reduced interest costs (through a reduced balance on which interest is calculated) and consequently accelerated loan repayment. With a revolving portion home loan, funds that would otherwise be in a savings or cheque account are paid into the loan account (but are available to be redrawn). No interest is payable on credit accounts 18. No interest is payable by Kiwibank on the credit balances of the credit accounts that customers have nominated to participate in the product. This is regardless of whether those credit balances exceed the debit balance of the home loan facility. This means that if the debit balance of a home loan facility is less than the aggregate of the credit balances of the nominated credit accounts, no interest is paid or payable by Kiwibank. Eligibility requirements 19. The product is only available to: • an individual who holds a home loan with Kiwibank • two individuals who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship and who hold a home loan with Kiwibank. 20. Additional people who may elect to offset their Kiwibank credit account against the home loan of a customer are: • child or children of the customer (or one of the customers) • parent or parents of the customer (or one of the customers). 21. Children and parents of customers may have a registered address with Kiwibank that is different from that of the customers. 22. An offset variable component of a home loan may be offset by up to eight credit accounts of the customers or other eligible people. Other features of an offset variable component 23. The offset variable component is not an independent product; it is a component of a home loan. The following features (amongst others) apply to the offset variable component along with the other components of a table portion home loan: • Interest is calculated on a daily basis, and is debited to the home loan account on each specific payment date. • Customers may repay all or part of an offset variable component of a home loan at any time without any break costs. • The interest and principal of an offset variable component are repayable by way of regular payment cycles over the term of the offset variable component, except in relation to any applicable interest - only period. Only interest payments are required to be made during an interest only period. 5 • All amounts owing under the table portion (including any offset variable component and other components) must be repaid in full on the last day of the home loan term. • The offset variable interest rate can vary at any time. Kiwibank will give the customer notice before changing the rate: − If the offset variable interest rate increases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will automatically increase if this is necessary to enable the customer to pay off the offset variable component over the agreed term. − If the offset variable interest rate decreases, the customer’s regular payments for the offset variable component will remain the same, so the term of the home loan will shorten. However, the customer can elect to reduce the amount of the regular payment so that the offset variable component can be repaid over the same term. • The product will be offered to customers having an existing variable rate table portion home loan facility. If an existing customer elects to convert a part or all of an existing variable rate table portion home loan to have an offset variable component, the customer must agree that Kiwibank’s applicable terms and conditions for the product will apply. All new customers will sign new terms and conditions applicable to all Kiwibank accounts, which will, by definition, include the terms and conditions applicable to the product. • A customer may have more than one loan account to which the terms and conditions of the product apply, but each such loan account is treated separately. • A transaction or deposit account (eg, everyday banking and savings and investments accounts) may be nominated to link to a single home loan account only under the product terms and conditions. • A monthly fee will be charged to the customer of the home loan account. The fee is charged against one of the customer’s Kiwibank accounts other than the home loan account. Terms and conditions for the product 24. Each Kiwibank home loan is documented under a collection of documents: • The Home Loan Terms and Conditions, which are contained in a booklet that Kiwibank issues (as amended and updated from time to time) and which set out the generic provisions applicable to all Kiwibank home loan facilities. • The Home Loan Agreement, which contains specific provisions about the home loan facility that is being made available to a specific customer, including the amount and timing of regular payments calculated on a basis that will repay the loan over the applicable term. • The General Terms and Conditions, which contains the terms that govern the general banking relationship between Kiwibank and its customers. The General Terms and Conditions may also contain specific terms and 6 conditions that apply to particular accounts and services. If any part of the General Terms and Conditions and the Home Loan Terms and Conditions conflict, then the Home Loan Terms and Conditions will prevail. Groups of accounts 25. The product is based on a group of participating accounts. The following rules explain the accounts that may be included in the group. 26. The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de–facto, and civil union couples, any of their children, and any of their parents may be combined as part of one group. 27. To illustrate, Sarah and Peter have a home loan facility with Kiwibank. Sarah, Peter, and their child Michael each have a savings account with Kiwibank. Sarah and Peter’s home loan facility could be offset by any or all of the credit balances of the various accounts held by Sarah, Peter and Michael. 28. Borrowers of the home loan facility and owner of other transaction accounts nominated for the offset feature must be either: • all residents of New Zealand for tax purposes; or • all non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. 29. Companies, trusts and sole traders are ineligible to participate in this product. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner The amount of interest payable under the product is determined by Kiwibank in accordance with arm's length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows. Financial arrangements rules For the purposes of applying ss EW 15 and EW 31 in calculating income and expenditure arising under the operation of the “financial arrangements rules” (as defined in s EW 1(2)), no amount of consideration is paid or is payable by virtue of a debit balance of a home loan account being offset by a credit balance of a credit account under the Arrangement. Section CC 7 No income arises under s CC 7 for Kiwibank or its customers in relation to the Arrangement. Resident withholding tax, non- resident withholding tax, and approved issuer levy 7 For the purposes of the resident withholding tax rules (as defined in s RE 1(1)) and the non-resident withholding tax rules (as defined in s RF 1(1)), there is no payment of, or entitlement to, interest in relation to the credit accounts participating under the Arrangement that would give rise to an obligation to deduct resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax or to pay approved issuer levy. Tax avoidance Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. Gift duty Where the balance of a credit account owned by one person is offset against the balance of the offset variable component of a home loan account of another person , there is no “disposition of property” (as defined under s 2(2) of the Estate and Gift Duty Act 1968). Therefore, gift duty does not apply. The period or income year for which this Rulings applies The Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 27 May 2011 and ending on 31 May 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 26th day of August 2011. Fiona Heiford Manager, Taxpayer Rulings
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 11/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Telecom Corporation of New Zealand Limited (Telecom). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (Act) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of the Act, in particular ss BD 1, BG 1, part C, ss DA 1, DB 23, DB 49, ED 1, and GA 1 and the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, in particular ss 61 and 63. This Ruling uses the following term defined in the Telecommunications Act 2001: “Demerger Distribution”. This Ruling uses the following term defined in s 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968: “dutiable gift”. This Ruling uses the following terms defined in s YA 1: “assessable income”, “dividend”, “identical share”, “original share”, “returning share transfer”, “share- lending arrangement”, “share supplier” and “share user”. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies References in this Ruling to: • “Telecom Group” or “Telecom companies” mean Telecom and its subsidiaries at the relevant time. • “Chorus Group” or “Chorus companies” mean Chorus Limited (Chorus), the listed parent of the Chorus group of companies to be demerged from the Telecom Group, and its subsidiaries at the relevant time. The Arrangement is the demerger of Chorus (including the Chorus Group and Chorus companies) from Telecom (including the Telecom Group and Telecom companies) (Demerger) to bring about the structural separation of the Telecom Group’s network infrastructure businesses (Chorus Businesses) from its other retail-focused businesses to meet the independence requirement of the Ultra-Fast Broadband (UFB) Initiative the Government announced in September 2009. The Demerger will involve the following steps (which are described further in paragraph 19): • On 1 July 2011 Telecom established the Chorus companies, being Chorus, and Chorus’s wholly-owned subsidiary Chorus New Zealand Limited (Chorus New Zealand), with nominal ordinary share capital. • To enable Chorus New Zealand to purchase the Chorus assets from the Telecom companies, Chorus will, on or around the date on which that purchase is to be completed, issue additional share capital to Telecom, and will borrow under a loan facility from third party banks. Chorus New Zealand will similarly issue additional share capital to Chorus and will also borrow from Chorus under an inter-company loan. (Chorus may also be entitled to receive an amount from a Telecom company in connection with the issue of bonds to be exchanged for bonds currently on issue by a Telecom company, and for agreeing to assume liability under related swap transactions. To that extent, the amount Chorus is required to draw-down under its loan facility will be reduced.) • Chorus New Zealand will purchase the Chorus assets and liabilities from the Telecom companies for an amount to be determined (but expected to fall within a range of NZ$2 billion to NZ$2.5 billion). • Telecom will distribute its shares in Chorus to Telecom’s existing shareholders, or to a sale agent in the case of ineligible overseas shareholders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background to the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative Objective of the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative 1. The Government announced the UFB Initiative in September 2009. In October 2009, the Government released New Zealand Government Ultra- Fast Broadband Initiative: Invitation to Participate in Partner Selection Process (Ministry of Economic Development, October 2009) (Invitation to Participate) setting out the process and terms and conditions for the selection of government partners in the UFB Initiative. The Invitation to Participate sets out the Government’s overall objective for the UFB Initiative (UFB Objective) as follows (footnotes omitted): 1.1 Ultra-fast Broadband Initiative (a) The government’s overall objective for the ultra-fast broadband investment initiative (UFB Initiative) is: To accelerate the roll-out of ultra-fast broadband to 75 percent of New Zealanders over ten years, concentrating in the first six years on priority broadband users such as businesses, schools and health services, plus greenfield developments and certain tranches of residential areas (UFB Objective). 2. The Government intends to invest up to NZ$1.5 billion towards achieving the UFB Objective, with the expectation that this will be at least matched by private sector investment. Structure of investment in the Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative 3. Crown Fibre Holdings Limited (Crown Fibre) will manage the Government’s investment in the UFB Initiative. Crown Fibre is a wholly-owned Crown investment company incorporated on 29 October 2009. Crown Fibre was responsible for conducting the partner selection process, and will manage the Government’s investment in the fibre-optic communications network in the future. 2 4. One of Crown Fibre's core roles was to select parties with which to co- invest in the UFB Initiative (Partners). Telecom was a participant in this partner selection process. On 24 May 2011, the Communications and Information Technology Minister, Steven Joyce, announced that an agreement had been reached with Telecom under which Telecom would build a fibre-optic network in Auckland, the eastern and lower North Island, and most of the South Island. 5. The Government's investment in the UFB Initiative is to be effected through local fibre companies. Local fibre companies will deploy the fibre networks and sell access to products on those networks. In the case of Telecom's proposal, Chorus will in effect be the local fibre company, although the terms of the arrangements between Crown Fibre and Chorus are not identical to the terms envisaged by the Invitation to Participate. Requirement for independence 6. The New Zealand Government Ultra-Fast Broadband Initiative: Overview of Initiative (Ministry of Economic Development, September 2009) outlined the requirements that local fibre companies operate on an independent basis and provides as follows (footnotes omitted): 66. The following principles will apply: ... • independence - LFCs \[local fibre companies\] will be prohibited from providing retail services. 67 In terms of independence, in the event that a prospective LFC partner currently owns a retail operation, the party either: • must divest itself of the retail operation (or alternatively alter governance arrangements so that it does not control the retail operation); or • will not have the right to appoint the majority of directors to the Board of the relevant LFC, and the chair of the LFC Board must be an independent chair agreed to by all shareholders. 7. This condition is repeated as one of the UFB Initiative’s “open access requirements” in the Invitation to Participate, which provides as follows: 13. Open Access Requirements ... These are the Open Access requirements. 13.4 Impact of current telecommunications operations In the event that a prospective Partner, or a related or associated entity of the Partner, currently (or at any time while a Partner) owns or controls a business which provides any Telecommunications Service other than the Permitted Services, the Partner: (a) must fully divest, or must ensure that the Partner's related or associated entity fully divests, itself of that business; or (b) may not appoint the majority of directors to the Board of the relevant LFC \[local fibre company\], and the chair of the LFC Board must be an independent chair agreed to by all shareholders. 3 8. “Permitted Services” are services of the type that will be provided in relation to the fibre optic network infrastructure. Permitted Services (and related terms) are defined in the Invitation to Participate as follows: 7. DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION 7.1 Definitions The terms used in this document shall have the following meanings: ... Layer 1 means layer 1 of the OSI Model, which is normally associated with passive fibre optic network infrastructure; Layer 1 Service means any service which operates at Layer 1; Layer 2 means layer 2 of the OSI Model, which is normally associated with active fibre optic network infrastructure; Layer 2 Service means any service which operates at Layer 2; ... OSI Model means the seven-layer model of network architecture known as the Open Systems Interconnection Model; ... Permitted Services means the services that may be provided by an LFC \[local fibre company\], being any Layer 1 Services and, subject to CFH \[Crown Fibre\] consent, any Layer 2 Service; ... Application to the Telecom Group 9. The Telecom Group has a significant operating business unit devoted to the provision of retail telecommunications services to the household and business markets. Because these retail services are not Permitted Services, a member of the Telecom Group would have been prevented from being a Partner unless it was prepared to comply with the requirement not to appoint the majority of the directors of the board of the local fibre company and to accept an independent board chair. Telecom considered that option commercially unacceptable, because it would not have given it the requisite degree of control over the local fibre company. Therefore, Telecom formed the view that the only way it could realistically participate in the UFB Initiative would be to structurally separate. 10. Telecom decided that for its network and wholesale business units (which do provide Permitted Services) to participate as a bidder in the UFB Initiative, it would (subject to its bid being successful and receiving relevant approvals, including shareholder approval) demerge and structurally separate those business units (ie, the Chorus Businesses) from its other business units, which predominantly involve the provision of retail telecommunications services. The entities carrying on the Chorus Businesses following the Demerger (ie, the Chorus companies) will be eligible to participate in the UFB Initiative without breaching the specific requirements imposed by the Government and in a way that does not unduly restrict the Chorus Group's governance arrangements. 4 Regulatory implications of structural separation 11. The Discussion Document: Regulatory Implications of Structural Separation (Ministry of Economic Development, September 2010) sets out the regulatory implications of the structural separation of Telecom as follows: 2 Overview 14 Structural separation would represent a significant change to the structure of the New Zealand telecommunications industry. Historically, the industry has been dominated by a vertically integrated incumbent operating at all levels of the market, which has given rise to issues regarding the effectiveness of competition. The new split would affect both legacy and next generation access infrastructure. ... The Demerger 12. The following diagram summarises the current structure of the Telecom Group. Current Structure of Telecom Group Public shareholders Telecom Telecom companies Chorus assets Overview 13. Effecting the Demerger requires the following: • The establishment of the Chorus companies to separately hold and carry on the Chorus Businesses. • The transfer of assets and liabilities of the Chorus Businesses (designated assets and liabilities), by the Telecom companies that hold or are party to those assets and liabilities immediately before the transfer to Chorus New Zealand and the entering into of certain transitional and long-term commercial arrangements between one or more Telecom companies and one or more Chorus companies. (The designated assets and liabilities will be described in the Separation 5 Deed (see paragraph 14) and in a proposal approved by Order in Council made under s 46 of the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2011 (Broadband Act).) • The capitalisation of and provision of interim funding to Chorus and Chorus New Zealand to enable Chorus New Zealand to acquire the assets and liabilities of the Chorus Businesses. • The distribution, to each holder of ordinary shares in Telecom, of ordinary shares in Chorus under an arrangement approved by the High Court under part 15 of the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act) (subject to the position of ineligible overseas shareholders discussed in paras 22 and 23). 14. The Demerger will be carried out in accordance with: • the Broadband Act; • a scheme of arrangement approved by the High Court; • a separation deed between the relevant companies (Separation Deed). 15. The Broadband Act amends the Telecommunications Act 2001. The Broadband Act contains measures to reform certain regulatory provisions currently applicable to the Telecom Group to reflect the structural separation of the Telecom Group and the Government’s UFB Initiative. The legislation deals with aspects of the Demerger that are affected by existing legislation and provides for certain outcomes different from those that would otherwise result (eg, in respect of public works and resource management matters). The Broadband Act also contains measures providing for the application of the Inland Revenue Acts to the Demerger. 16. The scheme of arrangement approved by the High Court under part 15 of the Companies Act will use a procedure for corporate reorganisations that involves obtaining shareholder approval, and consideration by the High Court of the interests of certain parties. The scheme will describe and give legal effect to the steps by which Chorus shares are to be distributed to Telecom shareholders, and will give legal effect to the Separation Deed. 17. The Separation Deed will provide for the transfer of the designated assets and liabilities to the Chorus Group, the assignment or novation of certain contracts related to the Chorus Businesses to the Chorus Group, and certain transitional arrangements between the Telecom Group and the Chorus Group. 18. Following the Arrangement, Telecom and Chorus will exist and operate as separate entities with separate ownership and management structures. Telecom will remain listed on the New Zealand stock exchange (NZSX) and Australian Securities Exchange and it is intended that Chorus will be listed on both the NZSX and Australian Securities Exchange. Telecom American Depository Shares (ADSs) will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Chorus shares or ADSs are not intended to be listed in the United States, but it is expected that Chorus ADSs will trade on an over- the-counter basis in the United States. 6 Capitalisation of Chorus and Chorus companies and distribution to Telecom shareholders 19. The four steps by which the Demerger will occur are summarised in the text and diagrams that follow (all figures are approximate, and amounts payable may be settled by payment direction in some cases). 20. References to the “Demerger Date” are to the date on which Chorus New Zealand acquires the Chorus Businesses under the Separation Deed and on which the Demerger Distribution is provided to Telecom shareholders. This date is expected to be 30 November 2011 or such other date as is determined by the board of directors of Telecom and notified by Telecom to the NZSX, Australian Securities Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Step 1: Telecom establishes the Chorus companies with nominal ordinary share capital. Step 1: Telecom Demerger Public shareholders Telecom Telecom companies Chorus assets Chorus (Nominal capital, eg NZ$100) Chorus New Zealand (Nominal capital, eg NZ$100) Before Telecom applies for initial court orders (i) On 1 July 2011, the Chorus companies (being Chorus and Chorus New Zealand) were incorporated with nominal share capital. As at the date of this ruling, Telecom holds all of the shares in Chorus and Chorus in turn holds all of the shares in Chorus New Zealand. Following receipt of final court orders (ii) For a certain period of days before the Demerger Date (expected to be seven business days in the case of trading on the Australian Securities Exchange, and five business days in the case of trading on the NZSX): 7 • Telecom will trade on an “ex-demerger entitlements” basis; • Chorus will trade (initially on a deferred settlement basis). On the Demerger Date Step 2: Telecom capitalises Chorus and Chorus in turn capitalises Chorus New Zealand in an equal amount. Chorus borrows an amount under an interim loan facility from third party banks. Step 2: Telecom Demerger Public shareholders Telecom Telecom companies Chorus assets Chorus Issuance of ordinary shares Chorus New Zealand Issuance of ordinary shares and inter- company loan Third party banks Interim loan Facility (iv) On the Demerger Date, Telecom will subscribe for such number of Chorus shares as will, together with the existing Chorus shares, enable Telecom to make the pro rata distribution referred to in Step 4 below, in consideration for an aggregate issue price to be determined having regard to each of the purchase price payable by Chorus New Zealand under the Separation Deed and the amount Chorus will have available from borrowings. (v) Chorus will in turn subscribe for an equivalent number of Chorus New Zealand shares in consideration for an equivalent aggregate issue price. (vi) Chorus will provide a loan to Chorus New Zealand of an amount sufficient (when considered together with the subscription amount received for the Chorus New Zealand shares) for Chorus New Zealand to pay the purchase price under the Separation Deed. Chorus will obtain the funds for the loan to Chorus New Zealand 8 from sources which include a drawdown under an interim loan facility of an amount expected to fall within a range of NZ$1.5 billion to NZ$2 billion. (Chorus may also be entitled to receive an amount from a Telecom company in connection with the issue of bonds to be exchanged for bonds currently on issue by a Telecom company, and for agreeing to assume liability under related swap transactions. To that extent, the amount Chorus is required to draw-down under its loan facility will be reduced.) Step 3: Chorus New Zealand purchases the Chorus assets from the Telecom companies. Step 3: Telecom Demerger Public shareholders Telecom Telecom companies Chorus Chorus New Zealand Chorus assets Purchase price Interim loan facility Third party banks Ordinary shares and inter-company loan (vii) The designated assets and liabilities will transfer to Chorus New Zealand from the relevant Telecom companies. (viii) Using the proceeds of the share issues and the funds borrowed under the interim loan facility and received in connection with the bond exchange and assumption of swaps as described in (vi) above, if any (and on-lent by Chorus to Chorus New Zealand), Chorus New Zealand will pay to the relevant Telecom companies an aggregate amount that is to be determined (but expected to fall within a range of NZ$2 billion to NZ$2.5 billion) in consideration for the transfer of the assets and liabilities under the Separation Deed. 9 Step 4: Telecom distributes its shares in Chorus to Telecom’s existing shareholders Step 4: Telecom Demerger Public shareholders Telecom Telecom companies Public shareholders Chorus Chorus New Zealand Chorus assets Third party banks Interim loan facility Ordinary shares and inter-company loan (ix) On the Demerger Date, Telecom will make the Demerger Distribution by the following mechanism: (a) Telecom will make a pro rata distribution (the Demerger Distribution) to Telecom shareholders, conferring on such holders an entitlement to an amount to be ascertained by reference to the volume weighted average price of the Chorus shares as traded on the NZSX over the last five trading days before the Demerger Date (and in accordance with the ratio of Telecom shares to Chorus shares and the approach to rounding described in (b) below). (b) Each Eligible Shareholder’s entitlement to the pro rata distribution amount will be automatically applied to acquire from Telecom the relevant number of Chorus shares to be distributed to that Telecom shareholder. Each Eligible Shareholder will receive a distribution of one Chorus share for every five Telecom shares held, with the number of Chorus shares to be rounded if necessary to the nearest whole number in circumstances where there may otherwise be fractional interests in Chorus shares. (c) In the case of ineligible overseas shareholders (being a shareholder other than an Eligible Shareholder), the Chorus shares that such holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Demerger Distribution will be transferred to a sale agent, who will then sell them and pay to each ineligible overseas shareholder its share of the net proceeds of sale of those Chorus shares. (x) Telecom will record the distribution in its accounts (for accounting purposes) partly as a return of capital and partly as a distribution of 10 retained earnings. The amount of the return of capital part will be calculated by: (a) dividing an amount “A” (being the number of Chorus shares on issue immediately following the Demerger Distribution multiplied by the volume weighted average price of the Chorus shares as traded on the NZSX over the last five trading days before the Demerger Date); by (b) the sum of amount “A” referred to in subparagraph (a) and an amount “B” (being the number of Telecom shares on issue immediately following the Demerger Distribution multiplied by the volume weighted average price of Telecom shares as traded on the NZSX over the last five trading days before the Demerger Date, on the basis that the Telecom shares trade on an ex-demerger entitlements basis on the NZSX for the whole of this period); and (c) multiplying the result by the balance of Telecom’s share capital account immediately before the distribution. The part of the distribution that is not a return of capital (as calculated above) will be recorded in Telecom’s accounts (for accounting purposes) as a dividend. 21. After the Demerger, the Telecom Group and the Chorus Group will exist and operate as separate corporate groups with separate ownership and management structures. Before the Demerger a transitional governance structure will be established in respect of the Telecom Group and the Chorus Group. The Telecom Group and the Chorus Group will enter into transitional and long-term commercial arrangements involving supplies being made between both groups after the Demerger. Ineligible overseas shareholders 22. Certain Telecom shareholders will not be eligible to participate in the Demerger Distribution in the same way as other shareholders. Ineligible overseas shareholders are those Telecom shareholders who are not, on the record date for the demerger, Eligible Shareholders. “Eligible Shareholders” are Telecom shareholders whose registered address as at 7:00 pm on the record date is in: • New Zealand, Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom Canada, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, Norway, the Netherlands, Singapore or Switzerland; or • a jurisdiction in which Telecom reasonably believes that it is not prohibited and not unduly onerous or impracticable to distribute Chorus shares to a Telecom shareholder pursuant to the demerger. 23. The shares in Chorus that the ineligible overseas shareholders would otherwise have been entitled to receive as a result of the Demerger Distribution, will be transferred to a sale agent, who will sell them on the NZSX and pay to each ineligible overseas shareholder its share of the net proceeds of sale of those Chorus shares. 11 Relevant Documents 24. The following documents are relevant to the Arrangement: • Telecommunications Act 2001, as amended by the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2011; • draft Scheme Booklet dated 26 August 2011, provided to Inland Revenue on 26 August 2011; • draft Separation Arrangement Plan, provided to Inland Revenue on 29 August 2011. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) Subpart 2 of Part 2 of the Broadband Act has come into force. This condition will be satisfied: (i) if an Order in Council has been made under s 36 of the Broadband Act; and (ii) from and including the date on which the Demerger Distribution is made. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: • For each holder of a Telecom ordinary share or shares, the Demerger Distribution will not constitute: - a dividend under subpart CD of the Act; - any other form of assessable income under s BD 1 or part C of the Act; or - a dutiable gift under the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. • For the purposes of ss CA 1, CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, CB 5, CH 1, DB 49 and ED 1, a holder of a Telecom ordinary share or shares who receives a share or shares in Chorus as a result of the Demerger Distribution, is treated as having acquired that Chorus share or shares for the same purposes and at the same time as the Telecom shareholder acquired the Telecom share or shares in respect of which that Demerger Distribution was made. • For the purposes of ss CH 1, DA 1, DB 23, DB 49 and ED 1, a holder of a Telecom ordinary share or shares who receives a share or shares in Chorus as a consequence of the Demerger Distribution shall be treated as having paid an amount given by the following formula, for the acquisition of the Chorus share or shares received and the corresponding Telecom ordinary share or shares (as applicable): 12 pre-calculation amount paid x individual MV combined MV Where the: (i) pre-calculation amount paid is the person’s expenditure or loss incurred in acquiring the relevant Telecom ordinary share or shares (ignoring the provisions of the Broadband Act); (ii) individual MV is the market capitalisation on the implementation date of the demerger of either Chorus or Telecom, as applicable; (iii) combined MV is the total market capitalisation, on the implementation date of the demerger of the Chorus and Telecom. For these purposes, “market capitalisation on the implementation date of the demerger” means the number of Chorus shares or Telecom shares (as applicable) on issue immediately following the Demerger Distribution multiplied by the volume weighted average price of Chorus shares or Telecom shares (as applicable) as traded on the NZSX over the first five trading days, starting on the date from which Chorus is listed (provided that an alternative method of calculating market capitalisation has not been prescribed by an Order in Council made under s 46 of the Broadband Act). • If, on or before the date on which the Demerger Distribution occurs, and ignoring the effect of the Broadband Act, an arrangement is, or would but for the Demerger Distribution, be a returning share transfer under which a Telecom share is an original share, and under the arrangement the share user is required to transfer a Chorus share to the share supplier (a “Telecom Securities Lending Arrangement”): (i) that arrangement will continue to be a returning share transfer after the Demerger Distribution; and (ii) a Chorus share will be treated as forming part of a Telecom share for the purposes of s ED 1 and the definitions of “identical share” and “original share” in s YA 1. • For a Telecom Securities Lending Arrangement that meets the definition of “returning share transfer” or “share-lending arrangement” in s YA 1 (taking into account the ruling set out in the fourth bullet point above), the rulings in the second and third bullet points above apply equally to the relevant share supplier under that Telecom Securities Lending Arrangement as if that share supplier were the shareholder referred to in those rulings. • Sections BG 1 and GA 1 will not apply to vary or negate any of the above ruling bullet points. 13 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2011 and ending on 30 June 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 30 th day of August 2011. Dinesh Gupta Manager (Taxpayer Rulings) 14
1 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 11/06 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by St Lukes Group Limited. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 5(11D)–(11I) and 8. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the provision of the electronic gift card scheme (Westfield Gift Card scheme) whereby customers can purchase Westfield Gift Cards and the card holders can redeem them for goods and services supplied by the participating stores and, on limited occasions, by the applicant. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Details of the Arrangement Parties to the Arrangement 1. The Arrangement involves:  the applicant: St Lukes Group Limited, being the provider of the Westfield Gift Card scheme and the owner of Westfield Gift Cards;  participating stores: the stores within Westfield shopping malls in which card holders may redeem the Westfield Gift Cards for goods or services;  card holders: people who hold a Westfield Gift Card and are entitled to receive goods or services on the redemption of the gift card;  customers: people who purchase a Westfield Gift Card; they may not be the same people as the card holders if they allow another person to use or take possession of the Westfield Gift Card. 2. The applicant and all participating stores are “registered persons” (as defined in s 2(1)). 3. The Westfield Gift Card scheme will operate as described in paragraphs 4 to 22. Terms and conditions documented 4. A detailed description of the terms and conditions of the Westfield Gift Card is set out in two documents (which are not materially different to the copies of these documents attached to the ruling application dated 16 May 2011):  Gift Card Terms and Conditions (In-Store), for in-store gift card purchases;  Gift Card Terms and Conditions (Online), for online gift card purchases. 2 Purchase of gift cards 5. A customer will be able to purchase a Westfield Gift Card from a Customer Services Desk in a Westfield shopping mall or online through the Westfield website. Additionally, participating stores as agents on behalf of the applicant may sell Westfield Gift Cards. Value of gift cards 6. On the purchase of the Westfield Gift Card, the customer may load a value from $10 to $995 on to the card. The funds loaded on to the card are transferred into a trust bank account. Interest accumulating on the funds held in trust will be payable to the applicant. 7. The value loaded on the Westfield Gift Card may then be used to purchase goods and services at participating stores within the Westfield network or from the applicant in limited situations. Purchases cannot be made online. Fees and surcharges 8. In addition to the amount loaded on to the Westfield Gift Cards, a fee may be charged for each Westfield Gift Card, accompanying greeting card and envelope. 9. Under the Gift Card Terms and Conditions (Online), when payment for a Westfield Gift Card purchased online is to be made by Diners Club, American Express, Visa or MasterCard, the applicant reserves the right to charge customers a surcharge, imposed by card companies and banks. Gift cards cannot be topped up but can be combined 10. At present, Westfield Gift Cards will not be able to be topped-up or added to after they have been purchased. However, if a card holder has several Westfield Gift Cards with differing values, the card holder may ask for a new Westfield Gift Card to be issued that combines all the card balances. A fee may be charged for the issue of the new card in this instance. Value may be printed or handwritten on gift cards 11. Bulk orders of Westfield Gift Cards are often ordered by corporate customers (who may want to distribute the cards as gifts to their customers or employees). In this case, the initial value loaded will be printed on the Westfield Gift Cards. For individual customer Westfield Gift Card orders, the initial value loaded will usually be handwritten on the cards. Balance of gift cards can be checked 12. Card holders can check their Westfield Gift Card balances at any time:  at a website;  by text;  by phoning;  by asking at any Customer Services Desk in a Westfield shopping centre. 13. A cost of 50 cents per message will be chargeable when a card holder sends a text message to check the Westfield Gift Card balance. 3 Expiry of gift cards 14. Westfield Gift Cards expire 12 months after their purchase. Any balance remaining on a Westfield Gift Card after its expiry date will become the property of the applicant. Gift cards may be used with alternative payment options 15. If a card holder does not have sufficient funds on the Westfield Gift Card to purchase an item, the card holder may pay using both the gift card balance plus an alternative payment option (ie, cash, credit card or EFTPOS). Gift cards are not redeemable for cash and are not legal tender 16. Westfield Gift Cards cannot be redeemed for cash. 17. Westfield Gift Cards are not legal tender, account cards, credit or debit cards, or securities. Applicant incurs the scheme’s operating costs 18. The applicant will incur costs in relation to the operation of the Westfield Gift Card scheme, including transaction fees from the processing of gift cards at retailer terminals. These fees include third-party maintenance costs (eg, server hosting fees, licensing and system monitoring and transaction fees for activating and replacing cards) along with the costs of setting up and running the software required to manage the scheme. Costs also include ongoing costs such as the printing costs of the cards and the envelopes sold. 19. The applicant may make limited supplies. For example, Westfield Gift Cards may be used to purchase bus tickets from Westfield information centres, but this is estimated to be less than 1% of the total goods and services acquired by card holders using the gift cards. Participating stores will honour gift cards 20. The applicant has agreed with the participating stores that the participating stores will honour a Westfield Gift Card, if a card holder presents the card before its expiry date. This is a condition of the lease agreement. Lost or stolen gift cards may be replaced 21. If a Westfield Gift Card is faulty or has been lost or stolen, the applicant will provide a replacement card of the same value as the unused value and with the expiry date as for the original Westfield Gift Card. For lost and stolen Westfield Gift Cards, card holders must provide an original receipt and card number. A fee may be charged for the issue of the replacement card . Applicant owns the gift cards 22. The Westfield Gift Card remains the property of the applicant. Scope of this Ruling 23. This ruling does not cover the GST implications of:  the cost of 50 cents per text message that is charged to a card holder when they send a text message to check the Westfield Gift Card balance; 4  any re-charge to customers of bank or credit card company surcharges when customers purchase the Westfield Gift Cards online. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following assumptions: i) The applicant (the Lessor) and the participating stores (the Lessee) enter into an agreement (generally by way of lease), which includes the following matters (or words to this effects):  The administration of electronic gift cards is reliant on EFTPOS/Credit Card facilities;  With the agreement of the Lessor, where a Lessee has no electronic EFTPOS/Credit card facilities the lessee will not be obliged to honour electronic gift cards;  The electronic gift cards may only be used by a customer for the full or partial purchase of the Lessee’s goods or services;  No cash or credit notes may be issued by the Lessee for balances remaining on electronic gift cards;  The Lessor will pay to the Lessee by way of cheque, direct credit or in cash, that part of the value of the transaction that a customer uses an electronic gift card to purchase the Lessee’s goods or services. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The applicant is, at all times, the supplier of the Westfield Gift Cards to the customers for the purposes of s 5(11G). (b) The applicant and the participating stores agree that a supply for GST purposes occurs when a Westfield Gift Card is used to acquire goods or services and not when the Westfield Gift Card is issued or sold . How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows:  Under s 5(11G), any goods and services supplied by the participating stores on redemption of Westfield Gift Cards will be treated by the applicant as a supply of goods and services for GST purposes. Accordingly, the participating stores are required to charge card holders GST and account for GST output tax when goods and services are acquired by the card holders using the Westfield Gift Cards. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 2 November 2011 and ending on 30 November 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 2nd day of November 2011. Tracey Lloyd Acting Assurance Manager
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 11/01 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by StockCo Limited (StockCo). Taxation Laws All legi slative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of sections BG 1, DA 1(1), DA 2, EA 3, EC 6 to EC 27, EC 32 to EC 37 and EJ 10, subpart EW, and sections FA 6 to FA 11, FA 12 and GC 1. Because this is a product ruling affecting the deductibility of lease payments for the customers of StockCo (ie, the farmers), the ruling does not consider the effect of the Arrangement on StockCo, StockCo Holdings Limited (StockCo Holdings) or StockCo Residual Limited (StockCo Residual). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies T he Arran gement is a sale and lease-back transaction involving livestock. The Arrangement mainly involves dairy cattle, but may also involve sheep. Under the Arrangement StockCo purchases livestock from a farmer and then leases that livestock back to the farmer. (There is also a variation of the Arrangement where StockCo purchases livestock from a third party and leases it to the farmer.) Once the lease is executed, StockCo assigns the lease income to StockCo Holdings in consideration for the discounted present value of the cash flow receivable under the lease. Further, StockCo sells the residual interest in the livestock to StockCo Residual. At the end of the lease (after the Lease Termination Date, as defined in the lease agreements), StockCo Residual may sell the livestock to the farmer or a third party. There is no obligation on StockCo to sell, or on the farmer or buy, the livestock. If StockCo Residual does sell the livestock to the farmer, the sale will be at the Residual Value. The Residual Value is an agreed estimate of the value of the livestock at the end of the lease term. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. StockCo is in the business of livestock leasing and financing and is the face of the StockCo leasing business. StockCo Holdings and StockCo Residual are both subsidiaries of StockCo. 2. StockCo has identified a market for livestock leasing in the farming industry. 3. Leases result from one or a combination of the two transactions outlined below: a. StockCo and the farmer enter into a sale and lease-back transaction (for all or part of the farmer’s livestock), whereby StockCo buys 1 livestock from the farmer and then leases the livestock back to the farmer; or b. StockCo purchases livestock from a third party, at the farmer’s request, and then leases the livestock to the farmer. 4. In the case of the first type of transaction, the Arrangement allows the farmer to realise capital that was tied up in livestock. This capital could be used to retire external debt or fund the expansion of herds, land or the business in general. Farmers also gain certainty of income and expenditure that is not guaranteed under current livestock valuation methods. 5. In the case of the second type of transaction, the Arrangement may assist a new farmer to set up their business, as capital set-up costs can be a barrier for entry into the market. This second type of transaction may also assist existing farmers if, for example, they wish to expand their herd. Sale of livestock 6. The Master Deed of Dairy Herd Lease is the lease document relating to dairy livestock. Clause 2 of the lease sets out the purchase and ownership provisions in relation to the initial sale of the livestock to StockCo: 2. PURCHASE AND OWNERSHIP OF THE HERD. (a) We will purchase the relevant Cows for the Purchase Price on the Commencement Date. (b) We will EITHER: (i) Purchase the relevant Cows from you for the Purchase Price and will create a buyer generated invoice and will pay the Purchase Price to you on the Commencement Date or on any other agreed settlement date; OR (ii) Purchase the relevant Cows from another person/s and provide the same to you on the Commencement Date or any other agreed settlement date; OR (iii) Undertake a combination of purchase methods set out in subparagraphs 2(b)(i) and (ii) above. (c) You covenant that the Herd will upon acquisition pursuant to this Deed be our absolute property free from any security interest and other encumbrance. You will do all things necessary and further warrant that pursuant to the transfers under clause 2(b) clear title to the Herd has been or will be transferred to us free of any security interest or other encumbrance. (d) You covenant that all Progeny will be our absolute property free from any security interest and other encumbrance. You will do all things necessary and further warrant that pursuant to the transfers under clause 2(b) clear title to all Progeny has been or will be transferred to us free of any security interest or other encumbrance. (e) You covenant that the Cow Herd Schedule is accurate, the Herd is located on the Land and the Herd is healthy and free from disease. (f) Legal and beneficial ownership of the Herd, free of any security interest or other encumbrance will be deemed to be transferred to us on the Commencement Date. We own the Herd. 2 Lease of livestock 7. Clause 3 of the lease sets out the general lease provision: 3. LEASE OF THE HERD. On completion of the purchase contemplated in clause 2, we will lease the Herd and any applicable Cows to you for the Term in consideration of you paying the Lease Payments, and subject to the covenants, conditions, terms, reservations and restrictions contained in this Deed. 8. Once the lease is executed, the farmer must make lease payments based on their individual cash flow. Dairy farmers usually make the lease payments from December to May each year of the lease. Sheep and beef farmers usually make the lease payments from February to May each year of the lease. 9. The length of each lease may vary. However, the maximum lease periods are five years for cattle and four years for sheep. Supplementary leases may be entered into in respect of replacement or additional livestock. Assignment of lease and sale of residual interests in lives tock 10. StockCo assigns the right to receive the lease payments to StockCo Holdings for the discounted present value of the lease payments receivable under the lease. The discount is equivalent to the market rate offered by third-party companies providing such financing facilities. The assignment is on a non-recourse basis, so StockCo is not liable to StockCo Holdings in the event of default by lessees. StockCo Holdings receives all the rights contained in the lease as applicable during the term of that agreement. 11. StockCo then sells the residual interest in the livestock (the right to the livestock after the termination of the lease) to another subsidiary company, StockCo Residual. The sale price is the present value of the Residual Value (the agreed estimate of the value of the livestock at the end of the lease term). The present value is calculated using market rates used by third-party companies. 12. Clause 23 of the lease allows for the assignment of StockCo’s interest in the lease without notice to the farmer: 23. ASSIGNMENT,TRANSFER AND AGREEMENT. You agree that: (a) we may, without giving you or any guarantor notice or obtaining your consent or the consent of any guarantor, at any time, sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of or deal with our interest in this Deed, any related document and any Herd, cows, Progeny or other property the subject of this Deed or any related document; (b) notwithstanding any privacy laws or other requirement of confidentiality, you and any guarantor consent to our disclosing information about you and any guarantor and otherwise in connection with this Deed and any related document for this purpose; (c) neither you nor any guarantor may assign any of your rights or purport to assign or transfer any of your obligations under this Deed or any related document or any Herd, cows, Progeny or other property the subject of this Deed or any related document without our prior written consent; (d) you and any guarantor continue to be bound by this Deed and any related document in all respects following any sale, assignment or other disposal or dealing by us. (e) following any sale, assignment, transfer or other disposal or dealing by us that the assignee or transferee of those rights will have the same rights, 3 powers, discretions and remedies against you and any guarantor that we have under this Deed and any related document as if it were named as StockCo Limited in this Deed and those related documents; and (f) following any sale, assignment or other disposal or dealing by us that each reference to “we”, “us” or any other reference to StockCo Limited in this Deed and any related document shall include the assignee or transferee (including, for the avoidance of doubt, under and in respect of any indemnity granted by you). 13. The assignment of the right to receive lease payments and the sale of the residual interest will return funds to StockCo. This will provide StockCo with working capital. Use and maintenance of livestock 14. The farmer is responsible for maintaining the livestock. The farmers must maint ain the number, quality and type of the herd that is the subject of the lease. In the event of any loss of livestock, a farmer must either replace the livestock or pay StockCo an amount equal to the remaining lease payments. In addition, with StockCo’s permission, the farmer may cull stock throughout the life of the lease. In doing so, the lease requires that the farmer acts as agent for StockCo and that any proceeds from the cull are returned to StockCo. Unless exempted by StockCo, the farmer must replace any culled livestock. 15. Clause 4 of the lease provides for the protection of StockCo’s interest in the livestock and the circumstances under which the farmer has enjoyment over the stock without interruption or disturbance from StockCo: 4. PROTECTION AND QUIET ENJOYMENT (a) You must protect our ownership of the Herd and not attempt to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, or deal with the Herd, or any Cows, in any way other than in accordance with this Deed. You will not use, or attempt to use, the Herd or any of the Cows as security for any loans or other obligation, sell or part with possession of any Cows otherwise than in accordance with this Deed, or register, attempt to register or allow to be registered, any security interest on the Personal Property Securities Register in respect of the Herd or any of the Cows other than by us. (b) As long as you make all Lease Payments and duly and punctually observe and perform all your obligations under this Deed, you may peaceably possess and enjoy the Herd without interruption or disturbance from us on the terms contained in this Deed. 16. Clause 8 of the lease contains provisions relating to the farmer’s expected use and maintenance of the leased livestock: 8. USE AND MAINTENANCE OF HERD (a) You will farm the Herd according to the best principles of good animal husbandry and take all possible care for the safety, well-being and security of the Herd and maintain the Herd's number, quality and type. (b) You will do all things necessary to maintain a Pregnancy Rate of not less than 80%. (c) All costs regarding the farming, health, levies, taxes and any other maintenance or compliance costs are payable by you. (d) We may, at any time, determine whether you are in compliance with clause 8(a) or 8(b) and may employ such consultants or persons as in our absolute discretion we think fit to assist in making that determination. You must reimburse us for any fees paid by us to any such persons upon receipt of a written demand, and will pay any fees due direct to any such persons 4 upon request by us. Any determination by us that you are not in compliance with clause 8(a) and 8(b) will in the absence of manifest error be final and binding on you. 17. Clause 9 of the lease sets out the actions that the farmer must take if there is a loss of any leased livestock: 9. STOCK LOSSES. (a) Following the death or loss of any Cow you will immediately notify us of such death or loss setting out the circumstances in which such death or loss took place and whether remedial steps have been taken to protect the remainder of the Herd. If requested by us, you will forthwith produce a report certified by a Veterinary Surgeon as to the fact and cause(s) of death. When a Cow dies or is lost, irrespective of the cause of death or loss, you are responsible for the value thereof and you will within 30 days either: (i) replace the Cow with a similar cow, ensuring continuing compliance with clauses 8 and 14; or (ii) pay to us by way of liquidated damages an amount equal to the total agreed lease payments relating to the Cow, less any lease payments received to date and less any rebate which we may in our absolute discretion allow you. (b) You are responsible for the removal and disposal of any Cow which has died. 18. Clause 10 of the lease sets out the rights and obligations of the farmer in relation to annual culls and the replacement and variations of leased livestock: 10. ANNUAL CULLS, REPLACEMENTS AND VARIATIONS. 10.1 It is agreed that the Herd may be varied by progressive Culling and replacement of dairy Cows forming part of the Herd, provided prior written consent is first obtained from us. (a) Culls. You may from time to time seek our approval to Cull Cows from the Herd. Following notification (and where approval is given) you are authorised and agree to act as our agent for the removal and disposal of any Cows Culled for any reason from time to time. (b) You must notify us annually before the 31 st day of May in every year, with full particulars of the number, age, breed and type of each Cow that you wish to Cull. (c) Following notification (and where approval is given) we will calculate and send you an invoice outlining the residual amount owed by you for each Cow Culled calculated as the total agreed lease payments relating to the Cow, less any lease payments received to date and less any rebate which we may in our absolute discretion allow you. (d) You will pay the residual amount calculated by direct debit from your bank account on a date that is mutually agreed. (e) You are responsible for the removal and disposal of any Cows Culled from the Herd. Upon the receipt of any proceeds received as consideration for the Cows Culled, you agree to hold the proceeds as constructive trustee for us. (f) You shall pay to us GST payable on all payments due under the Deed relating to the Cows which are culled. (g) Replacements. You may from time to time seek our approval to lease from us additional Cows or Herds (whether purchased from you or otherwise acquired). (h) Unless otherwise consented to by us, you must replace any Culled Cows, and otherwise ensure that you comply with the requirements as to maintenance of the Herd in clause 8 and to identification as set out in clause 14. 10.2 You covenant that all Cows which you provide to replace any Culled Cows or which we provide as additional Cows or Herds: 5 (a) form part of the Herd; (b) are procured by StockCo in accordance with the same provisions and covenants as are contained in clauses 2 and 3 of this Deed. 19. Clause 14 of the lease sets out the farmer’s obligations in relation to the identification and annual verification of the leased livestock: 14. IDENTIFICATION AND ANNUAL VERIFICATION. (a) You must at all times ensure that the Herd is separately identifiable from any other cows that may be depastured on the Land. (b) You must maintain complete and up to date records and details of each Cow. (c) You shall also identify the Herd by means of the Animal Health Board (AHB) Identification System (approved by the Chief Technical Officer on 3 October 1999 and notified in the Gazette1999, at page 3579) or any other identification system that is approved in its place under the Bio-Security (Animal Identification Systems) Regulations 1999, in the same manner as required in relation to cattle beasts being moved from the herd of origin to another herd. Progeny should also be subject to identification requirements. (d) We may request at any time, that you will send to us a written report that certifies the number of Cows and the breed, age, quality, pregnancy status and type. Following such request, you will supply the same within 7 days.

(a) StockCo owns the Progeny and leases to you the Progeny with effect from their birth (until transfer thereof). (b) StockCo holds a first ranking security interest over the Progeny. (c) StockCo may upon your written request transfer to you ownership of any Progeny, for nil consideration, which are not now and will not at any time in the future be Cows provided that you are not in default or in breach of this Deed. (d) You are entitled to revenue from the Progeny. Termination 21. After the termination of the lease, the farmer may offer to purchase the livestock from StockCo Residual (as noted above, StockCo Residual purchases the residual value of the livestock from StockCo at the beginning of the lease). StockCo Residual is under no obligation to accept the farmer’s offer (see clause 13 set out in paragraph 22). If the farmer does not purchase the livestock after the lease expires, StockCo Residual wi ll try to sell the livestock for at least the Residual Value of the livestock. If the sale price StockCo Residual receives is less than the Residual Value, the farmer must pay the difference to StockCo Residual. If the sale price i s greater than the Residual Value, StockCo Residual must pay the excess to the farmer. In either case, the net proceeds received by StockCo Residual will generally be equal to the Residual Value, no more and no less. 22. Clause 13 of the lease sets out the termination provisions: 6 13. TERMINATION. At the expiry or earlier termination of this Deed you must, at your cost, deliver to us the Herd forthwith, and in any event within 5 business days. (a) If you fail to deliver the Herd to us in the time period specified, we may collect and remove the Herd from the Land or any land where we believe the Herd may be located, and you hereby authorise us to do so, and you will be liable to us for any cost, loss, expense or liability in so collecting and removing the Herd. (b) Upon termination of this Deed, whether by way of early termination, or otherwise we may sell the Herd to any person we choose, in our absolute discretion, using any reasonable method. (c) Upon termination by expiry, we reserve the right to sell the Herd at then current market value, AND in the event that we exercise such right then we will endeavour to effect sale for a price no less than the Residual Value and to do so within 30 days after termination. Upon sale of the Herd, if the Net Proceeds: (i) are less than the Residual Value, you must pay us the difference between the Residual Value and the Net Proceeds; (ii) are greater than the Residual Value, we must pay to you the difference between the Residual Value and the Net Proceeds. (d) You may offer to purchase the Herd, but we are under no obligation to sell the Herd to you. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner Th is Ru ling is made subject to the following conditions: a) At the time the lease is entered into the Residual Value of the stock is a reasonable, and the parties’ best, estimate of the likely market value of the stock at the Lease Termination Date. b) The customer is in the “business” (as defined by section YA 1) of farming. c) The customer has entered into the lease for the sole purpose of undertaking a farming business and intends to use the leased stock in the production of assessable income. d) The lease payments are genuine, arm’s length amounts for the possession and use of the stock. e) The customers will enter into the leases for one or more of the following business reasons that are, in each case, the main reason or reasons for entering into the Arrangement. The possible reasons are the need:  to refinance livestock already owned for further investment in the farming business or to retire existing debt;  for certainty of cash flows through structuring the lease payments;  for certainty of income and expenditure; and/or  to reduce the initial level of cash required to enter the farming industry or to purchase new livestock. f) With one exception, neither StockCo, StockCo Residual, nor StockCo Holdings will, directly or indirectly, assign or otherwise dispose of any livestock lease interest to a lessee farmer or a person associated with a 7 lessee farmer. The exception is a sale of the residual interest in the livestock to a lessee farmer on the termination of the lease and as contemplated in the livestock lease. For the purposes of this condition, a livestock lease interest includes the right to receive lease payments, the residual interest or any other interest in the lease. g) The livestock becomes the property of the customer only if the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date, subject to approval by StockCo. h) The customer is not in the “business” (as defined in section YA 1) of selling or exchanging leases. i) At the time of entering into each lease, the customer does not intend to dispose of the lease. j) The customer is not carrying on or undertaking a scheme of trading leases entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. k) The livestock, when purchased by the customer after the Lease Termination Date, are not used in, or as part of, a stock-dealing “business” (as defined in section YA 1). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject i n a ll respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The livestock lease payments are deductible under section DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in section DA 2 applies to prevent deductibility, provided that:  no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction in section DA 1(1); and  the income arising from the Arrangement is derived by the taxpayer in New Zealand.  The valuation provisions in sections EC 6 to EC 27 apply to the customer when th e “specified livestock” (as defined in section YA 1) is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date.  T he valuation provisions in sections EC 32 to EC 37 apply to the customer wh en the “high-priced livestock” (as defined in section YA 1) is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date.  The cost price of the “speci fied li vestock” (as defined in section YA 1) for the purposes of sections EC 6 to EC 27, for customers purchasing that livestock at the end of the lease, is the Residual Value stated in the lease.  The cost price of the “high-priced livestock” (a s defined in section YA 1) for the purposes of sections EC 32 to EC 37, for customers purchasing that stock at the end of the lease, is the Residual Value stated in the lease.  At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, section EA 3 8 9 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year.  The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement.  Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not an operating lease.  Sectio ns FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement because the le ase is not a finance lease.  Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement because the lease is not a hire purchase agreement.  Section GC 1 does not apply to the sale of livestock by StockCo Residual to the farmers.  Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2011 and ending on 31 March 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 1st day of April 2011. Martin Smith Chief Tax Counsel
1 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 12/01 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by BP Oil New Zealand Limited and AA Smartfuel Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 2, 3A, 6, 8, 20 and 25(1)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the AA Smartfuel Programme (the Programme), which is a rewards scheme whereby customers obtain entitlements to buy fuel at a discounted price from certain fuel providers by purchasing goods or services from certain retailers (Participating Reward Providers (PRPs)). The fuel providers may also be PRPs in respect of both fuel and non-fuel purchases. This Ruling applies only to PRPs that are “registered persons” (as defined in s 2). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Parties to the Arrangement 1. The Arrangement involves the following parties:  AA Smartfuel Limited (AASL) as the scheme operator and administrator;  various fuel providers, currently BP Oil New Zealand Limited (BP) and Chevron New Zealand (which operates its retail fuel business under the Caltex brand);  various PRPs, which currently includes BP; and  individual people who join the scheme (customers). 2. The AA Smartfuel website (www.AAsmartfuel.co.nz) will list participating PRPs and fuel providers current at any time. PRPs and fuel providers may be subject to change. 3. Individuals will be able to join the Programme through one of the following two ways:  All AA members are automatically enrolled in the Programme. 2  Non-AA members can obtain a free AA Smartfuel card at PRPs and fuel providers, and will need to complete an application form online or in hard copy to be able to redeem their discounts. Documents relevant to the Arrangement 4. The documents relevant to the Arrangement are the:  AA Smartfuel Terms and Conditions, which relate to customers;  AA Smartfuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between AASL and PRPs (PRP Agreement);  AA Smartfuel National Fuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between BP and AASL (BP Agreement); and  AA Smartfuel Fuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between Chevron New Zealand and AASL (Chevron Agreement). At the time this Ruling was issued, these documents were in the process of being amended. The finalised documents will not be materially different to the draft documents provided to Inland Revenue on 30 August 2011 and 14 December 2011. Summary of the AA Smartfuel Programme 5. The Programme is a nationwide rewards scheme, which was launched to the public on 7 November 2011. Under the Programme, a customer will earn an entitlement to a discount on the purchase of fuel from fuel providers by purchasing qualifying goods or services from a PRP. The fuel discount entitlements will be credited to a card issued to the customer on presentation to the PRP when making qualifying purchases. 6. All fuel discount entitlements earned from all PRPs accumulate on the customer’s card as they make qualifying purchases from PRPs. Fuel discount entitlements expire at the end of the month following the month in which the purchases are made (eg, a fuel discount entitlement earned in August will expire on 30 September). 7. The fuel discount entitlements will provide the customer with the right to a discount on the GST-inclusive price of fuel from fuel providers, expressed as cents per litre, limited to a maximum of 50 litres of fuel. For example, a PRP may credit the customer’s card with a fuel discount entitlement of 4 cents per litre, which amounts to a $2 discount including GST on a purchase of 50 litres of fuel. Each PRP can set the level of fuel discount entitlement they offer, and can set special fuel discount entitlements (eg, if a promotion is done over a period of time) by logging into the AA Smartfuel platform and adjusting the cents discount per dollar spent. 8. Customers will be able to check their fuel discount entitlement balance online. Generally, both types of customers (AA and non-AA members) will be entitled to the same deals, but AA may occasionally offer a special deal to its members. 9. When a customer purchases fuel from a fuel provider and presents the provider with their card, the accumulated discounts on the card will be credited against the purchase price of the fuel (petrol, diesel or both), up 3 to a maximum of 50 litres, such that the customer pays a discounted amount. Accumulated discounts on the reward card could be sufficient to discount up to 50 litres of fuel purchased. Payment flows involving AA Smartfuel Limited 10. When a customer makes a qualifying purchase from a PRP and earns a fuel discount entitlement, under clause 4.1 of the PRP, BP and Chevron Agreements, the PRP must pay an amount equivalent to the value of the discount entitlement to AASL. Each week on Sunday night, AASL will determine the total amount of discounts provided to customers in the preceding week and either:  AASL will send a tax invoice to the PRP; or  (if s 24(2) is satisfied) the PRP will send a buyer created tax invoice to AASL. The PRP will pay the amount on Tuesday night. 11. Clause 4.1 of the PRP Agreement states: 4.1 In consideration of us undertaking to procure the Participating Redemption Parties’ agreement to honour the rights arising from AA Smartfuel Discounts awarded by you each week, you undertake to pay us an amount equal to the aggregate amount of AA Smartfuel Discounts sponsored and awarded by you to AA Smartfuel Members at each of the Business Premises each week (including any AA Smartfuel Discounts awarded under clause 16.2) which amount will be paid irrevocably by you to the AA Smartfuel Account by direct debit, weekly in arrears on Tuesday of the week following the week in which the relevant AA Smartfuel Discount Award Transactions occurred. 12. When a customer redeems their discount entitlement by purchasing fuel from a fuel provider and presenting their AA Smartfuel card, AASL will pay the fuel provider an amount equivalent to the discount given, under clause 4.4 of the BP and Chevron Agreements. The AA Smartfuel system will identify transactions when fuel discount entitlements are redeemed, and each week either:  the fuel provider will issue a tax invoice to AASL; or  (if s 24(2) is satisfied) AASL will issue a buyer created tax invoice to the fuel provider. The payment to the fuel provider is made on Thursdays by AASL. 13. Clause 4.4 of the BP Agreement states: 4.4 In consideration of you redeeming AA Smartfuel Discounts, we will pay you an amount equal to the aggregate amount of AA Smartfuel Discounts redeemed by you at each of the Business Premises each week, less the aggregate value of any AA Smartfuel Discounts awarded by you on transactions where AA Smartfuel Discounts have been awarded and redeemed in the same transaction. We will pay you from the AA Smartfuel Account by direct debit, weekly in arrears on the Thursday of the following week. 14. Clause 4.4 of the Chevron Agreement is materially the same as the BP Agreement, other than the reference to discounts being awarded and redeemed in the same transaction. 4 15. To the extent any fuel discount entitlements are not used before expiry, either:  AASL will issue a credit note to the PRP, or  (if s 25(3A) is satisfied) the PRP will issue a buyer created credit note to AASL. AASL will then refund an amount equivalent to the unused discount to the relevant PRP, under clause 4.2 of the PRP, BP and Chevron Agreements. This amount is then paid out within 10 days. 16. Clause 4.2 of the PRP Agreement states: 4.2 Where the AA Smartfuel Discounts sponsored and awarded by you (and paid for under clause 4.1) have expired (by passage of time or because they are in excess of your Pro Rata Share of the AA Smartfuel Discounts redeemed in an AA Smartfuel Discount Redemption Transaction), the amount of the consideration payable by you under clause 4.1 will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of such expired AA Smartfuel Discounts and an amount equal to the amount of such reduction will be paid to you in respect of the relevant Business Premises by direct credit on or about the 10th of the month following the month in which the AA Smartfuel Discounts expired. 17. The fuel providers and PRPs also make additional payments to AASL for other services AASL provides in respect of the information technology platform that enables it to operate the Programme, as well as administration, establishment, transaction and other sundry fees. Instant discounts by fuel providers 18. The Ruling does not apply to the provision of an “instant discount” by a fuel provider, being part of any discount on the price of goods or services supplied by a fuel provider to a customer, which is not referable to points accumulated under the Programme and does not result in a PRP having to reimburse the fuel provider. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The sale of goods and services by a PRP results in the customer providing “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a single supply of goods and services and the right to buy fuel at a discount, under s 6. To the extent the PRP makes a taxable supply to the customer, the amount paid by the customer is subject to GST under s 8.  Payments AASL makes to a fuel provider are “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a taxable supply of services from the fuel provider to AASL. The amount AASL pays to the fuel provider is therefore subject to GST under s 8.  In calculating the amount of tax payable in a taxable period under s 20, AASL will be entitled to an input tax (as defined in s 3A) deduction for all the GST charged in respect of supplies made by a fuel provider to AASL in that taxable period. 5  Where a customer uses fuel discount entitlements to purchase fuel at a discounted price, under s 8(1) GST on that supply is chargeable only on the discounted price payable by the customer to the fuel provider.  Payments a PRP makes to AASL are “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a supply of services from AASL to the PRP. The amount the PRP pays to AASL is therefore subject to GST under s 8.  To the extent that the single supply (comprising of goods and services and the right to buy fuel at a discount) made by a PRP to a customer is a taxable supply, in calculating the amount of tax payable in a taxable period under s 20, the PRP will be entitled to an input tax (as defined in s 3A) deduction, or (where s 20(3) applies) a deduction from the amount of output tax payable by that PRP, for the GST charged on supplies made by AASL to the PRP in that taxable period.  When an amount is refunded to a PRP under clause 4.2 of the relevant Agreement, s 25(1)(b) will apply and either: o AASL will be required to provide the PRP with a credit note, or o (if s 25(3A) is satisfied) the PRP will be required to provide AASL with a buyer created credit note. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 November 2011 and ending on 31 December 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31 st day of May 2012. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

Auckland Transport is “resident” in New Zealand and is a “registered person” and a “local authority” as those terms are defined in s 2(1). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. Public transport within the Auckland region is currently highly fragmented and is provided by a number of independent transport operators, each of which has its own fare structure and ticket formats. 2. Public transport in the Auckland region comprises three modes of transport: bus, train and ferry.  Buses in the Auckland region carry around 50 million passengers a year, and are provided by several different operators. Each operator has its own fare structure and ticketing options, although in some cases a multi-operator pass is available.  Trains in the Auckland region carry around nine million passengers a year. Auckland Transport is responsible for planning, developing and operating the Auckland train network, and contracts the day-to-day running of the train network to an independent commercial transport operator.  Nine ferry services in the Auckland region transport around five million passengers a year. Auckland Transport contracts ferry operators to run some of these services. However, the majority of passenger ferry services are run by four independent companies. 3. Three “types” of arrangement exist between Auckland Transport and the transport operators providing public transport services in the Auckland region (Transport Operator/s): gross contracts, net contracts and commercial registration.  Gross contracts are based on the gross operating price payable by Auckland Transport to the Transport Operator for providing the service. The Transport Operator is reimbursed at an agreed rate for the operating costs associated with providing the service. Auckland Transport bears any revenue risk.  Net contracts are based on the net cost payable by Auckland Transport to the Transport Operator for performing the service after the deduction of fare revenue earned by the operator. The Transport Operator is reimbursed a tendered rate, so bears the revenue risk for providing the service.  A commercial registration arrangement is where Transport Operators are responsible for registering a commercial service. The services are operated without funding assistance from Auckland Transport, and the Transport Operator bears all the revenue risk. 4. The type of arrangement held between Auckland Transport and Transport Operators will impact on the revenue allocated to each Transport Operator per customer transaction, as well as the nature in which revenues are settled between Transport Operators. 5. Transport Operators are “resident” in New Zealand and are “registered persons” as those terms are defined in s 2(1). 3 Auckland integrated fare system 6. To improve public transport accessibility and efficiency, Auckland Transport intends to introduce an integrated fare system (AIFS) using smartcard technology. Under the AIFS, all Transport Operators servicing the Auckland region will operate under the same fare structure, and customers will be able to purchase tickets to use transport with all Transport Operators in the region. The new AIFS will enable Cardholders to travel on Auckland’s public transport using a variety of smartcard products: pre-paid trips, period passes and HOP Money (AIFS Products) across multiple operators and modes. 7. Auckland Transport will be responsible for the overall management and oversight of the AIFS. 8. Retailers for AIFS Products (Retailers), other than Auckland Transport and Transport Operators, have yet to be decided. However, it is likely that there will be a large number of Retailers, and that the number of approved Retailers will increase, and change, with time. Retailers are “resident” in New Zealand and are “registered persons” as those terms are defined in s 2(1). 9. Retailers will pay all funds received from the sale of HOP Cards (Issuance Fees) and AIFS Products into a separate “ring fenced” bank account (Stakeholder Account) controlled and administered by Auckland Transport as Stakeholder. Relevant documents 10. The documents relevant to the Arrangement are the:  Settlement Agreement to be entered into between Auckland Transport and each Retailer and Transport Operator, which will be in a form that is not materially different to the “Settlement Agreement” supplied to Inland Revenue on 4 May 2012 (Settlement Agreement).  HOP Cards Terms of Use that govern a Cardholder’s possession and use of a HOP Card, in a form that is not materially different to the “HOP Cards Terms of Use” supplied to Inland Revenue on 4 May 2012 (Terms of Use). Clearing and settlement 11. Clearing and settlement entails the identification and distribution of earned revenues between Transport Operators, Retailers and Auckland Transport. Auckland Transport will be responsible for apportioning funds between these relevant parties for all transactions performed over an agreed number of business days, and the subsequent revenue earned by each party will be based on apportionment rules as defined by Auckland Transport. 4 Settlement Agreements 12. Auckland Transport will enter into a Settlement Agreement with each licensed Transport Operator and Retailer (AIFS Participant). 13. Clause 1.1 of the Settlement Agreement contains the following relevant definitions: AIFS means the Auckland integrated fare system to be managed by AT \[Auckland Transport\] on and from the Start Date; AIFS Product means the Pre-paid Trip Product, Period Pass Product or HOP Money Product and AIFS Products has a corresponding meaning; ... Cardholders means holders of the HOP Cards; Card Terms of Use means the general terms of use, as amended from time to time by AT, that apply to the use of the HOP Cards; ... HOP Cards means the AIFS cards issued by AT; HOP Money Product means the stored monetary value a Cardholder has loaded onto a HOP Card; ... Issuance Fee means the fixed fee to purchase a HOP Card as set by AT from time to time; ... Period Pass Product means a pass credit loaded onto a HOP Card allowing the Cardholder to undertake unlimited travel within a particular area for a specified number of days; Pre-paid Trip Product means a discounted trip credit loaded onto a HOP Card for trips over a specified number of stages for buses and trains or with a particular ferry service; ... Retailers means retailers of the HOP Cards and the AIFS Products appointed from time to time by AT; ... Stakeholder means AT as appointed pursuant to clause 3.1; Stakeholder Account means the \[Insert details of account\] controlled and administered by AT on behalf of AT, the Transport Operators and the Retailers or such replacement account; ... Transport Operators means the operators of passenger transport services in the Auckland region that agree to take part in AIFS on the terms set out in this agreement. 14. The Settlement Agreement will appoint Retailers to sell HOP Cards as agents for Auckland Transport. Clause 2.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 2.1 Sale of HOP Cards: each Retailer is appointed to sell HOP Cards as agent for and on behalf of AT; 5 15. The Settlement Agreement will appoint Auckland Transport and all other Retailers to sell AIFS Products as agents for each Transport Operator with whom an AIFS Product voucher is ultimately redeemed. Clause 2.2 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 2.2 Sale of AIFS Products: AT and each Retailer is appointed to sell AIFS Products as agent for and on behalf of each Transport Operator with whom, and to the extent that, an AIFS Product voucher is ultimately redeemed. 16. The Settlement Agreement will appoint Auckland Transport as the Stakeholder. Clause 3.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 3.1 Appointment of Stakeholder: On and from the Start Date, the parties agree that AT is appointed as Stakeholder to establish, control and maintain the Stakeholder Account. 17. The Settlement Agreement will provide that, for GST purposes, Auckland Transport and each Retailer, as agent for the Transport Operator, is selling a “voucher” to the Cardholder (and not “travel”). Clause 4.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 4.1 GST Treatment of HOP Cards and AIFS Products: On and from the Start Date, the parties agree to account for GST on the sale and purchase of HOP Cards and AIFS Products in accordance with the Product Ruling. For GST purposes, AT and each Retailer, as agent for the Transport Operator, sell a “voucher” to the Cardholder (and not “travel”). GST is not due and payable when a HOP Card is purchased or when AIFS Products are loaded onto the HOP Card. 18. The Settlement Agreement will provide that Retailers will not issue a “tax invoice” or a “credit note” or a “debit note” (as those terms are defined in s 2(1)) on behalf of Auckland Transport or a Transport Operator in relation to the sale of a HOP Card or an AIFS Product. Clause 4.2 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 4.2 No Tax Invoices Issued by Retailers: AT and each Retailer agree not to issue a “tax invoice”, “credit note” or “debit note” to any Cardholder on behalf of AT or a Transport Operator for the sale of a HOP Card or AIFS Product. 19. The Settlement Agreement will provide for the payment of commission by Auckland Transport to Retailers for providing sales services to Auckland Transport as manager of the AIFS. Clause 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 5.1 Sales Commission: To the extent that the AIFS Participant is a Retailer, AT will pay commission to the AIFS Participant for providing sales services to AT as manager of AIFS. Stakeholder Account 20. The Settlement Agreement will provide that all Issuance Fees Cardholders pay on the sale and purchase of HOP Cards and all amounts Cardholders pay on the sale and purchase of AIFS Products will be paid into the Stakeholder Account. The Settlement Agreement will also set out how and when funds received from the sale of HOP Cards and AIFS Products are to be deposited into the Stakeholder Account. Clause 3.2 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 3.2 Deposit of Amounts into Stakeholder Account: All amounts collected from the sale and purchase of HOP Cards (Issuance Fees) and the sale and purchase of AIFS Products will be paid into the Stakeholder Account in accordance with the following provisions: 6 (a) Funds Collected by Retailers: All amounts paid by Cardholders to Retailers will be paid into the Stakeholder Account by the Retailers. Each Retailer agrees to initially process and bank such amounts into the Retailer's bank account on the Business Day received (or if not received on a Business Day then the next available Business Day) and then to settle such amounts into the Stakeholder Account at the end of that same Business Day or next available Business Day; (b) Cash Collected by Vending and Reload Devices: Cash takings collected by third parties appointed by AT via vending and reload devices will be paid by the third parties into the Stakeholder Account at the end of each Business Day received (or if not received on a Business Day then the next available Business Day); (c) Credit Card and Eftpos Amounts: Amounts collected by credit card or eftpos via vending and reload devices, the MAXX Customer Contact Centre or the MAXX website will be paid into the Stakeholder Account at the end of each Business Day such sums are received (or if not received on a Business Day then the next available Business Day); and (d) Payments by AT: Amounts collected by cash, credit card or eftpos by AT at its ticket offices or via its website will be paid into the Stakeholder Account at the end of each Business Day such sums are received (or if not received on a Business Day then the next available Business Day). 21. Funds Retailers deposit into the Stakeholder Account will form a pool out of which payments will be made to Auckland Transport for the supply of HOP Cards and to Transport Operators for the supply of AIFS Products. The transactions performed using stored value, pre-paid trips or validation of period passes will be used to apportion the relevant amounts owed to each Transport Operator. With the exception of pre-paid ferry trips, funds held in the Stakeholder Account from the sale of AIFS Products will not be allocated to Transport Operators until a trip has actually been taken by a Cardholder using an AIFS Product. The amount settled will consider the number of trips taken by Cardholders for each Transport Operator, as well as factors such as the product type, trip distance and type of contractual or commercial arrangement between Auckland Transport and the relevant Transport Operator. The amount of funds to be apportioned to each Transport Operator per Cardholder’s trip will largely depend on the type of AIFS Product used by the Cardholder. 22. Clause 3.3 of the Settlement Agreement sets out how amounts held in the Stakeholder Account will be apportioned and provides as follows: 3.3 Apportionment of Amounts from Stakeholder Account: All amounts collected from the sale and purchase of HOP Cards and AIFS Products and paid into the Stakeholder Account pursuant to clause 3.2 will be held in the Stakeholder Account and apportioned by the Stakeholder in accordance with the following provisions: (a) Payments to AT: Payments will be made from the Stakeholder Account each Business Day to AT for: (i) Issuance Fees: Issuance Fees collected that Business Day (or if not collected on a Business Day then the next available Business Day); and (ii) Refunds: Any refund of the remaining balance of HOP Money Products loaded on a HOP Card requested by a Cardholder in accordance with the Card Terms of Use; (b) Payments to Transport Operators: Payments will be made from the Stakeholder Account to Transport Operators in accordance with the following provisions: 7 (i) HOP Money Products: For transport journeys undertaken using the HOP Money Product, the Stakeholder will apportion amounts out of the Stakeholder Account to Transport Operators each Business Day (or the next available Business Day) based on usage of HOP Money Products that day as calculated by AT. Deductions will be made for any discounts or concessions offered by AT to Cardholders using the HOP Money Product; (ii) Pre-Paid Trip Products: For transport journeys undertaken using the Pre-paid Trip Product, the Stakeholder will apportion amounts out of the Stakeholder Account as follows: (A) to bus and train Transport Operators, each Business Day (or the next available Business Day) based on usage of Pre-paid Trip Products that day as calculated by AT; and (B) to ferry Transport Operators, the full amount collected from a Cardholder for the Pre-paid Trip Product will be paid to the Transport Operator on the Business Day the Pre-paid Trip Product is loaded on a HOP Card (or if not loaded on a Business Day then the next available Business Day); (iii) Period Pass Products: For transport journeys undertaken using the Period Pass Product, the Stakeholder will apportion amounts out of the Stakeholder Account as follows: (A) to bus and train Transport Operators, based on the proportion of Period Pass trips undertaken by Cardholders with the respective Transport Operator, once the Transport Operator's entitlement has been calculated by AT and within seven days of a Period Pass Product expiring; and (B) to ferry Transport Operators, the full amount collected from a Cardholder for the Period Pass Product will be paid to the Transport Operator on the Business Day the Period Pass Product is loaded on a HOP Card (or if not loaded on a Business Day then the next available Business Day). 23. Under cl 4.3 of the Settlement Agreement each Transport Operator will agree to account for GST on payments received from the Stakeholder Account. Clause 4.3 provides as follows: 4.3 Transport Operators to Account for GST: Each Transport Operator agrees to account for GST on payments received from the Stakeholder Account pursuant to clause 3.3(b). 24. Under cl 3.4 of the Settlement Agreement, Auckland Transport will separately reimburse Transport Operators for the difference between any amounts a Transport Operator receives from the Stakeholder Account for any concessionary fare and/or discount offered by Auckland Transport and the full fare amount for that journey, out of Auckland Transport’s own bank account. Clause 3.4 of the Settlement Agreement provides as follows: 3.4 Compensation for Discounts and Concessionary Fares: AT will separately reimburse in full Transport Operators the difference between any amounts a Transport Operator receives from the Stakeholder Account in accordance with clause 3.3(b)(i) for any concessionary fare and/or discount offered by AT from time to time to Cardholders using the HOP Money Product and the full fare amount for that journey. 25. All amounts collected from the sale of HOP Cards and AIFS Products will be paid into the Stakeholder Account controlled by Auckland Transport (see para 20). Auckland Transport will not derive any benefit from holding the money while it remains in the central Stakeholder Account apart from retaining any interest earned, which it will apply towards the costs of operating the Stakeholder Account. 8 26. The Stakeholder will hold and have available, sufficient records to establish the particulars of all transactions relating to the sale of HOP Cards and AIFS Products, including (but not limited to) details of all deposits made by Retailers into the Stakeholder Account and all payments made to Auckland Transport and to each individual Transport Operator out of the Stakeholder Account. HOP Card Purchase of HOP Card 27. As part of the AIFS, Cardholders will be able to use HOP Cards to pay for travel on any bus, rail and ferry public transport service provided by public Transport Operators in the Auckland region. The HOP Card will be accepted by all public Transport Operators in the Auckland region. HOP Cards will need to be “topped up” with stored value or loaded with another AIFS Product before they can be used to purchase travel. 28. All HOP Cards will remain the property of Auckland Transport. Clause 8.3 of the Terms of Use provides as follows: 8.3 all HOP Cards will remain our property at all times and we retain the right to manage and change the software and data on the HOP Cards at any time; 29. Cardholders will be able to purchase a HOP Card for a non-refundable fixed fee (Issuance Fee) (currently $10 inclusive of GST) from Auckland Transport ticket offices, a network of third party Retailers and online via the Auckland Transport website. The purchase of a HOP Card will give the Cardholder the right to load AIFS Products onto the card and to use the pre-loaded AIFS Products to undertake travel in the Auckland region, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the HOP Card Terms of Use and the relevant Transport Operator. 30. Under cl 31 of the Terms of Use no invoice or tax invoice will be provided to a Cardholder when they purchase a HOP Card or an AIFS Product. Clause 31 provides as follows: 31. GST: The charges and other amounts payable to us or our Retail Agents under these Terms are stated and payable in New Zealand dollars inclusive of any GST, if any. No invoice or tax invoice will be provided to you when you purchase a HOP Card or load any Products on a HOP Card. If you need to make an expense claim or GST claim, please use a printout from your Online Account as a basis for your claim. 31. In relation to the initial sale of a HOP Card, the Settlement Agreement will (see paras 14-23):  Appoint Retailers (who may include Transport Operators) as agents for Auckland Transport to sell HOP Cards on its behalf.  Provide that all Issuance Fees paid by Cardholders on the sale and purchase of a HOP Card will be paid into the Stakeholder Account administered by Auckland Transport as Stakeholder.  Set out the terms and conditions of the stakeholder relationship, including details of how and when money received from the sale of a HOP Card to a Cardholder will be paid into the Stakeholder Account and how and when amounts will be paid by the Stakeholder to Auckland Transport out of the Stakeholder Account. 32. Under the Terms of Use of the HOP Card, Cardholders will be entitled to use a HOP Card to pay for public transport journeys using any of the AIFS Products. Clause 4 of the Terms of Use provides as follows: 9 4. HOP Cards: You may use a HOP Card to pay for public transport journeys provided by public transport operators (Public Transport Operators) in the Auckland region using any of the following System products (Products): 4.1 HOP Money: stored money value loaded onto a HOP Card (HOP Money), which can be used to purchase public transport journeys or paper tickets for public transport journeys; 4.2 Period Pass: a pass credit loaded onto a HOP Card allowing you to have unlimited journeys within a number of days (Period Pass); or 4.3 Pre-paid Trip: a discounted trip credit loaded onto a HOP Card for trips over a number of stages for buses and trains or a particular ferry service (Pre-Paid Trip). 33. Auckland Transport will apply the Issuance Fee towards the following:  a non-refundable travel deposit, allowing the Cardholder to end a journey with a negative balance;  various administrative costs associated with implementing the AIFS and issuing the card;  the cost of the card itself. 34. Cardholders will be able to register their HOP Cards online. Registration will enable the Cardholder to protect any AIFS Products stored on their card. Registered HOP Cards that are damaged, lost or stolen will be able to be replaced at a reduced fee. 35. A single HOP Card will be able to hold all three AIFS Products (pre-paid trips, period passes and stored value) simultaneously. The HOP Card will not be able to be used to purchase other goods or services. 36. When a Cardholder wants to travel on public transport using an AIFS Product, they will need to use their HOP Card to “tag on” before starting their trip and “tag off” when disembarking a bus or ferry or exiting a station or ferry wharf. When a Cardholder tags on and off, the respective boarding and alighting locations will be recorded as part of the transaction, as well as the time and date, route, device number and operator identification number. The AIFS will use this tag on and tag off information to calculate the relevant fare to be paid and to deduct or validate AIFS Products that have been loaded onto the Cardholder’s HOP Card. Stored value reserve and nominal fare 37. Because the AIFS cannot predict the type of trip a Cardholder will take from the tag-on event alone, regardless of the type of AIFS Product used to travel, every time a Cardholder tags on to board a new service a “nominal fare” will be deducted from the “stored value reserve” of the Cardholder’s HOP Card. The nominal fare will vary depending on the transport mode and will equate to a reasonable fare should the Cardholder fail to tag off. 38. When the Cardholder tags off as they complete their trip, one or more of the following will occur:  the validity of any period pass will be verified;  an appropriate pre-purchased stage trip will be deducted;  the actual fare will be calculated and deducted from the stored value purse. The nominal amount of stored valued deducted at the tag-on event will be credited back to the HOP Card “stored value reserve” on successful tag-off. 10 39. If a Cardholder fails to tag off after a trip has been completed, the nominal fare will not be re-credited to the stored value reserve of the HOP Card and will represent the fare paid for the trip taken. Therefore, the Cardholder will be charged the amount of the nominal fare for undertaking a trip on the service. Transport Operators under a net contract or commercial service will be apportioned the nominal fare amount for the trip taken in this instance. 40. The stored value balance and the status of all other AIFS Products loaded onto a HOP Card will be displayed each time the HOP Card is tagged on and off at a “fare payment device” or “electronic gate”. When tagging on, the current stored value balance, pre-paid trip balance or period pass expiration date will be communicated to the Cardholder via the device display. At the end of the trip when the Cardholder tags off, the fare payment device or electronic gate will display the fare paid using stored value and the remaining stored value balance, the validation of a pre-paid trip being used to pay a fare and the pre-paid trip balance; or state the validation of an applicable period pass and the pass expiration date. Cancellation of a HOP Card 41. All Cardholders who have registered their HOP Card online and who want to discontinue their use of a HOP Card that has stored value remaining on it, will be entitled to apply to Auckland Transport for a refund of the remaining balance, less an administration fee, on surrendering the card. Auckland Transport will not provide refunds for unused period passes or pre-paid trips loaded onto a Cardholder’s HOP Card. Clause 11.1 of the Terms of Use provides as follows: 11. Cancellation and Refund: 11.1 If your HOP Card is registered on our Website (Registered HOP Card) you may apply to cancel your HOP Card and receive a refund in cash of the remaining HOP Money on your HOP Card (less a $10 administration fee) within 14 days of surrender of your HOP Card. Only unused HOP Money can be refunded. No refunds are available for Period Passes or Prepaid Trips or paper tickets purchased using HOP Money. Any refund given by us is inclusive of any goods and services tax (GST). 42. A HOP Card will expire if it is not used for a continuous period of two years. When a HOP Card expires, any remaining stored value reserve and any remaining AIFS Products will be forfeited and become the property of Auckland Transport. Clause 9 of the Terms of Use provides as follows: 9. Expiry: The HOP Card (including any Products loaded on the HOP Card) will expire if the HOP Card is not used, no refund is requested, the HOP Card is cancelled, or no Products are loaded onto the HOP Card for a continuous period of two years. When a HOP Card expires, any Products remaining on the HOP Card will be forfeited and become our property on and from the date the HOP Card expires. AIFS Products 43. In relation to the sale of AIFS Products, the Settlement Agreement will (see paras 14-23):  Appoint Retailers as agents for Transport Operators to sell AIFS Products on their behalf.  Provide that all amounts Cardholders pay on the sale and purchase of an AIFS Product will be paid into the Stakeholder Account administered by Auckland Transport as Stakeholder. 11  Set out the terms and conditions of the stakeholder relationship, including details of how and when money received from the sale of an AIFS Product to a Cardholder will be paid into the Stakeholder Account and how, when and what amount of funds held in the Stakeholder Account will be apportioned by the Stakeholder and paid out of the Stakeholder Account to Transport Operators for the sale of AIFS Products. HOP Money product 44. Stored value (HOP Money) is an electronic record of monetary value that has been pre-loaded onto a HOP Card. The AIFS HOP Money stored-value product allows Cardholders to store money on a HOP Card that can be used at a later date to undertake travel of equivalent value to the amount stored on the card. The Cardholder will be able to use stored value on a HOP Card to undertake travel on all bus, train and ferry services provided by any Transport Operator in the Auckland region. 45. HOP Cards will be able to be “topped up” with stored value at Auckland Transport ticket offices, through a network of Retailers, through self- service vending machines located within some stations and large transport exchanges, by calling the MAXX Customer Contact Centre and online via the Customer Web Portal. 46. By default, when a Cardholder initially purchases a HOP Card, the stored value purse will have a zero balance and a stored value reserve amount. Cardholders will be able to end a trip with a negative stored value balance. However, to initiate a journey, a Cardholder must have a zero or positive stored value balance. 47. The HOP Money product will be used when any pre-paid trip product and/or period pass product that may be on the HOP Card does not match the specific trip undertaken by the Cardholder ascertained from the tag-on and tag-off events. 48. The minimum amount of stored value that can be added to a HOP Card will be $5 (including GST). HOP Cards are currently only able to store a maximum of $200 at one time. Clause 34 of the Terms of Use provides as follows: 34. HOP Money: 34.1 Each time you add HOP Money to a HOP Card, you must add at least $5 (incl. GST). You will only be able to add HOP Money equal to or above these minimum loadable values. 34.2 The maximum amount of HOP Money that may be held on a HOP Card is $200 (incl. GST). 34.3 Notwithstanding section 23 (Right to Refuse), Public Transport Operators may permit you to commence a public transport journey, and to complete each leg of the route, as long as there is a positive or $0.00 HOP Money balance on the HOP Card at the start of your journey. HOP Money contained on multiple HOP Cards cannot be combined to pay a single fare. 49. Cardholders may be provided with various discounts when using stored value to undertake travel including a stored value discount, stored value daily fare capping and transfer discount.  Stored Value Discount – a 10% discount on the adult cash fare that would have been charged for the same journey. 12  Stored Value Daily Fare Capping – a daily fare cap, whereby any travel initiated after that fare cap has been reached will not incur a charge.  Transfer Discount – a discount for transfers between different train and bus services to reduce the overall cost of using public transport for people who need to use multiple services to complete their journey. The transfer discount will apply only for transfers taken within a 30-minute period. 50. HOP Cards can be topped up an infinite number of times, unless they are reported lost or stolen or are cancelled for some other reason. 51. If a HOP Card has been registered online, the Cardholder will be able to “top up” online. The stored value balance on a registered HOP Card that is lost, stolen or damaged will be able to be transferred to a replacement card. 52. Cardholders will be able to obtain a refund of any stored value on their HOP Card from Auckland Transport if they choose to cancel the card. However, if a HOP Card is not cancelled and remains inactive for more than two years the stored value will become the property of Auckland Transport (see para 42). 53. No interest will be payable to, or by, Cardholders in respect of any positive or negative AIFS Smartcard balance. Revenue flows resulting from topping up stored value on a HOP Card 54. The topping up of stored value onto a HOP Card involves:  the Cardholder  the Retailer  Auckland Transport  the Transport Operator. 55. The flow of funds resulting from the topping up of stored value onto a HOP Card is as follows: (i) The Cardholder pays the amount of topped-up stored value to be loaded onto their HOP Card to the Retailer (as agent for each Transport Operator with whom the HOP Money product is ultimately redeemed). (ii) The Retailer pays the funds on a daily basis to the Stakeholder. (iii) The Stakeholder clears the funds to the Transport Operator. 56. Funds collected from stored value top-ups will be paid to Transport Operators daily, based on actual usage. Each journey a Cardholder takes using stored value has a set fee that is determined by the number of travel zones covered. The amount of funds to be paid to each Transport Operator will be based on the total value of trips taken by Cardholders and the amounts deducted from stored-value balances. 57. Transport Operators with whom HOP Money products are ultimately redeemed will not elect to treat the supply made on redemption as a supply of goods and services. 13 Pre-paid trip product 58. Pre-paid trips are discounted trip credits that are loaded onto (and stored electronically on) a Cardholder’s HOP Card for future use. The trips are defined by the number of stage points a Cardholder wishes to travel for a bus or train service or the particular ferry service a Cardholder wishes to travel on. 59. For bus and train services, Cardholders will be able to purchase pre-paid trips for a point-to-point journey between two specific points. The Transport Operator could be any bus or train operator providing travel between those points. The particular bus or train Transport Operator providing the service will not be known until a Cardholder actually uses the pre-paid trip product to undertake a journey. Pre-paid trips for travel on a ferry service will be for travel on a particular ferry service with an identifiable ferry Transport Operator. 60. Pre-paid trips must be purchased in multiples of 10, with a maximum of 40 stage-based pre-paid trips and 40 service-based pre-paid trips being able to be stored on a HOP Card at any one time. HOP Cards will only be able to store one type of stage-based pre-paid trip and one type of service based pre-paid trip at one time. 61. A HOP Card will need to be loaded with a pre-paid trip product, before a Cardholder can use it to undertake the appropriate travel. Pre-paid trip products will be able to be loaded onto HOP Cards at Auckland Transport ticket offices, through a network of Retailers, through self-service vending machines located within some stations and large transport exchanges, by calling the MAXX Customer Contact Centre and online via the Customer Web Portal. 62. To use a pre-paid trip, Cardholders must tag on to the transport service when they board, and tag off the transport service before disembarking or leaving the station or ferry wharf. If the journey matches a pre-paid trip, then the pre-paid trip is used. If the journey undertaken does not match the pre-paid trip type, either stored value or an applicable period pass will be used instead. 63. If a HOP Card has been registered online, the Cardholder will be able to set up automatic renewals of pre-paid trips. Pre-paid trips that are stored on a registered HOP Card that is lost, stolen or damaged will be transferable to a replacement card. Revenue flows resulting from purchase of a pre-paid trip product 64. The sale and use of a pre-paid trip product involves:  the Cardholder  the Retailer  Auckland Transport  the Transport Operator. 65. The flow of funds resulting from the purchase of a pre-paid trip product is as follows: (i) The Cardholder pays the cost of the pre-paid trip product to the Retailer (as agent for each Transport Operator with whom the pre- paid trip is ultimately redeemed). (ii) The Retailer pays the funds on a daily basis to the Stakeholder. (iii) The Stakeholder clears the funds to the Transport Operator. 14 66. Bus and train Transport Operators will be paid for each individual trip Cardholders take on their service using a pre-paid trip product. Funds collected from the sale of bus and train service pre-paid trips and held in the Stakeholder Account will be apportioned and paid to bus and train Transport Operators at the end of each day, based on the actual usage of pre-paid trips by Cardholders on a Transport Operator’s service on that day. 67. Ferry Transport Operators will be paid (from the Stakeholder Account) the full amount collected from the sale of a pre-paid trip product, on the day it is loaded onto the Cardholder’s HOP Card. 68. Transport Operators provide the actual transport to holders of pre-paid trips. Cardholders do not pay Transport Operators directly for their services. Period pass product 69. The period-pass is an electronic product that is stored on a HOP Card. To purchase a period pass under the AIFS, a customer must hold a HOP Card. 70. A period pass will entitle a Cardholder to unlimited travel within the defined travel area for a specified number of days. A travel period begins on the date that a period pass is activated for the first time by the Cardholder tagging on with a Transport Operator. A travel period ends when the specified number of days has elapsed since the period pass was first activated. 71. For the purpose of period passes, the Auckland region will be split into three travel zones, with period passes being available for travel within either a single zone, which must be specified at the time of purchase, or all zones. Bus and train period passes will be available for unlimited bus and train travel within a defined number of zones, but will not be able to be used on ferry services. 72. Ferry period passes will be service based and operator specific, meaning that a period pass will be able to be used for unlimited travel on a specific ferry service. Ferry period passes will not be able to be used for bus or train travel. 73. HOP Cards will only be able to store one type of bus and train period pass and one type of ferry period pass at one time. However, a new period pass may be loaded onto a HOP Card up to seven days before expiry of the current period pass. 74. A HOP Card will need to be loaded with a period pass product, before a Cardholder can use it to undertake the appropriate travel. Period pass products will be able to be loaded onto HOP Cards at Auckland Transport ticket offices, through a network of Retailers, through self-service vending machines located within some stations and large transport exchanges, by calling the MAXX Customer Contact Centre, and online via the Customer Web Portal. 75. To use a period pass, passengers must tag on to the transport service when they board, and tag off the transport service before disembarking or leaving a station or ferry wharf. If the travel begins and ends within the defined travel area of the period pass, then the period pass will be used. If the actual travel begins or ends outside the geographic area covered by the period pass, the fare will be deducted from the Cardholder's stored value purse or pre-paid trips balance (depending on availability of products on the HOP Card). 15 76. If a HOP Card has been registered online, the Cardholder will be able to set up automatic renewals of period passes. 77. Period passes that are stored on a HOP Card that is lost, stolen or damaged may be transferred to the replacement card, if the original card was registered online. Revenue flows resulting from purchase of a period pass product 78. The sale and use of a period pass product involves:  the Cardholder  the Retailer  Auckland Transport  the Transport Operator. 79. The flow of funds resulting from the purchase of a period pass product is as follows: (i) The Cardholder pays the cost of the period pass product to the Retailer (as agent for each Transport Operator with whom the period pass is ultimately redeemed). (ii) The Retailer pays the funds on a daily basis to the Stakeholder. (iii) The Stakeholder clears the funds to the Transport Operator. 80. Funds collected from the sale of all period passes will be held in a revenue pool in the Stakeholder Account, until such time as each Transport Operator’s entitlement is able to be determined. Funds collected from bus and train period passes will be paid to bus and train Transport Operators based on the proportion of period pass trips undertaken by Cardholders. Therefore, even when a period pass has been used to initiate travel with a particular Transport Operator, it will not be possible to determine the amount that a particular Transport Operator is entitled to, as this will be dependent on the proportion of total trips initiated with the period pass. For example, if only one bus or train trip is undertaken by a Cardholder using a period pass, the relevant Transport Operator will receive 100% of the purchase price of the period pass; if 100 bus and/or train trips are undertaken using a period pass, Transport Operators will receive only 1% of the purchase price of the period pass for each trip they provided to the Cardholder. 81. Funds collected from the sale of bus and train period passes will be paid to bus and train Transport Operators within seven days of the period pass expiring. Funds collected from the sale of a ferry period pass will be paid to the relevant ferry Transport Operator on the day it is loaded onto the Cardholder’s HOP Card. 82. Transport Operators provide the actual transport to holders of period passes. Cardholders do not pay Transport Operators directly for their services.

1 PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 12/ 04 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute (the Institute). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of section CW 36. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the Institute’s payment of a scholarship to students enrolled in the bone-, stone- and pounamu-carving school Te Takapū o Rotowhio (Te Takapū). Te Takapū runs a two-year diploma (pōkairua) in bone, stone and pounamu carving. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Act 1963 established the Institute. Under the 1963 Act, the purpose of the Institute is to operate as a showcase for Maoritanga with an emphasis on displaying aspects of Māori culture to tourists. The Institute is also charged with furthering the development of carving in a traditional manner. 2. Since 1967, the Institute has awarded two types of qualification, the New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Diploma and New Zealand Māori Arts and Crafts Institute Certificate. 3. In 1994, a “needs analysis” of the Institute was undertaken. As a result of the analysis, the Institute decided to refocus its activities on training and educating Māori. To this end, the Institute awards Te Takapū o Rotowhio Pōkairua (the Diploma), a diploma in bone, stone and pounamu carving. 4. To be awarded the Diploma, students must complete 10 modules. Each module carries a designated number of credits. Students need 360 credits to complete the course. The modules and their levels and credits are as shown in the table below. No. Name of module Level Credits 1 Studio Practice 1 4 45 2 Technical Skills 1 4 45 3 Studio Practice 2 5 45 4 Technical Skills 2 6 35 5 Research 1 5 40 6 Research 2 6 30 7 Introduction to Small Business Planning for the Creative Industries 4 30 8 Marketing for the Creative Industries 5 35 2 9 Basic Finance for the Creative Industries 6 20 10 Small Business Planning and Practice for the Creative Industries 6 35 5. The Institute has trained student carvers since 1967. In 2011, three students were enrolled in the first intake of year 1 of the Diploma. During 2012, three students have progressed to year 2 and two new students have been recruited to year 1. Scholarship Agreement and Scholarship Policy 6. The Institute offers a limited number of scholarships to help students (tauira) while they are studying. The Scholarship Agreement (the Agreement) entered into between the Institute and its tauira has the following features:  Each scholarship is for the amount of $18,200 per year paid in weekly sums over a two-year term. The amount of the annual scholarship payment may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the Consumers Price Index.  The Agreement sets out the hours of class attendance required by tauira, terms and study periods.  The Agreement states that the Institute will provide a uniform and tools for tauira.  Any carvings or other items tauira produce during their studies are the property of the Institute. 7. The scholarship payments help to cover the living costs of tauira. Tauira have generally moved from their tribal area, are young and have few assets. The Institute covers all costs of training, protective clothing, tools, equipment and raw materials. 8. The Institute also has a scholarship policy, which is set out below: SCHOLARSHIP POLICY (i) The Maori Arts and Crafts Institute now offers student scholarships to successful applicants to Te Takapu o Rotowhio. (ii) Scholarships will be offered annually to successful applications to Te Takapu o Rotowhio and the number of students will be determined or negotiated between the Institute and Te Wananga (iii) Scholarships will be awarded to a successful applicant for one year of study upon recommendation of the interview panel. (iv) A review of year one will be undertaken encompassing the student’s achievements and compliance with Te Wananga and New Zealand Maori Arts and Crafts Institute Policies. (v) The Scholarship awarded for all students is $18,200.00 per annum. (vi) Award payments will be made weekly in an effort to assist students budget adequately for the year. 3 (vii) Award payments will be direct credited to student bank accounts and record of payments identified through student bank statements. (viii) Te Wananga reserves the right to terminate a student’s scholarship with one week’s notice of such termination, for serious breaches of Wananga/Institute policies and dismissal through misconduct. (a) Students will, for the first three months of their first year with Te Wananga, move through a probation period. During this time Te Wananga staff and students will determine suitability/ability to cope with the course challenges. (b) Termination of a student’s scholarship may also be the result of the student’s inability to fully complete Module assignments or practice tasks described within the Wananga’s curriculum to prescribed standards and within given time-frames. (c) Students who wish to terminate their scholarships may do so either during the probation period or by giving one week’s notice of such termination in writing. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: a) Scholarship payments that the Institute makes to a student pursuant to the Arrangement will be exempt income of the student under s CW 36. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2011 and ending on 31 March 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 28 th of August 2012.

\[BR Prd 12/05 has been withdrawn and replaced by BR 14/05\] PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 12/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ProCare Health Limited (PHL). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 1 and CD 8. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue by PHL of two tranches of new shares to its existing shareholders and a further two tranches to the ProCare Charitable Foundation (the Trust), and the redemption of one of the tranches issued to existing shareholders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The parties to the Arrangement 1. PHL was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and provides management and clinical services to its subsidiaries. One of PHL’s subsidiaries is a Primary Health Organisation, which is contracted by the Auckland District Health Board to provide primary healthcare services to patients in the Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waitemata District Health Board domiciles. PHL also has two commercial subsidiaries that provide medical services. 2. PHL currently has 389 shareholders, each of whom are general practitioners (GPs) contracted to PHL. It is currently not mandatory for contracted GPs to hold a share in PHL, and there are approximately 400 GPs currently contracted to PHL who are not shareholders. 3. The Trust will be newly established with PHL as the Settlor. Under clause 2.3 of the draft Procare Charitable Foundation Trust Deed, the Trust has the purpose of promoting the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged communities across the Greater Auckland Region and, to that end, the Trust is authorised to provide grants and funding and develop programmes. The Trust will seek registration as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. Background to the Arrangement 4. It is proposed that PHL will introduce a mandatory shareholding requirement for contracted GPs. It is hoped that the introduction of mandatory shareholding will increase the engagement of contracted GPs with the organisation, and that it will provide all contracted GPs with the ability to participate in PHL’s governance. 5. Following the introduction of mandatory shareholding, PHL will need to issue new ordinary shares to contracted GPs who are not currently shareholders. Before issuing these new shares, PHL will undergo a capital restructure, return value to its existing shareholders, and establish the Trust. PHL has over 90% shareholder approval for the proposed restructure. Steps involved in the Arrangement 6. The steps involved in the Arrangement are: (a) The issue by PHL to all existing shareholders of two tranches of non- voting redeemable preference shares (RPS), being: (i) a fully imputed taxable bonus issue, as defined in s YA 1, subparagraph (b) (Tranche 1); and (ii) a non-taxable bonus issue as defined in s YA 1 (Tranche 2). (b) The redemption and cancellation off market by PHL of the Tranche 2 shares at face value (in aggregate, approximately $2.5 million). (c) The issue by PHL of a small number of non-voting B shares to the Trust (Tranche 3). (d) The fully imputed taxable bonus issue, as defined in s YA 1, subparagraph (b), by PHL of non-voting B shares to the Trust (Tranche 4). 7. The steps involved in the Arrangement are summarised in the following diagram: 2 Further details of the Arrangement 8. In issuing and redeeming the shares, PHL will be acting pursuant to the Constitution of PHL. Clause 2.1 of the Constitution provides: Shares on adoption: Upon or following adoption of this constitution, the Company will have the following classes of share on issue: a. Ordinary Shares; b. Redeemable preference Shares; and c. B Shares. 9. Pursuant to clause 2.1 of the Constitution, PHL may issue different classes of shares, including shares that: a. Are redeemable within the meaning of section 68 of the Act; b. Confer preferential rights to receive distributions of capital or income; c. Confer special, limited or condition voting rights; or d. Do not confer voting rights. 10. Clause 2.5 of the Constitution provides: Redemption of Shares: The Company may exercise an option to redeem redeemable Shares issued by the Company in relation to one or more holders of redeemable Shares. 11. The Tranche 1 shares will be non-voting and will not carry any “shareholder decision-making rights” (as defined in s YA 1). The Tranche 1 shares will pay dividends of approximately 7.5% per annum. PHL will elect to treat the Tranche 1 shares as a dividend pursuant to s CD 8(2). PHL does not intend to redeem the Tranche 1 shares in the foreseeable future. 12. The Tranche 2 will be non-voting and do not carry any “shareholder decision-making rights” (as defined in s YA 1). The Tranche 2 shares will have a face value approximate to that of the Tranche 1 shares. The Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 shares will be issued on near identical terms, but PHL will elect to treat them as shares of different classes. PHL will not elect to treat the Tranche 2 shares as a dividend. 13. As noted already PHL will redeem and cancel the Tranche 2 shares. The amount paid by PHL for the redemption and cancellation will exceed the available subscribed capital of class (ASC) under the ordering rule. 14. The Tranche 3 shares and Tranche 4 shares issued to the Trust will be B shares. These shares will be non-voting and will not carry any “shareholder decision-making rights” (as defined in s YA 1). The B shares will not be able to be traded, and are expected to pay dividends in the future. The total value of the B shares is expected to be approximately $2.5 million. PHL will elect to treat the Tranche 4 shares as a dividend pursuant to s CD 8(2). 15. Following the steps outlined in paragraph 6 above, the contracted GPs who are not currently shareholders of PHL will be required to subscribe for an ordinary share (the subscription amount is expected to be approximately $500 per share). 3 16. At the time the Tranche 3 shares are issued, the Trustees of the Trust will not be shareholders of PHL or associated with shareholders of PHL. PHL will issue these shares only in order to benefit the Trust and to enable it to carry out its charitable activities. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Tranche 1 shares will be a dividend and consequently income of the shareholders under s CD 1. b) The Tranche 2 shares will not be a dividend and consequently will not be income of the shareholders under s CD 1. c) The payment PHL makes to the shareholders for the redemption and cancellation of the Tranche 2 shares will be a dividend and consequently income of the shareholders under s CD 1. d) If any shareholder is treated under s CB 4 as having derived income as a result of the payment PHL makes to him or her for the redemption and cancellation of the Tranche 2 shares, the income of the shareholder under s CB 4 will be zero as a result of s CD 53(2). e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2012 and ending on 1 October 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 1 st day of October 2012. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings) 4

Sources of electricity generation are often hundreds of kilometres away from electricity consumers. The transmission system used to transport electricity over long distances is subject to:  loss of energy (which means more electricity must be generated than is consumed);  congestion (where a shortage in the transmission capacity to supply the demand leads to more expensive sources of generation being used to supply electricity demanded); and  risk of failure of critical elements (which means generation or demand reduction must be on standby to cover such an event, referred to as “instantaneous reserves”). 2. These factors can result in large unpredictable price differences across the electricity grid, resulting in “locational price risk”. 3. Electricity retailers buy electricity on the wholesale market at points of connection on the grid where their customers are located. Generators sell electricity to the market at the location where they generate electricity. As most generators are also retailers, they sell electricity to the wholesale market at different locations from where they buy it. 4. Wholesale market prices are volatile and can rise quickly and sharply if certain events occur, such as when transmission cables or power stations are taken out of service (either for faults or maintenance). This can result in large and volatile differences in wholesale market prices across New Zealand, such as between the North and South Islands, or between locations within each island. 5. An example of this problem occurs during “dry winters” when low rainfall constrains electricity generation from hydro dams, most of which (and the largest) are in the South Island, such as occurred in 2008. Minimising the use of hydro generation in the South Island requires large volumes of electricity to be “imported” from the North Island, which occurs over the high voltage direct current (HVDC) link between Wellington (Haywards) and Benmore. When the desired volume exceeds the southward capacity of the HVDC link, wholesale market prices in the South Island rise above North Island prices. 6. The lack of a secure and low-cost mechanism to manage locational price risk makes electricity retailers unwilling to enter new areas and compete for customers in regions where they do not have generation. This has resulted in some areas having relatively weak retail competition and, possibly, higher retail prices than they would otherwise have. 7. Before the introduction of FTRs, generator–retailers minimised their locational price risks by seeking retail customers in regions near to their generation assets. Retailers could also arrange hedge contracts with generators or other market participants. However, they were still likely to be exposed to some locational price risk. Reta ilers could also seek to arrange a basis swap (swap their locational risk position) with another party, but they may have continued to be exposed to locational price risk 3 if the other party was subject to weak competitive pressure and could alter the price and undermine the benefit of the swap. Sufficient basis swaps may not have been available because local generation in a region often accounts for only a portion of the load served—the rest is served from power imported over the transmission network. 8. Locational price risk was a matter that the Electricity Authority was required to address under s 42 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 which relevantly provides: 42 Specific new matters to be in Code (1) Before the date that is 1 year after this section comes into force \[1 November 2011\], the Authority must either— (a) have amended the Code so that it includes all the matters described in subsection (2) (the new matters); or (b) to the extent that the Code does not include all the new matters, have delivered to the Minister a report described in subsection (3). (2) The new matters are as follows: ... (c) mechanisms to help wholesale market participants manage price risks caused by constraints on the national grid: 9. In late 2011, the Code was amended to address locational price risk by enabling qualifying participants to purchase FTRs. FTRs are a form of hedge contract for wholesale market participants to cover price risks between two points on the national grid. They are intended to operate as a hedge against the volatile price differences between the half-hourly spot prices of electricity in the North and South Islands that arise and to hedge Participants against additional costs they may incur in the use of the national grid because of physical constraints and energy losses. FTRs will allow electricity traders to manage locational price risk arising from variations in wholesale spot prices between two price points (hubs) on the wholesale electricity market, such as Benmore and Otahuhu. FTRs will provide cover for the full price difference between the two hubs (except where insufficient funding is available to settle the FTRs, in which case a pro–rata scaling of the payment will apply). 10. FTRs allow generators to fix the price at which they can deliver electricity to a particular point and allow consumers to remove the risk of price escalations between the point of generation and the point of consumption. To clarify, FTRs hedge against price risk due to transmission effects rather than energy price. By analogy to an industry producing physical goods, FTRs allow the producer or consumer to fix the cost of delivery, and thus the return or cost to them, regardless of actual cartage costs. 11. In contrast to standard hedge contracts that are funded by the parties issuing them, FTRs are centrally funded from surplus money accruing in the wholesale electricity market (often called “loss and constraint rentals”). These surpluses arise because prices in the wholesale market reflect the marginal cost of electricity at each point along the national grid. The surplus money in the wholesale market is expected to be broadly sufficient to fund FTRs. However, funding for an FTR is not guaranteed and occasionally because of extreme events the price difference between Otahuhu and Benmore may not be fully covered by the FTR. 4 12. Ownership of an Option FTR does not entitle the Participant or FTR Holder to any rights for physical delivery of electricity or power. Relevant documents 13. The following documents are relevant to the Arrangement:  The Electricity Industry Participation Code 2010; and  The FTR Allocation Plan, issued (from time to time) by the FTR Manager under cl 13.238 of the Code and approved by the Electricity Authority under subpart 6 of Part 13 of the Code. Parties to the Arrangement 14. The parties to the Arrangement are the:  Electricity Authority;  Clearing Manager;  FTR Manager;  Participant; and  FTR Holder (the person registered as the holder of the FTR on the FTR register maintained by the FTR Manager, in the event that the FTR has been assigned in accordance with cl 13.248 of the Code). 15. The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity responsible for the efficient operation and regulation of the New Zealand electricity market. The Electricity Authority must pursue the statutory objective set out in s 15 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 to promote competition in, reliable supply by, and the efficient operation of, the electricity industry for the long-term benefit of consumers. 16. Energy Clearing House is the current Clearing Manager. Energy Clearing House is a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993, resident in New Zealand for GST purposes and a “registered person” as that term is defined in s 2(1). 17. Energy Market Services (EMS), a division of Transpower New Zealand Limited (Transpower), is the current FTR Manager. EMS is the market operation service provider contracted as FTR Manager under the Code. 18. The Electricity Authority appoints the Clearing Manager and the FTR Manager under Part 3 of the Code as market operation service providers. Under cl 3.4 of the Code, the remuneration of a market operation service provider is as agreed between the Electricity Authority and the service provider. Clause 3.4 of the Code provides: 3.4 Terms of market operation service provider agreements (1) The remuneration of a market operation service provider is as agreed between the Authority and the market operation service provider. (2) The Authority and the market operation service provider may agree on any other terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the functions, rights, powers, and obligations of that market operation service provider under this Code (except parts 6 and 9) and Part 2 and Subpart 1 of Part 4 of the Act. 5 Option financial transmission rights 19. Option FTRs ("one way" FTRs), will provide the Participant with a cap on the FTR reference price in return for payment of a premium. If the FTR reference price on settlement day exceeds the strike price, the Participant (or the FTR Holder, if the Participant has assigned the FTR in accordance with the Code) will receive the difference between the FTR reference price and the strike price. 20. The reference price for FTRs will be the sum of certain differences in final prices for electricity between the relevant hubs over the relevant contract period. For example assuming that the relevant hubs are the nodes at Benmore and Otahuhu:  If the final price at both Benmore and Otahuhu is $60 per megawatt hour (MWh) for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be zero; but  If the final price at Benmore is $40/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $100/MWh for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be $60/MWh multiplied by the number of trading periods in the contract period. Conversely, if the final price at Benmore is $100/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $40/MWh for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be zero (as the differences in final prices are all negative $60/MWh). 21. As of the date of this Ruling, Option FTRs will be for multiples of 0.1 MW, and will be issued in respect of a particular billing period (calendar month) or part of a billing period. FTRs may be made available up to two years or more ahead of the billing period to which they relate. 22. Option FTRs will require the Clearing Manager in accordance with cl 13.246 of the Code (see para 34), and in respect of the Option FTR contract, to pay the Participant or FTR Holder where the FTR reference price (the sum of certain differences between the final prices for electricity at the two hubs specified in the Option FTR contract—for example, Otahuhu and Benmore—over the specified contract period) is greater than the strike price. No corresponding obligation to make payment arises for the Participant or FTR Holder under the Option FTRs (that is, where the FTR reference price is less than the strike price on a specified date in the future (Settlement Day). The FTR reference price will be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the contract. Settlement Day is the 20 th day of the calendar month following the end of the contract period. 23. Option FTRs will be auctioned. On the date of entering into the Option FTR contract, Participants will agree to pay the premium determined by the auction. 24. The premium will not be payable at the time of the auction; instead, it will be payable at the time payment is required for the billing period in which settlement occurs, and will be included in the invoice issued by the Clearing Manager for the relevant Option FTR (and for any other services that may have been acquired from, or supplied to, the Clearing Manager – such as electricity or ancillary services). If any payment is due to the 6 Participant or FTR Holder from the Clearing Manager, the premium will be deducted from this amount. 25. Option FTRs will initially be split into two sub-types:  North Island to South Island, where the Participant or FTR Holder will receive the difference if the price at the relevant South Island hub exceeds the price at the relevant North Island hub (providing hedge protection for, by way of example, North Island generators retailing electricity in the South Island); and  South Island to North Island, where the Participant or FTR Holder receives the difference if the price at the relevant North Island hub exceeds the price at the relevant South Island hub (providing hedge protection for, by way of example, South Island generators retailing electricity in the North Island). Terms and conditions of an Option financial transmission right 26. All Option FTRs will be on standard terms and conditions. The standard terms and conditions will provide:  the type of FTR (option or obligation);  the contract period and contract unit;  the relevant hubs or “grid reference points”;  the formula for calculating the FTR pay-out and total settlement amount;  settlement terms; and  market disruption and termination events. Financial transmission right auctions 27. FTRs will be allocated to Participants by way of an auction that the FTR Manager will conduct. 28. It is currently anticipated that the following would be an appropriate list of Participants. However, entities not listed may be permitted to be Participants in future:  a person whose principal business is purchasing or selling electricity;  a person who uses in excess of 10 GWh per year of electricity;  Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand;  A Crown entity named in the Crown Entities Act 2004 that is permitted to enter into a derivative transaction in accordance with subpart 3 of Part 4 of the Crown Entities Act 2004;  a State enterprise named in the First Schedule or Second Schedule to the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986; 7  a member of the trade association known as the Major Electricity Users Group;  a registered bank as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989;  a person whose principal business is the investment of money or who, in the course of and for the purposes of their business, habitually invest money;  a person who is authorised to carry on the business of dealing in futures contracts under the Securities Markets Act 1988;  a person authorised in another jurisdiction by the competent authority of that jurisdiction to deal in futures contracts; and  a person that is a related body corporate of any of the persons listed above. FTR Manager 29. The FTR Manager will be responsible for:  preparing and publishing the FTR allocation plan (which the Electricity Authority must approve);  collecting relevant information from the grid owner, system operator and Clearing Manager;  determining the number of FTRs to be offered in each auction;  designing and operating the auction process; and  operating the FTR register. 30. The FTR Manager will prepare an FTR allocation plan, which will determine the number and nature of FTRs to be offered for auction in respect of a particular FTR period. Schedule 13.5 of the Code sets out the requirements for the FTR allocation plan and provides: Schedule 13.5 Requirements for FTR allocation plan 1 Purpose The purpose of this Schedule is to set out the requirements for the FTR allocation plan prepared by the FTR manager under subpart 6 of Part 13. 2 Requirements for design of FTRs (1) FTRs must be allocated by auction. (2) At a minimum, the FTRs allocated under the FTR allocation plan must be FTRs between a hub in the South Island and a hub in the North Island that would provide a reasonable match with the trading points for exchange–traded futures products or the equivalent electricity futures products, and which would enable the volumes of FTRs available to reflect inter-island grid capacity. 8 (3) The FTR manager must offer option FTRs and obligation FTRs. (4) The FTRs offered must include FTRs for which the FTR period is 1 month. (5) Subclause (4) does not prevent the FTR manager from offering FTRs relating to a shorter FTR period in addition to FTRs for which the FTR period is 1 month. 3 Requirements for FTR auction design (1) The number and nature of the FTRs allocated under the FTR allocation plan and available for auction must be— (a) supported by a reasonable estimate of the capacity of the grid for the relevant period; and (b) set so as to achieve a reasonable balance between the following: (i) ensuring that there is revenue available that is sufficient to settle the FTRs: (ii) ensuring that sufficient FTRs are available so that participants who wish to purchase FTRs are able to obtain them. (2) The FTR auction must be designed to— (a) maximise the value of trade in the auction as determined by the bids made in the auction; and (b) maximise competition in the auction; and (c) minimise costs of participation in the auction. (3) The FTR allocation plan must include FTR auction rules. (4) The initial FTR allocation plan must specify a plan that seeks to— (a) ensure that, no later than 1 year after the first FTR auction, FTRs are available in each FTR auction relating to an initial month and to at least each of the 11 months following the initial month; and (b) ensure that the availability of FTRs is progressively increased so that, no later than 3 years after the first FTR auction, FTRs are available in each FTR auction relating t o an initial month and to at least the 23 months following the initial month. 4 Requirements for FTR grid design The FTR grid must— (a) be based on each grid owner's forecast of the configuration and capacity of its grid for the FTR period; and (b) make allowance for relevant planned and unplanned outages in accordance with reasonable transmission operating practice. 9 31. Clause 13.242 of the Code states that the FTR Manager must create and allocate FTRs. Clause 13.242 provides: 13.242 FTR manager must create and allocate FTRs (1) The FTR manager must create and allocate FTRs in accordance with the FTR allocation plan approved under clause 13.240. (2) Every FTR must relate to - (a) a minimum quantity of electricity (in MW) of 0.1 MW; and (b) an amount of electricity (in MW) that is a multiple of 0.1 MW. Clearing Manager 32. The Clearing Manager will be responsible for:  ensuring persons wishing to take part in an FTR auction satisfy the prudential security requirements set out in the Code;  collecting and allocating FTR auction revenue, and dealing with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs, in accordance with Part 14 of the Code;  monitoring the prudential position of Participants and FTR Holders and ensuring Participants and FTR Holders maintain acceptable security;  managing the FTR account, including making and receiving final payments to and from the FTR account on the maturity of FTRs;  making recommendations to the Electricity Authority in relation to market disruption events; and  dealing with events of default. 33. Clause 13.245 of the Code states that the Clearing Manager must collect and allocate auction revenue. Clause 13.245 provides: 13.245 Clearing manager must collect and allocate auction revenue The clearing manager must collect the FTR auction revenue and allocate it in accordance with Part 14. 34. Clause 13 246 of the Code states that the Clearing manager must deal with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs. Clause 13.246 provides: 13.246 Clearing manager must deal with FTR receipts and payments The clearing manager must deal with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs in accordance with Part 14. 10 35. Clause 13.252 of the Code states that the FTR Manager must provide the following information to the Clearing Manager in relation to each successful bidder in an FTR auction. Clause 13.252 provides: 13.252 Information to be provided to clearing manager (1) The FTR manager must provide the following information to the clearing manager in relation to each successful bidder in an FTR auction: (a) the details of each FTR allocated under an FTR auction, including— (i) the period to which the FTR applies; and (ii) whether the FTR is an option FTR or an obligation FTR; and (iii) the formula under which the amount payable or to be paid is to be calculated for the settlement of the FTR: (b) the price at which each FTR has been allocated. (2) The FTR manager must provide the information specified in subclause (1) to the clearing manager as soon as practicable and no later than 1 week after each FTR auction. 36. Nothing in the Code states that the Clearing Manager is acting as agent for any other person when the Clearing Manager makes or receives payments in respect of an Option FTR. Auction process 37. The FTR allocation plan outlines the FTR auction process which is broadly as set out below:  The FTR Manager will first announce an FTR auction. A party wishing to participate in the FTR auction (Participant) will apply to the FTR Manager to do so. The FTR Manager will notify the Clearing Manager that the party wishes to participate in the FTR auction.  The FTR Manager will then determine the security that the Participant will need to provide, in accordance with the Clearing Manager’s prudential security assessment methodology. This methodology will be based on the Code’s current security requirements, which require a Participant to maintain an acceptable credit rating in accordance with cl 14.6 of the Code, or to provide to the Clearing Manager, and maintain, acceptable security in accordance with cl 14.5 of the Code. Acceptable forms of security include cash deposits, unconditional guarantees or letters of credit, security bonds, hedge settlement agreements or any similar securities.  Based on information received from the Clearing Manager, the FTR Manager will determine a limit for the Participant in an FTR auction that specifies the maximum liability that the Participant can incur in respect of its bids in the auction.  The FTR Manager will establish an “account” for the Participant in the FTR register and record the Participant’s auction trading limit. The FTR Manager will then determine the quantity, type and price of FTRs that will be awarded to different Participants given the available supply of FTRs. 11  As in the electricity market, most FTR markets use uniform fixed pricing rather than pay-as-bid pricing. This means that the price all bidders pay for each FTR type and period will be the price at which the market clears (where supply equals demand). Given the shape of demand curves, which are downward sloping, this is likely to mean all Participants will pay the price bid by the marginal (lowest price) winning bidder. Clearing and settlement 38. Although the detail of the FTR clearing and settlement design is still being determined, it is expected that the following process will apply:  Once the auction has been completed, the FTR Manager will record the quantity of FTRs that Participants have purchased into Participants’ accounts in the FTR register, and advise bidders of the results of the auction and make the results available on the FTR Manager's website. The FTR Manager will also inform the Clearing Manager of the successful bidders, the details of each FTR allocated, and the price at which each FTR has been allocated.  The FTR Manager will subsequently monitor the prudential position of Participants or FTR Holders according to the methodology for determining the minimum level of security developed according to the requirements of the Code. This may involve using the latest clearing prices in FTR auctions and futures market prices as indicators of the expected value of FTRs before the FTR period. If necessary, it may also mean requiring Participants or FTR Holders to adjust their security position in the event of adverse movements in the expected FTR value. Conversely, if price movements are favourable, the Clearing Manager can reduce the level of security that a Participant or FTR Holder is required to hold.  At the completion of the FTR contract period, the Clearing Manager will calculate FTR pay-outs and payments required. The Clearing Manager will publish this information on a per megawatt (MW) basis (but not on an individual portfolio basis—portfolio information will only be provided to the Participant or FTR Holder).  The Clearing Manager will then issue invoices to Participants or FTR Holders. As with the wholesale electricity market, payment will be required by the 20th of the month following the FTR period.  The Clearing Manager will deposit revenue received in relation to FTRs in the FTR account.  The FTR Manager will be responsible for calculating the portion of the loss and constraint excess the Clearing Manager must pay into the FTR account each month (in accordance with sch 14.6 of the Code).  Any residual loss and constraint excess in the FTR account (that is, an amount remaining in the FTR account that relates to the relevant billing period and is not required to settle FTRs for that billing period) will be treated as loss and constraint excess, and will be paid to the grid owner for allocation to its transmission customers (as is the current position). 12  Following settlement, the FTR Manager will record in the FTR register that the FTRs have been settled. Invoices and payments 39. The Code requires invoices to be issued two business days after the Clearing Manager receives reconciliation information for the prior billing period (cls 14.36 and 14.44 of the Code). 40. Clause 14.36 of the Code provides: Invoices to and payments by payers 14.36 Issue of invoices (1) 2 business days after the clearing manager receives reconciliation information in respect of the prior billing period from the reconciliation manager in accordance with clause 28(c) of Schedule 15.4, the clearing manager must issue to each purchaser an invoice in respect of the trading period of the billing period to which the reconciliation information applies. (2) At the same time as the clearing manager issues invoices under subclause (1), the clearing manager must issue an invoice to each person to whom ancillary service costs have been allocated. (3) At the same time as the clearing manager issues invoices under subclause (1) or, if publication of final prices is delayed under clause 13.184 for any trading period in the billing period, 2 business days after the relevant final prices are published, the clearing manager must issue an invoice in respect of the settlement of any amount owing under an FTR and any FTR payment due in respect of an FTR. 41. Clause 14.44 of the Code provides: Payments to and from payees 14.44 Issue of invoices to payees Payee invoices must be issued as follows: (a) concurrently with issuing invoices to payers, the clearing manager must issue pro forma invoices to each payee. Each such pro forma invoice must detail the amount that the clearing manager must pay in respect of a billing period upon receiving payment from the payers, subject to clause 14.47 and clause 14.47A and the issue of an actual GST invoice for the amount payable to that payee. Payees must not issue GST invoices for supplies of electricity or ancillary services or ancillary service administrative costs to the clearing manager: (b) if the clearing manager issues a pro forma invoice to a payee and the total sum of the items specified in that pro forma invoice is such that the payee is obliged to pay the clearing manager, the payee is deemed to have been issued with an invoice, and the payee is deemed to be, in relation to that invoice, a payer. Clauses 14.36 to 14.54 apply to the payee as if it were a payer for the purposes of issue and payment of the invoice. 13 42. Clause 14.47A of the Code states that the Clearing Manager must calculate the total amount payable in respect of FTRs and must pay that amount in accordance with the terms of the FTR. Clause 14.47A relevantly provides: 14.47A Payments in respect of FTRs (1) The clearing manager must calculate the total amount payable by the clearing manager in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period. (2) The clearing manager must publish the amount payable by a person or to a person per MW in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period. (3) The clearing manager must pay any amount payable in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period from the FTR account, in accordance with the terms of the FTR. (4) If the total amount required to be paid by the clearing manager in respect of FTRs in respect of the billing period exceeds the amount of all funds in the FTR account available for the settlement of FTRs in the relevant billing period, the clearing manager must amend each amount payable to a person in respect of each FTR for that billing period so that the amount payable is calculated according to the following formula: ... (5) Subclause (4) does not apply to an FTR in respect of which the holder of the FTR is required to pay an amount to the clearing manager. Secondary market 43. It is expected that over time a secondary market will develop for FTRs. The Code provides that FTRs may be sold or assigned to other persons, providing the purchaser satisfies the requirements that the Code specifies for Participants in the FTR market. That is, the purchaser would need to apply to the FTR Manager for registration of the FTR assignment, and provide the Clearing Manager with the necessary prudential security before the FTR Manager would be able to register the assignment of the FTR on the FTR register (at which time the purchaser would be an “FTR Holder”). The requirements for prudential security and assignment of FTRs are set out in cls 14.3 to 14.6 and 13.248 to 13.250 of the Code respectively. 44. Persons who acquire an FTR (or part of an FTR, for example, 0.5 MW of a 1.0 MW FTR) by way of assignment cannot do so otherwise than in accordance with cl 13.248 of the Code. Clauses 13.248(5) and (6) of the Code provide: 13.248 Assignment of FTRs ... (5) An assignment of an FTR or part of an FTR is not effective unless it is registered on the FTR register by the FTR manager. (6) The FTR manager must not register an assignment that is expressed to have effect after the end of the billing period to which the FTR relates. 45. Once an assignee has been registered as the holder of the FTR on the FTR register the assignee replaces the Participant as the counterparty to the FTR. 14 46. If the FTR has been assigned under cl 13.248 of the Code and the notification of assignment discloses the price at which the FTR has been assigned, cl 13.249 will apply and the assignee will become liable for the price disclosed when it becomes due on settlement. If the price disclosed in the notification is less than the FTR acquisition cost, the assignor will be liable to pay the difference to the Clearing Manager. If the price disclosed in the notification is more than the FTR acquisition cost, the assignor will be entitled to be paid the difference by the Clearing Manager. Clause 13.249 of the Code relevantly provides: 13.249 Liability for FTR payments when FTR assigned and price disclosed (1) This clause applies if— (a) an FTR is assigned under clause 13.248; and (b) the notification of assignment discloses the price at which the FTR has been assigned. (2) The FTR manager must provide a copy of the notification of assignment to the clearing manager. (3) The assignee becomes liable for the price disclosed under subclause (1)(b) when it becomes due on settlement of the FTR. (4) If the price disclosed in the notification is less than the FTR payment in respect of the FTR that would, if the assignment had not taken place, become due on settlement of the FTR, the assignor becomes liable to pay to the clearing manager an amount equal to the difference between the FTR payment and the price at which the FTR has been assigned. ... (7) If the price disclosed in the notification is more than the FTR payment in respect of the FTR that would, if the assignment had not taken place, become due on settlement of the FTR, the assignor becomes entitled to be paid by the clearing manager on settlement of the FTR an amount equal to the difference between the FTR payment and the price at which the FTR has been assigned. Loss and constraint excess 47. FTRs will be underpinned, and payments made by the Clearing Manager to Participants or FTR Holders under the FTRs will be funded, by FTR auction revenue and the “loss and constraint excess”. 48. The loss and constraint excess is, broadly, the difference between the aggregate amount the Clearing Manager receives from purchasers of electricity in a billing period (calendar month) and the aggregate amount the Clearing Manager pays to generators of electricity. 49. Historically the Clearing Manager allocated this loss and constraint excess to the owner of the national grid, which means it was not available to fund an instrument to protect purchasers from the high price under the constraint or generators from the low price. With the introduction of FTRs, the Clearing Manager will retain part of the loss and constraint excess for each billing period and use it to settle FTRs for the corresponding billing period. 50. Under cl 14.73 of the Code, the FTR Manager is required to determine the amount of loss and constraint excess that the Clearing Manager must retain and pay to the FTR account on the 20th day of each month following a billing period. 15 51. Where the amount retained for a billing period is greater than the amount required to settle the relevant FTRs, the balance will be paid to the grid owner. 52. Where the total amount required to be paid to Participants or FTR Holders in respect of FTRs for a billing period exceeds the amount of all funds in the FTR account (which is managed by the Clearing Manager), payments under the FTRs will be prorated and Participants or FTR Holders will receive a scaled amount. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) Option FTRs are entered into on arm’s length terms. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The supply of an Option FTR is a supply of financial services under s 3(1)(kaa).  The supply of an Option FTR (being the provision of a financial service as defined in s 3(1)(kaa)) by the Clearing Manager to a Participant or FTR Holder who is not “resident” in New Zealand (as defined in s 2(1)) and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed is subject to GST at the rate of 0% under ss 11A(1)(k) and 14(1B)(a), provided that s 11A(2) does not apply.  The premium paid by a Participant or FTR Holder to the Clearing Manager to acquire an Option FTR is “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for the supply of the Option FTR.  Amounts paid by the Clearing Manager to a Participant or FTR Holder in performance of the Clearing Manager’s obligations in respect of an Option FTR are not an adjustment to the “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) paid by the Participant or FTR Holder to the Clearing Manager for the supply of the Option FTR.  Amounts paid by the Clearing Manager to a Participant or FTR Holder in performance of the Clearing Manager’s obligations in respect of an Option FTR are not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for any “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Participant or FTR Holder to the Clearing Manager.  Amounts paid by a Participant or FTR Holder (in the event that the Option FTR has previously been assigned) to the Clearing Manager in performance of the Participant’s or FTR Holder’s (as appropriate) obligations in respect of an Option FTR that has been assigned to another FTR Holder are not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for any “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Clearing Manager. 16  Amounts paid by a Participant to an FTR Holder, or by an FTR Holder to a Participant or FTR Holder (in the event that the FTR has previously been assigned) in consideration for the assignment of an Option FTR are not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for any “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Participant or FTR Holder (as appropriate). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 18 th October 2012 and ending on 18 th October 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18 th day of October 2012. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)

Sources of electricity generation are often hundreds of kilometres away from electricity consumers. The transmission system used to transport electricity over long distances is subject to:  loss of energy (which means more electricity must be generated than is consumed);  congestion (where a shortage in the transmission capacity to supply the demand leads to more expensive sources of generation being used to supply electricity demanded); and  risk of failure of critical elements (which means generation or demand reduction must be on standby to cover such an event, referred to as “instantaneous reserves”). 2. These factors can result in large unpredictable price differences across the electricity grid, resulting in “locational price risk”. 3. Electricity retailers buy electricity on the wholesale market at points of connection on the grid where their customers are located. Generators sell electricity to the market at the location where they generate electricity. As most generators are also retailers, they sell electricity to the wholesale market at different locations from where they buy it. 4. Wholesale market prices are volatile and can rise quickly and sharply if certain events occur, such as when transmission cables or power stations are taken out of service (either for faults or maintenance). This can result in large and volatile differences in wholesale market prices across New Zealand, such as between the North and South Islands, or between locations within each island. 5. An example of this problem occurs during “dry winters” when low rainfall constrains electricity generation from hydro dams, most of which (and the largest) are in the South Island, such as occurred in 2008. Minimising the use of hydro generation in the South Island requires large volumes of electricity to be “imported” from the North Island, which occurs over the high voltage direct current (HVDC) link between Wellington (Haywards) and Benmore. When the desired volume exceeds the southward capacity of the HVDC link, wholesale market prices in the South Island rise above North Island prices. 6. The lack of a secure and low-cost mechanism to manage locational price riskmakes electricity retailers unwilling to enter new areas and compete for customers in regions where they do not have generation. This has resulted in some areas having relatively weak retail competition and, possibly, higher retail prices than they would otherwise have. 7. Before the introduction of FTRs, generator—retailers minimised their locational price risks by seeking retail customers in regions near to their generation assets. Retailers could also arrange hedge contracts with generators or other market participants. However, they were still likely to be exposed to some locational price risk. Retailers could also seek to arrange a basis swap (swap their locational risk position) with another party, but they may have continued to be exposed to locational price risk if the other party was subject to weak competitive pressure and could alter the price and undermine the benefit of the swap. 3 Sufficient basis swaps may not have been available because local generation in a region often accounts for only a portion of the load served—the rest is served from power imported over the transmission network. 8. Locational price risk was a matter that the Electricity Authority was required to address under s 42 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 which relevantly provides: 42 Specific new matters to be in Code (1) Before the date that is 1 year after this section comes into force \[1 November 2011\], the Authority must either— (a) have amended the Code so that it includes all the matters described in subsection (2) (the new matters); or (b) to the extent that the Code does not include all the new matters, have delivered to the Minister a report described in subsection (3). (2) The new matters are as follows: ... (c) mechanisms to help wholesale market participants manage price risks caused by constraints on the national grid: 9. In late 2011, the Code was amended to address locational price risk by enabling qualifying participants to purchase FTRs. FTRs are a form of hedge contract for wholesale market participants to cover price risks between two points on the national grid. They are intended to operate as a hedge against the volatile price differences between the half-hourly spot prices of electricity in the North and South Islands that arise and to hedge Participants against additional costs they may incur in the use of the national grid because of physical constraints and energy losses. FTRs will allow electricity traders to manage locational price risk arising from variations in wholesale spot prices between two price points (hubs) on the wholesale electricity market, such as Benmore and Otahuhu. FTRs will provide cover for the full price difference between the two hubs (except where insufficient funding is available to settle the FTRs, in which case a pro–rata scaling of the payment will apply). 10. FTRs allow generators to fix the price at which they can deliver electricity to a particular point and allow consumers to remove the risk of price escalations between the point of generation and the point of consumption. To clarify, FTRs hedge against price risk due to transmission effects rather than energy price. By analogy to an industry producing physical goods, FTRs allow the producer or consumer to fix the cost of delivery, and thus the return or cost to them, regardless of actual cartage costs. 11. In contrast to standard hedge contracts that are funded by the parties issuing them, FTRs are centrally funded from surplus money accruing in the wholesale electricity market (often called “loss and constraint rentals”). These surpluses arise because prices in the wholesale market reflect the marginal cost of electricity at each point along the national grid. The surplus money in the wholesale market is expected to be broadly sufficient to fund FTRs. However, funding for an FTR is not guaranteed and occasionally because of extreme events the price difference between Otahuhu and Benmore may not be fully covered by the FTR. 12. Ownership of an Obligation FTR does not entitle the Participant or FTR Holder to any rights for physical delivery of electricity or power. 4 Relevant documents 13. The following documents are relevant to the Arrangement:  The Electricity Industry Participation Code 2010; and  The FTR Allocation Plan, issued (from time to time) by the FTR Manager under cl 13.238 of the Code and approved by the Electricity Authority under subpart 6 of Part 13 of the Code. Parties to the Arrangement 14. The parties to the Arrangement are the:  Electricity Authority;  Clearing Manager;  FTR Manager;  Participant; and  FTR Holder (the person registered as the holder of the FTR on the FTR register maintained by the FTR Manager, in the event that the FTR has been assigned in accordance with cl 13.248 of the Code). 15. The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity responsible for the efficient operation and regulation of the New Zealand electricity market. The Electricity Authority must pursue the statutory objective set out in s 15 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 to promote competition in, reliable supply by, and the efficient operation of, the electricity industry for the long-term benefit of consumers. 16. Energy Clearing House is the current Clearing Manager. Energy Clearing House is a company incorporated under the Companies Act 1993, resident in New Zealand for GST purposes, and a “registered person” as that term is defined in s 2(1). 17. Energy Market Services (EMS), a division of Transpower New Zealand Limited (Transpower), is the current FTR Manager. EMS is the market operation service provider contracted as FTR Manager under the Code. 18. The Electricity Authority appoints the Clearing Manager and the FTR Manager under Part 3 of the Code as market operation service providers. Under cl 3.4 of the Code, the remuneration of a market operation service provider is as agreed between the Electricity Authority and the service provider. Clause 3.4 of the Code provides: 3.4 Terms of market operation service provider agreements (1) The remuneration of a market operation service provider is as agreed between the Authority and the market operation service provider. (2) The Authority and the market operation service provider may agree on any other terms and conditions, not inconsistent with the functions, rights, powers, and obligations of that market operation service provider under this Code (except parts 6 and 9) and Part 2 and Subpart 1 of Part 4 of the Act. 5 Obligation financial transmission rights 19. Obligation FTRs (“two way” FTRs), will provide that if the FTR reference price exceeds the initial price on settlement day, the Participant (or the FTR Holder, if the Participant has assigned the FTR in accordance with the Code) will receive the difference between the FTR reference price and the initial price. However, if the initial price exceeds the FTR reference price on settlement day, the Participant or the FTR Holder must pay the difference to the Clearing Manager. 20. The reference price for FTRs will be the sum of the differences in final prices for electricity between the relevant hubs over the relevant contract period. For example assuming the relevant hubs are the nodes at Benmore and Otahuhu:  If the final price at both Benmore and Otahuhu is $60 per megawatt hour (MWh) for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be zero; but  If the final price at Benmore is $40/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $100/MWh for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be $60/MWh multiplied by the number of trading periods in the contract period. Conversely, if the final price at Benmore is $100/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $40/MWh, then the FTR reference price will be negative $60/MWh multiplied by the number of trading periods in the contract period. 21. As of the date of this Ruling, Obligation FTRs will be for multiples of 0.1 MW, and will be issued in respect of a particular billing period (calendar month) or part of a billing period. FTRs may be made available up to two years or more ahead of the billing period to which they relate. 22. Obligation FTRs will require the Participant or FTR Holder to pay the Clearing Manager (where the FTR reference price is less than the initial price), or the Clearing Manager to pay the Participant or FTR Holder (where the FTR reference price is greater than the initial price), the difference between the relevant prices. 23. The FTR auction will determine the amount of the initial FTR price. Following the FTR auction, a successful Participant will enter into a legally binding contract for a specified contract period. Under the Obligation FTR contract the Participant will agree to be paid by the Clearing Manager or to pay to the Clearing Manager the FTR reference price (being the sum of the differences in final electricity prices between the two hubs specified in the contract—for example, Otahuhu and Benmore—over the specified contract period) on a specified date in the future (Settlement Day) less the initial FTR price (or the price disclosed under cl 13.249(1)(b) of the Code – in the event that the FTR has been assigned). In accordance with cl 13.246 of the Code (see para 34) and in respect of the Obligation FTR contract, the Clearing Manager will be required to pay to the Participant or FTR Holder or receive from the Participant or FTR Holder the FTR reference price less the initial FTR price (or the price disclosed under cl 13.249(1)(b) of the Code – in the event that the FTR has been assigned). . The FTR reference price will be calculated in accordance with the formula set out in the contract. Settlement Day is the 20 th day of the calendar month following the end of the contract period. 24. The initial price of an Obligation FTR is set by auction. Amounts payable by and to Participants or FTR Holders in respect of Obligation FTRs will be included in the 6 invoice issued by the Clearing Manager for the billing period in which settlement occurs. 25. Obligation FTRs will initially be split into two sub-types:  North Island to South Island, where the Participant or FTR Holder will receive the difference if the price at the relevant South Island hub exceeds the price at the relevant North Island hub, provided that amount exceeds the initial price or the price disclosed under cl 13.249(1)(b) of the Code – in the event that the FTR has been assigned (providing hedge protection for, by way of example, North Island generators retailing electricity in the South Island).  South Island to North Island, where the Participant or FTR Holder receives the difference if the price at the relevant North Island hub exceeds the price at the relevant South Island hub, provided that amount exceeds the initial price or the price disclosed under cl 13.249(1)(b) of the Code – in the event that the FTR has been assigned (providing hedge protection for, by way of example, South Island Generators retailing electricity in the North Island). Terms and conditions of an Obligation financial transmission right 26. All Obligation FTRs will be on standard terms and conditions. The standard terms and conditions will provide:  the type of FTR (option or obligation);  the contract period and contract unit;  the relevant hubs or “grid reference points”;  the formula for calculating the FTR pay-out and total settlement amount;  settlement terms; and  market disruption and termination events. Financial transmission right auctions 27. FTRs will be allocated to Participants by way of an auction that the FTR Manager will conduct. 28. It is currently anticipated that the following would be an appropriate list of Participants. However, entities not listed may be permitted to be Participants in future:  a person whose principal business is purchasing or selling electricity;  a person who uses in excess of 10 GWh per year of electricity;  Her Majesty the Queen in right of New Zealand;  a Crown entity named in the Crown Entities Act 2004 that is permitted to enter into a derivative transaction in accordance with subpart 3 of Part 4 of the Crown Entities Act 2004; 7  a State enterprise named in the First Schedule or Second Schedule to the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986;  a member of the trade association known as the Major Electricity Users Group;  a registered bank as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989;  a person whose principal business is the investment of money or who, in the course of and for the purposes of their business, habitually invest money;  a person who is authorised to carry on the business of dealing in futures contracts under the Securities Markets Act 1988;  a person authorised in another jurisdiction by the competent authority of that jurisdiction to deal in futures contracts; and  a person that is a related body corporate of any of the persons listed above. FTR Manager 29. The FTR Manager will be responsible for:  preparing and publishing the FTR allocation plan (which the Electricity Authority must approve);  collecting relevant information from the grid owner, system operator and Clearing Manager;  determining the number of FTRs to be offered in each auction;  designing and operating the auction process; and  operating the FTR register. 30. The FTR Manager will prepare an FTR allocation plan, which will determine the number and nature of FTRs to be offered for auction in respect of a particular FTR period. Schedule 13.5 of the Code sets out the requirements for the FTR allocation plan and provides: Schedule 13.5 Requirements for FTR allocation plan 1 Purpose The purpose of this Schedule is to set out the requirements for the FTR allocation plan prepared by the FTR manager under subpart 6 of Part 13. 2 Requirements for design of FTRs (1) FTRs must be allocated by auction. (2) At a minimum, the FTRs allocated under the FTR allocation plan must be FTRs between a hub in the South Island and a hub in the North Island that would provide a reasonable match with the trading points for exchange–traded futures products or the equivalent electricity futures products, and which would enable the volumes of FTRs available to reflect inter-island grid capacity. 8 (3) The FTR manager must offer option FTRs and obligation FTRs. (4) The FTRs offered must include FTRs for which the FTR period is 1 month. (5) Subclause (4) does not prevent the FTR manager from offering FTRs relating to a shorter FTR period in addition to FTRs for which the FTR period is 1 month. 3 Requirements for FTR auction design (1) The number and nature of the FTRs allocated under the FTR allocation plan and available for auction must be— (a) supported by a reasonable estimate of the capacity of the grid for the relevant period; and (b) set so as to achieve a reasonable balance between the following: (i) ensuring that there is revenue available that is sufficient to settle the FTRs: (ii) ensuring that sufficient FTRs are available so that participants who wish to purchase FTRs are able to obtain them. (2) The FTR auction must be designed to— (a) maximise the value of trade in the auction as determined by the bids made in the auction; and (b) maximise competition in the auction; and (c) minimise costs of participation in the auction. (3) The FTR allocation plan must include FTR auction rules. (4) The initial FTR allocation plan must specify a plan that seeks to— (a) ensure that, no later than 1 year after the first FTR auction, FTRs are available in each FTR auction relating to an initial month and to at least each of the 11 months following the initial month; and (b) ensure that the availability of FTRs is progressively increased so that, no later than 3 years after the first FTR auction, FTRs are available in each FTR auction relating to an in itial month and to at least the 23 months following the initial month. 4 Requirements for FTR grid design The FTR grid must— (a) be based on each grid owner's forecast of the configuration and capacity of its grid for the FTR period; and (b) make allowance for relevant planned and unplanned outages in accordance with reasonable transmission operating practice. 31. Clause 13.242 of the Code states that the FTR Manager must create and allocate FTRs. Clause 13.242 provides: 13.242 FTR manager must create and allocate FTRs (1) The FTR manager must create and allocate FTRs in accordance with the FTR allocation plan approved under clause 13.240. (2) Every FTR must relate to - (a) a minimum quantity of electricity (in MW) of 0.1 MW; and (b) an amount of electricity (in MW) that is a multiple of 0.1 MW. 9 Clearing Manager 32. The Clearing Manager will be responsible for:  ensuring persons wishing to take part in an FTR auction satisfy the prudential security requirements set out in the Code;  collecting and allocating FTR auction revenue, and dealing with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs, in accordance with Part 14 of the Code;  monitoring the prudential position of Participants and FTR Holders and ensuring Participants and FTR Holders maintain acceptable security;  managing the FTR account, including making and receiving final payments to and from the FTR account on the maturity of FTRs;  making recommendations to the Electricity Authority in relation to market disruption events; and  dealing with events of default. 33. Clause 13.245 of the Code states that the Clearing Manager must collect and allocate auction revenue. Clause 13.245 provides: 13.245 Clearing manager must collect and allocate auction revenue The clearing manager must collect the FTR auction revenue and allocate it in accordance with Part 14. 34. Clause 13.246 of the Code states that the Clearing manager must deal with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs. Clause 13.246 provides: 13.246 Clearing manager must deal with FTR receipts and payments The clearing manager must deal with all receipts and payments in respect of FTRs in accordance with Part 14. 35. Clause 13.252 of the Code states that the FTR Manager must provide the following information to the Clearing Manager in relation to each successful bidder in an FTR auction. Clause 13.252 provides: 13.252 Information to be provided to clearing manager (1) The FTR manager must provide the following information to the clearing manager in relation to each successful bidder in an FTR auction: (a) the details of each FTR allocated under an FTR auction, including— (i) the period to which the FTR applies; and (ii) whether the FTR is an option FTR or an obligation FTR; and (iii) the formula under which the amount payable or to be paid is to be calculated for the settlement of the FTR: (b) the price at which each FTR has been allocated. (2) The FTR manager must provide the information specified in subclause (1) to the clearing manager as soon as practicable and no later than 1 week after each FTR auction. 10 36. Nothing in the Code states that the Clearing Manager is acting as agent for any other person when the Clearing Manager makes or receives payments in respect of an Obligation FTR. Auction process 37. The FTR allocation plan outlines the FTR auction process which is broadly as set out below:  The FTR Manager will first announce an FTR auction. A party wishing to participate in the FTR auction (Participant) will apply to the FTR Manager to do so. The FTR Manager will notify the Clearing Manager that the party wishes to participate in the FTR auction.  The FTR Manager will then determine the security that the Participant will need to provide, in accordance with the Clearing Manager’s prudential security assessment methodology. This methodology will be based on the Code’s current security requirements, which require a Participant to maintain an acceptable credit rating in accordance with cl 14.6 of the Code, or to provide to the Clearing Manager, and maintain, acceptable security in accordance with cl 14.5 of the Code. Acceptable forms of security include cash deposits, unconditional guarantees or letters of credit, security bonds, hedge settlement agreements or any similar securities.  Once the Participant has provided the necessary level of security, the Clearing Manager will notify the FTR Manager that the Participant has met the prudential requirements.  Based on information received from the Clearing Manager, the FTR Manager will determine a limit for the Participant in an FTR auction that specifies the maximum liability that the Participant can incur in respect of its bids in the auction.  The FTR Manager will establish an “account” for the Participant in the FTR register and record the Participant’s auction trading limit. The FTR Manager will then determine the quantity, type and price of FTRs that will be awarded to different Participants given the available supply of FTRs.  As in the electricity market, most FTR markets use uniform fixed pricing rather than pay-as-bid pricing. This means that the price all bidders pay for each FTR type and period will be the price at which the market clears (where supply equals demand). Given the shape of demand curves, which are downward sloping, this is likely to mean all Participants will pay the price bid by the marginal (lowest price) winning bidder. Clearing and settlement 38. Although the detail of the FTR clearing and settlement design is still being determined, it is expected that the following process will apply:  Once the auction has been completed, the FTR Manager will record the quantity of FTRs that Participants have purchased into Participants’ accounts in the FTR register, and advise bidders of the results of the auction and make the results available on the FTR Manager’s website. The FTR Manager 11 will also inform the Clearing Manager of the successful bidders, the details of each FTR allocated, and the price at which each FTR has been allocated.  The FTR Manager will subsequently monitor the prudential position of Participants or FTR Holders according to the methodology for determining the minimum level of security developed according to the requirements of the Code. This may involve using the latest clearing prices in FTR auctions and futures market prices as indicators of the expected value of FTRs before the FTR period. If necessary, it may also mean requiring Participants or FTR Holders to adjust their security position in the event of adverse movements in the expected FTR value. Conversely, if price movements are favourable, the Clearing Manager can reduce the level of security that a Participant or FTR Holder is required to hold.  At the completion of the FTR contract period, the Clearing Manager will calculate FTR pay-outs and payments required. The Clearing Manager will publish this information on a per megawatt (MW) basis (but not on an individual portfolio basis—portfolio information will only be provided to the Participant or FTR Holder).  The Clearing Manager will then issue invoices to Participants or FTR Holders. As with the wholesale electricity market, payment will be required by the 20th of the month following the FTR period.  The Clearing Manager will deposit revenue received in relation to FTRs in the FTR account.  The FTR Manager will be responsible for calculating the portion of the loss and constraint excess the Clearing Manager must pay into the FTR account each month (in accordance with sch 14.6 of the Code).  Any residual loss and constraint excess in the FTR account (that is, an amount remaining in the FTR account that relates to the relevant billing period and is not required to settle FTRs for that billing period) will be treated as loss and constraint excess, and will be paid to the grid owner for allocation to its transmission customers (as is the current position).  Following settlement, the FTR Manager will record in the FTR register that the FTRs have been settled. Invoices and payments 39. The Code requires invoices to be issued two business days after the Clearing Manager receives reconciliation information for the prior billing period (cls 14.36 and 14.44 of the Code). 40. Clause 14.36 of the Code provides: Invoices to and payments by payers 14.36 Issue of invoices (1) 2 business days after the clearing manager receives reconciliation information in respect of the prior billing period from the reconciliation manager in accordance with clause 28(c) of Schedule 15.4, the clearing manager must issue to each purchaser an invoice in respect of the trading period of the billing period to which the reconciliation information applies. 12 (2) At the same time as the clearing manager issues invoices under subclause (1), the clearing manager must issue an invoice to each person to whom ancillary service costs have been allocated. (3) At the same time as the clearing manager issues invoices under subclause (1) or, if publication of final prices is delayed under clause 13.184 for any trading period in the billing period, 2 business days after the relevant final prices are published, the clearing manager must issue an invoice in respect of the settlement of any amount owing under an FTR and any FTR payment due in respect of an FTR. 41. Clause 14.44 of the Code provides: Payments to and from payees 14.44 Issue of invoices to payees Payee invoices must be issued as follows: (a) concurrently with issuing invoices to payers, the clearing manager must issue pro forma invoices to each payee. Each such pro forma invoice must detail the amount that the clearing manager must pay in respect of a billing period upon receiving payment from the payers, subject to clause 14.47 and clause 14.47A and the issue of an actual GST invoice for the amount payable to that payee. Payees must not issue GST invoices for supplies of electricity or ancillary services or ancillary service administrative costs to the clearing manager: (b) if the clearing manager issues a pro forma invoice to a payee and the total sum of the items specified in that pro forma invoice is such that the payee is obliged to pay the clearing manager, the payee is deemed to have been issued with an invoice, and the payee is deemed to be, in relation to that invoice, a payer. Clauses 14.36 to 14.54 apply to the payee as if it were a payer for the purposes of issue and payment of the invoice. 42. Clause 14.47A of the Code states that the Clearing Manager must calculate the total amount payable in respect of FTRs and must pay that amount in accordance with the terms of the FTR. Clause 14.47A relevantly provides: 14.47A Payments in respect of FTRs (1) The clearing manager must calculate the total amount payable by the clearing manager in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period. (2) The clearing manager must publish the amount payable by a person or to a person per MW in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period. (3) The clearing manager must pay any amount payable in respect of FTRs in respect of the current billing period from the FTR account, in accordance with the terms of the FTR. (4) If the total amount required to be paid by the clearing manager in respect of FTRs in respect of the billing period exceeds the amount of all funds in the FTR account available for the settlement of FTRs in the relevant billing period, the clearing manager must amend each amount payable to a person in respect of each FTR for that billing period so that the amount payable is calculated according to the following formula: ... (5) Subclause (4) does not apply to an FTR in respect of which the holder of the FTR is required to pay an amount to the clearing manager. Secondary market 43. It is expected that over time a secondary market will develop for FTRs. The Code provides that FTRs may be sold or assigned to other persons, providing the purchaser satisfies the requirements that the Code specifies for Participants in the 13 FTR market. That is, the purchaser would need to apply to the FTR Manager for registration of the FTR assignment, and provide the Clearing Manager with the necessary prudential security before the FTR Manager would be able to register the assignment of the FTR on the FTR register (at which time the purchaser will be an “FTR Holder”). The requirements for prudential security and assignment of FTRs are set out in cls 14.3 to 14.6 and 13.248 to 13.250 of the Code respectively. 44. Persons who acquire an FTR (or part of an FTR, for example, 0.5 MW of a 1.0 MW FTR) by way of assignment cannot do so otherwise than in accordance with cl 13.248 of the Code. Clauses 13.248(5) and (6) of the Code provide: 13.248 Assignment of FTRs ... (5) An assignment of an FTR or part of an FTR is not effective unless it is registered on the FTR register by the FTR manager. (6) The FTR manager must not register an assignment that is expressed to have effect after the end of the billing period to which the FTR relates. 45. Once an assignee has been registered as the holder of the FTR on the FTR register, the assignee replaces the Participant as the counterparty to the FTR. 46. If the FTR has been assigned under cl 13.248 of the Code and the notification of assignment discloses the price at which the FTR has been assigned, cl 13.249 will apply and the assignee will become liable for the price disclosed when it becomes due on settlement. If the price disclosed in the notification is less than the FTR acquisition cost, the assignor will be liable to pay the difference to the Clearing Manager. If the price disclosed in the notification is more than the FTR acquisition cost, the assignor will be entitled to be paid the difference by the Clearing Manager. Clause 13.249 of the Code relevantly provides: 13.249 Liability for FTR payments when FTR assigned and price disclosed (1) This clause applies if— (a) an FTR is assigned under clause 13.248; and (b) the notification of assignment discloses the price at which the FTR has been assigned. (2) The FTR manager must provide a copy of the notification of assignment to the clearing manager. (3) The assignee becomes liable for the price disclosed under subclause (1)(b) when it becomes due on settlement of the FTR. (4) If the price disclosed in the notification is less than the FTR payment in respect of the FTR that would, if the assignment had not taken place, become due on settlement of the FTR, the assignor becomes liable to pay to the clearing manager an amount equal to the difference between the FTR payment and the price at which the FTR has been assigned. ... (7) If the price disclosed in the notification is more than the FTR payment in respect of the FTR that would, if the assignment had not taken place, become due on settlement of the FTR, the assignor becomes entitled to be paid by the clearing manager on settlement of the FTR an amount equal to the difference between the FTR payment and the price at which the FTR has been assigned. 14 Loss and constraint excess 47. FTRs will be underpinned, and payments made by the Clearing Manager to Participants or FTR Holders under the FTRs will be funded, by FTR auction revenue and the “loss and constraint excess”. 48. The loss and constraint excess is, broadly, the difference between the aggregate amount the Clearing Manager receives from purchasers of electricity in a billing period (calendar month) and the aggregate amount the Clearing Manager pays to generators of electricity. 49. Historically the Clearing Manager allocated this loss and constraint excess to the owner of the national grid, which meant it was not available to fund an instrument to protect purchasers from the high price under the constraint or generators from the low price. With the introduction of FTRs, the Clearing Manager will retain part of the loss and constraint excess for each billing period and use it to settle FTRs for the corresponding billing period. 50. Under cl 14.73 of the Code, the FTR Manager is required to determine the amount of loss and constraint excess that the Clearing Manager must retain and pay to the FTR account on the 20th day of each month following a billing period. 51. Where the amount retained for a billing period is greater than the amount required to settle the relevant FTRs, the balance will be paid to the grid owner. 52. Where the total amount required to be paid to Participants or FTR Holders in respect of FTRs for a billing period exceeds the amount of all funds in the FTR account (which is managed by the Clearing Manager), payments under the FTRs will be prorated and Participants or FTR Holders will receive a scaled amount. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) Obligation FTRs are entered into on arm’s length terms. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The supply of an Obligation FTR is a supply of financial services under s 3(1)(k).  The supply of an Obligation FTR (being the provision of a financial service as defined in s 3(1)(k)) by the Clearing Manager to a Participant or FTR Holder who is not “resident” in New Zealand (as defined in s 2(1)) and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed is subject to GST at the rate of 0% under ss 11A(1)(k) and 14(1B)(a), provided that s 11A(2) does not apply.  An amount paid by the Clearing Manager to the Participant or FTR Holder in performance of the Clearing Manager's obligations in respect of an Obligation FTR is not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for a “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Participant or FTR Holder to the Clearing Manager. 15  An amount paid by the Participant or FTR Holder to the Clearing Manager in performance of the Participant's or FTR Holder's obligations in respect of an Obligation FTR is not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for a “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Clearing Manager to the Participant or FTR Holder.  An amount paid by a Participant to an FTR Holder, or by an FTR Holder to a Participant or FTR Holder (in the event that the FTR has previously been assigned) in consideration for the assignment of an Obligation FTR is not “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for a “taxable supply” (as defined in s 2(1)) made by the Participant or FTR Holder (as appropriate). The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 18 th October 2012 and ending on 18 th October 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 18 th day of October 2012. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)

Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, the Farmer Trustees, Fonterra and Public Investors may invest in the FSF. Together, they are referred to as the Unit Holders. Documents relevant to the Arrangement 3. The following documents are relevant to the Arrangement:  Unit Trust Deed (which establishes the FSF) (Unit Trust Deed);  Authorised Fund Contract, under which the FSF will be established as an “Authorised Fund” under Fonterra’s Constitution;  Trust Deed of the Fonterra Farmer Custodian Trust, which will hold all of the shares in the Custodian and the Fonterra Unit;  Custody Trust Deed of the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust, under which the Custodian will hold the legal title to Shares and the economic rights in Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee; and  Form B of Fonterra’s constitution (Form B Constitution), which will come into force if Trading Among Farmers is implemented. Background to the Arrangement 4. Fonterra is simultaneously registered as a co-operative dairy company under Part 3 of the Co-operative Companies Act 1996 and as a company under the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act). Many aspects of Fonterra's structure and operation are governed by the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001 (DIRA). 5. Supplying Shareholders must generally hold such number of Shares as is determined by the share standard (currently set in Fonterra’s constitution as being one share for each kilogram of milksolids obtainable from milk supplied by the farmer in that season, save that Shares cannot be issued to a farmer whose supply of milksolids is less than 1,000kg in a season). These Shares are informally known as “wet” shares, as they are backed by the supply of milk. In practice, Supplying Shareholders must indicate in advance how much milk they wish to supply in a coming season, and they must acquire or dispose of the appropriate number of Shares in order to back that supply (within certain margins). 3 6. In addition to their “wet” Shares, Supplying Shareholders may currently acquire further Shares (up to 20% of the number of shares that they are required to hold under the share standard). These Shares are informally known as "dry" Shares, as they are not backed by the supply of milk. Despite the informal distinction between wet Shares and dry Shares, all Shares of Fonterra belong to a single class of Shares. 7. Under s 98 of the DIRA, Fonterra must pay a surrender value for Shares when a notice of withdrawal is given by a Supplying Shareholder under s 97 of the DIRA. The ability for farmers to surrender their Shares has led to volatility in Fonterra's capital. For example, the surrender value for Shares withdrawn in 2008 was approximately $600 million as a result of droughts occurring in 2008, with production increasing to pre drought levels in 2009. Fonterra refers to this volatility as redemption risk. 8. To address this redemption risk, Fonterra has made, or is proposing to make, a number of changes to its capital structure in three stages. The proposal, referred to as Trading Among Farmers, includes: (i) enabling farmers to acquire up to 100% of the number of Shares that they are required to hold under the share standard as dry Shares. (ii) the establishment of a Fonterra shareholders’ fund that will enable public investment (ie the FSF). (iii) the creation of a “private market” for the trading of Shares between Supplying Shareholders, RVPs (whose Shares will be held in the name of the Custodian in trust for the RVP) and Fonterra (the Fonterra Shareholders’ Market (FSM)). Fonterra is involved in the FSM so that it can manage the size of the FSM by conducting buybacks of Shares. 9. The Trading Among Farmers proposal has required amendments to be made to the DIRA, to remove the requirement for Fonterra to accept the surrender of Shares on request. This amendment when it is brought into force, by Order-in-Council, will remove the redemption risk. 10. The current constitution of Fonterra is the Form A Constitution. The Form A Constitution sets out the framework for the Board of Fonterra to take steps to implement Trading Among Farmers, including the pre-conditions that must be satisfied and the implementation time period. If Trading Among Farmers is implemented, the Form B Constitution, which contains rules relating to the FSM, the FSF and RVPs, will apply. The Arrangement 11. Fonterra will establish, or procure the establishment of, the FSF – a passive investment vehicle through which a Public Investor can invest indirectly in Fonterra. The FSF will be established as a unit trust under the Unit Trusts Act 1960. 12. As t he FSF intends to have investors who are not resident in New Zealand, the FSF will elect to be a “foreign investment variable-rate PIE” (as defined in s YA 1) and will notify the Commissioner of that election. 4 13. The purpose of the FSF is to provide support to the FSM by acting as a conduit for Public Investors to access the underlying economic rights in a Share, thereby creating a more liquid market for Supplying Shareholders (and RVPs) to trade in Shares. This mechanism will allow Supplying Shareholders to sell economic rights in Shares to the FSF, as well as selling Shares on the FSM. It will also allow an RVP to move between the FSF and FSM to match supply and demand and possibly hedge its position. While Supplying Shareholders may invest in the FSF, it is anticipated that most of the Unit Holders will not be Supplying Shareholders. 14. Fonterra will initially appoint one RVP (although it retains the discretion to appoint further RVPs) to acquire and dispose of Shares (through the Custodian) on the FSM to facilitate trades and liquidity in that market. The principal duties of the RVPs are to ensure the smooth execution of transactions and improve liquidity through continuous quoting of both buy and sell orders with a contracted maximum spread between the buy and sell prices quoted. A key role of the RVPs will be to ensure that the spread between buy and sell prices is restricted to a narrow range. 15. Under the Form B Constitution, RVPs must hold, in aggregate, rights or interests in no more than 5% of the total Shares on issue at any time, excluding treasury stock (such Shares being held in the name of the Custodian in trust for the RVP). Fonterra and the RVPs will not enter into a risk sharing agreement, however where the RVP is suspended from selling economic rights in relation to Fonterra shares to the FSF, Fonterra will compensate the RVP for certain trading losses suffered by the RVP. 16. Like Supplying Shareholders, RVPs will also be able to participate in the FSF. This will promote price convergence between the FSM and the FSF. The Unit Trustee, the Manager and the Custodian 17. Fonterra will appoint the initial Unit Trustee as trustee of the FSF. The Unit Trustee holds a licence under the Securities Trustees and Statutory Supervisors Act 2011. 18. Fonterra will also appoint the initial Manager of the FSF. The Manager will initially be a company wholly owned by Trustees Executors Limited. Under the Unit Trusts Act 1960, the role of the Manager is to manage the investments of the FSF and issue Units to the public. The Manager will manage the FSF as an investment vehicle and will not undertake an active role (such as actively soliciting farmers to sell economic rights in their Shares). Fonterra will provide a licence (the Licence) to the Manager to use Fonterra’s name and brand for the purposes of the FSF. 19. The Unit Trustee and Manager will be party to an arrangement with Fonterra under which Fonterra will provide the FSF with funds (the Funding Arrangement) to cover the reasonable expenses incurred by the FSF, or the Manager, on behalf of the FSF (Operating Expenses). 20. The Custodian will be a limited liability company set up to hold legal title to Shares. The Custodian will hold legal title to any Shares in which economic rights have been sold to the FSF, and will hold the economic rights in Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee (under the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust). The Custodian will also hold legal title to any Shares acquired by the RVP, on trust for the RVP (under a separate trust from the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust). 21. 22. 23. 24. 25.

The operation of the FSF is described in the paragraphs below. 27. Supplying Shareholders, RVPs and Fonterra can transfer economic rights in Shares to the FSF. In this context, “economic rights in Shares” means the rights to receive dividends and other benefits derived from a Share, including any change in value of the Share, as well as the other rights and benefits comprised in the Share. It does not include any right to hold the legal title to a Share or a security convertible to a Share, or to exercise production-based voting rights. 28. The process for selling economic rights in Shares to the FSF will involve two steps: a) Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, and Fonterra will transfer legal title to a Share to the Custodian (legal title to the Share will not pass to the FSF). b) The Custodian will hold the economic rights in the Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee. 29. The economic rights in Shares will be the FSF’s only material asset. Under clause 7.5 of the Form B Constitution, the aggregate number of Shares in which the FSF may acquire economic rights is limited to 25 percent of the total number of Shares on issue (excluding treasury stock). 1 If this limit is exceeded the Board of Fonterra is obliged to take steps to bring the number of Shares placed with the FSF back within the limit within an appropriate timeframe (clause 7.6 of the Form B Constitution). 30. Units in the FSF will be issued by the Manager upon receipt of economic rights in a Share by the FSF. In addition, if Fonterra issues further Shares in respect of a Share held by the Custodian (in respect of which economic rights are being held in favour of the Unit Trustee), the FSF will issue a corresponding number of Units to its Unit Holders pursuant to clauses 15.1(d) and (e) of the Unit Trust Deed. This ensures that the number of Shares placed with the Custodian in which economic rights are being held in favour of the Unit Trustee will always equal the number of Units on issue. Clauses 15.1(a) and (b) of the Unit Trust Deed provide for the payment of cash dividends or other cash benefits to Unit Holders, mirroring payments on the Shares, as follows: (a) upon receipt of a cash dividend or other cash Benefits (other than a Supplementary Dividend) paid by Fonterra, this will be distributed to Unit Holders who were recorded in the Register at the same time and on the same record date as applied by Fonterra to determine the entitlement to the cash dividend or other cash Benefits. The amount to be paid or transferred to each such Unit Holder in respect of each Unit held by that Unit Holder as at that time, will be equal to the amount Fonterra paid or transferred per Share adjusted to take into account any Tax Liability of the Trust relating to the Unit Holder or any adjustments in accordance with s HM 48 of the Tax Act, and less any non-resident withholding tax deducted in respect of the Unit Holder in accordance with Subpart RF of the Tax Act pursuant to section HM 44B of the Tax Act and less any sum authorised in accordance with an 1 It is proposed that this threshold be reduced from 25% to 20%. 7 Extraordinary Resolution pursuant to paragraph 11.1(b)(viii) of Schedule 1; (b) upon receipt of any Supplementary Dividend paid by Fonterra, this will be distributed to the Unit Holders that entitled Fonterra to apply section LP 2 of the Tax Act and receive a tax credit for the Supplementary Dividend; 31. Each Supplying Shareholder or RVP who transfers Shares to the Custodian (in which economic rights have been sold to the FSF) will receive either one Unit in the FSF for each such economic right in a Share transferred or a cash sum (clause 5.1 of the Unit Trust Deed) in recognition of the transfer of the economic right in the Share to the FSF. Supplying Shareholders who sell economic rights in Shares to the FSF will also receive "vouchers" (subject to individual limits) that will count towards the share standard and support production-based voting rights and the right to full share backed milk price (clause 5.3 of the Unit Trust Deed). 32. Under the Unit Trust Deed, each Unit issued by the FSF will evidence the entitlement of the holder to the economic benefits (including distributions and other benefits) in the whole of the trust fund. As the number of Units issued by the FSF equals the number of Shares held by the Custodian (in which economic rights are being held in favour of the Trustee of the FSF), in effect each Unit will provide rights to receive the distributions and other benefits in respect of one Share. Individuals and their associates will be permitted to hold no more than 15% of the lesser of the total number of Units on issue or the total voting rights in the FSF under clause 6.1 of the Unit Trust Deed. 33. Clause 4.1(c) of the Unit Trust Deed sets out that the Units do not confer any interest in certain amounts under the Unit Trust Deed, as follows: (c) Unless the Manager directs otherwise, Units shall not confer any interest in interest income of the Trust or in monies paid to the Trustee or the Manager to meet their fees or to reimburse either of those parties for (or any advance payment in respect of) any expenses, liabilities, losses and costs incurred by them respectively in or about acting as Trustee or Manager (as the case may be) under this Deed. In all cases, all interest income and such monies will be applied by the Manager to meet the expenses, liabilities, losses and costs incurred by the Manager or the Trustee in or about acting as Manager or Trustee (as the case may be). 34. The FSF Units will trade on a registered market (ie, the NZSX) in which Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, Fonterra and other Public Investors may participate. Standard listing rules (but with various exemptions to those rules recognising that it is a unit trust and to accommodate other characteristics of the Trading Among Farmers proposal) will apply to the FSF. Fonterra and the FSF will co-operate with each other in relation to matters such as disclosure of information, to enable the FSF to comply with the listing rules applicable to the FSF. 35. Supplying Shareholders, RVPs and Fonterra will be able to exchange Units for Shares subject to various limits, but no other investor will be able to do this (clause 9 of the Unit Trust Deed). For example, if a Supplying Shareholder, Fonterra or an RVP wished to acquire a Share, it could do so by either buying a Share on the FSM, or by buying a Unit and presenting that Unit to the Unit Trustee for redemption and demanding that the Trustee procure the Custodian to transfer to it (or in the case of the RVP, to the Custodian to hold on trust for the RVP) one Share. 8 36. Under clauses 6.5 and 7.8 of the Form B Constitution and clause 15.2 of the Unit Trust Deed, neither the RVPs nor the FSF (or the Custodian in relation to either) is entitled to exercise any voting rights attached to Shares which are from time to time held for them by the Custodian (except on an interest group resolution where otherwise no shareholder can vote, clause 24.2(c) of the Form B Constitution). 37. Except as noted in para 35 above, no Unit Holder shall be entitled or permitted to require the transfer to that Unit Holder of any of the property of the FSF, or any Share. The Unit Trustee will covenant that it will not call for a transfer of the Shares (clause 4.8 of the Custody Trust Deed). In addition, no Unit Holder may redeem their Units for cash other than as described in clause 15.1(h) of the Unit Trust Deed. However, Unit Holders may sell their Units to other investors on the NZSX. 38. In addition to dividends, which are expected to be paid twice a year, other potential distributions in respect of the Shares include: (a) taxable and non-taxable bonus issues; (b) in-specie distributions of property; (c) share buy-backs; (d) dividend reinvestment schemes; (e) renounceable and non-renounceable rights issues; and (f) notional distributions. 39. The Farmer Trustees will hold one Unit in the FSF (the Fonterra Unit) which has special, essentially veto, rights (clauses 4.5 to 4.8 of the Unit Trust Deed). This will require the Farmer Trustees’ approval, for example, to an amendment, removal or alteration of a provision of the Unit Trust Deed where that amendment, removal or alteration would change: (a) the governance structure of the Board of the Manager; (b) the scope and role of the trust fund; (c) the obligation of the trust to facilitate the exchange of a Share for a Unit or a Unit for a Share; or (d) the limit of 15% on the number of Units that can be held by any person or their associated persons (other than Fonterra or a wholly owned subsidiary of Fonterra); or (e) the terms of the Fonterra Unit. 40. The rights of the Fonterra Unit to proceeds and distributions from the FSF will be the same as for all other Units (clause 4.5(h) of the Unit Trust Deed). 41. Section 16 of the Dairy Industry Restructuring Amendment Act 2012 inserts a new section 161A and 161B into the DIRA to allow Fonterra to hold Units in the FSF. Fonterra will maintain a unitholding in the FSF so that it can manage the size of the FSF. Fonterra’s unitholding may 9 increase or decrease depending on market activity, but it will always hold at least one Unit. In respect of Units held by Fonterra, the DIRA prevents Fonterra from exercising those voting rights carried by those Units (section 161A(i)). 42. The FSF may derive income other than from the Shares held by the Custodian on its behalf (Other Income) such as interest on cash held in a bank account. To the extent the Fund derives Other Income or there is assessable income from the Funding Arrangement, clause 4.1(c) of the Unit Trust Deed provides that no Unit Holder has an interest in such other income, unless the Manager directs otherwise. Any Other Income which is available to the FSF will be paid to the Unit Trustee as part of the fees due to the Unit Trustee. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The requirements of subs HM 55D(5), (6) and (7) and ss HM 55E and HM 55F are met. b) The FSF is not treated under any double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. c) The FSF does not carry on the business of life insurance. d) 90% or more of the FSF’s investments (by value of its assets) are investments of a type referred to in s HM 11, other than an interest in land in New Zealand or a right or option in relation to land in New Zealand, in accordance with s HM 19C(1). e) 90% or more of the income derived by the FSF is of a type referred to in s HM 12, other than an amount derived from an interest in land in New Zealand or the disposal of an interest in land in New Zealand, in accordance with s HM 19C(2). f) The FSF does not calculate its income tax liability using the provisional tax calculation option in s HM 44. g) The FSF has not lost its PIE status through the application of ss HM 25, HM 27 and/or HM 29. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Following its establishment, the FSF will qualify as a “foreign investment variable-rate PIE” (as defined in s YA 1). b) The FSF’s interest in the Shares is an investment of a type referred to in s HM 11. c) Income derived by the FSF from its interest in the Shares is income of a type referred to in s HM 12. 10 d) Income attributed by the FSF to its investors will be “excluded income” (as defined in s BD 1(3)) of the investor under s CX 56(3) provided that: o The requirements in ss CX 56(1) and/or CX 56(1B) are met; and o The amount is not an amount of attributed PIE income that is derived by a trustee who has chosen a prescribed investor rate referred to in sch 6, table 1, row 5 or 7, as applicable; and o The investor is not a person to whom s HM 57B would have applied but who has chosen not to apply that section to determine their prescribed investor rate for a “resident year” (as defined in s HM 57B(3)). e) Where a Share is transferred to a Unit Holder on redemption of their Unit, that Unit Holder will be treated as acquiring that share for its market value to the FSF on the date of transfer under s FC 2. f) Any redemption proceeds a Unit Holder receives as a result of the FSF redeeming a Unit (including a distribution of a Share) that are income, will be excluded income of the Unit Holder under s CX 56B. g) Any distributions from the FSF will be excluded income of each Unit Holder under s CX 56B (and therefore not taxable), other than where the FSF elects to pay non-resident withholding tax in accordance with s HM 44B in respect of the distribution. h) The Arrangement is not subject to s BG 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 25 October 2012 and ending on 30 November 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of October 2012. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)
1 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 12/09 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Electricity Authority. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s EW 25B. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue of option or obligation financial transmission rights (FTRs) by the Clearing Manager to participants. The FTRs are hedge products that allow an electricity trader to manage locational price risk that arises from variations in the wholesale spot prices between two points (e.g. Benmore and Otahuhu) on the wholesale electricity grid. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background All references to the Electricity Industry Participation Code 2010 (Code) are to the Code as at the date of this Ruling. 1. Electricity generators compete in the electricity spot market to generate the electricity necessary to satisfy demand. The generators submit offers through a Wholesale Information and Trading System Manager (a contestable service, currently provided by the New Zealand Stock Exchange). The System Operator (Energy Market Services, a division of Transpower New Zealand Ltd) uses a scheduling, pricing and dispatch system to rank these offers, from which the half-hourly spot prices are derived for around 285 grid nodes. Retailers and some customers then buy electricity directly from the spot market at one of the grid exit points. 2. The amount paid for electricity by retailers and customers in the wholesale market always exceeds the payments made to the generators, due to losses and constraints in the system. The Clearing Manager accrues these surplus funds (referred to as the “loss and constraint excess”) and allocates them to grid owners who in turn allocate them to transmission customers through a transmission pricing methodology. This allocation of surplus funds occurs on a monthly basis. “Locational price risk” 3. Electricity generators may sell electricity to the market at the location where they generate electricity. Electricity retailers buy electricity on the wholesale market at points of connection on the grid where their customers are located. As most generators are also retailers, they sell electricity to the wholesale market at different locations from where they buy it. 2 4. Locational price risk arises in the electricity market from the unpredictable movements in the price for electricity at different grid nodes throughout New Zealand. Wholesale market prices are volatile and can rise quickly and sharply if certain events occur, such as when transmission cables or power stations are taken out of service (either for faults or maintenance). 5. The main source of locational price risk currently occurs between the North and South Islands (across the high voltage direct current link, which is the inter-island transmission link between Haywards near Wellington and Benmore). There can be large and volatile differences in wholesale market prices between the North and South Islands. Locational price risk can also occur between locations within each island. 6. An example of locational price risk occurs during dry winters, when low rainfall constrains electricity generation from hydro dams, most of which are located in the South Island. This means that large volumes of electricity have to be “imported” from the North Island, causing wholesale market prices in the South Island to rise above North Island prices. 7. Currently, generator-retailers minimise their locational price risk by seeking retail customers in regions close to where they have their generation assets. Retailers can arrange hedge contracts with generators or other market participants. However, they are still likely to be exposed to some locational price risk. Retailers could also seek an electricity contract for difference (CFD) with another party. However, they may continue to be exposed to locational price risk if the other party was subject to weak competitive pressure and could influence the price and undermine the benefit of the CFD. There may also be insufficient counterparties available because local generation in a region often accounts for only a portion of the load served – the rest is served from power imported over the transmission network. Financial transmission rights 8. The Electricity Authority is required to address locational price risk under s 42 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010. In light of this, the Electricity Authority approved an amendment to the Code to introduce FTRs. 9. FTRs are a form of hedge product that allows an electricity trader to manage locational price risk arising from variations in wholesale spot prices between price points on the national grid. Initially, this will cover inter-island locational price risk between the Otahuhu and Benmore grid reference points. It is anticipated that this may be extended to include intra-island locational price risk. 10. The FTR market will consist of two types of FTRs:  Option FTRs will provide a payout only when the receiving end price exceeds the sending end price.  Obligation FTRs will provide a payout when the price at the receiving end of the FTR exceeds the sending end price, and will also require a payment to be made to the Clearing Manager when the opposite occurs. 11. Option FTRs will require a premium to be payable on entry into the FTR. This premium is to be determined by auction. However, the premium is not paid at the time of entry, but is to be settled at maturity. Option FTRs will 3 provide the participant with a cap on the FTR reference price. The FTR reference price is the sum of certain differences in final prices for electricity between the relevant hubs over the relevant contract period. For example, assuming that the relevant hubs are the nodes at Benmore (sending end) and Otahuhu (receiving end):  If the final price at both Benmore and Otahuhu is $60 per megawatt hour (MWh), then the FTR reference price will be zero.  If the final price at Benmore is $40/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $100/MWh for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be $60/MWh multiplied by the number of trading periods in the contract period.  If the final price at Benmore is $100/MWh and the final price at Otahuhu is $40/MWh for every trading period in the contract period, then the FTR reference price will be zero (as the differences in final prices are all negative $60/MWh). 12. An obligation FTR has a two-way obligation to pay the difference between the FTR reference price and the initial price (or the price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code if the FTR has been assigned) on settlement day. For an obligation FTR, the FTR reference price is the sum of all differences in final prices for electricity between the relevant hubs over the relevant contract period. Participants do not pay a premium for an obligation FTR. The initial price for the obligation FTR is determined at auction. Under the obligation FTR, if the FTR reference price exceeds the initial price (or the price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code), the participant will receive the difference between the FTR reference price and the initial price (or the price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b)). However, if the initial price (or the price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code ), exceeds the FTR reference price, the participant must pay the difference. 13. The FTRs will be centrally funded from amounts accruing within the wholesale electricity market (loss and constraint excess) and auction premiums. FTRs will allow participants to manage their inter-island locational price risk, including that which arises from losses and constraints within the system. Ownership of an obligation FTR or option FTR does not entitle the participant to any rights for physical delivery of electricity. 14. Payments made under the FTRs to participants may be scaled in the event that there are insufficient funds. This may occur if events create a substantial difference between the notional grid used to determine the volume of FTRs issued, and the actual grid available in real time. 15. The key features of an FTR include:  Each FTR will have a calendar month duration and will be available in multiples of 0.1MW with a minimum quantity of 0.1MW.  FTRs will be available through monthly auctions at least 12 months in advance by the end of year 1; and at least 24 months in advance by the end of year 3.  Any premium payable on entry into an option FTR by market participants will be settled when the FTR matures. 4  On assignment, specific rules apply to impose an obligation on the assignee when the FTR matures. These rules may also impose an obligation on the assignor at the time of assignment or the Clearing Manager at the time the FTR matures.  Payments to FTR holders will be funded by the loss and constraint excess as well as from FTR auction proceeds. It is intended that FTR payouts will reflect the full price difference between the Otahuhu and Benmore grid reference points. However, where revenue adequacy is not achieved, scaling of the FTR payout will occur.  Any residual loss and constraint excess in the FTR account (that is, an amount remaining in the FTR account that relates to the relevant billing period and is not required to settle FTRs for that billing period) will be treated as loss and constraint excess, and will be paid to the grid owner for allocation to its transmission customers (as is the current position).  A participant wishing to bid or trade FTRs will be required to post security. A participant may also be required to provide further security. The Applicant 16. The Electricity Authority is an independent Crown entity responsible for the operation and regulation of the New Zealand electricity market. The Electricity Authority must pursue the statutory objective set out in the Electricity Industry Act 2010 to promote competition in, reliable supply by, and the efficient operation of, the electricity industry for the long-term benefit of consumers. The participants 17. This Ruling only applies to participants who prepare accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 18. The participants will include (but are not limited to) electricity generators and retailers. The parties who may apply to be an FTR participant are those who meet the following criteria:  Parties who meet the prudential requirements in relation to FTRs set out in Part 14 of the Code.  Parties who are within the category of persons to whom the FTR manager is authorised to issue FTRs. These are natural persons or a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand and is within one of the categories of “approved participant” in the Authorised Futures Dealers (Financial Transmission Rights) Notice 2012.  Parties who are registered by the Electricity Authority as an Industry Participant under s 9 of the Electricity Industry Act 2010 as a trader in electricity, and  Parties who agree to the standard FTR participation agreement. 19. The A uthorised Futures Dealers (Financial Transmission Rights) Notice 2012 defines an “approved participant” as follows: 5 (a) A person whose principal business is purchasing or selling electricity; or (b) A person who uses in excess of 10 GWh per annum of electricity; or (c) Her Majesty The Queen in right of New Zealand, a Crown entity named in the Crown Entities Act 2004, or a State enterprise named in the First or Second Schedule to the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986 (each as amended from time to time); or (d) A member of the trade association known as the Major Electricity Users Group; or (e) A registered bank as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989; or (f) A person whose principal business is the investment of money or who, in the course of and for the purposes of their business, habitually invests money; or (g) A person who is authorised to carry on the business of dealing in futures contracts under the Act; or (h) A person authorised in another jurisdiction by the competent authority of that jurisdiction to deal in futures contracts; or (i) A person that is a related body corporate of any of the persons listed in (a) to (h) above. 20. The participants may also be a party to ASX New Zealand electricity futures or options, electricity CFDs or other types of forward contract or other derivative instrument (Other Derivative Instruments). The FTR Auction process 21. FTRs will be allocated to Participants by way of a monthly auction conducted by the FTR Manager. 22. The FTR Allocation Plan provides for a single-stage, sealed bid uniform price auction approach. This requires all bidders to submit bids for simultaneous assessment allowing optimisation of the allocation of FTRs amongst all the products on offer. All bidders will pay the FTR Auction Clearing Price (based on the lowest cleared bid) required to fill the allocation of FTRs across all FTR products for that FTR period. 23. The current proposal is for two sealed-bid auctions per month. The Primary Auction is where previously unlisted FTR periods are auctioned. For the primary auction, a proportion of FTR capacity will be offered. The Variation Auction is where additional FTRs for any of the previously listed FTR periods might be added. 24. The volume of FTRs to be issued will be based on the expected grid capacity at the time of auction or up to two years in advance. The actual grid capacity (in real time) might differ from the expected grid. To manage this, it is proposed that only a portion of the assessed FTR capacity will be issued in the Primary Auction, with subsequent Variation Auctions offering the majority of the remaining capacity. 25. It is also proposed that there will be Reconfiguration Auctions where FTRs may be sold back into Variation Auctions, facilitating secondary trading of FTRs. However, these may not be available from the outset and may require a Code amendment. 6 Assignments 26. Specific rules apply where FTRs are assigned from one party to another. The rules are outlined in clauses 13.248, 13.249 and 13.250 of the Code. 27. If the notification of assignment discloses the price at which the FTR has been assigned, the assignee becomes liable to pay that price to the Clearing Manager. Where the assignment price is less than the premium (for an option FTR) or the initial price (for an obligation FTR) or the previous price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code if the FTR has previously been assigned, the assignor must pay the difference to the Clearing Manager at the time of assignment. If the assignment price is greater than the premium, initial price or the previous price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code, the assignor is entitled to be paid the difference by the Clearing Manager when the FTR matures. 28. If the notification does not disclose the price at which the FTR has been assigned, the assignee is liable to pay the premium (for an option FTR) or the initial price (for an obligation FTR) or the previous price disclosed under clause 13.249(1)(b) of the Code (if the FTR has previously been assigned) to the Clearing Manager when the FTR matures. 29. It is expected that on-market secondary trading will eventually be permitted in FTRs. This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) At all times, each participant will use the same spreading method for all FTRs held by them, unless a different accounting treatment under IFRSs is used. b) During the period for which the Ruling applies, clause 2 of the FTR Allocation Plan will not be materially altered or amended from the FTR Allocation Plan approved on 29 June 2012 and provided to Inland Revenue on 12 October 2012. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: a) The FTRs are not the “same as, or similar to” Other Derivative Instruments in terms of s EW 25B(1)(b). Therefore, s EW 25B will not require participants to use the same spreading method for FTRs as used for Other Derivative Instruments. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2013 and ending on 31 March 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of December 2012.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the:  University of Canterbury (University); and  University of Canterbury Foundation (Foundation) Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of:  ss BG 1, CA 1(2), CC 3, CC 4, DB 41, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1 and LD 1, and the definition of “interest” in s YA 1;  s 73 and the definition of “gift” in s 2 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the raising of funds by the University for its capital works programme for the advancement of education and excellence at the University. The University has issued philanthropic bonds to the public, with university alumni being a focus of the offer. The parties to the Arrangement are:  the University, a tertiary education institution and registered charitable institution, as issuer;  the Foundation, a registered charitable trust, as promoter;  the Philanthropic Bond Trust (the Trust), a special purpose sub-trust fund the Foundation established to hold gifts of bond principal for special charitable purposes, being the capital works programme;  bondholders. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. The University offered up to $50 million fixed rate unsubordinated unsecured bonds (the Bonds) (with the provision for a further $50 million for oversubscriptions). The Bonds are fully subscribed. Bonds are listed on the New Zealand Debt Market. 2. The Bonds are conventional bonds, in that the University will pay interest at a fixed rate and will be required to repay the principal after a fixed term. However, the Bonds also have novel features designed to encourage bondholders to make philanthropic gifts to the University. In particular:  Bondholders are invited to agree to receive bond interest at a rate of 0% per year for one or more interest periods (a Bond Interest Adjustment).  Bondholders are invited to request repayment of the Bond principal amount at any time during the term of a Bond for the sole purpose of making a cash donation to the Foundation (a Bond Principal Donation).  Bondholders are invited to agree to bequeath their Bonds to the Foundation in their will. 3. The material terms of the Arrangement are governed by the:  University of Canterbury Foundation Trust Deed dated 17 September 2001;  Registered Prospectus dated 5 October 2009;  Investment Statement dated 5 October 2009;  Trust Deed for the Issue of Bonds dated 5 October 2009 (Trust Deed);  Amended Trust Deed for the Issue of Bonds dated 29 November 2012 (Amended Trust Deed);  Memorandum of Understanding In Relation to Issue of Philanthropic Bonds and Supplemental Deed to Foundation Trust Deed dated 5 October 2009 (Memorandum of Understanding);  First Amended Memorandum of Understanding In Relation to Issue of Philanthropic Bonds and Supplemental Deed to Foundation Trust Deed dated 18 October 2012 (Amended Memorandum of Understanding). University of Canterbury 4. The University is a tertiary education institution established under the Education Act 1989 and University of Canterbury Act 1961. The University is also a charity, because its purposes relate to the advancement of education for the benefit of the general public. The University is registered as a charity with the Charities Commission in accordance with the Charities Act 2005. 5. The University’s purposes are set out in the Education Act 1989. In particular:  the powers of the University’s council can be exercised only to advance its charitable purposes (s 181 of the Education Act 1989 - Duties of Councils);  if the University is disestablished, its assets vest in the Minister of Education (s 217 of the Education Act 1989 - Effect of Disestablishment). University of Canterbury Foundation and Philanthropic Bond Trust 6. The Foundation is a charitable trust established in 2001 to raise capital for the advancement of education at the University. The Foundation is registered as a board under the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 and registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. The Foundation creates opportunities for supporters of the University and, in particular, alumni, to make gifts for the benefit of advancing education and excellence at the University. The Foundation also enables those gifted funds to be kept separate from the University’s general operating budget. The Foundation’s mission statement is: To support the University in its quest for excellence and international reputation in education and research by creating mutual benefit partnerships and opportunities for giving 7. The Memorandum of Understanding between the University and the Foundation established the Trust fund for the benefit of the University. The Trust is a special purpose sub-trust of the Foundation. This sub-trust has its own trustees and is a separate trust fund, but the Registered Prospectus makes it clear that the Trust is and remains part of the Foundation. 8. The Trust will hold donated bond principal amounts and the asset and cash proceeds arising from repayment of the bond principal by the University. The establishment of the Trust ensures the benefits resulting from Bond Principal Donations can be separately identified (from the other funds of the Foundation) and used for certain special purposes stated in the Memorandum of Understanding. Those special purposes, as the trustees decide, are the advancing and promoting of the capital works programme, namely for the construction, acquisition and provision of buildings, plant, equipment, libraries, texts, learning and research tools and capital facilities for the University. These special purposes are charitable because they are for the advancement of education. 9. Clause 6.4 of the Memorandum of Understanding prohibits the trustees of the Trust from paying any part of the Bond Principal Donations to the University for unrestricted application to the general purposes of the University. Accordingly, the Trust funds are to be applied exclusively for charitable purposes. If, for some reason, the Trust funds cannot be applied to the special purposes, they must still be used in accordance with the objects of the Foundation. 10. The Foundation’s objects are exclusively charitable, and limited to New Zealand (cls 4 and 5 of the Trust Deed of the University of Canterbury Foundation). Clauses 10 and 11 of the Foundation’s trust deed also prohibit any individual from benefiting or profiting from the trust or trust fund and require that trust funds be applied only to charitable purposes if the Foundation is wound up or dissolved. Further, the Foundation’s rules cannot be amended if it would cause the board to be declared non-charitable (cl 10 of Schedule 2 of the Foundation’s trust deed). Bonds 11. The University is the issuer of the Bonds. The Bonds are 10-year fixed rate, unsubordinated, unsecured bonds. The offer period for subscribing for the bonds was from 9 October 2009 to 30 November 2009. Over this period, bondholders subscribed for 50,010,000 Bonds at an issue price of $1 per bond. A total of $50,010,000 was raised. 12. The Bonds were issued on 7 December 2009 pursuant to the Trust Deed, and currently pay a coupon of 7.25% per year fixed for five years. The coupon payable on the Bonds is reset after five years at 1.75% above the then-prevailing five-year swap rate. Interest is paid six monthly in arrears on each interest payment date (being 15 June and 15 December of each year). The first interest payment date is 15 June 2010. The Bonds mature on 15 December 2019. 13. The Bonds have been amended in accordance with the Amended Trust Deed and the Amended Memorandum of Understanding. Bond Interest Adjustment 14. Under the terms of the Bond, a bondholder may give notice to the Bond registrar that they agree to a Bond Interest Adjustment. As a result of the bondholder giving notice, the interest rate payable by the University to the bondholder is agreed to be 0% per annum, effective from the first day of the interest period (provided notice of the agreement is received on or before the record date for the interest period). 15. The Bond Interest Adjustment continues until the bondholder withdraws agreement or the Bond is transferred. Bond Interest Adjustments must be made in minimum parcels of 1,000 Bonds and in multiples of 1,000. By making a Bond Interest Adjustment, a bondholder is effectively donating the foregone interest to the University. Bond Principal Donation 16. Under the terms of the Bond, a bondholder may give notice to the registrar that they wish to make a Bond Principal Donation. 17. To enable bond principal only to be gifted, the Bonds allow for early repayment of the bond principal for the sole purpose of making a cash donation to the Foundation. Despite the repayment and gifting of the principal, the bondholder maintains their right to interest. The Trust Deed provides that on the bond donation date the:  University will repay the bond principal (or may pay the bond principal directly to the Foundation on behalf of the bondholder);  bond registrar will record in the register that the bond principal amount has been repaid and that the bondholder continues to be entitled to receive interest on the Bonds up until, but excluding, the maturity date; and  terms and conditions of the Bonds otherwise remain unchanged. 18. The bondholder may specify a bond donation date, being any date between the date that is 15 business days after the registrar’s receipt of the bond donation notice and the bond’s maturity date. However, if during any rolling 12-month period the University receives bond donation requests totaling more than $2 million (or such other amount as is notified by the University from time to time), the University may at its discretion defer any excess requests for a period of 12 months and 10 working days, and that deferred date will become the bond donation date. 19. Gifting of the principal when there is continuing liability for the University to pay interest, will be available exclusively for gifts to the Foundation. Bond Principal Donations must be made in minimum parcels of 1,000 Bonds and in multiples of 1,000. Donation of Bond on Death 20. Bondholders may contract with the University to bequeath (by their will) their Bonds to the Foundation on the event of their death. Bondholders exercise this option by completing the appropriate form. 21. The form will constitute a contract for valuable consideration between the bondholder and the University that is enforceable by the Foundation. Under the contract, the bondholder agrees to bequeath their Bonds to the Foundation in the bondholder’s will. This election may be revoked in writing to the University at any time before the bondholder’s death. On the death of the bondholder, the Bond will be registered in the name of the Foundation and the interest rate will be adjusted to nil. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  Bondholders who make a Bond Interest Adjustment: (i) will not derive, by reason of that Bond Interest Adjustment, any “interest” income as defined in s YA 1, income arising under the financial arrangement rules, or income under ordinary concepts in respect of those interest periods under ss CA 1(2), CC 3 and CC 4; (ii) will not be entitled to a refundable tax credit under s LD 1 or a deduction under s DB 41 in any income year; and (iii) will be exempt from gift duty under s 73 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968, if by reason of that Bond Interest Adjustment there is a “gift” as defined by s 2 of that Act.  Bondholders who make a Bond Principal Donation: (i) will not derive any income or expenditure under the financial arrangement rules under ss EW 15 and EW 31 from the bond principal being repaid for the purpose of making a cash donation to the Foundation, provided the relevant Bonds were acquired for an amount equal to their issue price; (ii) will be entitled to a refundable tax credit under s LD 1 in the income year in which the Bond Principal Donation date falls for the full cash amount of bond principal being repaid and donated, provided they are not an excluded person under s LD 2 and provided the requirements of s 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 are met; (iii) will be entitled to a deduction under s DB 41 in the income year in which the Bond Principal Donation date falls, for the cash amount of the bond principal being repaid and donated, if the bondholder is a company, subject to the limitation on the amount of the deduction to the company’s net income for the income year in s DB 41(3) and subject to the application of any general limitation in s DA 2; and (iv) will be exempt from gift duty under s 73 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 on any gift made as a result of donating the bond principal repaid.  Bondholders may contract with the University to bequeath their Bonds to the Foundation in their will. The act of entering into that contract: (i) will not generate taxable income in the hands of the bondholder under s CA 1; and (ii) will not give rise to a dutiable gift under s 63 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968.  Sections BG 1 and GA 1 of the Act do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 7 December 2009 and ending on 31 December 2014. This Ruling is signed by me on the 8 th day of April 2013. Fiona Heiford Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/03 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Reach Media New Zealand Limited (“Reach Media”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of:  the definitions of “extra pay”, “income from employment”, “PAYE rules”, “salary or wages” and “schedular payment” in the Act;  section DA 2(4) of the Act; and  section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (“Distributors”) by Reach Media to physically deliver unaddressed mail (newspapers, circulars, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items) from drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Parties to the Arrangement are: (a) Reach Media: a New Zealand incorporated company that is currently owned equally by New Zealand Post Limited and Salmat International Pty Limited, and which carries on the business of delivering unaddressed mail to New Zealand households. (b) Distributors: persons who physically deliver the unaddressed mail from the drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. 2. Although not technically parties to the Arrangement, Reach Media also contracts with: (a) Supervisors: persons who are or are to be contracted by Reach Media to provide certain supervisory services in metropolitan or rural areas in relation to the delivery of unaddressed mail. (b) Drivers: persons who use their own vehicles to transport the unaddressed mail from Reach Media’s premises to a series of pre- determined drop-off locations. 2 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED 3. The Distributors will not be carrying any item which requires Reach Media to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998, and Reach Media will not register as such. 4. Reach Media is currently run by a management team based in Auckland with processing branches throughout the country. Unaddressed mail is delivered by a network of Distributors, Drivers and Supervisors. 5. Reach Media’s processes and systems are aligned with industry practice. The industry uses a delivery model of supervisors who co-ordinate the activities of a team of distributors. The Drivers, Distributors and Supervisors are paid on a “piece rate” basis under contracts for services (i.e. as independent contractors). 6. The Distributors are engaged under a standard form contract – Contract for Services – Distribution Contractor, to physically deliver unaddressed Mail from the drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand (“the Contract”). 7. There are two versions of the Contract. Most of the Distributors are currently engaged under the earlier version – ("Version 1 Contract"). Reach Media is in the process of introducing the later version – ("Version 2 Contract") for newly-engaged Distributors. 8. There is no material difference between the two versions of the Contract. The changes reflected in the Version 2 Contract were made to improve the simplicity and readability of the Contract, and to shift non-material content to an online Operational Manual which the Distributors are instructed to also consult. There is therefore no material difference between the Version 2 Contract and the Version 1 Contract on which the previous Product ruling – BR Prd 09/05 is based. 9. Specific procedural details referred to in both versions of the Contract are also provided in specific Delivery Instructions given to the Distributors before each Job (“the Delivery Instructions”). 10. The key changes reflected in the Version 2 Contract are: • the inclusion of reference to the Operational Manual; • the removal of the Delivery Guidelines from Schedule 2 of the Version 1 Contract to the first part of Section 1 of the Operational Manual; • the removal of the list of important things that Distributors should do and should not do when carrying out their obligations under the Contract from Schedule 3 of the Version 1 Contract to the second part of Section 1 of the Manual; • the removal of the competition section from the body of the Contract and transferring it to section 2 of the Operational Manual; • some alteration to the way piece rates are calculated in schedule 2 of the Version 2 Contract; 3 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED • the removal of Schedule 4 (the dispute resolution flowchart) and Schedule 5 (the geographic map). 11. The Operational Manual does not replace or override any of the material terms of the Contract, and it does not affect the nature of the contractual relationship between Reach Media and the Distributors. 12. The terms of the Contract under various headings are as follows. 13. Under the heading “Deliveries”, the Contract states the Distributor agrees to:  deliver all product (papers/circulars) received by the Distributor from Reach Media to the letter boxes in the Distributor's Round within the timeframes (“the “Delivery Window”) communicated by Reach Media on the Delivery Instructions (exactly when each Distributor completes the deliveries within the delivery window is at the Distributor's discretion).  make all deliveries in accordance with the delivery Guidelines in Schedule 2 (which may be amended by Reach Media from time to time) (Version 1 Contract).  make all deliveries in accordance with the delivery Guidelines in the Manual (which may be amended by Reach Media from time to time) (Version 2 Contract).  ensure other commitments do not affect the Distributor's obligations to Reach Media.  comply with tax and health and safety legislation (version 1 contract)  familiarise himself or herself with, and fully comply with, the Operational Manual (and any amendments) and any applicable legislation including that related to Tax and Health and Safety (Version 2 Contract). 14. Under the heading “Payment” the fees are the only amounts payable in respect of the services and are inclusive of all taxes (except GST) and other duties and levies. Each Distributor’s fee for undertaking the services for Reach Media is calculated under Schedule 2 at a rate determined by the volume of deliveries. Under version 2 of the Contract, Payment is made by direct credit fortnightly and on a Thursday. Under version 1 Contract payment is made on the 2 nd and 7 th of each month. Reach Media will provide a buyer created invoice to Distributors within 7 days of payment. The implication of these provisions is that Reachmedia will provide an invoice to Distributors (which takes the form of a buyer created tax invoice for GST- registered Distributors or a similar invoice for Distributors who are not GST- registered) prior to payment, with payment made on a fortnightly basis. 15. Schedule 1 of the Contract requires Distributors to provide their personal, bank and Inland Revenue details. 16. Under the heading “Delivery Equipment”, the Contract states that the Distributors are responsible for providing their own equipment (such as 4 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED personal office supplies, a telephone, a vehicle and wet weather gear) at their own expense. The Distributors are also responsible for ensuring that such equipment is well maintained, safe and fit for its purpose. 17. Under the heading “Taxation”, the Contract specifies that the Distributors are responsible for the payment of their own taxes, duties and levies (including income tax, GST and Accident Compensation levies if applicable), and any other income related payments or deductions that may be legislated from time to time. The Distributors will register for GST with Inland Revenue if required to do so, and will advise Reach Media that they are GST registered. Reach Media will then provide them with a buyer created tax invoice and they must not send a GST tax invoice to Reach Media. 18. Under the heading “Termination of Contract”, the Contract states that Reach Media or the Distributors may terminate the contract for any reasons whatsoever by giving two weeks’ notice in writing. However, if Reach Media believes there has been a serious breach of the Contract, then Reach Media may terminate the Contract immediately without notice. Under the Version 2 Contract Reach Media may also terminate the Contract for serious breach of the Manual (and any amendments). 19. Under the heading “Status of Contractor”, the Contract defines the contractor’s status as follows:  Reach Media engages each Distributor under a contract for services, so the Distributor is an independent contractor; the terms of the Contract or its operation do not create an employment relationship between the Distributor and Reach Media. (These statements in the Contract are referred to in the Ruling as the “Clarification Statements”. They are not considered to be material for the purposes of the conditions that the ruling is subject to).  The Distributor may accept other engagements or work while engaged by Reach Media unless there is a conflict of interest. 20. Under the heading “Liability”,  The Version 1 Contract states that the Distributor is to undertake the services at their own risk. This means Reach Media will not be liable to the Distributor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Distributor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of this contract.  The Version 2 Contract states that the Distributor is to undertake the services at their own risk. This means Reach Media will not be liable to the Distributor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Distributor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of this contract or the Manual (and any amendments). 21. Under the heading “Delivery Options”, the Contracts state that the Distributor is responsible for arranging for someone else to carry out the Distributor’s services if the Distributor is unable to work. The Distributor is solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who help them in this way. 5 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED 22. Under the heading “Frequency of Deliveries”, the Contract states that Reach Media does not guarantee any minimum amount of Deliveries as the volume of product available for distribution will vary depending on the time of year and the requirements of Reach Media’s clients. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The terms of the Contract entered into between Reach Media and the Distributors are the same as those contained in the Version 1 Contract and Version 2 Contract provided to the Inland Revenue Department in the Ruling Application dated 26 November 2012, except in relation to immaterial details such as fees, rates, frequency of invoices, defined areas, names and addresses that are contained in the Online Operational Manual or specific Delivery instructions; and b) The relationship between Reach Media and any of the Distributors is, and during the period of this Ruling will apply, in accordance with all of the material terms of the Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, the Clarification Statements are not considered to be material for the purposes of these conditions. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any of the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Distributor by Reach Media under the Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” or a “schedular payment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in sections s RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8 respectively of the Act. b) For the purpose of section DA 2(4), any payment made to a Distributor by Reach Media under the Contract will not be “income from employment”. c) For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Distributor under the Contract will not be excluded from the definition of "taxable activity" (as defined in section 6 of that Act) by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2012 and ending on 30 June 2016.

CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Reach Media New Zealand Limited (“Reach Media”). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (“the Act”) unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of:  the definitions of “extra pay”, “income from employment”, “PAYE rules”, “salary or wages” and “schedular payment” in the Act;  section DA 2(4) of the Act; and  section 6(3)(b) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (“the GST Act”). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the engagement of persons (“Supervisors”), by Reach Media to provide certain supervisory services in metropolitan and rural areas in relation to the delivery of newspapers, circulars, leaflets, brochures, catalogues, advertising material, samples and other such items. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Parties to the Arrangement are: (a) Reach Media: a New Zealand incorporated company that is currently owned equally by New Zealand Post Limited and Salmat International Pty Limited, and which carries on the business of delivering unaddressed mail to New Zealand households. (b) Supervisors: persons who are or are to be contracted by Reach Media to provide certain supervisory services in metropolitan or rural areas in relation to the delivery of unaddressed mail. 2. Although not technically parties to the Arrangement, Reach Media also contracts with: (a) Distributors: persons who physically deliver the unaddressed mail from the drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. (b) Drivers: persons who use their own vehicles to transport the unaddressed mail from Reach Media’s premises to a series of pre- determined drop-off locations. 2 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED 3. The items deliveries that are supervised by the Supervisors are not items the carriage of which requires Reach Media to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998, and Reach Media will not register as such. 4. Reach Media is currently run by a management team based in Auckland with processing branches throughout the country. Unaddressed mail is delivered by a network of Distributors, Drivers and Supervisors. 5. Reach Media’s processes and systems are aligned with industry practice. The industry uses a delivery model of supervisors who co-ordinate the activities of a team of distributors. The Drivers, Distributors and Supervisors are paid on a “piece rate” basis under contracts for services (i.e. as independent contractors). 6. The Supervisors are engaged under a standard form contract – Contract for Services to Supervise Delivery of Papers and Circulars (in metro or rural areas), or Contract for Services to Supervise Delivery of Unaddressed Mail (“the Contract”). 7. There are two versions of the Contract. Most of the Supervisors are currently engaged under the earlier version – Contract for Services to Supervise Delivery of Papers and Circulars - Metro, or Contract for Services to Supervise Delivery of Papers and Circulars – Country (“Version 1 Contracts”). Reach Media is in the process of introducing the later version – Contract for Services to Supervise Delivery of Unaddressed Mail (“Version 2 Contract) for newly-engaged Supervisors. 8. The two contracts in the Version 1 Contracts are virtually identical. The only difference is that the services to be provided by a rural Supervisor under Schedule 1 include (under the heading “Processing Stock”), the preparation and distribution of unaddressed mail to Distributors operating under the rural Supervisor. Schedule 1 for metro supervisors does not include this service. This difference is reflected in Schedule 1 of the Version 2 Contract where the Processing Stock service is to be deleted for metro supervisors. The Version 2 Contract is in essence a single contract for both metro and rural Supervisors. There is no material difference between the two versions of the Contract. The changes reflected in the Version 2 Contract were made to improve the simplicity and readability of the Contract, and to shift non- material content to an online Operational Manual which the Supervisors are instructed to also consult. There is therefore no material difference between the Version 2 Contract and the Version 1 Contracts on which the previous Product Rulings – BR Prd 09/04 and BR Prd 09/06 are based. 9. Specific procedural details referred to in both versions of the Contract are also provided in specific Delivery Instructions given to the Supervisors before each Job (“the Delivery Instructions”). 10. The key changes reflected in the Version 2 Contract are: • the inclusion of reference to the Operational Manual; • the removal of the competition section from the body of the Contract and transferring it to section 2 of the Operational Manual; 3 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED • some alteration to the way piece rates are calculated in schedule 2 of the Version 2 Contract; • the removal of Schedule 3 (the geographic map), Schedule 4 (the template tax invoice) and schedule 5 (the dispute resolution flowchart) as included in the Version 1 Contracts; and • the renumbering of the Supervisor details form as schedule 3 of the Version 2 Contract (previously this was Schedule 6 of the Version 1 Contract). 11. The Operational Manual does not replace or override any of the material terms of the Contract, and it does not affect the nature of the contractual relationship between Reach Media and the Supervisors. 12. The terms of the Contract under various headings are as follows. 13. Under the heading “Services”, the Contract requires the Supervisors to:  complete the services set out in Schedule 1 of the Contract;  ensure other business commitments do not affect their obligations to Reach Media;  comply with tax and health and safety legislation (Version 1 Contracts);  familiarise themselves with, and fully comply with, the Operational Manual (and any amendments) and any applicable legislation including that related to Tax and Health and Safety (Version 2 Contract). 14. Schedule 1 of the Contract requires Supervisors to oversee the delivery of material by Contracted Distributors in a defined area and to complete related tasks. 15. Schedule 1 specifies the services for which the Supervisors are contracted:  Processing Stock: Preparation and distribution of stock to each Contracted Distributor within the Supervisor’s area (this requirement is deleted for metro Supervisors).  Physical Delivery: Overseeing of the physical delivery of the individual items by the Contracted Distributors to nominated delivery points.  Administration: maintain and supply to Reach Media details of current Contracted Distributors and provide information in relation to any Round changes and associated delivery quantities including No Circular counts.  Client Service: ensure delivery contractors phone or text in conformation of delivery before the close of the Delivery Window. 16. Under the heading “Payment” the fees are the only amounts payable in respect of the Deliveries and are inclusive of all taxes (except GST) and other duties and levies. Each Supervisor’s fee for performing the Services 4 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED for Reach Media is calculated at the rates set out in Schedule 2. Under Version 1 Contracts Reach Media will provide a draft monthly invoice twice a month for contracted deliveries to Supervisors and make payment by direct credit within 7 days. Under Version 2 Contract Reach Media will provide a “buyer created tax invoice” prior to payment and will make payment by direct credit fortnightly on a Thursday. The implication of these provisions is that Reachmedia will provide an invoice to Supervisors (which takes the form of a buyer created tax invoice for GST-registered Supervisors or a similar invoice for Supervisors who are not GST-registered) prior to payment, with payment made on a fortnightly basis. 17. Under the heading “Equipment”, the Contract states that the Supervisors are responsible for providing their own equipment (such as personal office supplies, a telephone, a vehicle and wet weather gear) at their own expense. The Supervisors are also responsible for ensuring that such equipment is well maintained, safe and fit for its purpose. 18. Under the heading “Taxation”, the Contract states that the Supervisors will register for GST with Inland Revenue if required to do so. It provides the current registration threshold. The Contract specifies that the Supervisors are responsible for the payment of their own taxes on payments made to them by Reach Media under the Contract; that Reach Media may be required to withhold taxes from its payments; and if so, the payment made will be reduced to the extent that tax is withheld. 19. Under the heading “Termination of Contract”, the Contract states that Reach Media or the Supervisors may terminate the contract for any reasons whatsoever by giving four weeks’ notice in writing. However, if Reach Media believes there has been a serious breach of the Contract, then Reach Media may terminate the Contract immediately without notice. Under the Version 2 Contract Reach Media may also terminate the Contract for serious breach of the Manual (and any amendments). 20. Under the heading “Status of Contractor”, the Contract defines the contractor’s status as follows:  Reach Media engages each Supervisor under a contract for services, so the Supervisor is an independent contractor; the terms of the Contract or its operation do not create an employment relationship between the Supervisor and Reach Media. (These statements in the Contracts are referred to in this Ruling as the “Clarification Statements”. They are not considered to be material for the purposes of the conditions that the Ruling is subject to).  The Supervisor may accept other engagements or work while engaged by Reach Media unless there is a conflict of interest. 21. Under the heading “Indemnity”,  The Version 1 Contracts state that the Supervisor is to undertake the services at their own risk. This means Reach Media will not be liable to the Supervisor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Supervisor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of this contract.  The Version 2 Contract states that the Supervisor is to undertake the services at their own risk. This means Reach Media will not be liable 5 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED to the Supervisor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Supervisor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of this contract or the Manual (and any amendments). 22. Under the heading “Delivery Options”, the Contract states that the Supervisor is responsible for arranging for someone else to carry out the services if the Supervisor is unable to work. The Supervisor is solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who help them in this way. 23. Under the heading “Frequency of Deliveries”, the Contract states that Reach Media does not guarantee any minimum amount of material for which the Supervisor will carry out the services. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The terms of the Contract entered into between Reach Media and the Supervisors are the same as those contained in the Version 1 Contracts and Version 2 Contract provided to the Inland Revenue Department in the Ruling Application dated 26 November 2012, except in relation to immaterial details such as fees, rates, frequency of invoices, defined areas, names and addresses that are contained in the Online Operational Manual or specific Delivery instructions; and b) The relationship between Reach Media and any of the Supervisors is, and during the period of this Ruling will apply, in accordance with all of the material terms of the Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, the Clarification Statements are not considered to be material for the purposes of these conditions. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any of the conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) For the purposes of the PAYE rules, any payment made to a Supervisor by Reach Media under the Contract will not be “salary or wages” or “extra pay” or a “schedular payment” within the meaning of those terms as defined in sections s RD 5, RD 7 and RD 8 respectively of the Act. b) For the purpose of section DA 2(4), any payment made to a Supervisor by Reach Media under the Contract will not be “income from employment”. c) For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by any Supervisor under "the Contract" will not be excluded from the definition of "taxable activity" (as defined in section 6 of that Act) by section 6(3)(b) of that Act. 6 CLASSIFIED IN CONFIDENCE – INLAND REVENUE PROTECTED The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2012 and ending on 30 June 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 29th day of April 2013. Maryanne Hansen Investigation Manager, Investigations and Advice

NZBL acquires new bloodstock from third party owners, and then leases this bloodstock to the customer. Alternatively, the customer purchases the new bloodstock from the third party owner, sells it to NZBL, and then leases the bloodstock from NZBL. This helps to protect NZBL from involvement in any subsequent contractual claims regarding the purchase of the bloodstock from the third party owner. In both cases, the parties contemplate the transaction as a whole at the outset. In either case, the customer sources the bloodstock, drawing on bloodstock consulting, freight, and insurance services provided by NZB. 4. NZBL may also acquire bloodstock that is already owned by the customer, either through an earlier purchase or because it is homebred (the already owned bloodstock) and the proceeds or sale of the already owned bloodstock are only used for the further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business. 5. It is agreed in the Bloodstock Agreement that the customer may purchase the bloodstock at the end of the lease. The Bloodstock Agreement describes the Arrangement: WHEREAS A. The Lessee has requested the Lessor to purchase the Animal described in the Schedule hereto (hereinafter called ‘the Animal’) and upon purchase thereof to lease and, if required, to re-sell the Animal to the Lessee in accordance with the terms hereof. B. The Lessor has purchased the Animal and has agreed to lease the Animal to the Lessee and the Lessee has agreed to lease the Animal with the right to purchase it upon the terms and conditions more particularly outlined herein. C. The Animal secures the payment or performance of the Lessee’s obligations hereunder and this Agreement creates a security interest in the Animal in terms of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999. D. The Lessor has agreed to this Lease to Purchase Agreement for the specific purpose of assisting the Lessee in the business of breeding bloodstock for sale by adding to its inventory and upon the basis that the Lessee, if it wishes to sell the leased animal or, if a mare, the progeny thereof, will sell the same through the bloodstock auctions conducted by its parent company New Zealand Bloodstock Limited. E. The Lessee has entered into this agreement for the purpose of obtaining breeding stock to use in the Lessee’s business of bloodstock breeding for sale. Lease particulars 6. The terms and duration of leases are based on individual requirements, credit risk, and potential breeding expectations. Lease periods may vary, but a typical lease term is three years for fillies or mares, and two years for colts or stallions. 3 Lease Assignment 7. When the lease is executed, in some instances NZBL may assign the lease to NZB Finance for the discounted value of the cash flow. The discount is equivalent to the market rate offered by third party companies providing such financing facilities. The assignment is on a non-recourse basis, and NZBL is not liable to NZB Finance in the event of default by the lessee. 8. The Notice of Assignment describes this assignment as: TAKE NOTICE that on the New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited being the Lessor under the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement between it and you as Lessee has absolutely assigned all of its right title and interest therein as Lessor as follows (a) To New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited a duly incorporated company having its principal place of business at Karaka Sales Centre, Hingaia Road, Papakura, New Zealand all of its rights and obligations relating to the leasing of the Animal under the said Agreement and without limiting the generality of the foregoing all of the rights of the Lessor to receive payments of rental as and when they shall become due or other monies payable under the said Agreement by the Lessee to the Lessor or in respect of the Lessor enforcing such rights and receiving such payments as are prescribed by the said Agreement. You are directed to pay all payments of rental due under the said Agreement and all other payments due in respect of the lease of the Animal therein described to the said New Zealand Bloodstock Finance Limited and in future to deal with that company in respect of all matters pertaining to the leasing arrangement under the said Agreement. Residual Value 9. The bloodstock has a defined Residual Value under the Bloodstock Agreement. The Residual Value is an estimate (at the time of signing the lease) of the value the bloodstock will have at the end of the lease. “Residual Value” is defined in the Bloodstock Agreement as: ‘Residual value’ means the amount specified in the Schedule hereto as such being a pre-estimate of the value of the Animal upon the expiry of this Lease. Bloodstock Assignment 10. After the lease has been entered into and assigned to NZB Finance, NZBL may assign the title to the bloodstock to NZB Progeny. Because the Residual Value, if realised at all, is not realised by NZB Progeny until the end of the lease, NZB Progeny pays to NZBL the discounted value of the residual value payment. The discounted value is calculated using market rates materially the same as those used by third party companies providing financial facilities. 11. Transferring the bloodstock titles to NZB Progeny gives additional asset protection benefit to the NZB Group. In this way the group’s interest in the bloodstock is separated and protected from the day to day business activities of NZB, NZB Finance and NZBL. The Notice of Assignment from NZBL to the lessee describes this assignment as: 4 TAKE NOTICE that on the New Zealand Bloodstock Leasing Limited being the Lessor under the Bloodstock Lease to Purchase Agreement between it and you as Lessee has absolutely assigned all of its right title and interest therein as Lessor as follows (a)... (b) To New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited a duly incorporated company having its principal place of business at Karaka Sales Centre, Hingaia Road, Papakura, New Zealand all of its rights and obligations relating to the title to and property in the Animal and the right to receive payment of the Residual value outlined in the said Agreement and any other monies due under the said Agreement in respect of the title to or ownership of the Animal. You are directed to pay the amount of Residual Value of the Animal on the date payable under the said Agreement to New Zealand Bloodstock Progeny Limited and in future to deal with that company in respect of all matters relating to the ownership and wellbeing of the Animal(s). Lease Termination Date 12. The “Lease Termination Date” is the date on which the lease ends. The customer may purchase the bloodstock on the Lease Termination Date for the Residual Value. If the customer does exercise their option to purchase the bloodstock, NZB Progeny or NZBL will transfer title to the customer in return for payment of the Residual Value. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The customer is in the business, as defined in section YA 1, of breeding bloodstock. b) Where the bloodstock is already owned bloodstock, the customers will enter into the Bloodstock Agreement for one or both of the following reasons which are, in each case, the main reason or reasons for entering into the Arrangement: - The need to refinance bloodstock already owned for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business, and/or - The need for certainty of cash inflows for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business through the sale of the bloodstock to NZBL. c) Where the bloodstock is new bloodstock, the customers will enter into the Bloodstock Agreement for one or a number of the following reasons which are, in each case, the main reason or reasons for entering into the Arrangement: - The need to refinance bloodstock already owned for further investment in the customer’s bloodstock breeding business - The need for certainty of cash outflows through structuring the lease payments, and/or - The need to reduce the initial level of cash required to enter the bloodstock breeding business or to purchase new bloodstock. d) The customer has not entered into two or more consecutive or successive leases (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(iv) of the “lease” definition in section YA 1, if 5 the reference to “the same personal property lease asset” is read as a reference to “the same bloodstock”) of the same bloodstock. e) The customer has entered into the Bloodstock Agreement for the sole purpose of breeding from the leased bloodstock and intends to use the leased bloodstock in deriving assessable income. f) The lease payments are genuine, arm’s length amounts for the possession and use of the bloodstock. g) The leased bloodstock is mature for use in breeding and is capable of being used for breeding at all times during the period to which each lease payment relates. h) Any racing undertaken by the leased bloodstock is incidental to the actual use of the bloodstock for breeding during the lease term. i) The Residual Value of the bloodstock is a reasonable, and the parties’ best, estimate of the likely market value of the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. j) The bloodstock becomes the property of the customer only when the customer makes payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. k) No consideration is paid for the option to purchase the bloodstock at the Lease Termination Date. l) The customer is not in the business, as defined in section YA 1, of selling or exchanging leases. m) At the time of entering into the Bloodstock Agreement, the customer does not intend to dispose of the lease. n) The customer is not carrying on or carrying out an undertaking or scheme of trading leases entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The bloodstock lease payments are deductible under section DA 1(1) and none of the general limitations in section DA 2 apply, provided that: (i) no provision in subparts DB to DZ applies to prevent a deduction in section DA 1(1), and (ii) the income arising from the Arrangement is derived by the customer in New Zealand. b) At the end of an income year, unless excused from this requirement pursuant to a determination issued by the Commissioner, section EA 3 applies to require the unexpired portion of any lease payments paid in advance to be included in the customer’s income in the current income year and to be an amount for which the customer is allowed a deduction in the following income year. 6 c) The valuation and specified write-down provisions in sections EC 38 to EC 48 apply to the customer when the bloodstock is purchased by payment of the Residual Value after the Lease Termination Date. d) The “cost price” of the bloodstock for the purposes of sections EC 38 to EC 48 is the Residual Value stated in the Bloodstock Agreement. e) The financial arrangements rules in subpart EW do not apply to the Arrangement. f) Section EJ 10 does not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not an operating lease. g) Sections FA 6 to FA 11 do not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not a finance lease. h) Section FA 12 does not apply to the Arrangement as the lease is not a hire purchase agreement. i) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 6 December 2012 and ending on 6 December 2017.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/07 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 5 and 8 and the definition of “consideration” in s 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the charging of an annual levy (Levy) on liable telecommunication operators by the Minister of the Crown (Minister) for the time being responsible for the administration of the Telecommunications Act 2001 (Telecommunications Act) under the Telecommunications Operators (Commerce Commission Costs) Levy Regulations 2011 (2011 Levy Regulations). The Arrangement ensures the cost the Commerce Commission (Commission) incurs in regulating telecommunications operators is paid, in part, by telecommunications operators. The Levy is collected by MBIE (the Ministry responsible for administering the Telecommunications Act for the Minister). The Commission is a Crown entity listed in sch 1 pt 3 of the Crown Entities Act 2004, it is resident in New Zealand for GST purposes and is a “registered person” as that term is defined in s 2(1). 2 Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 1. In March 2000 a Ministerial inquiry into telecommunications was established to assess the regulatory regime for telecommunications and recommend any changes. Following the inquiry, the Government announced it was establishing a new regulatory framework for the telecommunications industry that would include the establishment of a Telecommunications Commissioner in the Commission. A levy imposed on the telecommunications industry would meet the general costs of the Commission (including the Telecommunications Commissioner) incurred in carrying out its telecommunications-specific regulatory functions. 2. In May 2001, the Telecommunications Bill 2001 (2001 Bill) was introduced into Parliament and referred to the Commerce Select Committee for consideration. The Explanatory Note to the 2001 Bill relevantly stated that: Thirdly, the position of a new specialist Telecommunications Commissioner is established within the Commission. The Telecommunications Commissioner's main functions will be to- • make determinations on disputes over designated services and specified services in accordance with the processes set out in Part 2; and • report to the responsible Minister on the desirability of regulating additional services in accordance with a process contained in Schedule 3; and • undertake key costing and monitoring activities under Part 3 relating to telecommunications service obligations. ... Subpart 2 deals with preliminary matters about the Commission, which will have an important role in the context of designated services and specified services (Part 2) and telecommunications service obligations (Part 3). In particular, subpart 2- • provides for the appointment of a specialist Telecommunications Commissioner as a member of the Commission (clause 9): • specifies when the Telecommunications Commissioner will be involved in performing the functions of the Commission under this Bill, and specifies the number of other members of the Commission who will be involved in performing those functions (clause 10): • specifies the provisions of the Commerce Act 1986 that apply to the Bill: • provides that the Commission's costs in performing its functions under the Bill will be met by prescribing levies payable by prescribed telecommunications providers. 3. The Commentary to the 2001 Bill, as reported back from the Commerce Committee, stated that the Telecommunications Commissioner’s funding “is based on an industry levy”. The Commentary to the 2001 Bill relevantly stated: Industry levy The committee agrees it is appropriate that the Commerce Commission's new functions be funded by an annual levy on telecommunications services providers, in accordance with regulations. The committee notes that dispute resolution (determinations) will be paid for by the parties to the dispute. 3 To ensure a smooth transition to the new system, government member's recommend the annual levy be raised retrospectively in its first year, to cover establishment costs. Government and Green members also recommend the Minister be required to consult with the industry prior to setting a levy. ... Accountability arrangements The Telecommunications Commissioner will be funded from Vote Communications and there will be a Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Economic Development and the Commerce Commission covering this and other outputs the ministry is funding. The Minister of Communications had indicated that he expects the Commission to consult with industry in setting its telecommunications budget. The Government's position is that the budget process and the Commission's annual report to Parliament will be expected to keep the Telecommunications Commissioner's costs under control. It is also expected that the Commission will consult directly with industry on its work plan and budget to help address any industry concerns. 4. The Telecommunications Act was enacted on 19 December 2001. The industry levy was imposed by the Telecommunications Operators (Commerce Commission Costs) Levy Regulations 2002 (2002 Levy Regulations) with application from the financial year commencing 1 July 2001. Essentially, the 2002 Levy Regulations provided for the Telecommunications Commissioner’s annual estimated costs to be met by telecommunications operators. The costs were apportioned by reference to each operator’s annual revenues attributable to services offered by means of a “public switched telephone network” (PSTN) as that term is defined in the Telecommunications Act. Once the Telecommunications Commissioner’s actual costs were identified in the Commission’s annual audited financial statements, under-payments had to be met by each telecommunications operator and over-payments were repaid. 5. Following a stocktake of the New Zealand telecommunications industry, the Government introduced the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 2006 (2006 Bill). The 2006 Bill contained additional regulatory functions and powers to be performed by the Commission. It also enhanced the ability of the Commission to intervene to best promote the development of competition in telecommunications markets. The amendments in the 2006 Bill included:  introducing a standard terms determination process that would allow the Commission to simultaneously set access terms and conditions for regulated services for multiple access seekers, access providers or both.  providing for a formal undertakings process that allowed the Commission to accept and enforce voluntary supply commitments from access providers in lieu of regulation.  improving the regulated service access codes regime.  empowering the Commission to continuously monitor the performance and development of the telecommunications sector and its markets; and  providing for the Commission to have regard to statements of government economic policies when exercising its powers. The 2006 Bill was passed in December 2006. 4 6. The Cabinet Policy Committee paper relating to the Telecommunications Stocktake (POL Min (06) 7/9) recognised that the additional functions to be performed by the Commission would result in additional costs, but anticipated that these costs would be recoverable via the Levy. The paper relevantly stated that: FISCAL IMPLICATIONS 146 There will be budgetary implications arising from the proposals in order to ensure the Commerce Commission is adequately resourced to ensure effective competition. ... 148 The majority of the costs incurred by the Commission should be recoverable from the telecommunications industry via the industry levy and it is likely that any additional funding will be fiscally neutral. 7. Amendments introduced to the Telecommunications Act 2001 by the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2011 added further regulatory functions to be carried out by the Commission and the Telecommunications Commissioner relating to the structural separation of Telecom. Following the enactment of the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2011, the 2002 Levy Regulations were revoked and replaced by the 2011 Levy Regulations. Telecommunications Act 2001 8. Section 3(1) of the Telecommunications Act states that the main purpose of the Telecommunications Act is to regulate the supply of telecommunications services. Section 3(1) of the Telecommunications Act states: 3 Purpose (1) The main purpose of this Act is to regulate the supply of telecommunications services. 9. Section 9 of the Telecommunications Act specifies that there must be a Telecommunications Commissioner. Section 9 of the Telecommunications Act relevantly states: 9 Appointment of Telecommunications Commissioner (1) There must be a Telecommunications Commissioner. (2) The Telecommunications Commissioner is a member of the Commission as provided in section 9(3) of the Commerce Act 1986. (3) Subject to subsection (4), the Telecommunications Commissioner must be appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister. ... 10. The Telecommunications Commissioner is a member of the Commission appointed under s 9(3) of the Commerce Act 1986. 11. Section 11(3) of the Telecommunications Act states that the Governor General (acting on the recommendation of the Minister) may pass regulations requiring the payment of levies. The levies must be paid to the Minister by telecommunications operators. These levies must be used to defray the Commission's costs for the functions it performs under the Telecommunications Act. Under s 11(1) of the Telecommunications Act, 5 every service provider, or class of service providers, specified in regulations made under s 11(3) must pay to the Minister, in each financial year, a levy of an amount stated in, or calculated or set or reset in accordance with, those regulations for, or in connection with,—  the performance of the Commission’s functions and duties under the Telecommunications Act; and  the exercise of the Commission’s powers under the Telecommunications Act. 12. Section 11 of the Telecommunications Act states: 11 Levy (1) Every service provider, or class of service providers, specified in regulations made under subsection (3) must pay to the Minister, in each financial year or part financial year (as the case may require), a levy of an amount stated in, or calculated or set or reset in accordance with, those regulations for, or in connection with,— (a) the performance of the Commission's functions and duties under this Act; and (b) the exercise of the Commission's powers under this Act. (2) Subsection (1) applies irrespective of the fact that the regulations are made and come into effect after the date on which the financial year or part financial year commences. (3) The Governor-General may, by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister, make regulations— (a) specifying the amounts of levies payable under this section: (b) providing for the method by which those levies will be calculated: (c) specifying the criteria and other requirements by and against which those levies will be set or reset: (d) specifying the financial year or part financial year to which those levies apply: (e) providing for the payment and collection of those levies: (f) exempting any service provider or class of service providers from paying levies under this section: (g) providing for waivers or refunds of the whole or any part of any levy paid by any service provider or class of service providers under this section. 13. Section 14 of the Telecommunications Act provides for a late payment penalty for non–payment of the Levy and states: 14 Late payment of levy (1) If any service provider liable to pay the levy fails to pay the whole amount of that levy by the date specified in regulations made under section 11(3) or section 12(4), the service provider must pay interest on the unpaid amount at the rate of 1.5% per month calculated from the date payment is due. (2) Interest will be calculated in monthly instalments for each month, or part of each month, that the payment is due. (3) The amount of any unpaid levy or interest is recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction as a debt due to the Crown. 6 Telecommunications Operators (Commerce Commission Costs) Levy Regulations 2011 14. The Explanatory Note to the 2011 Levy Regulations states that they impose levies on telecommunications operators to cover the costs incurred by the Commission in performing and exercising its functions, powers, and duties under the Telecommunications Act (except certain determinations, where costs are required to be met by parties to the determination, and litigation). 15. Regulation 5 of the 2011 Levy Regulations states that every liable telecommunications operator during all or part of a financial year must pay the Levy for that financial year to the Minister. Regulation 5 of the 2011 Levy Regulations states: 5 Levy on telecommunications operators Every person who is a telecommunications operator during all or part of a financial year must pay a levy for that financial year to the Minister. 16. Regulation 6 of the 2011 Levy Regulations states that the Levy must be collected annually. The due date is 30 working days after the Commission’s final liability allocation determination for the financial year is publicly notified under s 87 of the Telecommunications Act. Regulation 6 of the 2011 Levy Regulations states that: 6 How and when levy must be paid (1) The Minister must collect the levy annually. (2) The due date for each payment is the 30th working day after the Commission's final liability allocation determination for the financial year is publicly notified under section 87 of the Act. 17. Regulation 7 of the 2011 Levy Regulations states that the total sum of the Levy to be collected from liable telecommunications operators is calculated by reference to the costs of the Commission for, or in connection with, the performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Telecommunications Act. These costs are identified as such in the Commission’s audited financial statements for the relevant financial year. However, this figure cannot be higher than the amount of Crown revenue appropriated for that financial year within Vote Communications for the non- departmental output class that authorises expenses to be incurred for, or in connection with, the Commission's performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Telecommunications Act. Regulation 7 states that: 7 Basis of calculation of levy (1) The levy payable for the financial year must be calculated by the Minister as follows: \_a\_ × c b where— a is the amount of the telecommunications operator's final qualified revenue b is the sum of all telecommunications operators' final qualified revenue 7 c is the amount of the Commission's costs for the financial year, as specified in subclause (2). (2) The amount of the Commission's costs for the financial year is the amount— (a) identified in the Commission's audited financial statements for the financial year as the costs of the Commission for, or in connection with, the performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Act; but (b) that does not exceed the total amount appropriated for that financial year within Vote Communications for the non- departmental output class that authorises expenses to be incurred for, or in connection with, the Commission's performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Act; and (c) that does not include— (i) any costs of the Commission in relation to a determination or application for a determination that are met by the parties to the determination under section 55 of the Act; and (ii) any costs of the Commission in relation to a determination that are met by a TSO provider under section 94A or 94B of the Act; and (iii) costs of litigation incurred for, or in connection with, the Commission's performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Act. Overview of some of the Commission’s functions, duties and powers under the Telecommunications Act that are (retrospectively) funded by the Levy 18. The Levy covers the amount of all the costs of the Commission for, or in connection with, the performance and exercise of its functions, powers, and duties under the Telecommunications Act that are identified as such in the Commission’s audited financial statements for the financial year. The only exception to this are those costs specifically excluded by reg 7(2)(c) of the 2011 Levy Regulations (refer para 17 above). The costs the Commission incurs, ultimately paid for by the Levy, relate to a number of different activities. Neither the 2011 Levy Regulations nor the Telecommunications Act explicitly itemise the expenses that the Levy is intended to pay. 19. The following is an overview of some (but not all) of the regulatory functions, duties and powers performed or exercised by the Commission under the Telecommunications Act that the Levy is intended to (retrospectively) fund: Market monitoring and information dissemination  Monitoring competition in, and the performance and development of, telecommunications markets.  Producing various monitoring reports on a regular basis. These include monitoring reports on telecommunications markets generally and broadband performance specifically. The Commission must make available all reports, summaries or information relating to its monitoring activities. 8 Reviews and studies  Section 9A(1)(b) of the Telecommunications Act 2001, as amended in December 2006, empowers the Commission to proactively conduct inquiries, reviews and studies into any matter relating to the telecommunications industry or the long-term benefits of end- users of the telecommunications services within New Zealand.  This power enables the Commission to take a strategic view of any matter that relates to the telecommunications industry. The Commission must make available all reports, summaries or information relating to its reviews and studies. The Standard Terms Determination process  The Standard Terms Determinations (STD) process enables the Commission to make a determination on how a designated or specified service must be supplied with reference to all access seekers and providers of the service. The Commission may, on its own initiative, initiate the STD process for any of the designated or specified services in sch 1 of the Telecommunications Act. Where the Commission’s costs for an STD are not met by the parties (under s 55(2) of the Telecommunications Act), they will be recoverable via the Levy. The key events in the STD process are as follows: o Commission initiates standard terms development process o Commission holds scoping workshop o Commission issues notice calling for standard terms proposal from access provider o Access provider submits standard terms proposal by specified date o Commission advises of receipt of standard terms proposal o Interested parties provide submissions on standard terms proposal o Commission issues draft standard terms determination o Interested parties provide submissions on draft standard terms determination o Commission holds conference or consultation with persons other than the parties to the determination (optional) o Commission issues standard terms determination. 9 Reviews and clarifications of Standard Terms Determinations  The Commission may, on its own initiative, commence a review at any time of all, or any, of the terms specified in a STD. Structural separation of Telecom  The Commission has the overall role of monitoring the broader effects of the Telecom separation arrangements. It also uses information from the independent oversight group, Telecom and other sources to identify either breaches or the potential for breaches, of the undertakings by Chorus. Telecom and Chorus are defined terms in the Telecommunications Act.  The Commission has the explicit role of enforcing compliance with the Telecommunications Act and can make recommendations to the Minister if it considers variations and exemptions to undertakings by Chorus are required.  The 2011 amendments to the Telecommunications Act introduced a requirement for the Commission to maintain a register of those users to whom Chorus may supply telecommunications services. This is known as the register of non-retail users. The Commission has processes to manage applications to add names to the register, inform people about these applications, and receive complaints about the inclusion of users on the register. Information disclosure requirements  The Telecommunications Act contains formal requirements for Telecom and access providers to provide a broad range of information to the Commission for publication. This ensures a wide range of people are informed about the operation and behaviour of prescribed businesses that provide prescribed services. This enables the Commission to monitor and facilitate compliance with prescribed applicable access principles, as those terms are defined in the Telecommunications Act. Schedule 3 investigations  The Commission is responsible for matters relating to regulation- making powers for designated services and specified services. This includes conducting formal investigations into whether sch 1 of the Telecommunications Act (Designated services and specified services) should be altered, following the procedure contained in sch 3 of the Telecommunications Act (Procedure for altering regulated services) and reporting the Telecommunications Commissioner’s recommendation to the Minister. Telecommunications Service Obligations  The Commission administers the Telecommunications Service Obligations (TSO) deeds. 10 Information disclosure by local fibre companies with undertakings  Under the 2011 amendments to the Telecommunications Act, local fibre companies building the ultrafast broadband fibre network and Chorus's copper network are required to disclose specified information to the Commission. Industry Codes  Draft telecommunications access codes must be submitted to the Commission for approval by the Telecommunications Industry Forum under sch 2 of the Telecommunications Act. Undertakings  The Commission must agree to the terms and conditions of any undertaking made by an access provider under sch 3A of the Telecommunications Act that provides a mechanism for an access provider to supply a service to all access seekers on a voluntary basis that avoids the need for and the costs of regulation. Administering the Telecommunications Development Levy  The Commission administers the Telecommunications Development Levy. Telephone number portability  The Commission is responsible for regulating local and cellular telephone number portability services under the Telecommunications Act. Charging, Collection and Allocation of the Levy 20. At the beginning of the financial year the Commission's costs for its functions under the Telecommunications Act are set within Vote Communications as non-departmental output expenses. The “Performance Information for Appropriations – Vote Communications” document for the 2012/2013 year (<http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2012/ise/v1/ise12-v1-pia- commun.pdf> accessed 12 February 2013) (Vote Communications document) states that the scope of the appropriation is as follows: Enforcement of Telecommunications Sector Regulation (M88) Scope of Appropriation The regulation and monitoring of telecommunication services in accordance with the Telecommunications Act 2001. 21. The Vote Communications document sets out specific “Output Performance Measures and Standards” that the Commission must satisfy when carrying out its function of regulating and monitoring telecommunications services under the Telecommunications Act. These include: • Number of determinations (includes determinations, clarifications, reviews and amendments). 11 • Percentage of stakeholders who find the Commission determinations and supporting reasons clear. • Number of reports completed (monitoring reports, summary and analysis reports, information disclosure reports, ministerial reports). • Number of substantial pieces of advice provided to officials to inform policy design. • Percentage of stakeholders who rate \[the Commission’s\] reports good or above. • Percentage of reports completed by the set date. • Number of compliance assessments completed. • Number of enforcement cases taken. • Percentage of compliance assessments completed by the set date. 22. For the Ministry, the Levy revenue and the Commission’s appropriations are completely separate for GST purposes and they go through separate bank accounts. 23. The appropriation funding is drawn down from Treasury by the Ministry and paid to the Commission GST inclusive as and when required. The Commission brings the appropriation funding to charge as a GST inclusive revenue stream from the Crown. The Commission has the input tax credit on its operating expenses to offset against its GST output tax liability. The Ministry does not return input tax on the appropriation funding paid to the Commission. 24. At the end of the financial year, the Commission's costs for its functions under the Telecommunications Act are outlined in its audited financial statements. The 2011/12 Annual Report for the Commission states, at 57: Cost allocation – Direct costs are charged directly to outputs within an appropriation. Personnel costs are allocated to outputs based on time records. The indirect costs of support groups, and corporate overhead costs are charged to outputs based on the budgeted relative time records of each output. Goods and Services Tax (GST) – All items in the financial statements are presented exclusive of GST, except for receivables and payables, which are presented on a GST inclusive basis. ... 25. The Minister then calculates the Levy with reference to reg 7 of the 2011 Levy Regulations and the Commission’s actual (GST exclusive) costs, as identified in the Commission's audited financial statements. The Ministry (on behalf of the Crown) invoices and collects the Levy revenue for the Commission. The Levy is paid retrospectively, by all liable telecommunications operators to the Ministry, into the Ministry's Crown bank account. The Ministry then passes the Levy revenue to Treasury. This revenue stream is accounted for by the Ministry (on behalf of the Crown) and not by the Commission. 12 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Levy does not constitute “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for any “supply” (as defined in s 5) of goods and services by the Crown. b) The Levy paid by liable telecommunications operators under the Telecommunications Act is not subject to GST under s 8. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 6 June 2013 and ending on 6 June 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 6 th day of June 2013. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/08 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Bank of New Zealand. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CA 1(2), CB 4, CC 3, CE 1, CP 1 and BG 1. This Ruling does not apply if there is an employment relationship between the Fly Buys member who redeems their Fly Buys points for a contribution and the BNZ KiwiSaver member who receives the contribution. This Ruling does not apply if there is a contract for services (i.e., independent contractor relationship) between the Fly Buys member who redeems their Fly Buys points for a contribution and the BNZ KiwiSaver member who receives the contribution. This Ruling does not apply to a Fly Buys member who is a participant in the Fly Buys for Business programme. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is for the redemption of Fly Buys points for a contribution to a KiwiSaver account in a KiwiSaver scheme that Bank of New Zealand (the Bank) has established (the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme). Under an agreement between the Bank and Loyalty New Zealand Limited (Loyalty NZ), persons who are members of the Fly Buys loyalty programme will be able to request the redemption of their Fly Buys points for a contribution to their own, or another person’s, member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. In order to request the redemption of Fly Buys points a person does not have to be a Bank customer. As a separate and independent obligation under an agreement between the Bank and Loyalty NZ and signed on 13 May 2013, the Bank will make a payment to Loyalty NZ in relation to each contribution Loyalty NZ makes to a member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 2 KiwiSaver Act 2006 1. The KiwiSaver Act 2006 enables the establishment of KiwiSaver schemes. These schemes aim to encourage individuals to save for their retirement, principally through the workplace. 2. Section 3 of the Act KiwiSaver Act 2006 states: • the purpose of the Act is encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre- retirement; and • the Act aims to increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits. 3. Savings are primarily for retirement and are “locked in”, subject to permitted withdrawals, until a member reaches the New Zealand superannuation qualification age (which is currently 65 years). Permitted withdrawals include withdrawals to purchase a first home, on death, in cases of significant financial hardship, and in cases of serious illness, and withdrawals or transfers to a foreign scheme in cases of permanent emigration. 4. Inland Revenue administers Parts 1 to 3 and Schedule 3 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue oversees the provisions of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 that Inland Revenue administers. Among other administrative functions, Inland Revenue collects contributions from employers as part of the PAYE rules, and pays contributions to providers of KiwiSaver schemes. The Bank’s KiwiSaver Scheme 5. Until recently, the Bank directed its customers who wished to enrol in a KiwiSaver scheme to the AXA KiwiSaver Scheme, which AMP Wealth Management Limited (AMP) manages and promotes. The Bank is not a promoter of the AXA KiwiSaver Scheme. However, the Bank distributed information about the AXA KiwiSaver Scheme to its retail customers and received fees from AMP in respect of retail customers who became members of the AXA KiwiSaver Scheme. 6. The Bank has now established its own KiwiSaver scheme. 7. The BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme was established by a trust deed dated 8 January 2013 (the Trust Deed). 8. For the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, the manager and issuer of the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme is BNZ Investment Services Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Bank). The Bank and its directors are (for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978) the promoters of the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. 9. As at the date of the Bank’s application for this ruling, the registrar, trustee, investment manager, and accountant for the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme are respectively Trustees Executors Limited, the New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited, Russell Investments Limited and MMC Limited. 3 10. The BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme will be a portfolio investment entity for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007. Specifically, the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme will be a multi-rate portfolio investment entity. 11. The five funds in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme at the date of establishment are as follows: • cash fund; • conservative fund; • balanced fund; • moderate fund; and • growth fund. 12. It is possible that additional funds could be established within the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme from time to time, pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed. Fly Buys 13. Fly Buys is New Zealand’s largest loyalty programme. 14. Loyalty NZ administers Fly Buys. The Bank, Foodstuffs Ventures (NZ) Limited, IAG New Zealand Limited, and Z Energy Limited own Loyalty NZ in equal shares. 15. The Bank has an existing relationship with Loyalty NZ whereby the Bank’s customers may accrue Fly Buys points on various Bank products, for example, by making purchases using a Bank credit card and on the outstanding balance on certain home loans. 16. Any person may become a Fly Buys account holder by completing the appropriate Loyalty NZ application form. Membership is free. Under the terms and conditions established by Loyalty NZ, Fly Buys points have no cash or monetary value and cannot be sold, transferred or assigned for cash or other consideration. Additionally, a member cannot redeem or refund Fly Buys points for the payment of an amount of money directly to the member. Any Fly Buys points awarded but unused expire after 36 months. The terms and conditions of the Fly Buys loyalty programme do not prohibit a member redeeming points for any particular reward or class of rewards. Following the redemption of Fly Buys points for a reward, a member may (as a subsequent and separate transaction) transfer or assign the reward for money or other consideration (i.e. sell it). 17. Once a person is a Fly Buys account holder, they “collect” Fly Buys points (by way of a credit to an account maintained by Loyalty NZ) as a consequence of purchasing goods or services from participating reward partners (Partners). Fly Buys members pay the same price for qualifying goods and services as non-Fly Buys members. There are currently more than 40 Partners. Loyalty NZ and Partners agree on the level of Fly Buys points that Loyalty NZ may award to account holders. For example, one point may be awarded to an account holder for every $25 (or some other amount) spent with a Partner. From time to time, Loyalty NZ provides account holders with a points summary statement that details the holder’s opening points balance, credits and debits of points, and closing points balance. 4 18. Once an account holder has collected sufficient Fly Buys points, the account holder may redeem the Fly Buys points for specified rewards, being goods and services provided by Partners or other third parties that have entered into an agreement with Loyalty NZ to provide such rewards. The account holder contacts Loyalty NZ to request the redemption of their Fly Buys points, and Loyalty NZ arranges for the relevant Partner or other reward provider to provide the reward to the account holder. At Loyalty NZ’s option, rewards are posted or delivered to the address of the account holder or made available for collection at a location notified to the account holder. Fly Buys and contributions to the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme 19. The Bank proposes to integrate a Fly Buys feature with the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. 20. Under an agreement between the Bank and Loyalty NZ, a Fly Buys member will be able to redeem their Fly Buys points for a contribution to their own, or another person’s, member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. Where a Fly Buys member redeems his or her Fly Buys points for a contribution to another person’s member’s account, the contribution will be a gift from the Fly Buys member to the other person. 21. In the case of a redemption request for a BNZ KiwiSaver contribution, the Fly Buys account holder will contact Loyalty NZ and request the redemption of a specified number of Fly Buys points for a contribution of a specified amount of money to a nominated member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. 22. Loyalty NZ will provide details of the BNZ KiwiSaver member who is receiving the contribution reward and the dollar amount of the reward to the Bank. Loyalty NZ will pay the money into a BNZ suspense account. The contribution will be applied to the nominated member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme and to the relevant fund(s) most recently selected by the member. 23. As a separate and independent obligation, the Bank will make a payment to Loyalty NZ in relation to each contribution made by Loyalty NZ to a member’s account with the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. 24. Contributions to a member’s account in the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme arising from the redemption of Fly Buys points will be treated no differently under the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme than any other voluntary contributions to the scheme. 25. A Bank customer’s membership in the Fly Buys programme will be contractually separate to the customer’s agreement (if any) relating to their investment in the relevant fund within the BNZ KiwiSaver Scheme. Each arrangement will exist independently. Bank’s objectives 26. The Bank’s goals and objectives in integrating the Fly Buys feature into the BNZ KiwiSaver scheme are to: • increase customer benefits, satisfaction and customer retention; • encourage retirement savings by providing an innovative savings solution to its customers; and 5 • improve the Bank’s brand awareness among the public, so the Bank is seen as a market leader. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) No income arises under s CA 1(2) for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. b) No income arises under s CB 4 for a Fly Buys member or for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. c) No income arises under s CC 3 for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. d) No income arises under s CE 1 for a BNZ employee in relation to the Arrangement. e) No income arises under s CP 1 for a BNZ KiwiSaver member in relation to the Arrangement. f) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 10 June 2013 and ending on 31 March 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of June 2013. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR Prd 13/09 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Westpac New Zealand Limited (Westpac). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007, unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) ss BG 1, CC 4, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GB 21, RE 1 to RE 6, RE 10, RF 2 to RF 4, RF 12 and YA 1; (b) part VIB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a mortgage offset arrangement comprising a series of deposit accounts and a home loan account known as Choices Offset that Westpac intends to offer to its customers (Offset Arrangement). The Offset Arrangement allows a customer to link several deposit accounts (known as Linked Deposit Accounts) to one of a variety of home loan accounts (known as a Choices Offset Loan), notionally offsetting the balances of the deposit accounts against the loan account balance to reduce the amount of interest payable to Westpac on the home loan account. Interest is not paid or payable on any Linked Deposit Accounts for as long as the account is linked to a Choices Offset Loan. This Ruling does not consider the tax consequences of any arrangement under which a Linked Deposit Account holder agrees to offset their deposit account credit balance against another person’s Choices Offset Loan account debit balance in return for valuable consideration (whether in monetary or non- monetary form). Further details of the Arrangement are set out below. Background 1. The Offset Arrangement is a “mortgage offset” arrangement. The customers who may participate are classified as either Restricted Entities or Non-restricted Entities. Special rules apply to each of the two participant entities. (These terms are explained in paragraphs 24 to 30.) 2. The Offset Arrangement allows Westpac customers to “link” up to 10 Linked Deposit Accounts to a single loan account such that the balances of the home loan and deposit account(s) will be notionally aggregated (thereby, notionally reducing the debit balance of the loan) for the purposes of calculating the amount of interest that accrues on the loan. Westpac will pay no credit interest on the linked deposit accounts during the period they are so linked, even where the deposit balances exceed the loan balance. 3. The Offset Arrangement is not a separate loan product; it is an arrangement that can be used with an existing home loan product and deposit accounts. Further details of the Offset Arrangement, particularly in relation to the eligible home loans and deposit accounts, interest calculations, interest rates, eligibility requirements of participants and relevant documentation are set out in the following paragraphs. Eligible home loans that can be offset 4. Westpac offers its retail and business customers several loan products, including Choices Home Loans, which may have a fixed, floating or capped interest rate. 5. Westpac will determine from time to time which loan products may be included in an Offset Arrangement (such loans will be referred to as Qualifying Loans). Initially, only floating-rate Choices Home Loans will be included in the Offset Arrangement, but other Choices Home Loan types (excluding the Choices Everyday Loan) 1 may be added in due course. 6. Qualifying Loans will have a variety of repayment options, including table, non-table and interest only. A Qualifying Loan included in an Offset Arrangement is referred to as a Choices Offset Loan. 7. The effect of offsetting is that interest will be payable on the lower notional principal balance of the Choice Offset Loan. In the case of:  a table loan, the term of the loan will be reduced;  a non-table loan, the interests payments will be reduced with any interest savings resulting in either a reduction of interest payments or (if any minimum periodical payments are maintained) a reduction in the term of the loan;  an interest-only loan, interest payments will be reduced. Eligible deposit accounts that can be offset 8. Westpac also offers its customers a variety of deposit accounts, including transaction accounts and savings accounts. Westpac will determine, from time to time, which of these accounts may be included in an Offset Arrangement. 1 A Choices Everyday Loan is a revolving home loan product that gives the customer only one account for the home loan and everyday banking. Deposit accounts are not required to be new deposit accounts opened for the purpose of the Arrangement. Further, no new deposit account types will be created as part of the Offset Arrangement. 9. To participate in the Offset Arrangement, the deposit account (or accounts) has to be linked to a Choices Offset Loan. Under the Arrangement, a deposit account that has been linked to a Choices Offset Loan is referred to as a Linked Deposit Account. 10. Only one Qualifying Loan and up to 10 Linked Deposit Accounts may be included in an Offset Arrangement. Offsetting features 11. The key feature of the Offset Arrangement is the “offsetting” of the aggregate credit balance of the Linked Deposit Account (or Accounts) against the debit balance of a Choices Offset Loan account, which occurs before interest is calculated. 12. A net notional balance will be calculated for the Choices Offset Loan before interest is calculated with interest accruing on that net notional balance only. This is the case as a matter of contract (as set out in the terms and conditions applying to the Offset Arrangement) and as a matter of practice (in terms of Westpac’s internal systems and accounting). 13. There are no actual transfer of funds, no set-offs or netting of funds, and no transfer of any interest in, or entitlement to, funds between the Choices Offset Loan account and Linked Deposit Account (or Accounts). 14. The effect of offsetting is that interest will be payable on the lower notional principal balance of the Choices Offset Loan. 15. Financially, the consequences for a customer of linking one or more deposit accounts and a Choices Offset Loan in an Offset Arrangement or using Westpac’s revolving home loan product (Choices Everyday Loan) are similar in terms of reduced interest costs. The balance on which interest is calculated is reduced, resulting in a reduced term of the loan for table mortgages and reduced periodical payments for non-table mortgages. Interest calculations under a Choices Offset Loan 16. The balance on which interest shall accrue on any day under a Choices Offset Loan will be calculated by notionally reducing the debit balance of the Choices Offset Loan at the end of that day by an amount equal to the aggregate of the credit balances of each Linked Deposit Account at the end of that day. 17. If the aggregate of the credit balances of all Linked Deposit Accounts equals or exceeds the debit balance of the relevant Choices Offset Loan, no interest will accrue on the Choices Offset Loan. 18. No interest will accrue or be paid on the credit balance of a Linked Deposit Account for so long as it is linked to a Choices Offset Loan. This is the case irrespective of whether, on any given day, the aggregate of the credit balances of all Linked Deposit Accounts at the end of that day exceeds the debit balance of the Choices Offset Loan to which they are linked. 19. Interest will accrue on any Linked Deposit Account for any period that it is not linked to a Qualifying Loan. Clause 3 of the Offset Arrangement Agreement and Clause 2 of the Offset Arrangement Contributor Agreement make it clear that interest is suspended on Linked Deposit Accounts only for so long as they are linked to a Choices Offset Loan under those agreements. 20. Default interest will not be subject to the offsetting arrangement. It will continue to accrue in accordance with the standard terms and conditions that apply to any Choices Offset Loan. Interest rate 21. The rate of interest applicable to a Choices Offset Loan will be a market rate that Westpac determines. Eligible persons and entities 22. Under an Offset Arrangement, deposit accounts held by the following persons may be linked to a Choices Offset Loan:  the Borrower, that is, the person (or persons acting jointly) who has (have) taken out the Qualifying Loan to be included in the Offset Arrangement;  in limited circumstances (as discussed below), persons other than the Borrower (known as a Contributor). 23. For the purposes of this Ruling, a Borrower is a Restricted Entity or a Non- restricted Entity. Restricted Entities 24. Where the Borrower under the Offset Arrangement is a Restricted Entity, deposit accounts held only by the Borrower can be offset against the Borrower’s Choices Offset Loan account. 25. A Restricted Entity is:  any body corporate or other person, including a body of persons acting jointly, other than a natural person or two natural persons jointly who are ‘Partners’ (namely, two natural persons who are married, in a civil union or in a de facto relationship with each other); or  any person(s), including any natural person(s), who is/are acting in its/their capacity as the trustee(s) of a trust or executor(s) of an estate. 26. The effect of being a Restricted Entity is that only deposit accounts in respect of which the Borrower is the sole account holder can be linked to the Borrower’s Choices Offset Loan. 27. In the case of a Borrower acting in its/their capacity as the trustee(s) of a trust or the executor(s) of an estate, deposit accounts held only by the Borrower in its/their capacity(ies) as the trustee(s) of the same trust or executor(s) of the same estate can be linked to its Choices Offset Loan. 28. By way of example, if ABC Limited has established an Offset Arrangement in connection with its Qualifying Loan, deposit accounts held only by ABC Limited may be linked to that loan. Further, if ABC Limited is a party to the Choices Offset Loan as trustee of a trust, deposit accounts held only by ABC Limited in its capacity as trustee of the same trust may be linked to that loan. Non-restricted Entities 29. Where the Borrower is not a Restricted Entity (i.e. the Borrower is either a natural person or two natural persons jointly who are partners), deposit accounts which are held either individually or jointly by the Borrower, their partner (spouse, civil union or de facto partner), any of their children (or a child together with his or her partner), or any of their parents (or a parent together with his or her partner) can be linked to the Borrower’s Choices Offset Loan. This is on the condition that such persons are not themselves Restricted Entities. This can be done by:  the Borrower where he or she (or they) can do so within the parameters of any linking rules determined by Westpac from time to time (which will require, among other things, that the Borrower has sufficient authority to operate the relevant deposit account);  the Borrower acting with the consent of the relevant Contributor, in circumstances where the linking rules determined by Westpac from time to time require the relevant Contributor’s consent (which will be the case where the Borrower does not have sufficient authority to operate the relevant deposit account);  a Contributor, where the relevant deposit account is held by a Contributor and that Contributor has already provided consent in relation to another deposit account (and, therefore, has already signed up to the relevant terms and conditions under which the Borrower and the relevant Contributor agree that the Contributor may do so). 30. By way of example only, if Mr and Mrs Brown jointly establish a Choices Offset Loan:  deposit accounts held by Mr and Mrs Brown jointly may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan;  subject to any further criteria set by Westpac from time to time, deposit accounts held by Mr Brown in his individual capacity may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan (most likely by Mr Brown himself);  subject to any further criteria set by Westpac from time to time, deposit accounts held by Mrs Brown’s father may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan by: ‒ Mr and Mrs Brown, as the Borrower, with the consent of Mrs Brown’s father; or ‒ Mrs Brown’s father, if Mrs Brown’s father has already consented to another deposit account being linked to Mr and Mrs Brown’s Choices Offset Loan;  deposit accounts held by Mr Brown’s father or by Mr Brown’s father and his de facto partner jointly may be linked to that Choices Offset Loan (in accordance with relevant linking criteria above); and  deposit accounts held by ABC Limited, or by Mr Brown in his capacity as a trustee, or any other Restricted Entity, cannot be linked to that Choices Offset Loan. Offset Arrangement documentation 31. The terms and conditions of the Offset Arrangement are set out in the following documents provided to Inland Revenue on 27 March, 20 May and 13 June 2013. 32. The documents for the loan products included the:  Loan Summary (which contains particular and specific provisions relating to a loan facility that will be made available to a particular customer);  Westpac’s terms and conditions for the relevant home loan product (which is a standard form master document that contains generic provisions that apply to all loans of a particular type). 33. The documents for the Offset Arrangement included the:  Offset Arrangement Agreement (being the principal agreement between the Choices Offset Loan customer and Westpac in relation to the Offset Arrangement);  Offset Arrangement Contributor Agreement (being the document that a Contributor signs in addition to Westpac and the Borrower to join an Offset Arrangement). 34. The Offset Arrangement documentation will override certain of the terms and conditions that would otherwise apply to the relevant Qualifying Loan and Linked Deposit Accounts that are included in an Offset Arrangement. 35. In particular, the Offset Arrangement Agreement sets out the interest calculation method to be used for the Choices Offset Loan, provides for no interest to accrue on Linked Deposit Accounts for as long as the account(s) are linked to a Choices Offset Loan, and sets out the eligibility criteria (in relation to loans, accounts and account holders). 36. Therefore, Westpac customers who wish to include a Qualifying Loan in an Offset Arrangement would enter into the standard loan documentation applicable to the Qualifying Loan as well as the Offset Arrangement documentation. A customer may not have an Offset Arrangement without a Qualifying Loan. Condition(s) stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: (a) All interest rates offered by Westpac in relation to an Offset Arrangement are at arm’s length market rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any conditions stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Offset Arrangement as follows. Financial arrangements rules  When, under the Offset Arrangement, a credit balance of a Linked Deposit Account and a debit balance of a Choices Offset Loan account are offset, no amount of consideration is paid or payable by virtue of that offset for the purposes of calculating income or expenditure under ss EW 15 and EW 31 of the financial arrangements rules (as defined in s EW 1(2)). Therefore, offsetting does not, of itself, give rise to any income or expenditure under the financial arrangements rules. Resident withholding tax, non-resident withholding tax and approved issuer levy  There is no payment of, or entitlement to, interest (as defined in s YA 1) in relation to the credit balance(s) of Linked Deposit Account(s) in the Offset Arrangement. Therefore, no holder of a Linked Deposit Account derives any interest income on such accounts for the purposes of s CC 4, and Westpac does not pay any interest and has no obligation to deduct resident withholding tax or non-resident withholding tax under the Act or pay approved issuer levy under part VIB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. Section CC 7  No income arises under s CC 7 for Westpac or its customers in relation to the Offset Arrangement. Tax avoidance  Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement.  Section GB 21 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2013 and ending on 31 March 2017 This Ruling is signed by me on the 9 th day of July 2013.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/01 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Minister of State Owned Enterprises and the Minister of Finance, in their capacity as holders of all of the issued shares in Mighty River Power Limited (MRP) on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand (the Crown). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CC 3. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax consequences (if any) arising from the sale or disposition of any Shares acquired under the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the transfer of fully paid ordinary shares in Mighty River Power Limited (the Shares, which include the IPO Shares and the Loyalty Bonus Shares each as defined below) by the Crown to New Zealand Applicants (as defined below) pursuant to a combined Investment Statement and Prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ordinary Shares in MRP (the Offer Document). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. MRP is a New Zealand incorporated company. MRP commenced operations in 1999, when the Crown separated Electricity Corporation of New Zealand into three state-owned enterprises. MRP produces electricity, mainly from renewable sources, using its power station assets. MRP sells electricity to retail and business customers through multiple channels and retail brands. 2. All shares in MRP are currently held by the Crown. The Crown is intending to sell up to 49% of the ordinary Shares in MRP under the IPO. 3. The purchase price payable to the Crown for each Share under the IPO will be determined under an institutional book-build process. Application has been made to list all of the Shares in MRP on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. 4. New Zealand Applicants under the General Offer will acquire Shares from the Crown under the IPO (the IPO Shares) on the date of completion of the IPO (the Allotment Date) pursuant to the terms of the IPO. New Zealand Applicants who continue to hold those IPO Shares in the same registered name for a period of 24 months will be entitled to be transferred additional MRP shares from the Crown (the Loyalty Bonus Shares) based upon a ratio of one Loyalty Bonus Share for every 25 IPO Shares held by that New Zealand Applicant), up to a maximum number of 200 Loyalty Bonus Shares for each New Zealand Applicant. 2 5. In submitting an application form for IPO Shares, New Zealand Applicants under the General Offer are automatically applying for Loyalty Bonus Shares to which they may become entitled under the terms of the Offer Document. 6. Participants under the MRP Employee Share Purchase Programme will not receive Loyalty Bonus Shares under the IPO in respect of shares purchased under that Programme. 7. The date upon which the Loyalty Bonus Shares will be allotted to eligible New Zealand Applicants is intended to be within 5 business days from 24 months after the Allotment Date (Measurement Date). 8. New Zealand Applicants pay the same amount per share as all other purchasers under the IPO. This amount (the Final Price) is payable on completion of the Offer. No further consideration (in addition to the price paid by New Zealand Applicants when applying for their Shares) is payable by New Zealand Applicants who receive Loyalty Bonus Shares. There is no partial refund to the New Zealand Applicants if they do not receive the Loyalty Bonus Shares. 9. The Offer Document contains the following statement: For the purposes of the financial arrangements rules, the Crown confirms that the Final Price is the lowest price it would have accepted for the Shares on the basis of payment in full on the Allotment Date. 10. No promise to hold the IPO Shares for the required period of time is given by the New Zealand Applicants; they are free to dispose of their IPO Shares at any time. The recipients of the Loyalty Bonus Shares are determined solely by reference to those of the New Zealand Applicants still on the MRP share register at the Measurement Date. The Crown promises to transfer Loyalty Bonus Shares to New Zealand Applicants on a future date if the New Zealand Applicants are on the MRP share register at the Measurement Date. 11. A New Zealand Applicant is defined in the Offer Document as an applicant who is in New Zealand and provides, in conjunction with their application to acquire Shares, a New Zealand IRD number, a New Zealand bank account, a New Zealand address, confirmation that the applicant is in New Zealand and is not acting for the account or benefit of a person in the United States, and a declaration that the applicant is: a) in the case of an individual, a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident; or b) in the case of a New Zealand incorporated company, incorporated in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficial owners are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or c) in the case of a trust, established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficiaries are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or d) in the case of any other legal entity, it is incorporated or established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate 3 beneficial owners, beneficiaries or members are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. 12. The document describing the Arrangement is the combined Investment Statement and Prospectus dated 5 April 2013. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: a) The New Zealand Applicants will not derive income under s CC 3 as a result of acquiring Loyalty Bonus Shares under the Mighty River Power Limited Initial Public Offering. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 5 April 2013 and ending on 4 April 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 5 th day of April 2013. Fiona Heiford Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 13/11 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Minister of State Owned Enterprises and the Minister of Finance, in their capacity as holders of all of the issued shares in Meridian Energy Limited (Meridian) on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand (the Crown). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss CA 1(2), CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, CB 5, CD 1, CV 13, DB 23, DB 49, ED 1, EW 3, EW 5(13), EW 6(2), EW 31, EW 32(3), EW 35, FC 1, FC 2, HC 6, HC 17, the definition of “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” in s YA 1, and s YB 21. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the sale of up to 49% of the ordinary shares (the Shares) in Meridian Energy Limited (Meridian), through the use of instalment receipts, by the Ministers of State Owned Enterprises and Finance (the Ministers) on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand (the Crown) as vendor to purchasers (IR Holders), pursuant to the terms of the Retail Offer and the Institutional Offer contained in a combined Investment Statement and Prospectus (the Offer Document). For the avoidance of doubt, this Ruling does not apply to the Participating Iwi Offer contained in the Offer Document. This Ruling also does not apply to holders of Instalment Receipts to the extent to which the Shares to which those Instalment Receipts relate are held by an Australian trustee entity. The purchase price will be paid in two instalments (the First Instalment and the Final Instalment). All Shares sold under the Offer Document (other than Shares sold to applicants whose address as recorded in the Instalment Receipt register (Registered Address) is in Australia) will be held in trust by a New Zealand trustee entity (the New Zealand IR Trustee) until payment of the Final Instalment. Upon payment of the First Instalment, an IR Holder will receive an instalment receipt for each Share acquired under the Offer Document (the Instalment Receipt), which will be evidence of the IR Holder’s beneficial interest in that Share. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. The Ministers currently hold all of the Shares in Meridian on behalf of the Crown. The Crown is intending to sell up to 49% of the ordinary shares in Meridian under an initial public offering (the Offer). The purchase price payable per Share under the Offer (the Final Price) will be determined under an institutional book-build process prior to the allotment date of shares under the Offer (the Allotment Date). 2. The Final Price will be paid by investors in two instalments. The First Instalment is payable on application and the Final Instalment is payable 2 approximately 18 months after the Allotment Date (the Final Instalment Payment Date). The Final Instalment will be the Final Price less the First Instalment. The Final Price offered to New Zealand Applicants pursuant to the Retail Offer will be capped (as described at para 7 below). No IR Holder has the ability to prepay any part of the Final Price. 3. On the Allotment Date, Shares sold by the Crown to each successful applicant (other than any applicant whose Registered Address is in Australia) (IR Holder) under the Offer will be transferred to the New Zealand IR Trustee and will be held by that New Zealand IR Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of that IR Holder until payment of the Final Instalment. Pending payment of the Final Instalment, each IR Holder will be issued with Instalment Receipts by the New Zealand IR Trustee representing the beneficial interest of the IR Holder in the underlying Share. 4. Shares sold to each successful applicant whose Registered Address is in Australia will be transferred to an Australian trustee entity to be held subject to a separate trust deed. This Ruling does not apply to holders of Instalment Receipts to the extent to which the Shares to which those Instalment Receipts relate are held by an Australian trustee entity. References in this Ruling to “IR Holders” exclude references to any such holder of Instalment Receipts. 5. The New Zealand IR Trustee will allot Instalment Receipts as directed by the Crown. The New Zealand IR Trustee will not be an “issuer” or a “promoter” under the Securities Act 1978. 6. The underlying Share will be held on trust subject to a security interest in favour of the Crown securing the obligation to pay the Final Instalment and, if applicable, default interest, enforcement costs and certain other payments. Upon payment of the Final Instalment, IR Holders will receive legal title to the underlying Shares and the Instalment Receipts will be cancelled. 7. The Final Price payable by New Zealand Applicants who are allocated Instalment Receipts and corresponding Shares in the Retail Offer will be capped at a certain amount. This means that such New Zealand Applicants who continue to hold their Instalment Receipts in the same registered name until the Final Instalment Payment Date may pay a lesser aggregate Final Price than participants in the Institutional Offer. 8. The price cap offered to such New Zealand Applicants encourages them to participate in the offer and hold their Instalment Receipts until the Final Instalment Payment Date. The capped price will not apply to other IR Holders (such as institutional investors who participate in the Offer or any investors who acquire Instalment Receipts after the Allotment Date). 9. “New Zealand Applicant” is defined in the Offer Document as an applicant who provides, in conjunction with their application to acquire Shares, a New Zealand IRD number, a New Zealand bank account number, a New Zealand address and a declaration that the applicant is: a) in the case of an individual, a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident; or b) in the case of a company, incorporated in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficial owners consists 3 of persons who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or c) in the case of a trust, established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficiaries consists of persons who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or d) in the case of any other legal entity, incorporated or established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficial owners, beneficiaries or members consists of persons who are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. 10. The Offer Document will contain “lowest price” wording. This wording will form part of the agreement between the Crown as vendor and each IR Holder as purchaser. The lowest price wording will provide that the lowest price that the parties (the Crown and each IR Holder) would have agreed on the date the agreement between them was entered into for the supply of each underlying Share on the Allotment Date is the (applicable) Final Price. The Offer, therefore, will give rise to two types of contract for sale and purchase of Shares: a) one for New Zealand Applicants entitled to benefit from the price cap described above, which provides that those New Zealand Applicants who are allocated Instalment Receipts and corresponding Shares in the Retail Offer and who hold those Instalment Receipts to the Final Instalment Payment Date are entitled to pay the capped Final Price in respect of those Instalment Receipts; and b) one for all other IR Holders, which provides for payment of the (potentially higher) Final Price in respect of Instalment Receipts held by those IR Holders, including New Zealand Applicants who acquired their Instalment Receipts other than pursuant to the Offer on the Allotment Date. 11. Meridian will apply for the Shares and the Instalment Receipts to be listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges (the NZX and ASX respectively). However, only the Instalment Receipts will be quoted on the exchanges until the Final Instalment Payment Date, after which the Shares will be quoted (and the Instalment Receipts will cease to be quoted). Role of New Zealand IR Trustee 12. Legal title to the underlying Shares to which Instalment Receipts relate will be held by the New Zealand IR Trustee as trustee pursuant to a trust deed (the IR Trust Deed) between the Crown, Meridian and the New Zealand IR Trustee. The New Zealand IR Trustee will hold legal title to the underlying Shares on trust for IR Holders (who will hold the beneficial interest in the Shares) subject to a security interest in favour of the Crown. In this regard, cl 3.1 of the draft IR Trust Deed states: Subject to clause 3.4, as soon as possible after the closing of the Offer (or at such later time as is contemplated in the Offer Document), the Crown will, provided any conditions to which the contract with the relevant Successful Applicant may be subject have been satisfied, and in consideration for receipt of the First Instalment and the obligation of the Holders of Instalment Receipts at the Final Instalment Record Date to pay the Final Instalment in accordance with the terms of the Offer 4 and this Deed, transfer to the Trustee the Shares in respect of which there are Successful Applications by Successful Applicants to be held subject to the terms of the trusts set out in this Deed and will deliver to the Trustee certificate(s), if any, relating to those Shares. With effect from the time of that transfer: (a) the Security Interest shall be deemed to take effect; and (b) the Beneficial Interest shall vest in the person entitled to the Beneficial Interest in terms of the definition of that term in clause 1.1 and the appointment of the Trustee as the nominee of each such person pursuant to clause 4 shall take effect. 13. Each Instalment Receipt corresponds to a specific Share and each will be held by the New Zealand IR Trustee on a separate trust for the holder of the corresponding Instalment Receipt. Clause 4.1(a), 4.2 and 4.3 of the draft IR Trust Deed state: 4.1 Establishment (a) As from the date of registration of the transfer of a Share to the Trustee under clause 3.1, a Separate Trust in respect of each such Share shall be constituted by and subject to the terms and conditions of this Deed in favour of the Trustee as nominee for the relevant Successful Applicant and in favour of the relevant Successful Applicant as beneficiary, and the Trustee shall hold that Share which is the subject of that Separate Trust as nominee for the relevant Successful Applicant on the terms and conditions of this Deed. ... 4.2 Retention of Share (a) The Share the subject of a Separate Trust shall, during the Term of that Separate Trust, be held by the Trustee as nominee for the Holder of the Instalment Receipt which corresponds to the Share, but subject always to the Security Interest and this Deed. The provisions of this Deed which limit the rights of an Instalment Receipt Holder as holder of the Beneficial Interest are included for the purpose of giving effect to, and protecting, the Security Interest, and for no other purpose (other than where necessary to give effect to the requirements of Part 5A of the Public Finance Act 1989 or to the Crown’s rights where a Holder misrepresents its status as a New Zealand Applicant (as defined in the Offer Document)) and do not impact upon or alter the status of the Trustee as the nominee for each Instalment Receipt Holder. (b) The holding of a Share on the trusts described in clause 4.2(a) is subject to the following qualifications: (i) a Share may be retained by a Custodian or Sub-Custodian as nominee for the Trustee; and (ii) the Trustee may have any certificates in relation to any Shares held in custody by any person on behalf of the Trustee. 4.3 Instalment Receipt Holders’ rights and limits thereon (a) An Instalment Receipt Holder shall be entitled to the Beneficial Interest in each of the Shares corresponding to the Instalment Receipts registered in the name of such Holder. (b) Notwithstanding clause 4.3(a), the Beneficial Interest held by an Instalment Receipt Holder in any Share shall not: (i) confer upon the Instalment Receipt Holder, other than as provided in this Deed, any right or power to require the transfer to it or any other person of the Share prior to it having paid the Final Instalment and any other amounts payable under this Deed by Cleared Payment in respect of that Share; or 5 (ii) entitle the Instalment Receipt Holder to any further assurance of that Beneficial Interest beyond that resulting from the Acceptance of the relevant Application (in the case of a Successful Applicant) or registration of the Instalment Receipt Holder in the Instalment Receipt Register (in the case of the Successful Applicant or any other Instalment Receipt Holder), and from the terms of this Deed. 14. The New Zealand IR Trustee will have various duties under the IR Trust Deed, including as described below in relation to dividends paid by Meridian on underlying Shares (Dividends), voting of those Shares and the transfer of the underlying Shares to IR Holders on payment of the Final Instalment. 15. Other key duties imposed on the New Zealand IR Trustee include: a) holding the Shares on trust for IR Holders; b) selling the underlying Shares to recover the Final Instalment owed to the Crown if an IR Holder defaults in payment of the Final Instalment and cancelling the relevant Instalment Receipts; and c) arranging the registration of transfers of title to Instalment Receipts (or arranging the refusal of such transfer in accordance with applicable laws or stock exchange listing requirements). Dividends paid on Shares 16. Under the Trust Deed, each IR Holder will be entitled to receive Dividends paid on the underlying Shares to which that IR Holder’s Instalment Receipts relate, together with any imputation credits attached to those Dividends. In the IR Trust Deed, the New Zealand IR Trustee, as registered holder of the Shares and acting in the interests of the IR Holder, agrees to ensure that payment of all Dividends will be made directly by Meridian to IR Holders, as if those IR Holders were the registered holders of the underlying Shares at the relevant time. Meridian undertakes to pay the Dividends directly to the relevant IR Holder. The New Zealand IR Trustee also agrees to take reasonable steps to confer on IR Holders the benefit of imputation credits attached to any Dividends or any other tax benefit permitted by the Act. 17. Clauses 16.1 and 16.4 of the draft IR Trust Deed state: 16.1 Entitlements to Dividends Subject to clauses 16.7(a) and 18.4, if the Company pays a Dividend in respect of any Share at any time before the Final Instalment Payment Date, the Trustee shall hold the Dividend (and all its right, title and interest thereto) as a bare trustee for the relevant Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder on the terms set out in this Deed and shall (as registered holder of such Share and acting in the interests of the Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder): (a) in respect of a Dividend wholly or partly in cash, take all Reasonable Steps to cause the Company to pay such Dividend (or the cash portion) directly to the Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder; and (b) in respect of a Dividend wholly or partly other than in cash, take all Reasonable Steps to cause such Dividend (or the non-cash portion) to vest in the Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder, and the Crown will procure the Company to provide the Trustee with all reasonable assistance to comply with this clause 16.1 and, in particular, prior to the Final 6 Instalment Payment Date, to pay (or vest) Dividends directly to, or with, the relevant Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder. 16.4 Method of payment of Dividends (a) Subject to clauses 16.7(a) and 18.4, payment of any Dividend pursuant to clause 16.1(a) to an Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder in respect of the Shares corresponding to its Instalment Receipts may be made to the Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder as if that Holder was the registered holder of the Shares at such time and otherwise in the same manner and by the same means as applies to Shareholders (other than the Trustee), or by one of the methods described in clause 29.1. (b) The Trustee shall not retain for its own account any Dividends in respect of the Shares. (c) Payment of any Dividend in accordance with clause 16.4(a) may be effected through the Trustee, the Company, the Instalment Receipt Registrar, or, if this can be conveniently arranged, directly through the Share Registrar. (d) The payment of any Dividend to an Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder is at that Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder’s risk. (e) Money earned by the Company or the Trustee on the amount of a Dividend pending clearance of a cheque or other collection by an Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder shall be for the benefit of the Company or the Crown, as the case may be. (f) If, for any reason, the Trustee is prevented from making a payment as provided in this clause 16.4 or in the case of a non-cash Dividend, if there are no Reasonable Steps which can be taken under clause 16.1(b), the Trustee shall continue to hold the Dividend in question as a bare trustee for the Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder and shall take or continue to take (subject to clause 16.8) all Reasonable Steps to transfer or make available the Dividend to that Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder. (g) The Trustee is not responsible to any person for any neglect or default on the part of the Company in relation to any matter dealt with in this clause 16.4. (h) The Crown will procure that the payment of any Dividend to an Eligible Instalment Receipt Holder pursuant to this clause 16 is made at the same time as payment by the Company or the Share Registrar of the equivalent Dividend is made to holders of Shares. (i) The Trustee or other person making payment of any Dividend under clause 16.4(c) may make, and account to the relevant tax authorities for, any withholding payments required by law. 18. If the New Zealand IR Trustee does receive a Dividend (i.e. the Dividend is not paid directly by Meridian to the IR Holder) and the New Zealand IR Trustee is prevented for some reason from paying the Dividend on to the IR Holder, the New Zealand IR Trustee will hold the amount of the Dividend as bare trustee for the relevant IR Holder and must continue to take all reasonable steps to transfer or make available the Dividend to the IR Holder. 19. If the New Zealand IR Trustee receives payment of a Dividend after the Final Instalment Payment Date then: a) if the payment is attributable to a Share for which the Final Instalment has been paid by a cleared payment, the New Zealand IR Trustee will hold the Dividend as bare trustee for 7 the relevant IR Holder and must take all reasonable steps to transfer the Dividend to that IR Holder; or b) if the payment is attributable to a Share for which there has been a default in the payment of the Final Instalment, the Dividend is to be applied in or towards payment of the amounts due to the Crown. 20. IR Holders will not be able to elect for Dividends to be retained by Meridian or the New Zealand IR Trustee and applied towards payment of Final Instalment. Voting rights in respect of Shares 21. Each IR Holder will be invited to attend shareholder meetings of Meridian. However, until an IR Holder pays the Final Instalment and becomes registered as the holder of the underlying Shares, the IR Holder will not be entitled to vote the underlying Shares, directly, at such meetings (IR Holders will not be registered shareholders of Meridian in terms of the Companies Act 1993 or Meridian’s constitution). 22. For each meeting of Meridian’s shareholders prior to the Final Instalment Payment Date, the New Zealand IR Trustee will arrange for IR Holders to be sent a form inviting them to instruct the New Zealand IR Trustee as to the manner in which the votes attached to the underlying Shares are to be exercised by the New Zealand IR Trustee at that meeting. 23. The New Zealand IR Trustee has the power, and is required, to call for a poll on each resolution put to each meeting. If valid voting instructions are received within the specified time the New Zealand IR Trustee will vote the relevant Shares in accordance with the IR Holder’s instructions. The New Zealand IR Trustee will request a meeting of shareholders if requested to do so by persons holding such number of Instalment Receipts as would entitle them to request a meeting if they were shareholders. 24. The New Zealand IR Trustee will not have the right to exercise votes for any Shares for which it does not receive voting instructions, nor will it have the right to vote those Shares at its own discretion. 25. The right of an IR Holder to give voting instructions to the New Zealand IR Trustee, and the obligation of the New Zealand IR Trustee to act in accordance with those instructions, will be able to be suspended in certain circumstances, reflecting the ownership requirements under the Public Finance Act 1989 (more particularly described in section 4.3 of the current draft of the Offer Document). Payment of Final Instalment 26. Payment of the Final Instalment is due by IR Holders at 5pm on the Final Instalment Payment Date (expected to be approximately 18 months after the Allotment Date). Once payment of the Final Instalment is made, the New Zealand IR Trustee will transfer the underlying Share to the IR Holder within four business days of cleared payment being received by the Crown. On the transfer of the Share, the underlying security interest of the Crown will be extinguished and the relevant Instalment Receipt will be cancelled. IR Holders will then be entered onto Meridian’s shareholder register. The 8 Shares will then be traded on the ASX and NZX in place of the Instalment Receipts. Default in payment of Final Instalment 27. If the Final Instalment is not paid when due, the New Zealand IR Trustee will be required to sell the underlying Share pursuant to the Crown’s security interest and apply the proceeds in paying the Final Instalment on behalf of the IR Holder. Interest is payable by the IR Holder on the unpaid amount (being the Final Instalment, costs, expenses, taxes and other charges then owed) from the Final Instalment Payment Date. Any fees, costs, taxes, interest and similar charges are deducted from the sale proceeds with any surplus payable to the IR Holder. If the net proceeds are insufficient to pay the Final Instalment, then the New Zealand IR Trustee can recover the shortfall from the IR Holder on behalf of the Crown. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Arrangement is an “agreement for the sale and purchase of property or services” (as defined in s YA 1), and a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3. b) The Shares are each an excepted financial arrangement under s EW 5(13) and are part of that financial arrangement. c) Under s EW 6(2), any amounts that are solely attributable to the Shares will not be taken into account under the financial arrangements rules (as set out in Determination S24). d) For an IR Holder that is issued Instalment Receipts on the Allotment Date under the Offer and holds them until the Final Instalment Payment Date (Original IR Holder), the lowest price for s EW 32(3) is the applicable Final Price and no income or expenditure will arise under the financial arrangements rules in subpart EW. e) Any Dividend paid prior to the Final Instalment Payment Date will be taxable under s CD 1 as dividend income of the relevant IR Holder, provided that it is solely attributable to an “excepted financial arrangement” (as set out in Determination S24), and will not be taxable to the relevant IR Holder under ss CV 13 or HC 17. f) The transfer of legal title to the underlying Share to an IR Holder upon payment of the Final Instalment on the Final Instalment Payment Date will not give rise to income under any of ss CA 1(2), CB 1, CB 3, CB 4, or CB 5. g) For each IR Holder for whom a Share is revenue account property or “trading stock” (as that term is defined in s YA 1), the cost of that Share, upon its acquisition by the IR Holder on payment of the Final Instalment, for s DB 23 and s DB 49 respectively, is: i) in the case of an Original IR Holder, the aggregate of the First Instalment and the (applicable) Final Instalment paid by that Original IR Holder; and 9 ii) in the case of any other IR Holder, the aggregate of the amount paid by that IR Holder to acquire the Instalment Receipt to which that underlying Share relates from another IR Holder, and the Final Instalment paid by the IR Holder. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 19 September 2013 and ending on 19 September 2016. This Ruling is signed by me on the 19 th day of September 2013. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)

RBL sells its products through a chain of restaurants and provides a delivery service to its customers at some of these restaurants. RBL engages the services of delivery drivers to deliver its products to its customers from its Pizza Hut stores. 2. The relationship between the Delivery Drivers (owner drivers) and Pizza Hut are governed by the following documents:  The “Delivery Driver Contract” dated September 2012 which includes the following:  An outline of delivery driver payments (clause 7);  A form to compile the details of the driver, bank account, vehicle and motor insurance (schedule B); and  The driver uniform policy (schedule C);  The “Delivery Driver Handbook” dated November 2010 which incorporates the following:  The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements”; Page 2 of 8  The guideline on “Delivery Driver Duties”;  The “CHAMPS ” guidelines on dealing with a customer; and  The “Certification S5” which drivers are required to complete to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in the following areas:  Driver’s Role in CHAMPS;  Service Standards; and  Driver Safety & Security; and  The “Standard Practice Information” provided to Inland Revenue in prior rulings application. 2a) Changes to the terms of the Delivery Driver contract and the Delivery Driver Handbook (for example, with respect to payments) are communicated to Area Managers & Store Managers by the RBL Head Office by way of an email. This is in turn communicated to the Delivery Drivers verbally with reference to the e- mail received from RBL Head Office. No physical amendment is made to the Delivery Driver Contract entered into with each respective driver. Consequently, the Delivery Driver contract and the Delivery Driver Handbook has not changed from that previously provided to the Inland Revenue. 3. In some cases, in-store employees make home deliveries for Pizza Hut stores from time to time, while also carrying out employment duties in-store. These employees are contracted with RBL under employment contracts and are not remunerated separately for the delivery services performed. Terms of the Delivery Driver Contract 4. Under the terms of the Delivery Driver Contract the delivery driver agrees to: (a) use only the motor vehicles detailed in the Driver/Vehicle details as provided in Schedule B to the contract in the performance of the contract (clause 3.1(d)); (b) ensure the performance of the delivery services in a safe, proper and courteous manner in accordance with the guidelines provided in the Delivery Driver Handbook as varied from time to time (clause 3.1) (attention is drawn to any delivery driver guidelines issued by RBL from time to time); (c) be responsible for all costs and expenses of the driver’s business including the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining all delivery vehicles (clause 4.1(b)); (d) immediately refer any discrepancies on delivery with regards to collection of monies and delivery records to RBL (clause 5.1(a)); (e) at the end of each delivery period provide to RBL’s authorised representative:  a complete account and record in the format specified by RBL (clause 5.1(b)(i)); and Page 3 of 8  all monies collected by the delivery driver from customers of RBL during the course of that delivery period (clause 5.1(b)(ii)); (f) be responsible to account for any cheques, credit card slips or monies received on behalf of RBL as soon as possible and make good any shortfall (clause 5.1(c)); (g) be liable for, and indemnify RBL against, any liability, loss, claim or proceedings arising out of or relating to the use of the Contractor’s vehicles in the provision of delivery services (clause 8.1); (h) a minimum of Third Party Property Damage Liability Insurance in respect of the vehicle (clause 8.1(a)); (i) wear any uniforms provided by RBL and ensure their proper care and maintenance. A $30 deposit is retained out of the first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on return of the uniform in good conditions (fair wear and tear excepted) (clause 9.1); (j) provide a float of $20 for the purpose of making change during each delivery period (clause 9.2); (k) return upon request, clean and in good condition uniforms and delivery pouches. Failure to do so will entitle RBL to deduct the replacement cost from any monies owing to the delivery driver (clause 9.3); and (l) produce to RBL’s authorised representative documents that are necessary in the opinion of RBL to establish that the delivery driver has complied and continues to comply with their obligations under the contract (clause 10). 5. The delivery driver is not liable to take out any insurance or be responsible for loss or damage to the products delivered (as long as the loss or damage does not result from the delivery driver’s wilful default, negligence or breach of the Contract) (clause 8.3). 6. In terms of RBL’s obligations under the Delivery Driver Contract: (a) The engagement of the delivery driver does not commit RBL to a guarantee of any minimum remuneration (clause 1.2); (b) RBL also reserves the right to engage the services of other contractors (clause 1.3); (c) RBL agrees to pay the delivery driver:  for services on a per delivery basis an all inclusive payment of $5.50 per delivery including GST if any) (clause 7);  within 24 days of submission and approval of an invoice for services (clause 6.1); (d) RBL is not responsible for any vehicle damage sustained as a result of the delivery driver’s negligence or omission (clause 8); Page 4 of 8 (e) Products carried by the delivery driver shall be at the risk of RBL (clause 8.3); (f) The uniforms and delivery pouches remain the property of RBL (clause 9.3). 7. Under clause 1.2 either party may terminate the Delivery Driver Contract upon notice to the other party at the conclusion of any delivery. 8. The legal relationship between the delivery driver and RBL is described as that of “principal and independent contractor and not that of employer and employee” (clause 2.1). Delivery Driver Payments 9. Clause 7 of the guideline on “Delivery Driver Payments” states that the delivery drivers will be reimbursed at the current delivery payment rate per delivery, at a maximum of two deliveries per round trip. 10. In the case of a mistake and redelivery is required, the delivery driver will receive another delivery payment if the mistake was through no fault of their own. 11. The following are examples of delivery driver payments/reimbursements that are available. The delivery drivers receive payments/ reimbursements for:  redeliveries that have resulted through overdue order complaints, ;  redelivery due to wrongly supplied delivery details (e.g. wrong address/ phone number supplied by RBL to the delivery driver);  delivery of hoax orders or orders cancelled after the product has left the restaurant (the product must be returned to the restaurant);  redelivery due to miscellaneous circumstances outside the delivery driver’s control;  cost of phone calls made to customers or back to the restaurant from a payphone;  redelivery due to complaints received in relation to an incorrect pizza base/toppings or production of a pizza;  delivery of orders cancelled after they have left the unit;  drivers will only receive payments/reimbursement once there is a “Driver Activity Record” report signed by both the Driver and the Manager on Duty. 12. The delivery drivers do not receive payments/ reimbursements for:  three or more home deliveries per delivery round, RBL policy is a maximum of two,  complaints indicating driver’s mishandling of the order (e.g. pizza has been dropped by the delivery driver), Page 5 of 8  redelivery due to the delivery driver not finding the address where the original delivery details are correct (where possible delivery drivers are required to call from a pay phone to clarify the delivery details),  cost of cell phone calls to the customer or back to the restaurant,  redelivery due to missing items off the order (e.g. missing garlic bread). \[It is the delivery driver’s responsibility to check that they have the entire order before leaving the restaurant\],  transporting stock between stores, stock transfers are the shift manager’s responsibility, and not the delivery driver’s responsibility,  Deliveries done if there is no “Driver Activity Record” report signed by the Driver and the Manager on Duty for the night worked 13. Delivery drivers are not guaranteed any minimum per hour delivery payment. Uniform Requirements 14. Clause 9 of the Delivery Driver Contract sets out the uniform requirements for delivery drivers to adhere to health regulations and Pizza Huts professional standards. Key points of the requirements are listed below:  Delivery drivers are required to wear the uniforms provided by the Company and shall ensure their proper care and maintenance;  A $30 deposit will be retained from the delivery drivers first payment and will be returned on the return of the uniform in good condition (fair wear and tear accepted);  Failure by the contractor to do so will entitle the Company to deduct the replacement or repair costs from any monies owing the Contractor at the time of termination of the Agreement, in addition to any other legal remedies that may be available to the Company. Notice of Taxation Requirements 15. The “Contract Delivery Drivers Notice of Taxation Requirements” is a guide contained in the Delivery Driver Handbook which states that:  The delivery driver is not an employee of RBL;  The delivery driver should seek independent taxation advice to understand their rights and obligations;  PAYE will not be deducted from payments for deliveries;  The gross values of all payments received by the delivery driver for deliveries must be included in the delivery driver’s annual income tax return;  The delivery driver must calculate and pay their earner premium at the end of the year when they file their tax return;  The delivery driver may be liable to pay provisional tax; and  The delivery driver must register for GST if the delivery driver has income of $60,000 or more. Page 6 of 8 Delivery Driver Duties 16. The guidelines on “Delivery Driver Duties” have suggestions for the manner in which deliveries are to be made, handling customer complaints, and what to do in the event of emergencies. CHAMPS – guidelines on dealing with a customer 17. The CHAMPS guidelines on dealing with a customer includes a problem solving method and actions to take when certain scenarios arise (e.g., if the order has missing items). Certification S5 – Serving Delivery Customers 17a) The delivery drivers are required to complete and pass this certification to demonstrate their skills and knowledge in the following areas (a) Driver’s Role in CHAMPS (b) Service Standards (c) Driver Safety & Security Any questions that are incorrect are re-done by the drivers and are re-marked by the trainers until the correct answer is recorded and understood by the incumbent delivery driver. (A copy of the Certification S5 has been provided for information purposes) Standard Practice Information 18. The delivery drivers are not:  entitled to overtime or sick pay;  required to belong to any union;  able to supervise employees of RBL;  able to access RBL’s administration or support services, however they do have access to staff toilets and product discounts;  advertising for work nor do they have their own client base, however there is no restriction for them doing this. 19. Also, the delivery drivers:  are able to decide the hours they work (provided work is expected to be available). It is standard practice that the delivery drivers make themselves available for rostered hours;  provide their own vehicles and associated equipment;  are free to work for another principal;  must hold an appropriate drivers’ license. 20. RBL trains the delivery drivers as to the manner in which deliveries are made. The delivery drivers are instructed as to what geographical area they will work in. Page 7 of 8 21. RBL employees take orders over the phone and decide the delivery sequence of the orders. A maximum of two orders can be delivered at any one time (to ensure quality control of the product). 22. From time to time RBL may pay at its discretion the delivery drivers a minimum of two deliveries per hour during certain hours, in order to ensure minimum coverage for RBL during quiet periods. 23. Although the delivery driver may find his or her own replacement driver, in practice this does not happen and generally another delivery driver is used by RBL. 24. RBL is currently reviewing the implementation of an incentive scheme, which will apply only to certain delivery drivers for maintaining delivery standards and will not be offered to in-store drivers or employees. The incentive payments are not contractually guaranteed and are not part of an ongoing arrangement. Relationship between RBL’s employees (employed under a different contract) and delivery drivers 25. In certain cases employees of RBL may, from time to time, be required to perform delivery services. Where this is the case, the employees also do other tasks (i.e. making the pizzas, cleaning etc). In contrast, delivery drivers are contracted purely to deliver pizzas and are not asked to perform other tasks. 26. No other collateral contracts, agreements, terms or conditions, written or otherwise, have a bearing on the conclusions reached in this Ruling. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: (a) The terms of the relevant documents entered into by RBL and the delivery driver is exactly the same as those provided to the Inland Revenue in the Ruling application dated 8 December 2009, except in relation to the following clauses of the Delivery Driver Contract (dated September 2012) where the basic uniform and hygiene requirements, number of days or dollar amounts (as appropriate) may vary from time to time:  Clause 6, which states that RBL agrees to pay the delivery drivers within 24 days of submission of an invoice.  Clause 7, which states the rate per delivery as a gross amount of $5.50 per delivery.  Clause 9, which specifies the current uniform requirements.  Clause 9.1, which states that a $30 deposit will be retained out of the delivery driver’s first payment, to be returned to the delivery driver on the return of the uniform in good condition;  Clause 9.2, which provides that a float of $20 be carried by the delivery driver; Page 8 of 8 (b) RBL will provide the delivery drivers with the notice of taxation requirements at the commencement of the contract and advise the delivery drivers that as independent contractors they are required to comply with their own income tax, GST and ACC obligations. (c) The actual relationship between RBL and the delivery driver is, and will continue to be during the period this Ruling applies, in accordance with the terms of the relevant documents in all material respects. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any assumption or condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  For the purposes of sections BD 2, DA 1 and DA 2(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007, payments made by RBL to the delivery driver are not “income from employment” as defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, so the driver is not prevented from claiming deductions under these sections by reason only that the driver earns “income from employment”; and  For the purposes of the GST Act, the provision of services by the driver to RBL will not be excluded from the definition of “taxable activity” in section 6 of the GST Act by section 6(3)(b) of that Act as they are not made under “contracts of service”. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 26 October 2013 until 26 October 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on 25 February 2014.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 14/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Minister of State Owned Enterprises and the Minister of Finance, in their capacity as holders of all of the issued shares in Genesis Energy Limited (Genesis) on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand (the Crown). Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CC 3. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax consequences (if any) arising from the sale or disposition of any Shares acquired under the Arrangement. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the transfer of fully paid ordinary shares in Genesis (the Shares, which include IPO Shares and the Loyalty Bonus Shares each as defined below) by the Crown to New Zealand Applicants pursuant to an Investment Statement and a Prospectus relating to the Initial Public Offering (IPO) of Ordinary Shares in Genesis (the Offer Documents). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. Genesis is a New Zealand incorporated company. Genesis commenced operations in 1999, when the Crown separated Electricity Corporation of New Zealand into three state-owned enterprises. Genesis produces electricity, using its power station assets and has a 31% interest in the Kupe oil and gas field. Genesis sells electricity, gas and LPG to retail and business customers through two retail brands. 2. All shares in Genesis are currently held by the Crown. The Crown is intending to sell up to 49% of the ordinary Shares in Genesis under the IPO. 3. The purchase price payable to the Crown for each Share under the IPO will be determined under a front-end book-build process. Application will be made to list all of the Shares in Genesis on the Australian and New Zealand stock exchanges. 4. New Zealand Applicants under the Retail Offer will acquire Shares from the Crown under the IPO (the IPO Shares) on the date of completion of the IPO (the Allotment Date) pursuant to the terms of the IPO. New Zealand Applicants who continue to hold those IPO shares in the same registered name for a period of 12 months will be entitled to be transferred additional Genesis shares from the Crown (the Loyalty Bonus Shares) based upon a ratio of one Loyalty Bonus Share for every 15 IPO Shares held by that New Zealand Applicant, up to a maximum of 2,000 Loyalty Bonus Shares. 2 5. In submitting an application form for IPO Shares, New Zealand Applicants under the Retail Offer are automatically applying for Loyalty Bonus Shares to which they may become entitled under the terms of the Offer Document. 6. The date upon which the Loyalty Bonus Shares will be allotted to eligible New Zealand Applicants is intended to be within 5 business days from 12 months after the Allotment Date (Measurement Date). 7. New Zealand Applicants pay the same amount per share as all other purchasers under the IPO. This amount (the Final Price) is payable on completion of the Offer. No further consideration (in addition to the price paid by New Zealand Applicants when applying for their Shares) is payable by New Zealand Applicants who receive Loyalty Bonus Shares. There is no partial refund to New Zealand Applicants if they do not receive the Loyalty Bonus Shares. 8. The Prospectus contains the following statement: For the purposes of the financial arrangement rules, the Crown confirms that the Final Price is the lowest price it would have accepted for the Shares on the basis of payment in full on the Allotment Date. 9. No promise to hold the IPO Shares for the required period of time is given by the New Zealand Applicants; they are free to dispose of their IPO Shares at any time. The recipients of the Loyalty Bonus Shares are determined solely by reference to those of the New Zealand Applicants who have held their IPO Shares until the Measurement Date. The Crown promises to transfer one Loyalty Bonus Share to a New Zealand Applicant on a future date for each 15 IPO Shares that the New Zealand Applicant held continuously until the Measurement Date, up to a maximum of 2,000 Loyalty Bonus Shares, with that value determined based on the Final Price. 10. A New Zealand Applicant is defined in the Offer Document as an applicant who provides, in conjunction with their application to acquire Shares, a New Zealand IRD number, a New Zealand bank account, a New Zealand address and a declaration that the applicant is:  in the case of an individual, a New Zealand citizen or permanent resident; or  in the case of a New Zealand incorporated company, incorporated in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficial owners are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or  in the case of a trust, established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficiaries are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents; or  in the case of any other legal entity, it is incorporated or established in New Zealand and the majority of its ultimate beneficial owners, beneficiaries or members are New Zealand citizens or permanent residents. 11. The documents describing the Arrangement are the Investment Statement dated 13 March 2014 and the Prospectus dated 13 March 2014. 3 How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: (a) The New Zealand Applicants will not derive income under s CC 3 as a result of acquiring Loyalty Bonus Shares under the Genesis Energy Limited Initial Public Offering. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 13 March 2014 and ending on 13 March 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of March 2014. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 14/03 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Bank of New Zealand (BNZ). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of: (a) ss BG 1, CC 7, EW 15, EW 31, GA 1, RE 1 to RE 6, RE 10, RF 1, RF 2, RF 3 and RF 4; and (b) ss 86F and 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (SCDA). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is a product (TotalMoney) that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may only be individuals, companies or trusts. TotalMoney involves the creation of new types of accounts that must be in a group of accounts, and the facility to elect to group up to 10 of these new types of accounts (potentially increasing to 25 during 2014) into one or more groups to either "pool" or "offset" the account balances. "Pooling" involves the aggregation of account credit balances to determine the tiered interest rate that will apply to the calculation and crediting of interest to each account balance. "Offsetting" involves the aggregation of account balances to calculate the amount of interest debited to a lending facility account balance. The Arrangement is set out in the documents listed below, copies of which were received by the Taxpayer Rulings Unit, Inland Revenue, on 13 December 2013:  Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Personal and Sole Trader Customers;  Terms and Conditions for your Bank of New Zealand TotalMoney Account for Companies and Trusts;  Bank of New Zealand Home Loan Facility Master Agreement; 2  Bank of New Zealand Facility Master Agreement;  Letter of Advice - TotalMoney Home Loan;  Letter of Advice - TotalMoney Business Term Loan; and  Confirmation of New Terms and Conditions (for customers converting to TotalMoney). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in paragraphs 1 to 30 below. 1. TotalMoney is a package of accounts and loans that BNZ offers to its customers. These customers may only be individuals, companies or trusts. 2. Customers, in general, have a range of accounts with BNZ, including transaction accounts, savings accounts and various loan accounts. Loan accounts may only be table, non-table, tailored, principal and interest, interest only, fixed or floating home loan accounts, or business loan accounts. 3. Interest under a TotalMoney loan account cannot be capitalised, for example, because of a "mortgage holiday". TotalMoney allows customers to group or aggregate these accounts to either "pool" or "offset" the account balances. Primary features of TotalMoney 4. The primary features of TotalMoney are the "pooling" and "offsetting" features. These features operate in the manner described below. Pooling (a) The pooling aspect of TotalMoney can operate when several transaction accounts with credit balances exist. Interest on these credit balance accounts is calculated and paid based on the cumulative credit balance of all transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the pooling feature. Interest-bearing accounts usually attract interest based on interest rate brackets that apply to the balance of each relevant individual account. (b) The cumulative credit balance is calculated so BNZ can ascertain the relevant interest rate tier applicable to the relevant accounts. The separate funds are not actually transferred to one account before the interest is calculated. BNZ calculates interest at the applicable interest rate tier that applies to the accumulated balance. Offsetting (a) With the offset feature of TotalMoney, interest on a lending facility or facilities within the group is calculated and paid by the customer on the difference between the lending facility balances and the credit balances of transaction accounts in the group that are nominated for the offset feature. Under the terms and conditions agreed between BNZ and its customers for TotalMoney, BNZ pays no interest on the credit balances that are "offset" against the lending facility. 3 (b) The "offsetting" is only to calculate the balance of the lending facility or facilities on which interest is payable or, where the credit balances nominated for the "offset" feature exceed the balance of the lending facility, the balance of the credit balances on which interest is receivable. There is no actual transfer of funds, no set-off or netting of funds together in an account, and no transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. 5. Every transaction account in a TotalMoney group must be selected to either "pool" or "offset". That is, customers can choose whether some or all of their transaction accounts with credit balances are "pooled" (in which case BNZ will pay interest to those accounts) or "offset" against the product lending facility. By default, all accounts will be set to the "offset" feature unless changed to "pooled" (by the customer or BNZ on the customer's instructions), except where the customer has no loan account (in which case the customer's TotalMoney accounts will automatically "pool"). 6. TotalMoney does not provide a facility for existing accounts. TotalMoney involves the creation of a new type of account. To participate in TotalMoney, a customer must open specific TotalMoney accounts that are particular to the TotalMoney product. Customers may convert an existing non-TotalMoney transaction or savings account that they have with BNZ to a new TotalMoney account. However, the customer must agree that the existing terms and conditions applying to those accounts cease to apply and are replaced by the TotalMoney Terms and Conditions. 7. For TotalMoney accounts, the customer can select either to "offset" or "pool" (and to change between) at any time and for any period. Pooling - further detail 8. BNZ has a contractual obligation to pay interest to each transaction account with a credit balance participating in the pooling feature, based on the applicable interest rate tier applying to the total cumulative balance of all accounts being "pooled". Following usual business practice, BNZ makes a separate determination for withholding tax on each interest payment made to each account. 9. The benefit of the "pooling" feature for customers is that they can earn more interest by combining smaller balances and reaching higher interest- rate tiers and still maintain their money in separate accounts for separate purposes. The customer may consider this an advantageous way to manage their money. 10. Account owners have full deposit and withdrawal access to their transaction accounts. Overdraft facilities may be available for these accounts. However, any overdraft balance is ignored for "pooling" purposes. BNZ charges debit interest on the overdrawn balance of any account. The overdrawn balance does not reduce the "pooled" balance of the credit balance accounts when BNZ is calculating interest for those accounts. 4 Offsetting - further detail 11. Where one loan account is in the group, the interest payable on the loan account is calculated on the balance of the loan account less the credit balances of accounts set to the "offset" feature. This will be the case as a matter of law (in terms of TotalMoney documentation) and as a matter of practice (in terms of BNZ's computer system). There is no actual set-off, netting, or transfer of funds, or transfer of any interest in or entitlement to funds. "Offsetting" occurs before debit or credit interest is calculated. 12. For example, in the case of a loan account that would otherwise be the same as a standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years with a "minimum payment", there will be no provision for the amount of interest saved under "offsetting" to reduce the "minimum payment". The effect of "offsetting" is the same as a decrease in the floating interest rate and a decision not to reduce the amount of the "minimum payment". In either case, the term of the loan is reduced because the principal portion of the payment is effectively increased. In the case of a non-table loan, interest payments will be reduced by "offsetting", principal repayments will not change, and the loan term will not reduce. 13. Where there is more than one loan account in the group, the loan accounts in the group are given a default priority, namely, the oldest loan account in the group will receive the highest priority. However, the customer may elect two or more of those loan accounts to be prioritised for "offsetting" purposes. The loan account with the highest priority will receive the benefit of "offsetting" first. It is only where the credit balances of transaction accounts set to offset exceed the balance of that highest priority loan account that the next highest priority loan account balance is offset, and so on. 14. If the total credit balances of the transaction accounts set to "offset" are greater than the total debit balance of the loan accounts, credit interest will be applied to the difference and paid on a prorated basis to the credit balance accounts (essentially in line with the "pooling" feature of TotalMoney). 15. BNZ calculates interest daily. If, during a month, BNZ has both an entitlement to receive interest (that is, the balance of participating loan accounts exceeds the balance of all transaction accounts set to the offset feature) and, at another point in the month, BNZ has an obligation to pay interest (that is, the balance of transaction accounts set to offset exceeds the balance of the relevant loan accounts), then the two interest payments are made and are not set-off. 16. The "offsetting" feature of TotalMoney essentially offers the same benefits to customers as those offered by a revolving credit loan (such as BNZ's "Rapid Repay" product) in terms of lower interest costs and a shorter time to repay the loan. However, this feature overcomes a primary perceived disadvantage of a revolving credit loan because it allows customers to retain separate account balances (which customers may prefer when managing their finances). 17. Where a customer has a TotalMoney loan account, this account must be grouped with at least one TotalMoney transaction account. 5 18. No arrangement must exist between the customers who have grouped their accounts that provides for the loan account owner(s) to make a payment(s) to the transaction account owner(s) in consideration for the transaction account owner(s) electing the "offset" feature of TotalMoney. Business purposes 19. When TotalMoney was established, customers were contractually prohibited from using TotalMoney for business purposes. BNZ has now removed the prohibition on the business use of TotalMoney. BNZ extended the availability of TotalMoney to business customers to give them the same tools for managing their financial affairs as it gives to personal customers. 20. Under the terms and conditions applicable to TotalMoney, customers are able to use TotalMoney accounts for business purposes, which means that customers are able to group business and non-business product accounts. This means that a sole trader, for example, is able to group their business and non-business accounts. Terms and Conditions for the TotalMoney home loan products 21. Each of BNZ's home loans is explained in a collection of documents. These documents include primarily a Home Loan Facility Master Agreement (which is a standard form master document that contains generic provisions that apply to all BNZ home loan facilities) and a Letter of Advice for Home Loans (which contains particular and specific provisions for the home loan facility being made available to the customer and overrides the Loan Facility Master Agreement in case of any inconsistencies). The Letter of Advice is produced from a computer system that contains a master list of possible provisions that can apply to BNZ's home loans. Under this system, the provisions applicable to a particular home loan are selected, collated and produced in a document. 22. The TotalMoney product home loans are also documented in a Home Loan Facility Master Agreement and Letter of Advice for Home Loans. Customers may also enter into another Letter of Advice if they want to be able to redraw amounts that they have repaid under a fixed home loan at a later stage. The Home Loan Facility Master Agreement is the standard document that applies to all BNZ home loans. The Letter of Advice for Home Loans has only minor differences from the Letter of Advice for other loans, primarily relating to branding (that is, the name BNZ has given to this particular form of home loan) and the interest calculation for the variable rate components of the home loan (to account for the "offset" feature of TotalMoney). 23. Table loans provide for regular payments and a set date when the loan will be paid off. Most payments early in the loan term comprise interest, while most of the payments later in the term comprise repayments of the principal. Non-table loans have two separate repayments, one of interest and one of principal. Customers repay the same amount of principal each time and interest is charged separately. 24. The documentation for a TotalMoney standard variable rate table home loan facility over 20 years will largely be the same as that for current BNZ home loan facilities that are standard variable rate table home loans over 20 years. The only differences are: branding (the name on the Letter of 6 Advice), the interest calculation (which provides for the effect of the "offset") and, in relation to table loans, the provision stating that where the loan has the benefit of the "offset" to reduce the interest cost, the "minimum payment" specified for the loan will not decrease because of any interest savings but instead the loan term will reduce. Under a non- table loan, any interest saving (whether as a result of a reduction in the applicable interest rate because of a general decrease in interest rates or because of the offset feature) would result in either a reduction of the interest repayment or a reduction in the loan term (if the original repayment amount is maintained despite the interest saving). In relation to a TotalMoney product home loan that is a table home loan, a reduction is only allowed in the loan term. Terms and conditions for TotalMoney business loan products 25. Each of BNZ’s business loans is also documented under a collection of documents. These include primarily the Loan Facility Master Agreement (a standard form "Master" document that contains primarily generic provisions that apply to BNZ’s business loan facilities) and a Business Term Loan Letter of Advice (which contains particular and specific provisions for the loan facility that is being made available to a TotalMoney business customer and overrides the Loan Facility Master Agreement in case of any inconsistencies). 26. Any variations between the different versions of the Business Term Loan Letter of Advice and the Loan Facility Master Agreement primarily relate to branding (the name given by BNZ to this particular form of loan) and the interest calculation for the variable rate components of a business loan (to account for the "offset" feature of the product). Apart from these differences, the provisions are the standard provisions that apply to BNZ’s other business loans; for example: table, non-table, tailored, interest only, and so on. Groups 27. TotalMoney is based on a group of participating accounts. Groups can comprise only one of the following categories: (a) Natural persons: (i) The accounts of an individual, or the individual and joint accounts of married, de facto, and civil union couples, and any of their children may be combined as part of one group of accounts. (ii) For example, the various accounts of one natural person, Jane, or the various accounts (individual or joint) of Jane and her husband, John, and their child, Joe. The group is not limited to residents of New Zealand, although the group may not include both residents and non-residents. (b) One company or one trust: (i) Multiple accounts of one company (including a qualifying company or look through company) or one trust may be combined as a group of accounts. Only one entity can be in a group at any time. 7 (ii) Accounts of different entities (including the entity and any related individual) cannot be pooled or offset. 28. Accounts may only be included in one group. An individual may have accounts in three groups, through membership in one as an individual customer, the second as a joint customer and in the third as a sole trader. A group may not include more than one sole trader’s accounts. 29. A customer may be a resident or non-resident of New Zealand for tax purposes. However, where a group of accounts consists of accounts owned by more than one legal person, BNZ will obtain representations from the owners of those accounts that they do not have different tax residence status. That is, where more than one legal person is participating in a group of accounts, either all persons must be residents of New Zealand for tax purposes or all persons must be non-residents of New Zealand for tax purposes. BNZ's objectives 30. BNZ's objectives in providing TotalMoney are to: (a) increase its market share, particularly for home loans and transaction-type accounts; (b) increase the proportion of its home loans that are charged variable interest rates; (c) increase customer satisfaction and customer retention; and (d) improve its brand awareness and be seen as a market leader. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: (a) All interest rates related to the TotalMoney product are arm’s length market interest rates. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicant and the Arrangement as follows: Financial arrangements rules (a) When a credit balance of a transaction account and a debit balance of a loan account are "offset", there is no amount of consideration paid or payable because of that "offset" for the calculation of income and expenditure under ss EW 15 and EW 31 of the "financial arrangements rules" (as defined in s EW 1(2)). Resident Withholding Tax (RWT), Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) and Approved Issuer Levy (AIL) (b) Under the "pooling" feature of TotalMoney: 8 (i) RWT (as defined in s YA 1) and NRWT (as defined in s YA 1) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in ss RE 1(1) and YA 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in ss RF 1(1) and YA 1); (ii) For an account that is a "registered security" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA), "approved issuer levy" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an "approved issuer" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) for the interest credited to that account pursuant to s 86I of the SCDA. (c) Under the "offsetting" feature of TotalMoney: (i) There is no payment of or entitlement to "interest" (as defined in s YA 1) for the credit balances of participating transaction accounts in a group, and no obligation to deduct RWT or NRWT or to pay AIL, except to the extent that the combined credit balance of those accounts exceeds the combined debit balance of the lending facility accounts. (ii) To the extent that interest is credited to participating transaction accounts in a group: o RWT (as defined in s YA 1) and NRWT (as defined in s YA 1) must be deducted by BNZ from the interest credited to the participating transaction accounts in a group in accordance with the RWT rules (as defined in ss RE 1(1) and YA 1) and the NRWT rules (as defined in ss RF 1(1) and YA 1); o For an account that is a "registered security" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA), "approved issuer levy" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) may be paid by an "approved issuer" (as defined in s 86F of the SCDA) for the interest credited to that account pursuant to ss 86F and 86I of the SCDA. Section CC 7 (d) No income arises under s CC 7 for BNZ or its customers in relation to the Arrangement. Section BG 1 (e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2014 and ending on 31 March 2018. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31 st day of March, 2014. Bill Acton Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 14/04 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by:  The Scales Consolidated Tax Group  Scales Corporation Ltd Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CD 22 and s BG 1. This Ruling does not consider or rule on the tax effects set out in paragraph 60. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is an intra-group restructure of the Scales Consolidated Tax Group (Scales Group). The Arrangement involves a transfer of certain property- owning companies to a new holding company, George H Investments Ltd (GHI). Scales Corporation Ltd (SCL) will then distribute the shares in GHI, along with surplus cash, to its shareholders in an off-market share repurchase and cancellation (so that GHI is a sister company to the existing holding company). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. 1. SCL has identified property assets and shares that are considered surplus to the ongoing requirements of the Scales Group. The Arrangement has the following 3 purposes:  The Arrangement will be undertaken to allow the capital represented by these surplus property assets and shares to be returned to current SCL shareholders. The assets identified are various land and buildings and a 10.3% shareholding in Turners & Growers Ltd (T&G).  The Arrangement will be undertaken because the Scales Group considers that the risk of ownership of these surplus property assets and shares could complicate a possible initial public offering (IPO).  The Arrangement will be undertaken because separating the core operating divisions of the Scales Group from other property and investment interests (not required in the operating divisions) will enable SCL to focus on the growth and development of the core operating divisions while GHI focuses on managing its property and other investments. The Scales Group considers this will maximise value, with any proceeds from asset realisations by GHI and GHI’s newly acquired subsidiaries expected to be returned to shareholders as the relevant assets are realised. 2 Current Scales Group structure 2. Figure 1 in the Appendix sets out the current structure of the Scales Group. 3. All of the wholly-owned New Zealand companies, in Figure 1 in Appendix 1, are members of the Scales Group, except for Scales Property Development Ltd (SPDL) and Cashreal Properties Ltd (in liquidation). However, SPDL is wholly owned by Scales Holdings Ltd (SHL), which is a member of the Scales Group. Summary of Arrangement 4. The following will occur before the distribution of GHI shares by SCL to its shareholders:  Some of the assets (being real property) that are surplus to the ongoing requirements of the Scales Group have been, or will be, sold to third parties. These sales are expected to raise about $9.3 million. Two further properties will be sold to other Scales Group companies.  Several options have been entered into to enable members of the Scales Group to acquire properties from GHI’s newly acquired subsidiaries (for a fixed price based on their market value), until 31 December 2015.  GHI will purchase: o various intra-group loans; and o the shares in Tiger Ventures Ltd (TVL), SPDL, Silverstream Industrial Park Ltd (SIPL), and Whakatu Property Management Ltd (WPML).  The proceeds from the above transactions will be paid between Scales Group members as dividends or loan repayments.  There will be a 2 to 1 share split of all SCL shares issued (currently 39,864,002 shares). 5. The above share split will be followed by an off-market pro rata repurchase and cancellation of 50% of SCL’s shares on issue in exchange for cash consideration (27 cents per share and $10.8 million in total) and one share in GHI for each SCL share (the demerger). The cash paid to shareholders will be sourced from the sales of the surplus properties. 6. The restructuring referred to above and how the demerger will occur are explained in more detail in paragraphs 7 to 57. Pre demerger restructuring George H Investments Ltd 7. GHI was incorporated on 5 December 2013. GHI will be part of the Scales Group from that date (although it may leave the Scales Group on an IPO). SCL will hold 100% of the shares in GHI until the demerger. 3 8. SCL will capitalise GHI with up to $52.6 million of new capital. SCL will fund the capitalisation of GHI by issuing GHI with assignable promissory notes for the amount of the capital. The capital may be less than $52.6 million, with GHI obtaining external debt funding to cover the difference, if it should be necessary to reduce the value of GHI so the total distribution to shareholders, on the share repurchase and cancellation, does not exceed the available subscribed capital of SCL. In this event, SCL expects to repay its borrowings (being working capital facilities provided by a third-party bank) by an equivalent amount. The Scales Group does not expect GHI’s external debt funding, used to reduce the value of GHI, will exceed $4 million. Whakatu Property Management Ltd 9. WPML owns land in Hawke’s Bay (the Whakatu Industrial Park), one lot of which it is planning to subdivide into seven sections during 2014. WPML expects to apply for resource consent, to subdivide this land, in April 2014 and to complete this subdivision by December 2014. 10. WPML’s parent entity Whakatu Coldstores Ltd (WCS) uses part of the Whakatu Industrial Park as part of its cold store business (lot 3). WPML will sell lot 3 to WCS at its market value (about $2.1 million) before the demerger. Title in that land will transfer to WCS in 2014 immediately on the completion of the subdivision. WCS will fund this purchase from its available working capital, including (as necessary) its bank working capital facility. 11. Until 31 December 2015, WCS will hold an option to acquire a second lot in the Whakatu Industrial Park (lot 12) from WPML for $370,000 (which is the market value of this lot). The option ensures WCS can acquire this land if it becomes required for its business before 31 December 2015. 12. WPML sold three further sections (Wool Scours) to a third party in December 2013 for a total of $2.2 million. The sale proceeds are being held in a trust account until title to these sections is issued. 13. The balance of the land in Whakatu Industrial Park is considered surplus to the Scales Group ownership requirements and will be retained in WPML when that entity is sold to GHI. The value of this land is expected to be about $9.6 million. 14. WPML has already sold a property in Dunedin to a third party. The property is leased to a Scales Group entity, Meateor Foods Ltd, for use in its business activities. This land was sold at market value ($1.7 million). 15. The above transactions and land holdings of WPML are summarised in the following table: 4 Value ($m) Status WCS lot 3 2.1 To be sold Meateor, Dunedin 1.7 Sold Wool Scours 2.2 Sold Residual land 9.6 Holding 16. WPML’s parent entity, WCS, has an outstanding intercompany balance with WPML for about $5.5 million. After the above transactions, WCS will repay this amount to WPML. This outstanding intercompany balance is money lent after WPML and WCS were both part of the Scales Group. Further, WPML and WCS will remain in the Scales Group when WCS repays this loan to WPML. 17. The funds received from these land sales (about $4.3 million), along with the funds received from WCS (about $5.5 million, being repayment of the intercompany loan), plus some accumulated gains of about $0.5 million will be paid as a dividend (about $10.3 million), to WCS, before the demerger. Scales Property Development Ltd 18. SPDL owns land in Hawke’s Bay (Groome Place), part of which a Scales Group entity, Mr Apple Ltd, uses as part of its business activities. 19. In 2014, SPDL is planning to subdivide lot 5 Groome Place into five sections. SPDL expects to apply for resource consent, to subdivide this land, in March 2014. SPDL expects that the subdivision will be complete by December 2014. Until 31 December 2015, Mr Apple Ltd will lease two of these sections from SPDL on market terms. During this period, Mr Apple Ltd will also have an option to acquire either or both of these sections for $760,000 and $635,000 (the respective current market values of each section). 20. SPDL will retain the land SPDL owns when the entity is sold to GHI. This residual land’s value will be about $5.2 million. 21. The above land holdings, by SPDL, are summarised in the following table: Value ($m) Status Residual land 5.2 Holding Silverstream Industrial Park Ltd 22. SIPL owns industrial land and buildings in Mosgiel (Silverstream Industrial Park). 23. This land is considered surplus to the Scales Group’s requirements. SIPL has subdivided and sold a portion of this land to a third party for $5.4 million. The settlement proceeds were temporarily advanced to another Scales Group entity, Polarcold Stores Ltd (PCL), which will repay them to SIPL. 5 24. The balance of the land in Silverstream Industrial Park will be retained by SIPL and held for future sale. This residual land’s value will be about $12.5 million. 25. PCL owns a piece of bare land in Hornby, Christchurch (Canada Crescent), that is considered surplus to the Scales Group’s requirements. SIPL will purchase this land before the demerger at the land’s current market value (about $2.3 million). Until 31 December 2015, PCL will hold an option to reacquire this land from SIPL for $2.3 million (which is the market value of this land). This option ensures PCL can reacquire this land if it becomes required for its business before 31 December 2015. 26. The above transactions and land holdings by SIPL are summarised in the following table: Value ($m) Status Mosgiel 5.4 Sold Canada Crescent 2.3 To be purchased Residual land (excluding above) 12.5 Holding 27. The net funds received from the above transactions (about $3.1 million), plus some accumulated gains of about $0.4 million, will be paid as a dividend (about $3.5 million), to PCL before the demerger. Tiger Ventures Ltd 28. TVL is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SCL. TVL was incorporated for the purpose of purchasing shares in Turners and Growers Ltd (T&G). TVL owns a 10.3% shareholding in T&G. These shares are the only asset TVL holds. TVL funded the purchase of shares in T&G through a loan from SCL. This loan is TVL’s only liability. 29. The market value of TVL’s shares in T&G (based on T&G’s NZX trading price) is now less than the amount of the loan SCL advanced to TVL to fund the purchase. However, the combined shareholding may have an additional strategic value (which is difficult to value). As explained in paragraph 30, the consideration for the transfer of this loan, from SCL to GHI, will be the face value of the loan (the amount owing, which is about $22.9 million). George H Investments Ltd purchases shares in various companies, and loans, from members of the Scales Group 30. Following the above transactions, GHI will acquire the following assets from the Scales Group:  In relation to TVL: o the shares in TVL, from SCL, for $1; and o a loan TVL owes to SCL, from SCL, for the amount owing of about $22.9 million.  In relation to SPDL: o the shares in SPDL, from SHL, for about $0.5 million; and o a loan SPDL owes to WCS, from WCS, for the amount owing of about $4.9 million.  In relation to SIPL: 6 o the shares in SIPL, from PCL, for about $0.2 million; and o a loan SIPL owes to PCL, from PCL, for the amount owing of about $13.3 million.  In relation to WPML: o the shares in WPML, from WCS, for about $8.7 million. 31. All of the above loans are interest free, repayable on demand, and in New Zealand currency. Further, after the sale of the above loans to GHI, their terms will not change and these loans will remain fully repayable. No portion of these loans will be remitted either before or after GHI acquires these loans. 32. GHI will fund the above purchases by assigning the promissory notes SCL issued to it (up to $52.6 million in total). The recipients of these notes will use them to fund their transactions under the Arrangement (together with funds raised from selling properties to third parties and available working capital). The promissory notes are all finally paid or distributed to SCL under the Arrangement, at which point they will be cancelled (because SCL will be both the holder and the issuer of the notes). Cash used to pay further dividends and repay another intra-group loan 33. After the above transactions, the Scales Group will pay further dividends and repay another intra-group loan with the cash received from the above transactions and the previous dividends (as detailed above). Whakatu Coldstores Ltd 34. WCS will pay a dividend to PCL of approximately $16.3 million funded by the dividend received from WPML ($10.3 million), the sale of WPML shares ($8.7 million) and the SPDL loan ($4.9 million). Polarcold Stores Ltd 35. PCL has a loan liability to SCL of $32.8 million as the result of various advances. PCL will repay this loan and pay a dividend of $2.8 million to SHL, a total of $35.6 million, which the above transactions will fund. 36. PCL (the borrower) and SCL (the lender) have been in the Scales Group for the whole term of the above loan. PCL and SCL will remain in the Scales Group when PCL repays this loan to SCL. Scales Holdings Ltd 37. SHL will pay a dividend to its parent SCL of about $3.3 million funded by the sale of SPDL shares ($0.5 million) and the dividend from PCL ($2.8 million). 38. Figure 2 in the Appendix summarises the funding flows under the Arrangement. Scales Corporation Ltd undertakes a demerger of the GHI group 39. SCL will then undertake the demerger of the new GHI group, from SCL, as explained below. 40. Before the return of capital, under the demerger, SCL will carry out a 2 to 1 share split of all SCL shares issued (currently 39,864,002 shares). 7 41. The demerger of the GHI group will then occur by way of a mandatory pro-rata buy back and cancellation by SCL of 50% of its shares. The shares will be cancelled wholly and not in part. 42. For every one SCL share cancelled, SCL shareholders will receive one GHI share (estimated value $1.36) and $0.27 cash (being solely the proceeds of the sale of assets identified as surplus to the Scales Group’s requirements under the Arrangement). 43. The share repurchase and cancellation will allow capital represented by assets identified as surplus to requirements to be returned to SCL shareholders ahead of a possible IPO of SCL. If an IPO occurs, its primary purpose will be to allow existing shareholders access to an easily accessible market to increase the transferability of their shares. No plans exist to issue new shares if an IPO does not proceed. Any such potential share issue is not part of the Arrangement. 44. The return of capital is not intended to be a substitute for, or to replace, the payment of a dividend. 45. The total cash payment to SCL’s shareholders on the share repurchase will be about $10.9 million and the total value of the GHI shares will be not more than $52.7 million. 46. Initially, SCL’s and GHI’s shares will be stapled. No decision has been made about when the shares might be de-stapled, except that if an IPO occurs, a de-stapling would occur at that point. Structure of the Scales Group after Arrangement 47. Figure 3 in the Appendix shows the structure of the Scales Group after the Arrangement. Available subscribed capital of Scales Corporation Ltd 48. The available subscribed capital of SCL was $63.6 million as at 31 March 2013 (at a minimum) and will be maintained at least at that level until the demerger. Dividend history of Scales Corporation Ltd 49. Previous dividends SCL paid are shown in the following table: Date Amount of dividend ($) December 2007 1,885,637 December 2008 2,157,025 November 2009 3,370,352 June 2013 8,107,668 50. Dividends were not paid between 2010 and 2012 because of financial pressure in this period. Instead profit was used to retire debt. 51. The Scales Group was sold to its current ownership group on 21 July 2011. Since then the group's financial position has improved such that the group could pay its first dividend since 2009 in June 2013. 52. The Scales Group does not have a formal dividend policy. However the Scales Group intends to pay the following dividends: 8  a final dividend for the 2013 calendar year of $8 million; and  a further dividend in the following year subject to the financial position of the Scales Group. 53. The company has historically maintained and is committed to re- establishing consistent dividend payments in the future. Retained earnings balances of Scales Corporation Ltd and the Scales Group 54. The balances of retained earnings for SCL, SPDL and the Scales Group are set in paragraphs 55 to 57. 55. The balance of retained earnings of SCL are shown in the following table (brackets indicate negative balances): Date Level of retained earnings ($) 30 June 2009 (29,446,704) 30 June 2010 (23,168,048) 30 June 2011 (18,553,390) 31 December 2011 (22,988,518) 31 December 2012 (34,179,727) 56. The balance of the retained earnings of SPDL is shown in the following table (brackets indicate negative balances): Date Level of retained earnings ($) 30 June 2010 0 30 June 2011 (6) 31 December 2011 141,631 31 December 2012 (386,308) 57. The balance of the retained earnings of the Scales Group (on a consolidated basis) is shown in the following table: Date Level of retained earnings ($) 30 June 2009 53,065,421 30 June 2010 50,752,877 30 June 2011 66,604,876 31 December 2011 59,993,342 (restated) 31 December 2012 71,022,206 Subsequent plans after the demerger 58. Initially, none of the companies will leave the Scales Group. 59. GHI and GHI’s subsidiaries (after the demerger) will progressively dispose of their assets to optimise value for the GHI shareholders. GHI’s subsidiaries will repay the loans owed to GHI as funds are available and then be liquidated or amalgamated. These post-demerger transactions are not part of the Arrangement. 9 Tax effects of the Arrangement 60. The Applicants consider that the tax effects of the Arrangement are as follows: a) All shares being transferred under the Arrangement are held on capital account by the transferors. They will also be held on capital account by the transferees. No income will arise, from the transfer of these shares, under s CA 1. b) In relation to the subdivision of Whakatu Industrial Park into seven sections by WPML:  The land (Whakatu Industrial Park Land) was purchased in 1995 and was not acquired for the purpose of disposal.  The land is held on capital account and no income will arise, under s CA 1, from the sale of this land.  Section CB 12 does not apply to the disposal of any of this land, because the land has been held for more than 10 years.  Section CB 13 does not apply to the disposal of any of this land, because the subdivision of land will not involve significant expenditure. c) In relation to the sale, of lot 3 Whakatu Industrial Park, by WPML to WCS:  The sale price will be at market value.  WPML will derive depreciation recovery income, of about $188,000, from the sale under subpart EE. This income will be excluded income under ss FM 8 and CX 60.  WCS will be treated as having acquired the property on the date it was acquired by WPML for its cost to WPML and to have been allowed deductions of the depreciation loss that WPML has been allowed for the property under s FM 15.  The expected sale price of $2.054 million will generate an associated party capital gain of $1.020 million. Under s CD 44(10B), this amount will not be included in WPML’s capital gain amount for the purposes of the “available capital distribution” formula in s CD 44.  Any income derived from the sale of lot 3 to WCS would be excluded income to WPML under ss FM 8 and CX 60. d) In relation to the sale of the three sections (referred to in the Arrangement as the Wool Scours) by WPML, to unrelated parties, WPML will derive depreciation recovery income, of about $10,000, under subpart EE. This land is held on capital account, and no other income will arise from the sale of this land. e) In relation to the sale of the Meateor, Dunedin, site by WPML to a third party:  The sale is complete and settlement occurred on 31 October 2013.  This land was held on capital account and no income arose under s CA 1.  WPML derived depreciation recovery income of about $180,000 under subpart EE. 10 f) In relation to the land, held by SPDL, at Groome Place, Hawke’s Bay:  This land was acquired in June 2011 (from Mr Apple Ltd and WCS).  This land is held on revenue account, because SPDL carried on a business of property development when this land was acquired (and the land has been held for less than 10 years). Therefore, income will arise under s CA 1 for SIPL from any sale of this land.  The sale proceeds of any of this land in the future will be income under s CB 10(1).  Mr Apple Ltd has options, which will expire on 31 December 2015, to acquire either or both of two sections. If these options are exercised, the amount SPDL receives will be income under s CB 10(1). g) In relation to the sale of the land and buildings in Mosgiel (Silverstream Industrial Park) by SIPL to third parties:  This land was acquired in August 2008.  This land is held on revenue account because SIPL was associated with a property developer when the land was acquired. Therefore, income will arise under s CA 1 for SIPL from any sale of this land.  The gain on sale of this land will be about $500,000. This gain on sale will be taxable under s CB 10(2).  SIPL will derive depreciation recovery income of about $80,000 under subpart EE. h) In relation to the sale of land at Canada Crescent, Christchurch, by PCL to SIPL:  The sale price will be at market value.  This land is, and will continue to be, held on capital account. Therefore, any sale proceeds will not be income under s CA 1.  There are no buildings or other depreciable property. Therefore, PCL will not derive any depreciation recovery income on the disposal of this land under subpart EE.  PCL will have an option, which will expire on 31 December 2015, to buy back the land for $2.3 million (which is its market value). i) The loans GHI will purchase are excepted financial arrangements for the lenders under s EW 5(10). Therefore, on the purchase of the loans by GHI, the lenders are not required to calculate a base price adjustment under s EW 29. The borrowers remain liable under those loans, so are not required to calculate a base price adjustment under s EW 29. j) The sale of shares (in SIPL, WPML, TVL and SPDL) to GHI is on capital account. Therefore, no income arises from the disposal of those shares under s CA 1. If any income were to arise, then that income would be excluded income under ss FM 8 and CX 60. 11 k) SCL’s shareholders will be treated as disposing of their shares when SCL repurchases them under its pro rata buy back and cancellation. Consequently, any shareholder who hold their SCL shares on revenue account will derive net income from the repurchase equal to the difference between the repurchase proceeds they receive and the cost of the shares that are repurchased from them. Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) All SCL shares cancelled as part of the Arrangement will be ordinary shares of the same class issued by SCL, and the shares will each be cancelled in whole, not in part. b) A “market value circumstance” (as defined in s YA 1) will not exist at the time of the share cancellation. c) The aggregate of the amount payable, plus the market value of the GHI shares distributable, by SCL to its shareholders on account of the share cancellation will be less than the available subscribed capital of SCL. d) The aggregate of the amount payable, plus the verifiable market value of the GHI shares distributable by SCL to its shareholders on account of the share cancellation will be at least 15% of the market value of all ordinary shares SCL issues at the time of the share cancellation being notified to SCL’s shareholders. e) SCL will continue to pay dividends after the capital reduction provided the financial performance of the Scales Group allows this. f) All transactions in the Arrangement will be for market value and on arm’s length terms with the possible exception of the purchase, by GHI, of the loan owned by TVL to SCL. In particular, any amount paid for or allocated to the sale of depreciable property under the Arrangement is equal to the market value of that depreciable property on the date of sale. g) All of the companies in the Scales Group and SPDL are solvent, both in terms of their liquidity and balance sheet, except for TVL, which may be insolvent. h) No material tax effects arise from the Arrangement other than those described in paragraph 60. i) The Scales Group and SPDL will file its tax returns materially in accordance with the tax effects described in paragraph 60. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the conditions stated above and the qualification set out under “Taxation Laws”, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The entire amount distributed to SCL shareholders upon the pro-rata buy- back and cancellation of shares by SCL under the Arrangement is excluded from being a “dividend” (as defined in subpart CD) by s CD 22 of the Income Tax Act 2007. b) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 January 2014 and ending on 31 December 2015. 12 This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of March 2014.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 14/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by ProCare Health Limited (PHL). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CB 4, CD 1 and CD 8. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the issue by ProCare Health Limited (PHL) PHL of two tranches of new shares to its existing shareholders on 15 October 2012, and the redemption of one of the tranches issued to existing shareholders. A further two tranches of shares may also be issued by PHL, to the ProCare Charitable Foundation (the Trust). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. The parties to the Arrangement 1. PHL was incorporated in New Zealand in 1995 and provides management and clinical services to its subsidiaries. One of PHL's subsidiaries is a Primary Health Organisation, which is contracted by the Auckland regional Health Boards to provide primary healthcare services to patients in the Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waitemata District Health Board domiciles. PHL also has two commercial subsidiaries that provide medical services. 2. PHL had 389 shareholders as of 15 October 2012 (as at 15 November 2013, it had 379 shareholders), each being a general practitioner (GP) contracted to PHL. It is currently not mandatory for contracted GPs to hold a share in PHL, and as at the date of this ruling there are approximately 400 GPs currently contracted to PHL who are not shareholders. 3. The Trust was established on 17 July 2012 with PHL as the Settlor. Under the Procare Charitable Foundation Trust Deed, the Trust has the purpose of promoting the health and wellbeing of disadvantaged communities across the Greater Auckland Region and, to that end, the Trust is authorised to provide grants and funding and develop programmes. The Trust is registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005. Background to the Arrangement 4. It is currently proposed that PHL will introduce a mandatory shareholding requirement for contracted GPs. It is hoped that the introduction of mandatory shareholding will increase the engagement of contracted GPs with the organisation, and that it will provide all contracted GPs with the ability to participate in PHL's governance. Other means by which PHL might increase the participation of contracted GPs and operate more effectively to promote the health and wellbeing of people within the Greater Auckland Region are also being considered. 5. In the event that mandatory shareholding is introduced, PHL will need to issue new ordinary shares to contracted GPs who are not currently shareholders. In anticipation of the introduction of mandatory shareholding, PHL has undergone a capital restructure to return value to its existing shareholders, and has established the Trust. PHL has obtained over 90% shareholder approval for the proposed restructure. Steps involved in the Arrangement 6. The steps involved in the Arrangement are: (a) The issue by PHL to all existing shareholders on 15 October 2012 of two tranches of non-voting redeemable preference shares (RPS), being: (i) a fully imputed taxable bonus issue, as defined in s YA 1, subparagraph (b) (Tranche 1); and (ii) a non-taxable bonus issue as defined in s YA 1 (Tranche 2). (b) The redemption and cancellation off-market by PHL of the Tranche 2 shares at face value (in aggregate, approximately $2.5 million). 7. It is anticipated that the Arrangement will incorporate the following additional steps: (a) The issue by PHL of a small number of non-voting B shares to the Trust (Tranche 3). (b) The fully imputed taxable bonus issue, as defined in s YA 1, subparagraph (b), by PHL of non-voting B shares to the Trust (Tranche 4). 2 8. The steps involved in the overall Arrangement (including the issue of the Tranche 3 and Tranche 4 shares) are summarised in the following diagram: Further details of the Arrangement 9. In issuing and redeeming the shares, PHL has, and will be acting pursuant to the Constitution of PHL. Clause 2.1 of the Constitution provides: Shares on adoption: Upon or following adoption of this constitution, the Company will have the following classes of share on issue: a. Ordinary Shares; b. Redeemable preference Shares; and c. B Shares. 10. Pursuant to clause 2.1 of the Constitution, PHL may issue different classes of shares, including shares that: a. Are redeemable within the meaning of section 68 of the Act; b. Confer preferential rights to receive distributions of capital or income; c. Confer special, limited or condition voting rights; or d. Do not confer voting rights. 11. Clause 2.5 of the Constitution provides: Redemption of Shares: The Company may exercise an option to redeem redeemable Shares issued by the Company in relation to one or more holders of redeemable Shares. 12. The Tranche 1 shares are non-voting and do not carry any "shareholder decision-making rights" (as defined in s YA 1). The Tranche 1 shares will pay dividends of approximately 7.5% per annum. PHL has elected to treat the Tranche 1 shares as a dividend pursuant to s CD 8(2). PHL does not 3 intend to redeem the Tranche 1 shares in the foreseeable future. 13. The Tranche 2 shares are non-voting and do not carry any "shareholder decision-making rights" (as defined in s YA 1). The Tranche 2 shares have a face value approximate to that of the Tranche 1 shares. The Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 shares have been issued on near identical terms, but PHL has elected to treat them as shares of different classes. PHL has not, and will not, elect to treat the Tranche 2 shares as a dividend. 14. PHL has redeemed and cancelled the Tranche 2 shares. The amount paid by PHL for the redemption and cancellation exceeded the available subscribed capital of the class under the ordering rule. 15. The Tranche 3 shares and Tranche 4 shares, if issued to the Trust, will be B shares. These shares will be non-voting and will not carry any "shareholder decision-making rights" (as defined in s YA 1). The B shares will not be able to be traded, and will be expected to pay dividends in the future. The total value of such B shares is expected to be approximately $2.5 million. If the Tranche 3 and Tranche 4 shares are issued, PHL will elect to treat the Tranche 4 shares as a dividend pursuant to s CD 8(2). 16. If the Tranche 3 shares are issued then at the time the Tranche 3 shares are issued, the Trustees of the Trust will not be shareholders of PHL or associated with the shareholders of PHL. PHL will issue these shares only in order to benefit the Trust and to enable it to carry out its charitable activities. 17. Following the steps outlined in paragraphs 6 and (if implemented) 7 above, it is anticipated that PHL will undertake further changes to its operating and business ownership structure and PHL currently proposes that contracted GPs who are not existing shareholders of PHL will be required to subscribe for an ordinary share (with the subscription amount expected to be approximately $500 per share). These further changes are not part of the Arrangement (and this ruling does not apply to these further changes). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Tranche 1 shares are a dividend and consequently income of the shareholders under s CD 1. b) The Tranche 2 shares are not a dividend and consequently will not be income of the shareholders under s CD 1. c) The payment PHL makes to the shareholders for the redemption and cancellation of the Tranche 2 shares was a dividend and consequently income of the shareholders under s CD 1. d) If any shareholder is treated under s CB 4 as having derived income as a result of the payment PHL makes to him or her for the redemption and cancellation of the Tranche 2 shares, the income of the shareholder under s CB 4 will be zero as a result of s CD 53(2). e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. 4 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 October 2012 and ending on 1 October 2015. This Ruling is signed by me on 20 th day of June 2014. Dinesh Gupta Manager (Taxpayer Rulings) 5

Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Parties to the Arrangement 1. The parties to the Arrangement are:  PMP Distribution, a wholly owned subsidiary of PMP (NZ) Limited, which operates in the print media industry; and  Supervisors, who are people who are or are to be contracted by PMP Distribution to provide certain supervisory services throughout New Zealand in relation to the delivery of unaddressed mail. 2.

Deliverers are people who physically deliver the unaddressed mail from drop-off locations to households and other premises throughout New Zealand. Delivery of circulars 3. The circular deliveries that are supervised by the Supervisors under the Contract are not items the carriage of which requires PMP Distribution to be registered as a postal operator under the Postal Services Act 1998, and PMP Distribution will not register as such. 2 Meaning of terms in the contract 4. The Supervisors are engaged under the Contract between PMP Distribution and the Supervisors. 5. Within the Contract, defined terms and their meanings are:  “Contractor”, which means the same as “Supervisor”;  “Distributor”, which means the deliverer of circulars and is equivalent to and interchangeable with the term “Deliverer”;  the “Manual”, which means the Supervisors’ instructions published by PMP Distribution; and  the “Company”, which means PMP Distribution. 6.

Payment 9. Under the heading Payment, the Contract provides that PMP Distribution will pay Supervisors monthly in arrears. The basis for the calculation of the payment to Supervisors is the quantity of each job, as shown on the Supervisor worksheet for the distribution supervised by the Supervisor. Schedule 2 specifies the fees PMP Distribution is to pay the Supervisors. 10. All payments the Supervisor receives are gross payments, and the Supervisor is solely responsible for its own accident compensation levies, income tax liabilities, and GST liability under the Income Tax Act, the GST Act and the Accident Compensation Act 2001. 11. PMP Distribution may be required to withhold statutory deductions from the payments; if so, the payment made will be reduced to the extent that the payment is withheld. 3 Liability and claims 12. Under the heading Liability and Claims, the Contract states that the Supervisor will be responsible for all errors, omissions, loss or damage that are its responsibility having regard to standards of service and compliance with the Manual as required by PMP Distribution. This means PMP Distribution will not be liable to the Supervisor (or any other person) for any loss resulting from the Supervisor’s deliberate actions or negligence or where there is a breach of any term of this contract or the Manual. 13. The Supervisor must take out insurance to indemnify PMP Distribution against any damage or loss arising from the Supervisor’s actions or relating to the services that the Supervisor will provide. Motor vehicle, telephone, office and storage facilities 14. Under the heading Motor Vehicle, Telephone, Office and Storage Facilities, the Contract states that the Supervisors are responsible for providing their own equipment (such as personal office supplies, a telephone, a vehicle and wet weather gear) at their own expense.

Under the heading Relief Supervisor, the Contract provides that the Supervisor shall appoint a Relief Supervisor to temporarily undertake the obligations of the Contractor if the Supervisor is unable to work. An appointment of a Relief Supervisor by the Supervisor must be approved in writing by PMP Distribution. The Supervisor is solely responsible for payment and all other obligations to others who help them in this way. Termination 16. Under the heading Termination, the Contract states that PMP Distribution or the Supervisor may terminate the Contract for any reasons whatsoever by giving four weeks’ notice in writing. However, if PMP Distribution believes a serious breach of the Contract has occurred, then PMP Distribution may terminate the Contract immediately by written notice. Term 17. Under the heading Term, the Contract provides that the Agreement shall commence from the commencement date until terminated in accordance with the conditions in the termination section of the Contract. Relationship 18. Under the heading Relationship, the Contract defines the contractor’s status as follows:  The Supervisor is an independent contracting party and not an agent or employee of PMP Distribution.  The terms of the Contract or its operation do not create an employment relationship between the Supervisor and PMP Distribution. Conflict of Interest 19. Under the heading Conflict of Interest, a Supervisor may accept other engagements or work while engaged by PMP Distribution unless there is a conflict of interest. 4 General 20. Under the heading General, the Contract provides a process of resolving any dispute or conflict that arises. Three schedules 21.

The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 December 2013 and ending on 30 November 2017.

The Body Corporate is the body corporate for the Property. The Body Corporate is not registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Body Corporate insured the Building with an insurer, Zurich Australian Insurance Ltd trading as Zurich New Zealand (Insurer), for periods on the terms, conditions, and limitations in policy number 99 2783578 ISR (Insurance Policies). The Insurer is resident in New Zealand for GST purposes and the supply of the Insurance Policies to the Body Corporate was charged with tax under s 8(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The Body Corporate (not each Owner) is named in the Insurance Policies as the insured party. 2 2. The Earthquakes caused material damage to the Building and other improvements at the Property and resulted in loss of rents for the owners of the units. 3. The Body Corporate made a claim under one of the Insurance Policies in respect of the material damage to the Building and other improvements at the Property and loss of rents (Claim). The Body Corporate negotiated a settlement of the Claim with the Insurer on 12 September 2013 (Settlement Agreement). Under the Settlement Agreement the Insurer agreed to pay the Body Corporate an amount (including GST, if any) in full and final settlement of the Claim and any other existing or future liability of the Insurer under the Insurance Policies or otherwise in relation to loss, damage, or liability arising from the Earthquakes. 4. The Body Corporate was required to apply money received under the Insurance Policies in or towards the reinstatement of the Building unless it decided otherwise by special resolution at a general meeting (s 136(4) of the Unit Titles Act 2010). On 26 July 2013, the Body Corporate resolved:  not to reinstate the Building; and  to distribute the material damage portion of the Insurance Payment (net of costs) to Owners in accordance with their ownership interests in the Property. 5. The majority of the Owners are registered under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 6. The Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery had previously given notice of intention to compulsorily acquire the Property under s 54 of the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act 2011 (see the New Zealand Gazette, No 26, 7 March 2013 at 714). The Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority (CERA) established by the State Sector (Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority) Order 2011 reached agreement with the majority of the Owners to acquire their units. Settlement of the purchase by CERA of 113 of these units has now been completed. 7. CERA and the Owners agreed that the purchase price to be paid by the CERA to each Owner would broadly be calculated based on the current market value of the Owner’s unit or units on an as–repaired basis less the amount distributed to each Owner under the Resolution. Diagram of the Arrangement 8. The following diagram summarises how the Arrangement operates: Insurer Body Corporate Each Owner Insurance Payment Share of Distribution 3 How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Insurance Payment made by the Insurer to the Body Corporate under the Settlement Agreement is not a payment that has been received by a GST registered Owner for the purposes of s 5(13). b) A Distribution by the Body Corporate to a GST registered Owner is not a payment received by a GST registered Owner under a contract of insurance for the purposes of s 5(13). c) A Distribution by the Body Corporate to a GST registered Owner is not consideration for a taxable supply made by the Owner to the Body Corporate for the purposes of s 8. d) A Distribution by the Body Corporate to a GST registered Owner is not consideration for a taxable supply made by the Owner to the CERA for the purposes of s 8. e) Section 76 does not apply. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 30 May 2014 and ending on 30 May 2017.

These requirements include (but are not limited to):  refusing to register the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities;  treating the transfer of any PIE Capital Securities as void (ab initio or from such other date as Rabo Capital may decide in its complete discretion) (clause 3(i)(ii) of the PIE Conditions);  de eming any PIE Capital Securities held that would result in any holder (or where the holder is a nominee their beneficial owner) exceeding the maximum holding that an investor may hold in Rabo Capital in order for it to meet the PIE eligibility requirements in the Act, to be held by the holder of the PIE Capital Securities on trust for any member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and allowing such member full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities, including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clause 3(i)(ii) of the PIE Conditions);  allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to request any holder (or any person associated with that holder) of PIE Capital Securities to provide such information or evidence as it may require to determine 5 whether Rabo Capital is eligible or continues to be eligible as a PIE and qualify as a listed PIE and, where holders do not provide such information within specified time periods, deeming that such holder’s (or where the holder is a nominee, such beneficial owner’s) PIE Capital Securities are held on trust for a member of the Rabobank Group appointed by Rabo Capital and such member of the Rabobank Group shall have full powers of direction in relation to those PIE Capital Securities including when, how and to whom they may be transferred (clauses 3(i)(iii) and (iv) of the PIE Conditions);  allowing Rabo Capital or the Registrar to take any of the steps in clause 3(i)(v) of the PIE Conditions to ensure that any breach of the PIE regime “investor interest size” requirement is remedied within the period required by the Act. PIE Capital Securities 11 Rabo Capital offered PIE Capital Securities with a face value of $1 each to the public in New Zealand for $1 per security. The minimum holding amount is $5,000. The offer which opened on 27 April 2009 and closed on 22 May 2009, was available to retail and institutional investors. Rabobank Nederland acquired 5,000 PIE Capital Securities on 5 February 2010. 12 On 25 May 2009 Rabo Capital accepted a total of $280 million in applications. 13 Rabo Capital has entered into a Listing Agreement with NZX for the PIE Capital Securities to be quoted on the NZDX (the debt security market operated by NZX). Although the PIE Capital Securities are not debt securities for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978, NZX Regulation has given certain rulings and waivers from the NZDX Listing Rules in relation to the listing of the PIE Capital Securities on the NZDX. 14 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual non-cumulative non-voting preference shares of Rabo Capital and shall at all time rank pari passu and without any preference among themselves (clause 4(a) of the PIE Conditions). They are direct, unsecured and subordinated obligations of Rabo Capital and are not guaranteed by Rabobank Nederland or any other person. 15 Dividends are paid on the PIE Capital Securities quarterly in arrears on the “Initial Rate Dividend Payment Date”, with the first dividend payment date occurred on 18 June 2009 (clause 5(c) of the PIE Conditions). 16 The dividend amount is the amount of cash payable to holders of PIE Capital Securities on the relevant dividend payment date. The dividend amount for each dividend period from 18 June 2009 to 18 June 2019 is calculated as follows: face value x dividend rate x (1-t) 4 Where “t” is the weighted basic rate of New Zealand corporate income tax expressed as a percentage applicable to Rabo Capital (currently 28 percent) during the period ending on the relevant dividend payment date. 6 The “dividend rate” used to calculate the dividend amount will be as follows: (a) for the first 10 years, the initial rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the benchmark rate (the five-year swap rate), which will be reset after five years; and (b) thereafter, the floating rate, which is equal to the sum of the margin and the three-month bank bill rate, which is reset quarterly. 17 The Investment Statement contains the following statement, relating to dividends payable on the PIE Capital Securities (at page 6): Dividend: The PIE Capital Securities will pay a non-cumulative dividend. Dividend Amounts are scheduled to be paid quarterly on each 18 March, 18 June, 18 September and 18 December. The Dividend Amount is the cash component of the dividend and is a proportion of the amount calculated using the Dividend Rate. Dividend Amounts payable on the PIE Capital Securities will be paid to the person registered as the Holder on the relevant Record Date (including in relation to the first Dividend Amount payable). Initial Dividend Rate: The initial Dividend Rate will be set for an initial period of approximately 5 years from the Issue Date to 18 June 2014 at the greater of:  the Minimum Initial Rate, which is 8% per annum; and  the Benchmark Rate on 25 May 2009 plus the Margin. Dividend Rate reset: The Dividend Rate will be reset for a further 5 years on 18 June 2014 at the prevailing Benchmark Rate plus the Margin. From 18 June 2019 the Dividend Rate will reset quarterly, at the 90 day bank bill rate plus the Margin. 18 On 25 May 2009 the dividend rate for the period until 18 June 2014, incorporating the margin (which has been set at 3.75 percent per annum) and the swap rate, was set at 8.7864 percent per annum. 19 On 19 June 2014 the dividend rate for the period until 17 June 2019, incorporating the margin (which has been set at 3.75% per annum) and the swap rate was set at 8.3425 percent per annum. 20 Rabo Capital attaches imputation credits to distributions made to holders of PIE Capital Securities to the maximum extent permitted by the imputation credits available. At the current corporate income tax rate of 28 percent, this would be a maximum of 28/72 of the dividend amount. The Investment Statement contains the following statement (at page 11) – note that the corporate tax rate was 30 percent in 2009: Imputation Credits The Issuer will attach imputation credits to Dividend Amounts to the extent permitted by the imputation credits that the directors of the Issuer determine are available. It is expected that dividends will have imputation credits fully attached to a Dividend Amount (30/70th of the Dividend Amount assuming a corporate tax rate of 30%). If the Issuer does not fully impute a Dividend Amount, this may trigger an Exchange Event and the PIE Capital Securities 7 may, at the Issuer's option, exchange into the Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. Alternatively, the Issuer may, at its discretion, put in place an arrangement to reimburse Holders who are adversely affected by the dividends not being fully imputed. Underlying Securities 21 Rabo Capital used the funds raised from the issue of PIE Capital Securities to invest in Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland on or about the issue date of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying Securities are interest-bearing, unsecured, perpetual, non-cumulative subordinated bonds. The principal amount of the Underlying Securities is equal to the subscription amount of the PIE Capital Securities. The Underlying Securities will have terms conforming substantially to the terms of the PIE Capital Securities. However, the Underlying Securities constitute bonds paying interest rather than shares paying imputed dividends. The Underlying Securities will be the only material asset of Rabo Capital and at least 90 percent of the income Rabo Capital will derive from interest from its investment in the Underlying Securities. 22 Rabobank Nederland uses the funds raised from the issue of Underlying Securities for its banking business. The funds are not being raised specifically for the purposes of Rabobank Nederland’s New Zealand branch (“NZ Branch”), although Rabobank Nederland may “on-lend” some of the funds raised to NZ Branch. 23 Interest received by Rabo Capital on the Underlying Securities will constitute assessable income for Rabo Capital. 24 Rabo Capital will receive credits in its imputation account for New Zealand tax paid. Termination of Arrangement 25 The PIE Capital Securities are perpetual securities that have no scheduled repayment date, but the PIE Capital Securities will be redeemed in the following circumstances (among others). The circumstances are set out in clause 8 of the PIE Conditions and are: (a) if Rabo Capital exercises the option contained in clause 8(c) of the PIE Conditions on the “First Call Date” which is specified as being 18 June 2019 or on any dividend payment date thereafter; (b) if, as a result of a Netherlands tax law change, there is more than an insubstantial risk that additional amounts are payable under the Underlying Securities or interest payable on the Underlying Securities would not be deductible to Rabobank Nederland for Netherlands tax purposes and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (c) if the Dutch Central Bank notifies Rabo Capital that the PIE Capital Securities may not be included in consolidated Tier 1 Capital of the Rabobank Group and Rabo Capital elects to redeem the PIE Capital Securities; (d) where the Underlying Securities are redeemed; or 8 (e) on the occurrence of certain “Exchange Events” the PIE Capital Securities may be, at the option of Rabo Capital either cancelled and exchanged for Underlying Securities with a face value equal to the face value of the PIE Capital Securities or redeemed. The types of circumstances that would constitute an “Exchange Event” are described in the “Definitions” section of the PIE Conditions and summarised in the Investment Statement as follows (at page 12): Exchange Events On the occurrence of certain events (each an “Exchange Event”) the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, exchange into the Underlying Securities issued by Rabobank Nederland or be redeemed. The Exchange Events are: (a) if the Dutch Central Bank requires that all PIE Capital Securities must be issued directly by Rabobank Nederland; or (b) an Insolvency Event in relation to the Issuer or Rabobank Nederland; or (c) a default by the Issuer for more than 30 days in the payment of Dividend Amounts or Redemption Amounts (other than relating to an administrative error) in respect of any of the PIE Capital Securities; or (d) any of the following events that the Issuer determines in its absolute discretion is an Exchange Event; (i) an Increased Costs Event; or (ii) any Tax Law Change which has or is expected to have the effect that the anticipated tax outcomes for the Issuer or for Holders as at the Issue Date are adversely affected (as determined by the Issuer); or (iii) the Issuer does not impute a Dividend Amount at the maximum imputation ratio under the Tax Act and an arrangement is not in place, or in the Issuer's opinion is not expected to be in place, within 90 Business Days of the relevant Dividend Payment Date to fully reimburse Holders who are adversely affected; or (iv) the New Zealand Inland Revenue Department has indicated that it will not provide or renew a satisfactory binding ruling or rulings (as determined by the Issuer) confirming the anticipated tax implications of the transaction for the Issuer and the Holders. Upon the occurrence of an Exchange Event, Holders of the PIE Capital Securities may, at the option of the Issuer, receive Underlying Securities in a principal amount equal to the Redemption Amount of each Holder's PIE Capital Securities at the relevant time or have their PIE Capital Securities redeemed. Prior to the distribution to Holders of the Underlying Securities or redemption, any Outstanding Amounts and any surplus amounts (after accounting for the Outstanding Amounts and the distribution of the Underlying Securities) held by the Issuer will be paid out pro rata to Holders. Administration Costs 26 Rabo Capital pays Rabobank Nederland an administration fee for administration services provided by Rabobank Nederland. The administration does exceed an arm’s length amount. 27 The New Zealand branch of Rabobank Nederland (“NZ Branch”) provided a liquidity facility to Rabo Capital pursuant to which Rabo Capital may request advances of up to NZ$10 million from NZ Branch. Any interest paid by Rabo Capital to NZ Branch pursuant to the liquidity facility will be on arm’s length terms or, if not on arm’s length terms, on terms that are 9 in favour of Rabo Capital. It is expected that money from this funding facility will only be used to pay tax or other expenses of Rabo Capital if it has insufficient available funds before receiving income under the Underlying Securities. There is no intention on the part of the Board of Directors of Rabo Capital and/or the Supervisory Board of Rabobank Nederland that Rabo Capital, Rabobank Nederland and/or NZ Branch would be paid any of the income that should otherwise be paid to the holders of PIE Capital Securities. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) This Product Ruling will cease to apply if the Binding Private Ruling (BR Prv 14/38) issued in respect of the Rabo Capital PIE regime Arrangement no longer applies or Rabo Capital ceases to be eligible to be a PIE and a listed PIE. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Applicants and the Arrangement as follows:  Distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to Holders constitute excluded income of a New Zealand tax resident Holder who is a natural person or a trustee and who does not include the amount as income in their return of income for the income year, pursuant to section CX 56C(1) of the Act.  Where section CX 56C(1) does not apply, distributions or dividends made by Rabo Capital to Holders under the PIE Capital Securities constitute excluded income of a Holder to the extent to which the amount of the distribution or dividend is more than the amount that is fully credited as described in section CD 43(26) of the Act.  Section GB 35 (streaming) does not apply to the Arrangement.  Section BG 1 and section GA 1 (tax avoidance) do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 July 2014 and ending on 30 June 2019. This Ruling is signed by me on the 25 th day of August 2014. John Trezise Investigations Manager
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 14/10 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by New Zealand Income Guarantee Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CA 1, CD 3 – CD 21, CW 4, CX 56B, HM 31, HM 34–HM 55 and YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies 1. The Arrangement is the Lifetime Income product, which is a retirement product that provides a fund to invest accumulated KiwiSaver funds in return for a stream of regular payments over Investors’ retirement lifetime. The payments will be set at a percentage of the Protected Income Base, being the original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and including any increase in value during the Investor’s Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) and will be made:  first, out of the capital invested by an Investor in the Lifetime Income Fund and the Investor’s proportion of the Fund’s post-tax earnings accumulated as a result of investing the original capital sum and;  second, from a life insurance policy or policies purchased by the Fund for the benefit of each individual Investor. 2. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background 3. The parties to the Arrangement are:  The Lifetime Income Fund (the Fund). This is a unit trust registered under the Unit Trusts Act 1960. The Fund comprises two separate portfolios: the Balanced Portfolio and the Cash Portfolio. All investment activities are carried out through the Balanced Portfolio. The Fund’s commitments are met from the Cash Portfolio. The trustee is the Public Trustee and the Custodian of the Fund is Public Trust and its bare trust nominee Public Trust (NZIG) Nominees Limited. The Fund will elect to be a portfolio investment entity (PIE) in accordance with s HM 71. The Fund will receive investments from members of the public.  New Zealand Income Guarantee Limited (NZIG). NZIG is a New Zealand incorporated company. NZIG is the parent company of the NZIG group and is 100% owner of Lifetime Asset Management 2 Limited (LAM) and Lifetime Income Limited (LIL). NZIG will undertake general management for the group, including solvency and capital management.  Lifetime Asset Management Limited (LAM). LAM is a wholly owned subsidiary of NZIG and is a New Zealand incorporated company. LAM’s function is to operate as an investment manager and as the manager of the Fund. It is the issuer and promoter of the Lifetime Income Fund for the purposes of the Securities Act 1978.  Lifetime Income Limited (LIL). LIL is a wholly owned subsidiary of NZIG and is a New Zealand incorporated company that is a licensed life insurer under s 17 of the Insurance (Prudential Supervision) Act 2010. LIL will receive insurance premiums from the Fund and provide Investors with cover under the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit, Minimum Death Benefit and Spouse Benefit policies. LIL will not have reinsurance for the cover provided under the Arrangement.  Investors. These are members of the public who will invest in the Lifetime Income product by way of investing in the Fund and will in return be issued with units in the Balanced Portfolio. Investors’ money will be pooled together and invested by the Fund in accordance with the Fund’s investment strategy. From time to time the Fund will redeem Investors’ units in the Balanced Portfolio and reinvest the proceeds in the Cash Portfolio to ensure there is adequate liquidity for the Fund to meet its commitments. Investors must be New Zealand citizens or individuals entitled to reside in New Zealand permanently and who are living (or normally living) in New Zealand. Investors can be aged up to 85 years old and must invest a minimum of $100,000 with the Fund (although this requirement may be waived at the Fund’s discretion). Investors will supply an applicable prescribed investor rate (10.5%, 17.5% or 28%) to the Fund as appropriate. 3 4. The following diagram summarises how the Arrangement operates: The Lifetime Income Fund 5. The overall product is the Lifetime Income Fund, in which members of the general public up to the age of 85 can invest their retirement savings (or a portion of them) built up through savings in a KiwiSaver scheme or otherwise. The Fund will manage the investment in a similar manner to a KiwiSaver scheme through the Balanced Portfolio, which will invest in low cost share and fixed interest index funds. The Fund will also manage distributions to provide income (the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit) for the Investor over their retirement lifetime (from age 65 onwards). The Lifetime Income Fund will achieve this by purchasing a life insurance policy or policies in the name of the Trustee and for the benefit of Investors, along with offering an investment in a managed fund. The Cash Portfolio will be invested in cash and liquid fixed income investments. Premiums will be paid by the Fund manager to LIL annually by redeeming units held for an Investor in the Cash Portfolio. The amount of the premiums will be actuarially calculated based on factors specific to the Investor. 6. The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit of the Investor is set at a percentage of their Protected Income Base, being the original capital sum invested in the Fund net of any applicable fees and including any increase in value during the Investor’s Deferral Period (the period up to the time the Investor begins receiving payments of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit). The Investor may elect to commence receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit at any time from age 65 until age 85. 7. The Investor’s Protected Income Base will rise during their Deferral Period (the period between when an Investor makes their initial investment and when they start receiving their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit), as positive investment returns increase the value of their unitholding in the Fund. However, the Investor’s Protected Income Base will not fall below the highest value reached before commencement of the payments of the 4 Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (or the original value of their investment, if this is higher). 8. Each year of deferral after the age of 65 increases the minimum Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit payment by 0.2%. For example, if an Investor takes the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit immediately upon joining the Fund at age 65, they will receive minimum annual repayments of 5% of the original amount invested. If the Investor defers the commencement of the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit for a year, the ongoing payments will be 5.2% of the Protected Income Base. 9. The Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit is comprised of two phases:  First, the Protected Income Phase: this phase commences on the date of the first payment of an Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit and ends when the Investor’s balance in the Fund falls to zero. Payments made during this phase are made by the Fund from the Investor’s investment in the Fund, ie, the capital investment in the Fund and the Investor’s share of the post-tax investment returns earned by the Fund. This is achieved by automatically redeeming the Investor’s units in the Fund on an annual basis.  Second, the Insured Income Phase: this phase commences after the Investor’s balance in the Fund falls to zero. Payments made during this phase are made by LIL under the life insurance policy or policies purchased by the Fund from LIL directly to the Investor. If, for any reason, LIL does not make payments to an Investor under the policy, the Investor’s income will cease accordingly, ie, the Fund has no liability to make payments to the Investor during this phase. Similarly, if LIL imposes any conditions limiting or affecting an amount payable under a policy, the Investor’s income will be adjusted accordingly. 10. An Investor can choose between two options to take effect on their death at additional cost. First, they can choose for any remaining capital to be returned to the personal representative of their estate (the Minimum Death Benefit option). Alternatively, they can choose for their spouse to receive their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit for the remainder of their spouse’s life after their death (the Spouse Benefit option). Both of these benefits will be provided by LIL, with the Fund purchasing cover from LIL on behalf of the Investor. Payments and withdrawals 11. The Fund will pay Investors their Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit fortnightly. 12. There will be flexibility for an Investor to withdraw their Fund balance (an Unplanned Withdrawal) but the Investor will be able to withdraw a minimum of 20% of their Fund balance at any time. This will first be used to reduce the balance of the Investor’s capital investment and will reduce the base amount upon which the Investor’s Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit from then on is calculated. If an Investor withdraws more than 20% of their Fund balance, their account will be closed and their entire remaining balance with the Fund returned to them. 5 13. In addition, if an Investor withdraws their investment within three years of their initial investment, an extra 1% of the original capital value will be payable by the Investor to the Fund over and above the transaction costs payable upon exit. Fees and expenses 14. All fees, expenses and premiums payable by the Investor will be paid from the Investor’s investment in the Cash Portfolio. Fees and expenses include transaction costs for monies invested or withdrawn, management fees, trustee’s fees and early withdrawal fees. Condition stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following condition: a) The continued application of private ruling Br Prv 14/82 (under s 91EB of the Tax Administration Act 1994). How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Investors’ investment returns will be taxed at the Fund level at the appropriate prescribed investor tax rate under ss HM 31 and HM 34 to HM 55. b) Payments from the Fund to Investors will be excluded income of the Investors under s CX 56B. c) Any benefit to the Investor from the Fund arranging and meeting the costs of life insurance cover provided by LIL is not a dividend under ss CD 3 to CD 21 and is not income under s CA 1. d) Payments under the Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit are exempt income of the Investor under s CW 4. e) Section BG 1 does not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 April 2014 and ending on 31 March 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 24th day of December 2014. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 15/01 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Chorus Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CA 1, CE 1, CX 2, CX 10, CX 35, EW 3, EW 6, EW 31, GA 1, HC 6, and HC 7 and subpart CE. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment of a long-term incentive plan (Plan) for senior executives of Chorus New Zealand Limited (CNZL). The following draft documents (in the form as provided to Inland Revenue on 23 May 2014) constitute part of the Arrangement:  letter of invitation from Chorus Limited (Chorus) to employees of CNZL (Invitation Letter);  Chorus long term incentive plan rules (Rules);  Chorus long term incentive plan trust deed (Trust Deed) to be entered into between Chorus and Chorus LTI Trustee Limited (Trustee) acting as trustee of the Plan;  Chorus long term incentive plan loan agreement (Loan Agreement) to be entered into between the participant and CNZL; and  Chorus long term incentive plan put option deed to be entered into between Chorus and Trustee. 2 Broadly, the Arrangement operates as follows:  CNZL will advance an interest free loan to Trustee as agent for, and at the request of, the employee. Trustee will use this loan to acquire shares in Chorus on behalf of the employee.  The shares will be held on trust during a restrictive period. In respect of shares held on behalf of an employee: o distributions are applied in partial repayment of the employee’s loan; and o the employee is able to direct Trustee how to vote.  At the end of the restrictive period, the employee’s ability to receive legal title to the shares will depend on whether vesting criteria are met. o Where the vesting criteria are met legal title will vest in the employee. In addition, the employee will receive a bonus equal to the grossed up original loan amount. The bonus (or part thereof, depending on the outstanding loan balance) is used to fully repay the employee’s loan. o Where the vesting criteria are failed legal title will not vest in the employee. The employee will not receive a bonus. The loan becomes repayable in 20 days. The employee and Trustee have put and call options (respectively) to require Trustee to purchase and the employee to sell (respectively) the employee’s beneficial interest in the shares to Trustee for the outstanding loan amount. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Objectives of the Plan 1. The primary objective of the Chorus Group in establishing the Plan is to encourage executives to become shareholders in Chorus, thus aligning their interests with those of other shareholders. Clause 2 of the Rules states that the objectives of the Plan are to: • reward and retain key employees; • drive longer-term performance and alignment of incentives of participants with the interests of Chorus' shareholders; and • encourage longer term decision-making. Invitation 2. The Invitation Letter will be sent to certain employees of CNZL who are tax resident in New Zealand (potential Participants). The Invitation Letter details the terms of the proposed grant, including a loan amount offered to the Participant that must be used to acquire shares in Chorus, the Plan Shares being held in trust for a restrictive period, a target cash bonus amount and performance hurdles. The Invitation Letter also specifies that the grant is subject to the Rules, Trust Deed and Loan Agreement. 3 3. The potential Participant may accept the grant by signing and returning the acceptance form attached to the Invitation Letter within a prescribed timeframe. In accepting the grant, the Participant acknowledges that they are bound by the Plan Rules, and that such acknowledgement is also for the benefit of CNZL and Trustee, and is intended to be enforceable by CNZL and Trustee. 4. CNZL is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chorus. The Participants will not be associated with Chorus or CNZL for the purpose of the Act. Terms of loan 5. On acceptance of the grant, CNZL will advance an interest free loan to Trustee as agent for, and at the request of, the Participant (cl 2.1 of the Loan Agreement and cls 6.1, 6.3(a) and 6.3(b) of the Rules). 6. Trustee will be bound to use the loan amount to purchase or subscribe for new or existing ordinary shares in Chorus on behalf of the Participant (the Plan Shares) (cl 2.1(a) of the Loan Agreement and cls 5.2(b) and 6.2 of the Rules). 7. The loan will be limited recourse; that is, the recourse of CNZL (the lender) will be limited to the Plan Shares acquired with the proceeds of the loan (cl 2.1(d) of the Loan Agreement and cl 6.3(d) of the Rules). The Participant will have no liability in respect of the loan other than to the extent of their interest in the Plan Shares. 8. The loan will be repayable on the loan repayment date and otherwise in accordance with the Rules (cl 2.1(b) of the Loan Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Rules, a Participant may not prepay the loan balance (cls 2.1(b) and 2.1(c) of the Loan Agreement and cl 6.3(c) of the Rules). The Rules provide for repayment of the loan as follows: • The loan repayment date is the date that is 20 business days after the vesting date for legal title to the Plan Shares. The vesting date is set out in the Invitation Letter and is the date on which the performance hurdles are measured, currently set at three years from the commencement date (cl 16.9 of the Rules and the Invitation Letter). • A Participant must apply dividends (after deduction of any tax) to which the Participant is entitled in respect of that Participant’s Plan Shares (as set out below) to partially repay the relevant Participant’s loan amount, and the Participant instructs Trustee to do so (cl 6.4 of the Rules). • To the extent performance hurdles are achieved on the vesting date and the Participant is eligible to have legal title to the Plan Shares vested and a cash bonus, the Participant authorises CNZL to apply the after-tax bonus towards repayment of the loan balance (cls 10.1 and 10.3 of the Rules). Clause 10.4 of the Rules specifies that the Participant must repay the loan balance in respect of such Plan Shares on the loan repayment date in this manner. • To the extent hurdles are not met and the Participant is not eligible to have legal title to the Plan Shares vested, cl 10.4(b) of the Rules provides that cls 11 and 12 will apply. Clauses 11 and 12 each 4 relate to call and put options (discussed further below). On Trustee’s exercising of the call or the Participant’s exercising of the put, the Participant must transfer its beneficial interest in the relevant Plan Shares to the Trustee for an amount equal to the outstanding loan balance, which shall be settled by the transfer of the loan balance from the Participant to Trustee by way of novation of the Loan Agreement (cls 11.2, 11.3(c), 12.2 and 12.3(c) of the Rules). Acquisition and holding of Plan Shares 9. Trustee will acquire the Plan Shares either on-market or, if the Plan Shares are issued by Chorus or transferred from unallocated shares, at the volume weighted average price of Chorus shares on the NZX for the 10 trading day period before such issue or transfer (cl 7.2 of the Rules). No agreement to subscribe or purchase will be entered into by the Trustee before the relevant purchase, subscription or allocation of Plan Shares. 10. Trustee will hold the Plan Shares as trustee on behalf of the Participant pursuant to the Rules and the Trust Deed. On the vesting date, legal title to any Plan Shares the Trustee holds for a Participant will become eligible for vesting (cl 8.1 of the Rules). Trustee must maintain an account for each Participant detailing the number of Plan Shares and the loan balance (cl 8.2 of the Rules). 11. In respect of the Plan Shares, each Participant will be entitled to: • receive notices issued to shareholders by Chorus (cl 8.3(a) of the Rules); • exercise voting rights via instructing Trustee (cl 8.4 of the Rules); and • receive any distributions (cl 8.3(b) of the Rules); such distributions must be applied to reduce the relevant Participant’s loan balance while Trustee holds legal title to that Participant’s Plan Shares. 12. Except as otherwise specified in the Plan, Plan Shares are not transferrable while the Trustee holds them. No Participant may grant security over that Participant’s interest in any Plan Shares (cl 8.5 of the Rules). 13. Three adjustments are provided for in cl 13 of the Rules: • If, before vesting, Chorus confers on shareholders the rights to acquire shares or other benefits or assets, Chorus’s board may offer further shares to Trustee as agent for the Participants so that Participants receive a benefit that reflects the value of the distribution rights to ordinary shareholders. • If, before vesting, Chorus, pursuant to a bonus issue, issues ordinary shares to shareholders in a manner that maintains the existing relative voting and distribution rights of all holders of ordinary shares, a Participant will be entitled on vesting to receive additional shares as if the Participant’s Plan Shares had participated in the bonus issue. 5 • If, before vesting, there is a reconstruction of the shares of Chorus, the Board may effect a similar reconstruction in relation to the Plan Shares held by Trustee for that Participant to ensure Participants are no better or worse off as a result of the reconstruction. 14. Plan Shares will be held by Trustee on behalf of the Participant pursuant to the Trust Deed. This will essentially be until legal title vests in the Participant following the vesting date or Trustee purchases the beneficial interest in the Shares. The trust will be a “complying trust”, as defined in s HC 10. 15. If Trustee purchases the beneficial interest in any Plan Shares, Trustee will: • retain them for future Plan issues (while the shares are unallocated, Trustee will not exercise any voting rights in respect of such shares and will waive rights and entitlements to any dividends on such shares in accordance with cl 2.4 of the Trust Deed); or • sell them in the market and use the proceeds to settle the loan (which Trustee rather than the Participant will at that time owe to CNZL); or • exercise a put option to sell the Plan Shares back to Chorus for consideration equal to the loan balance outstanding, which Trustee can then use to settle the loan balance. 16. If Trustee has any surplus funds on the winding up of the Trust, whether by reason of any sale of Plan Shares at a price greater than the price paid by Trustee or otherwise, Trustee may distribute such funds as Trustee so wishes, provided no funds shall be distributed to Chorus (cl 5.2 of the Trust Deed). Performance hurdles and vesting 17. The provisional hurdles are: • Tranche 1 – Chorus's total shareholder returns (TSR) from commencement of the Plan until the restrictive period ends must be greater than the 50th percentile TSR of NZX50 companies. If this hurdle is met, legal title in the shares will transfer to participants on a straight-line basis, from 50% transfer at the 50th percentile to l00% transfer, if the TSR is equal to the 75% percentile. • Tranche 2 – Chorus's TSR must be 10.4% or greater per year for legal title in all shares to be transferred. 18. The performance hurdles will be finalised around the time of the issue of the Invitation Letter to ensure the hurdles are appropriate at that time. The hurdles will be set at a level that is intended to push the executives to perform while being achievable and not unrealistic. If the performance hurdles are achieved 19. Provided the Participant remains employed at the end of the restrictive period (cl 9.2 of the Rules) and to the extent performance conditions are met, Chorus will procure that a cash bonus equal to the grossed up value 6 of the original loan is paid by CNZL to the Participant in respect of each Tranche (Invitation Letter and cls 7.1 and 10.1 of the Rules). 20. Where Chorus is required to procure the bonus for the Participant in accordance with the Plan, CNZL will pay the Participant the bonus pursuant to the employment contract entered into between CNZL and the relevant Participant. 21. The after-tax amount of the bonus will be paid to Trustee and applied to repay the loan balance, regardless of Chorus's share price at that time (cl 10.1 of the Rules). Any excess amount of bonus will be paid directly to the Participant. An excess will arise if dividends have previously been derived by the Participant on the Plan Shares and used, in compliance with the Rules, to partially repay the loan. 22. Trustee will transfer legal title to the Plan Shares to the Participant on repayment of the loan (cls 10.3 and 10.4 of the Rules). If the performance hurdles are not met 23. To the extent performance conditions are not met, no or a reduced cash bonus will be paid (ie, vesting is proposed to be progressive in relation to Tranche 1) (cl 10.2 of the Rules). 24. Clauses 11.1 and 12.1 of the Rules provide that Trustee will grant a put option to each Participant in respect of each Participant’s beneficial interest in the Plan Shares in consideration for the grant of a call option by each Participant to Trustee in respect of each Participant’s beneficial interest in the Plan Shares. The options are effectively exercisable where vesting criteria are not met. 25. Trustee may exercise a call option requiring the Participant to sell their beneficial interest in the Plan Shares to Trustee for an amount equal to the loan balance. The purchase price under the call option will be settled by the transfer of the loan balance from the Participant to Trustee by way of novation of the Loan Agreement (cls 11.1 and 11.2 of the Rules). Therefore, after novation, the loan will be owed by Trustee to CNZL. 26. Failing exercise of the call option, the Participant can exercise an equal and opposite put option requiring Trustee to purchase the beneficial interest in the Plan Shares from the Participant on the same basis (cls 12.1 and 12.2 of the Rules). The put option can be exercised only in limited circumstances where the performance hurdles are not met and the call option has not been exercised (cl 12.3 of the Rules). The Participants cannot exercise the put option if the hurdles are met but the share price has fallen. 27. Because the consideration for the transfer of the Participant’s beneficial interest in Plan Shares under the call and put options is an amount equal to the loan balance, it is unlikely one or other will not be exercised if the performance hurdles are not met. If, for whatever reason, no option is exercised, the loan will become due on the loan repayment date regardless. Accordingly, the Participant will be required to repay the loan or CNZL will be able to take legal steps to execute against the shares. 7 Cessation of employment 28. If the Participant ceases to be employed as a result of an involuntary event (eg, death, redundancy or ill health) before the restrictive period ends, the vesting date will be brought forward and an apportionment made to determine the number of shares eligible for immediate transfer of legal title (cl 9.1 of the Rules). If the Participant ceases to be employed for any other reasons or otherwise elects to cease participating in the Plan, then the Participant will not be eligible for a cash bonus and the Plan Shares will be subject to cls 11 and 12 of the Rules (ie, as if the performance hurdles had not been met). Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The value of the Plan Shares on the date Trustee acquires them on behalf of the relevant Participant will equal the price payable by the Participant for those Plan Shares. b) The final executed documents will not be materially different to the draft documents provided to Inland Revenue on 23 May 2014. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) Trustee’s purchase of Plan Shares on behalf of the Participants will not give rise to any income to the Participants under subpart CE. b) Cash bonuses CNZL pays to eligible Participants will be income of the Participant under s CE 1(1)(a). c) The transfer of legal title in the Plan Shares to Participants will not result in the Participants deriving:  income under ordinary concepts for the purpose of s CA 1(2);  income in connection with their employment under s CE 1(1); or  beneficiary income under s HC 6. d) Where Trustee derives Chorus distributions on Plan Shares that are held on behalf of Participants, such distributions will constitute “beneficiary income” of the relevant Participant in accordance with s HC 6 and not “trustee income” in accordance with s HC 7. e) When the Participant transfers their beneficial interest in Plan Shares to Trustee following exercise of the call or put option:  the Participant will not derive any income under s CE 1; and  no fringe benefit will arise under s CX 2. 8 f) The Plan, including the share acquisition, loan, bonus and options, but excluding any market purchase of shares by Trustee, is a “financial arrangement” as defined in s EW 3. g) The Participants must use Determination S33 to determine amounts solely attributable to the Shares, Put Options, Call Options and Employment Contracts (as defined in Determination S33) for the purposes of s EW 6(2). h) If a put or call option is exercised in accordance with the Plan, the base price adjustment calculated in accordance with s EW 31(5) on novation of the Loan Agreement will be nil for the Participant, provided Determination S33 is applied. i) Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 4 February 2015 and ending on 31 December 2018. This Ruling is signed by me on the 4th day of February 2015. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING BR Prd 15/02: NEW ZEALAND MĀORI ARTS & CRAFTS INSTITUTE SCHOLARSHIP This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the New Zealand M āori Arts and Crafts Institute (the Institute). Taxation Law All Legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of s CW 36. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the payment of a scholarship by the Institute to students enrolled in the canoe (waka) building school known as Te Wananga a Kupe Mai Tawhiti (Te Wananga a Kupe) which runs a three-year Diploma in waka building ( the Arrangement). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below: 1. The Institute was established by the New Zealand M āori Arts and Crafts Institute Act 1963 (NZMACI Act). Under that Act, the purpose of the Institute—alongside its tourism function—is to train M āori in the practice of Māori arts and crafts and culture (s 14(b) , NZMACI Act). 2. In 1994 a “needs analysis” of the Institute was undertaken. It was decided to focus activities on training and educating M āori. To this end, the Institute awards a Diploma in M āori arts and crafts or Māori culture generally (s 15(k) , NZMACI Act). 3. The art of waka building (tarai waka) had been identified in the report, the Health of M āori Heritage Arts released by Creative New Zealand in 2009 as one of the two artforms diagnosed with “fragile health”. 4. To be awarded the Diploma, students must complete four modules. The modules are: • Module 1 Te Tua i te Rakau (The felling of trees) • Module 2 Te Tarai i te Waka (The building of canoes) • Module 3 Te Here i te Waka (The lashing of canoes) • Module 4 Waka Hourua (Double-hulled canoes). 5. The Institute has trained students in traditional waka building since 2013 with a limited intake of one to five students per year. The Scholarship Agreement (the Agreement) and Scholarship Policy 6. The Institute offers a limited number of scholarships to assist students (Tauira) while they are undertaking their studies. The Agreement entered into between the Institute and its Tauira has the following features: • Each scholarship will be awarded to a successful applicant for the duration of the student's course at the amount of $18,200.00 per annum. The amount of the annual scholarship payments may be adjusted from time to time to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. • The Agreement sets out the hours of class attendance required of the Tauira. Terms and study periods are also specified. • The Agreement states that the Institute will provide a uniform and tools for the Tauira. • Any carvings or other items produced by the Tauira in the course of their studies are the property of the Institute. 7. The scholarship payments aim to help cover the living costs of Tauira. Tauira have generally moved from their tribal area, are young and have very few assets. All costs of training, protective clothing, tools, equipment and raw materials are covered by the Institute. 8. The Institute also has a scholarship policy which is set out below: Scholarship Policy The Institute agrees to provide the programme and in consideration the Tauira (student) agrees to attend and participate in the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement (the Scholarship). Scholarships will be awarded to a successful applicant for the duration of the student's course upon recommendation of the interview panel. Scholarships will be offered annually to successful applicants to Te Wananga a Kupe and the number of students will be determined or negotiated between the Institute and Te Wananga a Kupe. The programme has a duration of three (3) years. The Institute shall be entitled to vary and/or include any teaching and material that it deems appropriate for the programme. The Scholarship awarded for students is $18,200.00 while satisfactory attendance and participation in the programme is maintained. Award payments will be made weekly in arrears into the students bank account in an effort to assist students budget adequately for the year. Deductions as authorised by the student from time to time may also be made. The parties agree that the Institute shall be entitled to make any deductions it deems appropriate from the payments including replacement costs for tools and for any damage or destruction that the student may cause to property of the Institute its visitors, directors, employees or invitees. Students will, for the first three months of their first year with Te Wananga a Kupe, move through a probation period. During this time Te Wananga a Kupe staff and student will determine suitability/ability to cope with the course challenges. Termination of a student's scholarship may also be the result of the students' inability to complete module assignments or practice tasks prescribed within the Wananga curriculum to prescribed standards and within given time-frames. Students who wish to terminate their scholarships may do so either during the probation period or by giving one week's notice of such termination. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement The Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement as follows: • Scholarship payments made by the Institute to a student pursuant to the Arrangement will be exempt income of the student under s CW 36. The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply from the period 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2019. This Ruling is signed by me on 7 July 2015.

Classified Public 1 PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 15/03 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (the MBIE). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 5 and 8 and the definition of “consideration” in s 2(1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the charging of an annual levy (Levy) under s 89 of the Telecommunications Act 2001 (the TA) on liable telecommunication operators by the Minister of Communications and Information Technology (Minister), currently responsible for the administration of the TA. The Levy was introduced by the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2011 by substituting the current ss 87 to 92 into the TA. The Levy is collected by the MBIE (the Ministry responsible for administering the TA for the Minister). Pursuant to s 90 of the TA, the Levy may be used for the following purposes:  to pay telecommunications service obligations (TSO) charges:  to pay for non-urban telecommunications infrastructure development:  to pay for upgrades to the emergency service calling system:  any other purpose that the Minister considers will facilitate the supply of certain telecommunications services to groups of end-users within New Zealand to whom those telecommunications services may not otherwise be supplied on a commercial basis or at a price that is considered by the Minister to be affordable to those groups of end-users. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Classified Public 2 Background 1. The New Zealand telecommunications market is regulated by the TA, which provides the regulatory framework for the supply of certain telecommunications services. 2. In 2011, the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Bill (2011 Bill) was introduced into Parliament and referred to the Commerce Select Committee for consideration. The 2011 Bill introduced the Levy as a levy that “will be collected from industry participants annually” to “consolidate the statutory mechanisms for industry funding of telecommunications service and sector development obligations”. The Explanatory Note to the 2011 Bill relevantly stated that: The Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill (the Bill) amends the Telecommunications Act 2001 (the Act) to support the implementation of the Government’s policy programme for the telecommunications sector. The Bill achieves this intent by providing for amendments to— • streamline the administration of TSO instruments: • consolidate the statutory mechanisms for industry funding of telecommunications service and sector development obligations: • establish a regulatory framework for the enhanced broadband networks that will be developed under the UFB Initiative and the RBI with the support of Crown funding. ... Overview of the Telecommunications (TSO, Broadband, and Other Matters) Amendment Bill Part 1 Part 1 of the Bill contains amendments to Part 3 of the Act, which sets out a legislative framework for the declaration and management of TSO instruments. These instruments are service agreements between the Crown and a service provider for the delivery of telecommunications services that would not otherwise be delivered on a commercial basis or at an affordable price. The Bill— • amends the basis for calculation of the net cost of deemed TSO instruments, including the Telecommunications Service Obligations (TSO) Deed for Local Residential Telephone Service (the Local Service TSO) provided by Telecom, to ensure that the full benefits a provider accrues from provision of the required services are considered when determining whether additional compensation should be paid to the provider; and • streamlines the legislative funding mechanisms for TSO instruments by introducing a new Telecommunications Development Levy (the TDL), which will be collected from industry participants annually and be used for the payment of TSO-related compensation, non-urban telecommunications infrastructure development, and upgrades to the emergency services calling system. 3. The amendments to Part 3 of the TA came into force on 1 July 2011. The Levy is payable under s 89 of the TA by liable persons who exceed the minimum telecommunications revenue threshold, as set out in ss 80 and 81 of the TA (meaning they earned more than $10 million in gross telecommunications revenue in the year preceding the year being considered in calculating the Levy). 4. Section 5 of the TA defines “liable person” as: Liable person means a person who provides a telecommunications service in New Zealand by means of some component of a PTN \[public telecommunications network\] that is operated by the person 5. “Minimum telecommunications revenue” is defined in s 80 of the TA as: Classified Public 3 minimum telecommunications revenue means $10 million, or such other amount, as may be prescribed by regulations made under section 101(1)(a), of gross revenue (as may be determined in accordance with any specifications set by the Commission) that a liable person receives during a financial year for supplying either or both of the following (excluding any amount paid to a liable person by the Crown as compensation for the cost of complying with a TSO instrument that contains a specified amount): (a) telecommunications services by means of its PTN: (b) telecommunications services by means that rely primarily on the existence of its PTN or any other PTN. 6. Section 81(1) of the TA provides that the Levy is not imposed on all liable persons: 81 Subpart does not apply to certain liable persons (1) This subpart does not apply to a liable person in respect of a financial year (financial year A) if— (a) the liable person was not trading in the financial year preceding financial year A; or (b) the liable person’s telecommunications revenue for the year preceding financial year A was less than the minimum telecommunications revenue. 7. The Levy is payable under s 89 of the TA. Pursuant to s 90 of the TA, the Levy may be used for the following purposes:  to pay TSO charges:  to pay for non-urban telecommunications infrastructure development:  to pay for upgrades to the emergency service calling system:  any other purpose that the Minister considers will facilitate the supply of certain telecommunications services to groups of end-users within New Zealand to whom those telecommunications services may not otherwise be supplied on a commercial basis or at a price that is considered by the Minister to be affordable to those groups of end- users. 8. The Crown will contract a service provider or service providers for goods and services that need to be provided under ss 90(1)(c) and (d) of the TA, rather than provide the goods and services itself. 9. Sections 82 to 88 of the TA set out the annual procedure for determining amounts payable by liable persons to the Crown. The process of charging, collecting and allocating the Levy is summarised in the following paragraphs. Charging, Collecting and Allocating the Levy 10. At the end of the financial year, liable persons must provide the Commerce Commission (Commission) with information regarding their qualified revenue for the financial year: s 83 of the TA. The Commission prepares a draft liability allocation determination that is publicly notified and open for submissions: s 84 of the TA. 11. Under s 85 of the TA, the amount of the Levy payable by each liable person for the financial year is calculated using the following formula: \_a\_\_ × c b Classified Public 4 where— a is the amount of the liable person’s qualified revenue b is the sum of all liable persons’ qualified revenue c is the telecommunications development levy specified for the relevant year in Schedule 3B of the TA. 12. The Levy is then paid by liable persons into the MBIE’s Crown bank account. 13. In accordance with s 89(2) of the TA, if the Levy is not paid on or before the 20 th working day after the date the determination is publicly notified, it becomes a debt to the Crown recoverable in any court of competent jurisdiction. Interest is payable on any unpaid amount at the 90-day bank bill rate plus 5% for the period any amount is outstanding. 14. Except as provided in s 94L of the TA, the Crown is not required to use any Levy amount within any particular time: s 90(3) of the TA. Under s 94L of the TA, the Crown must pay the TSO provider the amount set out in the final TSO cost calculation determination not later than 30 working days after the date that determination is publicly notified. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumption stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Levy does not constitute “consideration” (as defined in s 2(1)) for any “supply” (as defined in s 5) of goods and services made by the Crown. b) The Levy charged to liable telecommunications operators under the TA by the MBIE is not subject to GST under s 8. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 November 2014 and ending on 1 November 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 23 day of October 2015. Dave Hames Investigations Manager, Investigations and Advice
PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 15/04 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Harbour Fund II GP Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. The Ruling applies in respect of ss BD 1(4), BD 1(5), BG 1, and YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the entering into of the Funding Agreement, and the receipt by Harbour Fund II Limited Partnership (the Fund) of proceeds (Proceeds) pursuant to individual funding agreements that the Fund will enter into with litigation claimants (the Claimants) to a class action against James Hardie New Zealand and the other James Hardie entities, under which the Fund will agree to pay all legal and other costs incurred by the Claimants, in return for a share of the proceeds. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Background to the Arrangement 1. The Fund is situated in the Cayman Islands and has been established to make litigation and arbitration funding available for all types of claims other than personal injury, divorce or defamation proceedings. 2. Under the law of Cayman Islands, the Fund does not have separate legal personality from its partners. The Fund is not the beneficial owner of its assets, which are held by Harbour Fund II GP Limited (the General Partner), in accordance with the terms of the Fund’s limited partnership agreement. Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2 3. The Fund provides funding for litigation claimants all around the world who have met certain criteria. The criteria include the creditworthiness of the defendant, the legal merits of the case, the expertise of the legal team and the likely legal fees. 4. The Fund is advised by Harbour Advisors Cayman Limited (the Investment Advisor) a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. The Investment Advisor has been contracted by the General Partner under an investment advisory agreement (Investment Advisory Agreement) to perform investigation, evaluation and due diligence services in respect of potential claims for which funding is sought. 5. Preliminary investigation and due diligence services have in turn been subcontracted by the Investment Advisor to Harbour Litigation Funding Limited (the Sub-Advisor) which is a company incorporated in England and Wales, under a sub-advisory agreement (Sub-Advisory Agreement). 6. Details of the activities undertaken by the Investment Advisor and by the Sub- Advisor (together the Advisors) when investigating and evaluating potential claims are set out below. Summary of the normal investment procedure 7. The Advisors ensure that the business of the Fund is known to interested parties. However, the Advisors do not actively or routinely seek to identify and locate specific claims for which funding might be provided. 8. Once a request for funding is received a confidentiality agreement is entered into, and the Advisors conduct a preliminary assessment. Information is gathered regarding the claim, and an immediate analysis is conducted to assess whether the claim is likely to satisfy the Fund’s criteria. If the claim is unlikely to satisfy the criteria, it will generally be rejected at this stage. 9. If a claim passes the first stage of analysis, the Sub-Advisor will, if appropriate, enter into a letter of intent, usually with the claimant directly, but in the case of a class/group action, with the legal representative seeking funding on behalf of the claimants. This procedure has been adopted because there are too many claimants to execute separate documents with and they may not yet have been identified. The Sub-Advisor will then conduct a more detailed due diligence to ascertain whether the claim would be likely to meet the criteria for funding. 10. An Investment Committee established by the Investment Advisor then meets monthly to evaluate the legal merits of the cases for which funding is sought which satisfy the Fund’s criteria. The Investment Committee reviews updates on the progress of existing funded claims. 11. At the conclusion of each meeting the Investment Committee, where appropriate, make a formal recommendation to the Board of the Investment Advisor, about investing in proposed new claims. The Investment Committee also reports to the Board of the Investment Advisor on existing funded claims if there have been material adverse developments in the case of existing funded claims. 3 12. The Board of the Investment Advisor then considers the recommendations made by the Investment Committee at its monthly meeting. Where the Board of the Investment Advisor considers that a proposed claim is likely to meet the Fund’s criteria for funding, a recommendation is made by the Board of the Investment Advisor to the Board of the General Partner, which has the authority to invest in claims on behalf of the Fund. 13. The Board of the General Partner then meets monthly to consider the recommendations made by the Board of the Investment Advisor. 14. Where the Board of the General Partner (on behalf of the Fund) considers that a recommended claim is meritorious, the Fund will make funds directly available for the claim by entering into a funding agreement or funding agreements with the claimants. How the decision to fund this Claim was made 15. The Sub-Advisor was approached in November 2014, via email, by a barrister working with Adina Thorn lawyers in relation to the possible funding of a representative action in relation to cladding supplied and fitted in buildings throughout New Zealand. The potential claim, would be based in negligence and breach of statutory duties, and was expected to involve over 500 Claimants with a claim for damages in excess of NZD $100m (the Claim). 16. In accordance with normal procedure summarised above, this approach for funding was subjected to the preliminary review and assessment process. It was subsequently concluded that the Claim could potentially satisfy the Fund’s criteria. 17. Due diligence was then undertaken by the Advisors, and ultimately a recommendation was made to the Board of the General Partner that the Claim be approved for funding. 18. At its March 2015 meeting in the Cayman Islands, the Board of the General Partner approved the Claim for funding. 19. The parties then attended to the finalisation of anticipated timetables and funding amounts, and appropriate documentation was prepared for the Fund to record the terms on which funding would be provided to Claimants. 20. A draft of the Funding Agreement (the Funding Agreement) was prepared, to record the terms on which the Fund will make funding available to Claimants for their legal and other costs incurred in relation to the Claim. A draft relationship agreement (Relationship Agreement) was prepared to record the various invoicing and reporting requirements that will apply to the legal representative (the Legal Representative) acting for the funded Claimants throughout the proceedings. 21. The Relationship Agreement was finalised and entered into on 19 May 2015 by the Board of the General Partner and the Legal Representative. At the date that this Ruling is signed Adina Thorn lawyers are the Legal Representative, but the Claimants have the ability to appoint a replacement Legal Representative. The Funding Agreement was finalised around early August 2015 with Claimants progressively entering into the Funding Agreement from that time. 4 Funding Agreement 22. The Funding Agreement records the terms on which the Fund agrees to make funds available to Claimants (i.e., individuals or groups who have suffered damage within the scope of the Claim) for Claimants Legal Costs. The phrase Claimants Legal Costs is defined in clause 20.1 of the Funding Agreement. It includes legal fees incurred in relation to the Claim, and any costs incurred by the Claimants (subject to certain exclusions) should the Claimants be ordered to pay the legal costs of the defendant or any other party involved in the Claim. Pursuant to the terms of clause 9, the Claimants have agreed that in the event that the Claimants are successful, the Fund will receive the Proceeds. 23. The Claimants will comprise individuals, groups of individuals and companies (or their respective representatives, such as liquidators or administrators) that are home and building owners, affected by defects in cladding used in the construction of their homes and buildings. Some of these Claimants are unable to bring a claim under the Weathertight Homes Resolution Services Act 2006 (WHRS Act) on account of their buildings having been constructed outside the 10 year limitation period imposed by the WHRS Act. 24. While the Claimant group is located in both New Zealand and other countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, it is the applicant’s understanding that all the properties to which the Claim relates are located in New Zealand. Funding process 25. Funding for the Claimants Legal Costs will be made available under the Funding Agreement in two stages. The first stage comprises the point up to which all the pre-conditions for full funding are satisfied, and a statement of claim has been filed. 26. The Applicant advised that due to the process of confirming Claimants taking time, Claimants will be confirmed as being part of the Claimant group on a progressive basis during the first stage of funding. Claimants will continue to be confirmed up until (and potentially after) the time that the statement of claim is filed. It is possible that Claimants could be confirmed and enter into the Funding Agreement after the second stage of funding has commenced. 27. During the first stage, legal fees will be incurred for work which will benefit all Claimants including Claimants who are accepted towards the end of the first stage. The definition of Claimants Legal Costs (clause 20.1 of the Funding Agreement) overcomes a potential problem associated with the timing of, and allocation of, legal costs, which were incurred before a Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. This clause provides that Claimants will agree that each Claimant’s proportionate share will be allocated by reference to the value of their claim, regardless of when each Claimant entered into the Funding Agreement. 28. Provided that the Claim satisfies the preconditions for full funding, the Fund will, after the completion of the first stage, fund the second stage of the Claim. Funding will be provided for the second stage of the Claim until such time as the Fund terminates its obligations under the Funding Agreements or the proceedings are concluded (whether by settlement or judgment of the courts). 5 Fund’s entitlement to Proceeds 29. In the event that the Fund funds stage one and two of the Claim, and the Claim is successful, the Fund will be entitled to receive the Proceeds. The amount of the Proceeds will be calculated on the basis set out in the Funding Agreement. Clause 9.1 (a)(i) to (vi) outlines how the Proceeds will be allocated between the Fund and the Claimants. 30. In accordance with the Funding Agreement, the Legal Representative will receive and hold any damages, costs and settlement sums received in respect of a Claim on bare trust for the Fund and the Claimants in the proportions agreed until such time as the relevant amounts are paid to the Fund and to the Claimants. All amounts received from the defendant must first be paid to the Fund who will be paid in priority to the Claimants, who shall each receive such sum as is equal to their share of the remaining damages, costs or settlement sum. Control of Claim 31. Control of the Claim will rest with the Claimants. The Fund will have no ability to instruct the Legal Representative or dictate how the proceedings are to be conducted. Clause 5 of The Funding Agreement expressly acknowledges that the Fund has no control over or right to make decisions about the proceedings. Only the Claimants, through the Representative Claimant (the Representative Claimant) may instruct the Legal Representative and determine, for example, that the claims that will be pursued and what actions will be taken or decisions made on a day to day basis in respect of the conduct of the proceedings. 32. Clause 6.1 (f) of the Funding Agreement provides that at any time Claimants will be entitled to change the Legal Representative. While the prior written agreement of the Fund is required, this clause provides that the Fund’s consent to such a change is not to be unreasonably withheld. However, in order to continue to receive funding under the Funding Agreement, the Claimants will be required to ensure that the new Legal Representative executes a deed in favour of the Fund under which the new Legal Representative agrees to be bound by the terms of the Relationship Agreement as if they were the prior Legal Representative. 33. Clauses 5, 6 and 13 outline the Claimants obligations under the Funding Agreement. They include taking certain actions and to provide certain instructions to the Legal Representative in relation to certain anticipated future events including: in relation to the pursuit of an appeal should the Fund wish to provide funding for an appeal, and in relation to settlement decisions should settlement be recommended or not recommended (as the case may be) by the Legal Representative. 34. The Applicant states that because this is a class action, Claimants will also agree on entering into the Funding Agreement the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted and the Representative Claimant will instruct the Legal Representative. This is to ensure that the funded Claimants agree at the outset how the proceedings will be conducted, and so that the Fund can be confident that the proceedings are being conducted in an optimal manner. 6 Termination 35. Clause 1 of the Funding Agreement contains an initial cooling off period of 20 days. Clause 12 provides that a Claimant will not be able to unilaterally terminate its obligations under the Funding Agreement. Claimants will only be entitled to actively terminate their obligations if there has been a material breach by the Fund which has adversely affected the Claimant’s interests and which has not been remedied by the Fund within 30 days. 36. Clause 12 of the Funding Agreement enables a Claimant to opt out of the class action if the Claimant gives instructions to the Legal Representative or otherwise exercises a right to opt out of the proceedings. However if the Claim is subsequently successful the Fund is still entitled to recover its share of the Proceeds as if the Claimant had not opted out of the class action. 37. Clause 11 of the Funding Agreement provides that the Fund will have the right at any time to terminate its obligation to contribute to future legal costs in respect of the Claim. Key contractual terms relating to process 38. Claimants will agree to take certain actions and provide certain instructions to the Legal Representative in relation to the manner in which the proceedings will be conducted, and in relation to certain potential future events. These obligations are contained in the following clauses: • Clause 5 Conduct of Proceedings. • Clause 6 Claimant’s Obligations. • Clause 9 Application of Proceeds. • Clause 13 Settlement Decisions. • Clause 19 General Provisions. 39. Pursuant to clauses 5, 6 and 13 of the Funding Agreement, each Claimant will agree: • That the Representative Claimant will determine in consultation with the Legal Representative what claims will be pursued clause 5.1 (a); • That the Representative Claimant will give day to day instructions to the Legal Representative and will make binding decisions on behalf of Claimants clause 5.1 (b); • That the Claimant will provide all information and documents required by the Legal Representative, will deal promptly with all requests made by the Legal Representative and will co-operate generally with the Legal Representative clause 6.1 (n); • That the Claimant will act reasonably and commercially in the prosecution of the proceedings and in accordance with the advice of the Legal Representative clause 6.1 (d); • That the Claimant will accept and follow the Legal Representative reasonable legal advice including in relation to settlement clause 6.1 (j); 7 • That the Representative Claimant is authorised to make or take any action constituting a settlement decision provided that the Legal Representative has advised such action is reasonable clause 13.1; • That the Legal Representative is authorised to and instructed to accept on the Claimant’s behalf, any settlement proposed where the Claimant has not initially wanted to act in accordance with the advice of the Legal Representative and the matter has been referred to independent counsel for opinion, with the independent counsel having recommended that the Legal Representative’s advice is reasonable in all the circumstances clause 13.3 and 13.4. 40. In addition, each Claimant will agree under the Funding Agreement that the Fund is entitled to communicate directly with the Legal Representative, and that the Fund is entitled to receive any information which has or may have a material impact on the Claim or the proceedings clause 6.1 (c). The Relationship Agreement between the Legal Representative and the Fund 41. The terms and conditions in the Relationship Agreement are consistent with the above provisions in the Funding Agreement. The Relationship Agreement provides that the Legal Representative must: • Act consistently with all authorisations and instructions given by the Claimant as contemplated in the Funding Agreement, subject to having received such instructions or authorisations clause 2.4; • Only enter into a retainer with a Claimant if the Claimant gives the Legal Representative all the authorisations and instructions contemplated and referred to in the Funding Agreement; • Ensure the Claimant is given all necessary information to facilitate informed instructions clause 8.2; • Keep the Fund fully informed by providing a monthly report in the form set out in the Relationship Agreement clause 8.1 (a); • Give the Fund access to, and when requested provide the Fund with copies of, all material documents produced by or for the Claimants in relation to the proceedings clause 8.1 (b); • Immediately inform the Claimant, and in accordance with the Claimant’s instructions as contemplated in the retainer and the Funding Agreement, notify the Fund if the Legal Representative becomes aware of any information which has or may have a material impact on the Claim clause 8.2 (b); • Immediately notify the Fund in the event that the Claimant receives a settlement offer, and prepare for the Claimant a written recommendation on whether to accept such an offer and provide a copy of that recommendation to the Fund clause 8.1 (e). 8 Conditions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) None of the General Partner, the limited partners of the Fund, nor the Investment Advisor or Sub-Advisor is resident in New Zealand for income tax purposes. b) None of the General Partner (whether on its own account or on behalf of the Fund), the Investment Advisor or Sub-Advisor own or lease any property located in New Zealand. c) None of the General Partner (whether on its own account or on behalf of the fund), the Investment Advisor or Sub-Advisor has any employees based in New Zealand. d) Funds made available by the Fund under the Funding Agreement will be paid to the Legal Representative from a bank account maintained by the Fund outside New Zealand.

PRODUCT RULING - BR Prd 15/05 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by AA Smartfuel Limited. Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss 2, 3A, 6, 8, 20 and 25(1)(b). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the AA Smartfuel Programme (the Programme). This is a rewards scheme where customers obtain entitlements to buy fuel at a discounted price from certain fuel providers by purchasing goods or services from certain retailers (Participating Reward Providers (PRPs)). The fuel providers may also be PRPs in respect of both fuel and non-fuel purchases. This Ruling applies only to PRPs that are “registered persons” (as defined in s 2). Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Parties to the Arrangement 1. The Arrangement involves the following parties:  AA Smartfuel Limited (AASL) as the scheme operator and administrator;  various fuel providers, which currently include BP Oil New Zealand Limited (BP) and Chevron New Zealand; Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2  various PRPs, which currently include BP for non-fuel purchases;  individual people who join the scheme (customers). 2. The AA Smartfuel website (www.AAsmartfuel.co.nz) lists participating PRPs and fuel providers current at any time. PRPs and fuel providers may be subject to change. 3. Individuals are also able to join the Programme through one of the following two ways:  All AA members are automatically enrolled in the Programme.  Non-AA members can obtain a free AA Smartfuel card at PRPs and fuel providers. They need to complete an application form online or in hard copy to be able to redeem their discounts. Documents relevant to the Arrangement 4. The documents relevant to the Arrangement are:  AA Smartfuel Terms and Conditions, which relate to customers;  AA Smartfuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between AASL and PRPs (PRP Agreement);  AA Smartfuel National Fuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between BP and AASL (BP Agreement);  AA Smartfuel Issuer Agreement, entered into between Chevron New Zealand and AASL (Chevron Agreement);  AA Smartfuel Fuel Merchant Agreement, entered into between the individual Caltex Service Stations and AASL (Caltex Service Station Agreements). 5. The actual agreements entered into between the individual Caltex Service Stations and AASL will not be materially different from the draft AA Smartfuel Merchant Agreement attached as an appendix to the Chevron Agreement provided to Inland Revenue on 23 June 2015. Summary of the AA Smartfuel Programme 6. The Programme is a nationwide rewards scheme, which was launched to the public on 7 November 2011. Under the Programme, a customer will earn an entitlement to a discount on the purchase of fuel from fuel providers by purchasing qualifying goods or services from a PRP. The fuel discount entitlements will be credited to a card issued to the customer on presentation of that card to the PRP when making qualifying purchases. 7. All fuel discount entitlements earned from all PRPs accumulate on the customer’s card as they make qualifying purchases from PRPs. Fuel discount entitlements expire at the end of the month following the month in which the purchases are made (eg, a fuel discount entitlement earned in August will expire on 30 September). 3 8. The fuel discount entitlements will provide the customer with the right to a discount on the GST-inclusive price of fuel from fuel providers, expressed as cents per litre, limited to a maximum of 50 litres of fuel. For example, a PRP may credit the customer’s card with a fuel discount entitlement of 4 cents per litre, which amounts to a $2 discount including GST on a purchase of 50 litres of fuel. Each PRP can set the level of fuel discount entitlement they offer and can set special fuel discount entitlements (eg, if a promotion is done over a period of time) by logging into the AA Smartfuel platform and adjusting the cents discount per dollar spent. 9. Customers will be able to check their fuel discount entitlement balance online. Generally, both types of customers (AA and non-AA members) will be entitled to the same deals, but AA may occasionally offer a special deal to its members. 10. When a customer purchases fuel from a fuel provider and presents the provider with their card, the accumulated discounts on the card will be credited against the purchase price of the fuel (petrol, diesel or both), up to a maximum of 50 litres. The customer then pays a discounted amount. Accumulated discounts on the reward card could be sufficient to discount up to 50 litres of fuel purchased. Payment flows involving AA Smartfuel Limited 11. When a customer makes a qualifying purchase from a PRP and earns a fuel discount entitlement, the PRP must pay an amount equivalent to the value of the discount entitlement to AASL. This is currently described in cl 4.1 of the PRP Agreement, cl 5.1 of the Chevron Agreement and cl 4.1 of the BP Agreement (this latter clause being materially the same as the clauses in the PRP Agreement and the Chevron Agreement). Each week on Sunday night, AASL will determine the total amount of discounts provided to customers in the preceding week and either:  AASL will send a tax invoice to the PRP; or  (if s 24(2) is satisfied) the PRP will send a buyer created tax invoice to AASL. The PRP will pay the amount on Tuesday night. 12. Clause 4.1 of the PRP Agreement states: 4.1 In consideration of us undertaking to procure the Participating Redemption Parties’ agreement to honour the rights arising from AA Smartfuel Discounts awarded by you each week, you undertake to pay us an amount equal to the aggregate amount of AA Smartfuel Discounts sponsored and awarded by you to AA Smartfuel Members at each of the Business Premises each week (including any AA Smartfuel Discounts awarded under clause 13.2) which amount will be paid irrevocably by you to the AA Smartfuel Account by direct debit, weekly in arrears on Tuesday of the week following the week in which the relevant AA Smartfuel Discount Award Transactions occurred. 13. When a customer redeems their discount entitlement by purchasing fuel from a fuel provider and presenting their AA Smartfuel card, AASL will pay the fuel provider an amount equivalent to the discount given, as currently described under cl 4.4 of the BP and Caltex Service Station Agreements. The AA Smartfuel system will identify transactions when fuel discount entitlements are redeemed, and each week either: 4  the fuel provider will issue a tax invoice to AASL; or  (if s 24(2) is satisfied) AASL will issue a buyer created tax invoice to the fuel provider. The payment to the fuel provider is made on Thursdays by AASL. 14. For instance, cl 4.4 of the BP Agreement states: 4.4 In consideration of you honouring the redemption of AA Smartfuel Discounts, we will pay you an amount equal to the aggregate amount of AA Smartfuel Discount redemptions honoured for AA Smartfuel members at each of the Business Premises each week, less the aggregate value of any AA Smartfuel Discounts issued by you on transactions where AA Smartfuel Discounts have been awarded and redeemed in the same transaction. We will pay you from the AA Smartfuel Account by direct debit, weekly in arrears on the Thursday of the following week. 15. Reference can also be made to cl 4.4 of the Caltex Service Station Agreements, which is materially the same as the BP Agreement other than the reference to discounts being awarded and redeemed in the same transaction. 16. To the extent any fuel discount entitlements are not used before expiry, either:  AASL will issue a credit note to the PRP, or  (if s 25(3A) is satisfied) the PRP will issue a buyer created credit note to AASL. AASL will then refund an amount equivalent to the unused discount to the relevant PRP. This is currently described in cl 4.2 of the PRP Agreement, cl 4.2 of the BP Agreement and cl 5.1 of the Chevron Agreement, (cls 4.2 of the BP Agreement and 5.1 of the Chevron Agreement are materially the same as cl 4.2 of the PRP Agreement). This amount is then paid out within 10 days. 17. Clause 4.2 of the PRP Agreement states: 4.2 Where the AA Smartfuel Discounts sponsored and awarded by you (and paid for under clause 4.1) have expired (by passage of time or because they are in excess of your Pro Rata Share of the AA Smartfuel Discounts redeemed in an AA Smartfuel Discount Redemption Transaction), the amount of the consideration payable by you under clause 4.1 will be reduced and an amount equal to the amount of such reduction will be paid to you in respect of the relevant Business Premises by direct credit on or about the 10th of the month following the month in which the AA Smartfuel Discounts expired. 18. The fuel providers and PRPs also make additional payments to AASL for other services AASL provides in respect of the information technology platform that enables it to operate the Programme, as well as administration, establishment, transaction and other sundry fees. 5 Instant discounts by fuel providers 19. The Ruling does not apply to the provision of an “instant discount” by a fuel provider, being part of any discount on the price of goods or services supplied by a fuel provider to a customer that is not referable to points accumulated under the Programme and does not result in a PRP having to reimburse the fuel provider. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows:  The sale of goods and services by a PRP results in the customer providing “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a single supply of goods and services and the right to buy fuel at a discount under s 6. To the extent the PRP makes a taxable supply to the customer, the amount paid by the customer is subject to GST under s 8.  Payments AASL makes to a fuel provider are “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a taxable supply of services from the fuel provider to AASL. The amount AASL pays to the fuel provider is therefore subject to GST under s 8.  In calculating the amount of tax payable in a taxable period under s 20, AASL will be entitled to an input tax (as defined in s 3A) deduction for all the GST charged in respect of supplies made by a fuel provider to AASL in that taxable period.  Where a customer uses fuel discount entitlements to purchase fuel at a discounted price, under s 8(1) GST on that supply is chargeable only on the discounted price payable by the customer to the fuel provider.  Payments a PRP makes to AASL are “consideration” (as defined in s 2) for a supply of services from AASL to the PRP. The amount the PRP pays to AASL is therefore subject to GST under s 8.  To the extent that the single supply (comprising of goods and services and the right to buy fuel at a discount) made by a PRP to a customer is a taxable supply, in calculating the amount of tax payable in a taxable period under s 20 the PRP will be entitled to an input tax (as defined in s 3A) deduction, or (where s 20(3) applies) a deduction from the amount of output tax payable by that PRP, for the GST charged on supplies made by AASL to the PRP in that taxable period.  When an amount is refunded to a PRP under cl 4.2 of the relevant Agreement, s 25(1)(b) will apply and either: o AASL will be required to provide the PRP with a credit note, or o (if s 25(3A) is satisfied) the PRP will be required to provide AASL with a buyer created credit note. 6 The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2017. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21st day of December 2015. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
PRODUCT RULING – BR PR D 15/ 06 Name of the person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited (Fonterra). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CD 4, CD 5, CD 6, CX 56, CX 56B, DA 1, DB 23, subpart HM, and the definition of “foreign investment variable-rate PIE” in s YA 1. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the establishment and operation of the Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund (FSF), a New Zealand resident unit trust through which non milk-supplying investors (Public Investors) and farmers supplying milk to Fonterra (Supplying Shareholders) are able to invest in units. Units in the FSF give Public Investors and Supplying Shareholders economic rights in Fonterra shares (Shares), but do not provide them with any legal interest in the Shares. Units in the FSF are issued when a Supplying Shareholder, registered volume provider (RVP) (whose Shares are held in the name of the Custodian on trust for the RVP), or Fonterra transfers the legal ownership of Shares to Fonterra Farmer Custodian Limited (Custodian). The Custodian holds the economic rights in those Shares on trust for The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited as trustee of the FSF (Unit Trustee). The FSF was established in November 2012. Trading in FSF Units commenced on the NZX Main Board at 12 pm on 30 November 2012. A total of 95,454,545 Units were on issue at that date, for a total consideration of NZ$525 million. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 Parties to the Arrangement 1. The parties to the Arrangement are: • Fonterra; • The FSF (through the Manager or Unit Trustee); • Kevin Turnbull, Malcolm Bailey and Brian Todd in their capacity as trustees of the Fonterra Farmer Custodian Trust (the Farmer Trustees); • The Custodian; • Unit Trustee; • FSF Management Company Limited as manager of the FSF (Manager); • Supplying Shareholders; • RVPs; and • Public Investors. 2. Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, the Farmer Trustees, Fonterra and Public Investors may invest in the FSF. Together, they are referred to as the Unit Holders. Documents relevant to the Arrangement 3. The following documents are relevant to the Arrangement: • Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund Unit Trust Deed dated 23 October 2012 (which established the FSF) (Unit Trust Deed); • Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund Authorised Fund Contract dated 25 October 2012, under which the FSF was established as an "Authorised Fund" under Fonterra's Constitution; • Deed of Trust establishing the Fonterra Farmer Custodian Trust dated 25 October 2012, which holds all of the shares in the Custodian and the Fonterra Unit; • Custody Trust Deed for the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust dated 25 October 2012, under which the Custodian holds the legal title to Shares, and holds the economic rights in Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee; and • Constitution of Fonterra Co-operative Group Limited dated 30 November 2012 (Constitution), which came into force in December 2012 when Trading Among Farmers was implemented. Background to the Arrangement 4. Fonterra is simultaneously registered as a co-operative dairy company under Part 3 of the Co-operative Companies Act 1996 and as a company under the Companies Act 1993 (Companies Act). Many aspects of Fonterra's structure and operation are governed by the Dairy Industry Restructuring Act 2001 (DIRA). 5. Supplying Shareholders must generally hold such number of Shares as is determined by the share standard (currently set in Fonterra's Constitution as being one share for each kilogram of milksolids obtainable from milk supplied by 2 the farmer in that season, save that Shares cannot be issued to a farmer whose supply of milksolids is less than 1,000kg in a season). These Shares are informally known as "wet" shares, as they are backed by the supply of milk. In practice, Supplying Shareholders must indicate in advance how much milk they wish to supply in a coming season, and they must acquire or dispose of the appropriate number of Shares in order to back that supply (within certain margins). Supplying Shareholders may also comply with the share standard through the holding of "vouchers" (discussed further in paragraph 29 below). 6. In addition to their "wet" Shares, Supplying Shareholders may acquire further Shares (currently up to 100% of the number of shares that they are required to hold under the share standard). These Shares are informally known as "dry" Shares, as they are not backed by the supply of milk. Despite the informal distinction between wet Shares and dry Shares, all Shares of Fonterra belong to a single class of Shares. 7. Prior to the implementation of Trading Among Farmers, s 98 of the DIRA required Fonterra to pay a surrender value for Shares when a notice of withdrawal was given by a Supplying Shareholder under s 97 of the DIRA. The ability for farmers to surrender their Shares in this way had led to volatility in Fonterra's capital. For example, the surrender value for Shares withdrawn in 2008 was approximately $600 million as a result of droughts occurring in 2008, with production increasing to pre-drought levels in 2009. Fonterra referred to this volatility as redemption risk. 8. To address this redemption risk, Fonterra made a number of changes to its capital structure in three stages. The changes, referred to as Trading Among Farmers, included: • enabling farmers to acquire up to 100% of the number of Shares that they are required to hold under the share standard as dry Shares. • the establishment of a Fonterra Shareholders' Fund to enable public investment (ie the FSF). • the creation of a "private market" for the trading of Shares between Supplying Sh areholders, RVPs (whose Shares are held in the name of the Custodian in trust for the RVP) and Fonterra (the Fonterra Shareholders' Market (FSM)). Fonterra is involved in the FSM so that it can manage the size of the FSM by conducting buybacks of Shares. 9. The Trading Among Farmers changes required amendments to be made to the DIRA, to remove the requirement for Fonterra to accept the surrender of Shares on request. This amendment was brought into force in November 2012 by Order- in -Council and removed the redemption risk. The Arrangement 10. The FSF is a passive investment vehicle through which a Public Investor can invest indirectly in Fonterra. The FSF was established as a unit trust under the Unit Trusts Act 1960 on 23 October 2012. 3 11. The FSF has elected to be a "foreign investment variable-rate PIE" (as defined in s YA 1) and to use the exit calculation option (under s HM 42), and the Commissioner confirmed this by letter dated 13 November 2012. 12. The purpose of the FSF is to provide support to the FSM by acting as a conduit for Public Investors to access the underlying economic rights in a Share, thereby creating a more liquid market for Supplying Shareholders (and RVPs) to trade in Shares. This mechanism allows Supplying Shareholders to sell economic rights in Sh ares to the FSF, as well as selling Shares on the FSM. It also allows an RVP to move between the FSF and FSM to match supply and demand and possibly hedge its position. While Supplying Shareholders may invest in the FSF, most of the Unit Holders are not Supplying Shareholders. The RVPs 13. Fonterra has appointed one RVP, Craigs Investment Partners (although it retains the discretion to appoint further RVPs), to acquire and dispose of Shares (through the Custodian) on the FSM to facilitate trades and liquidity in that market. The principal duties of the RVPs are to ensure the smooth execution of transactions and improve liquidity through continuous quoting of both buy and sell orders with a contracted maximum spread between the buy and sell prices quoted. A key role of the RVPs is to ensure that the spread between buy and sell prices is restricted to a narrow range. 14. Under the Constitution, RVPs must hold, in aggregate, rights or interests in no more than 5% of the total Shares on issue at any time, excluding treasury stock (such Shares being held in the name of the Custodian in trust for the RVP). Fonterra and the RVPs have not and will not enter into a risk sharing agreement, however where the RVP is suspended from selling economic rights in relation to Fonterra shares to the FSF, Fonterra will compensate the RVP for certain trading losses suffered by the RVP. 15. Like Supplying Shareholders, RVPs are also able to participate in the FSF. This promotes price convergence between the FSM and the FSF. The Unit Trustee, the Manager and the Custodian 16. Fonterra appointed the initial Unit Trustee as trustee of the FSF. The Unit Trustee holds a licence under the Securities Trustees and Statutory Supervisors Act 2011. 17. Fonterra also appointed the initial Manager of the FSF. The initial Manager is a company wholly owned by Trustees Executors Limited. Under the Unit Trusts Act 1960, the role of the Manager is to manage the investments of the FSF and issue Units to the public. The Manager manages the FSF as an investment vehicle and does not undertake an active role (such as actively soliciting farmers to sell economic rights in their Shares). Fonterra provided a licence (the Licence) to the Manager to use Fonterra's name and brand for the purposes of the FSF. 18. The Unit Trustee and Manager are party to an arrangement (the Funding Arrangement) with Fonterra under which Fonterra provides the FSF with funds at the start of each financial year to cover the reasonable expenses incurred by the 4 FSF, or the Manager, on behalf of the FSF (Operating Expenses) in accordance with a Budget agreed between the parties. 19. The Custodian is a limited liability company set up to hold legal title to Shares. The Custodian holds legal title to any Shares in which economic rights have been sold to the FSF, and holds the economic rights in Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee (under the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust). The Custodian also holds legal title to any Shares acquired by the RVP, on trust for the RVP (under a separate trust from the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust). 20. The Custodian is wholly-owned the Farmer Trustees, as trustees of the Fonterra Farmer Custodian Trust. The Fonterra Farmer Custodian Trust is a trust set up for the sole purpose of holding the shares in the Custodian and the Fonterra Unit, which confers on the holder rights to prevent certain changes to the Unit Trust Deed (see further discussion at paragraph 38 below). The Farmer Trustees are three farmer representatives (a farmer directly elected by Supplying Shareholders, a director of Fonterra elected by Supplying Shareholders, and a member of the Fonterra Shareholders' Council). The discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are Supplying Shareholders and Fonterra is the final beneficiary of the trust. 21. The Custodian (and the FSF) do not have any voting rights in Fonterra under Fonterra's Constitution, which restricts voting rights to Supplying Shareholders (ie production based voting rights), except at a meeting of an interest group where there would otherwise be no shareholder entitled to vote at that meeting under clause 24.2(c) of the Constitution. Under clause 7.8 of the Constitution, the Authorised Fund Contract is required to prohibit the FSF and the Custodian from exercising, controlling or exerting any influence over any voting rights attached to the Shares. The Unit Trust Deed and Custody Trust Deed also contain provisions preventing the FSF and the Custodian from exercising any influence over voting rights attached to the Shares. 22. Under clause 7.1 of the Custody Trust Deed, the income of the Fonterra Economic Rights Trust includes amounts of deemed income that arise under tax law and the Custodian is permitted to distribute this income to the FSF. Operation of the FSF 23. The operation of the FSF is described in the paragraphs below. 24. Supplying Shareholders, RVPs and Fonterra can transfer economic rights in Shares to the FSF. In this context, "economic rights in Shares" means the rights to receive dividends and other benefits derived from a Share, including any change in value of the Share, as well as the other rights and benefits comprised in the Share. It does not include any right to hold the legal title to a Share or a security convertible to a Share, or to exercise production-based voting rights. 25. The process for selling economic rights in Shares to the FSF involves two steps: • Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, and Fonterra transfer legal title to a Share to the Custodian (legal title to the Share does not pass to the FSF); and 5 • The Custodian holds the economic rights in the Shares on trust for the Unit Trustee. 26. The economic rights in Shares are the FSF's only material asset. Under clause 7.5 of the Constitution, the aggregate number of Shares in which the FSF may acquire economic rights is limited to 20 percent of the total number of Shares on issue (excluding treasury stock). If this limit is exceeded the Board of Fonterra is obliged to take steps to bring the number of Shares in respect of which the economic rights are held for the FSF back within the limit within an appropriate timeframe (clause 7.6 of the Constitution). 27. Units in the FSF are issued by the Manager upon the Custodian receiving a Share, which gives rise to the receipt of economic rights in a Share by the FSF. In addition, if Fonterra issues further Shares in respect of a Share held by the Custodian (in respect of which economic rights are being held in favour of the Unit Trustee), the FSF will issue a corresponding number of Units to its Unit Holders pursuant to clauses 15.1(d) and (e) of the Unit Trust Deed. This ensures that the number of Shares placed with the Custodian in which economic rights are being held in favour of the Unit Trustee will always equal the number of Units on issue. Clauses 15.1(a) and (b) of the Unit Trust Deed provide for the payment of cash dividends or other cash benefits to Unit Holders, mirroring payments on the Shares, as follows: a) upon receipt of a cash dividend or other cash Benefits (other than a Supplementary Dividend) paid by Fonterra, this will be distributed to Unit Holders who were recorded in the Register at the same time and on the same record date as applied by Fonterra to determine the entitlement to the cash dividend or other cash Benefits. The amount to be paid or transferred to each such Unit Holder in respect of each Unit held by that Unit Holder as at that time, will be equal to the amount Fonterra paid or transferred per Share adjusted to take into account any Tax Liability of the Trust relating to the Unit Holder or any adjustments in accordance with section HM 48 of the Tax Act, and less any non-resident withholding tax deducted in respect of the Unit Holder in accordance with subpart RF of the Tax Act pursuant to section HM 44B of the Tax Act and less any sum authorised in accordance with an Extraordinary Resolution pursuant to paragraph 11.1(b)(viii) of Schedule 1; b) upon receipt of any Supplementary Dividend paid by Fonterra, this will be distributed to the Unit Holders that entitled Fonterra to apply section LP 2 of the Tax Act and receive a tax credit for the Supplementary Dividend; 28. Each Supplying Shareholder or RVP who transfers Shares to the Custodian (in which economic rights have been sold to the FSF) receives either one Unit in the FSF for each such economic right in a Share transferred or a cash sum (clause 5.1 of the Unit Trust Deed) in recognition of the transfer of the economic right in the Share to the FSF. Units received by Supplying Shareholders in consideration for the transfers of Shares to the Custodian (in which economic rights have been sold to the FSF) are not able to be retained by the relevant Supplying Shareholder, and must be sold on the NZX Main Board or ASX to settle a sale contract previously entered into on the relevant market. 29. Supplying Shareholders who sold economic rights in "wet" Shares to the FSF as part of the establishment of Trading Among Farmers (and as part of a subsequent one-off offer by Fonterra to purchase Units in October 2012) also received "vouchers" that count towards the share standard and support production-based voting rights and the right to full share backed milk price (clause 5.3 of the Unit Trust Deed). Fonterra's Constitution gives the Fonterra Board the discretion to 6 permit Supplying Shareholders to sell the economic rights in "wet" Shares to the FSF on a day-to-day basis and (subject to individual limits) to receive "vouchers" in partial consideration for the sale of those economic rights. While the Board keeps this policy under review, Supplying Shareholders are not currently entitled to sell economic rights in "wet" Shares to the FSF or to receive "vouchers" in connection with such sale. 30. Under the Unit Trust Deed, each Unit issued by the FSF evidences the entitlement of the holder to the economic benefits (including distributions and other benefits) in the whole of the trust fund. As the number of Units issued by the FSF equals the number of Shares held by the Custodian (in which economic rights are being held in favour of the Unit Trustee), in effect each Unit provides rights to receive the distributions and other benefits in respect of one Share. Individuals and their associates are permitted to hold no more than 15% of the lesser of the total number of Units on issue or the total voting rights in the FSF under clause 6.1 of the Unit Trust Deed. 31. The Units in the FSF (including the Fonterra Unit discussed in more detail below, at paragraphs 38 and 39) carry in respect of the FSF a right to vote or participate in any decision-making concerning at least one of the following: • a dividend or other distribution to be paid or made by the FSF; or • any variation to the Unit Trust Deed. 32. Clause 4.1(c) of the Unit Trust Deed sets out that the Units do not confer any interest in certain amounts under the Unit Trust Deed, as follows: c) Unless the Manager directs otherwise, Units shall not confer any interest in interest income of the Trust. Units shall not confer any interest in monies paid to the Trustee or the Manager to meet their fees or to reimburse either of those parties for (or any advance payment in respect of) any expenses, liabilities, losses and costs incurred by them respectively in or about acting as Trustee or Manager (as the case may be) under this Deed. In all cases, all interest income and such monies will be applied by the Manager to meet the fees and expenses, liabilities, losses and costs incurred by the Manager or the Trustee in or about acting as Manager or Trustee (as the case may be). 33. The FSF Units trade on a registered market (the NZX Main Board and ASX) in which Supplying Shareholders, RVPs, Fonterra and other Public Investors may participate. Standard listing rules (but with various exemptions to those rules recognising that it is a unit trust and to accommodate other characteristics of Trading Among Farmers) apply to the FSF. Fonterra and the FSF co-operate with each other in relation to matters such as disclosure of information, to enable the FSF to comply with the listing rules applicable to the FSF. 34. Supplying Shareholders, RVPs and Fonterra are able to exchange Units for Shares subject to various limits, but no other investor is able to do this (clause 9 of the Unit Trust Deed). For example, if a Supplying Shareholder, Fonterra or an RVP wished to acquire a Share, it could do so by either buying a Share on the FSM, or by buying a Unit and presenting that Unit to the Unit Trustee for redemption and demanding that the Trustee procure the Custodian to transfer to it (or in the case of the RVP, to the Custodian to hold on trust for the RVP) one Share. 35. Under clauses 6.5 and 7.8 of the Constitution and clause 15.2 of the Unit Trust Deed, neither the RVPs nor the FSF (or the Custodian in relation to either) is 7 entitled to exercise any voting rights attached to Shares which are from time to time held for them by the Custodian (except on an interest group resolution where otherwise no shareholder can vote, clause 24.2(c) of the Constitution). 36. Except as noted in paragraph 34 above, no Unit Holder is entitled or permitted to require the transfer to that Unit Holder of any of the property of the FSF, or any Share. The Unit Trustee covenants that it will not call for a transfer of the Shares (clause 4.8 of the Custody Trust Deed). In addition, no Unit Holder may redeem their Units for cash other than as described in clause 15.1(h) of the Unit Trust Deed. However, Unit Holders may sell their Units to other investors on the NZX Main Board or ASX. 37. In addition to dividends, which are expected to be paid twice a year, other potential distributions in respect of the Shares include: • taxable and non-taxable bonus issues; • in -specie distributions of property; • share buy-backs; • dividend reinvestment schemes; • renounceable and non-renounceable rights issues; and • notional distributions. 38. The Farmer Trustees hold one Unit in the FSF (the Fonterra Unit) which has special, essentially veto, rights (clauses 4.5 to 4.8 of the Unit Trust Deed). This requires the Farmer Trustees' approval, for example, to an amendment, removal or alteration of a provision of the Unit Trust Deed where that amendment, removal or alteration would change: • the governance structure of the Board of the Manager; • the scope and role of the trust fund; • the obligation of the trust to facilitate the exchange of a Share for a Unit or a Unit for a Share; or • the limit of 15% on the number of Units that can be held by any person or their associated persons (other than Fonterra or a wholly owned subsidiary of Fonterra); or • the terms of the Fonterra Unit. 39. The rights of the Fonterra Unit to proceeds and distributions from the FSF are the same as for all other Units (clause 4.5(h) of the Unit Trust Deed). 40. Section 16 of the Dairy Industry Restructuring Amendment Act 2012 inserted a new s 161A and 161B into the DIRA to allow Fonterra to hold Units in the FSF. Fonterra maintains a unitholding in the FSF which may increase or decrease, but it will always hold at least one Unit. In respect of Units held by Fonterra, the DIRA prevents Fonterra from exercising any voting rights carried by those Units (s 161A(i)). 41. The FSF may derive income other than from the Shares held by the Custodian on its behalf such as interest on cash held in a bank account and amounts received 8 under the Funding Arrangement (Other Income). To the extent the Fund derives Other Income, clause 4.1(c) of the Unit Trust Deed provides that no Unit Holder has an interest in such Other Income, unless the Manager directs otherwise. Any Other Income which is available to the FSF is and will be paid to the Unit Trustee as part of the fees due to the Unit Trustee. Transitioning to the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 42. The FSF will constitute a "managed investment scheme" for the purposes of the Financial Market Conduct Act 2013 (FMCA). The FSF has until 1 December 2016 to meet the requirements of the FMCA. Accordingly, prior to 1 December 2016, various amendments will be made to the Unit Trust Deed in order to comply with the FMCA, and consequential changes will be made to a number of documents including the Authorised Fund Contract. The FSF will no longer be a "unit trust" under the Unit Trusts Act 1960, as that Act has been repealed (although transitional provisions apply until 1 December 2016). Conditions stipulated by the Commissioner This Ruling is made subject to the following conditions: a) The requirements of ss HM 55D(5), (6) and (7), HM 55E, HM 55F and HM 55FB are met in relation to notified foreign investors in the FSF. b) The FSF is not treated under any double tax agreement as not being resident in New Zealand. c) The FSF is not in the business of life insurance. d) 90% or more of the FSF's investments (by value of its assets) are investments of a type referred to in s HM 11, other than an interest in land in New Zealand or a right or option in relation to land in New Zealand, in accordance with s HM 19C(1). e) 90% or more of the income derived by the FSF is of a type referred to in s HM 12, other than an amount derived from an interest in land in New Zealand or the disposal of an interest in land in New Zealand, in accordance with s HM 19C(2). For the avoidance of doubt, this condition will not be breached if any failure to meet the requirement of s HM 12 is not “significant and within control of the FSF” and is remedied by the last day of the next quarter, in accordance with s HM 25. f) The FSF has not lost its PIE status through the application of s HM 25, s HM 27 and/or s HM 29. g) The FSF has not changed its election to use the exit calculation option in s HM 42. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to any condition stated above, the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The FSF qualifies as a "foreign investment variable-rate PIE" (as defined in s YA 1). 9 b) The FSF's interest in the Shares is an investment of a type referred to in s HM 11. c) Income derived by the FSF from its interest in the Shares is income of a type referred to in s HM 12. d) Income attributed by the FSF to its investors is "excluded income" (as defined in s BD 1(3)) of the investor under s CX 56(3) provided that: • the prescribed investor rate for the investor is more than zero and not more than the investor’s notified investor rate when the PIE calculates its income tax liability under s HM 47, or makes a voluntary payment under s HM 45; or • the investor is one of those listed in s CX 56(1B); and • the amount is not an amount of attributed PIE income that is derived by a trustee who has chosen a prescribed investor rate referred to in sch 6, table 1, row 5 or 7, as applicable; and • the investor is not a new New Zealand resident to whom s HM 57B would have applied but who has chosen not to apply that section to determine their prescribed investor rate for a "resident year" (as defined in s HM 57B(3)). e) Where a Permitted Person acquires a Share on redemption of a Unit, and is entitled to a deduction under ss DA 1 and/or DB 23, the cost or amount of expenditure incurred in acquiring the Share for the purposes of those sections will be the market value of the redeemed Unit on the day it was redeemed. f) The redemption of a Unit in the FSF by a Unit Holder, in exchange for a Share, will not give rise to a dividend under ss CD 4 to CD 6. g) Any distributions from the FSF are excluded income of each Unit Holder under s CX 56B (and therefore not taxable), other than where the FSF elects to pay non- resident withholding tax in accordance with s HM 44B in respect of the distribution. h) The Arrangement is not subject to s BG 1. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 1 December 2015 and ending on 31 December 2020. This Ruling is signed by me on the 21 st day of December 2015. Fiona Heiford Manager (Taxpayer Rulings) 10

PRODUCT RULING – BR PRD 16/02 This is a product ruling made under s 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Name of the Person who applied for the Ruling This Ruling has been applied for by SKYCITY Entertainment Group Limited (SKYCITY) (IRD No: 62-854-472). Taxation Laws All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 unless otherwise stated. This Ruling applies in respect of ss BG 1, CA 1(2), CE 1, CX 2, GA 1, HC 6, HC 7 and subpart CE. This Ruling does not rule on or consider whether particular Participants hold their Plan Shares on capital account. The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The Arrangement is the Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan 2009 (the Incentive Plan), which applies to executives (referred to as the Participants) of the SKYCITY Group, a group of companies wholly owned by SKYCITY. In summary, under the Incentive Plan, SKYCITY Auckland Holdings Limited (SKYCITY Auckland) advances to the trustee of the SKYCITY Executive Share Trust (the Trustee), as agent for the Participants, funds that are used to purchase SKYCITY shares (the Plan Shares). The Plan Shares are then held on trust for a restrictive period (usually three years). At the end of the restrictive period, if the Participant has met various performance hurdles, SKYCITY will pay to the Participant a cash bonus equal to the original Loan grossed up for tax, which will be used to repay the Loan, and the legal title in the Plan Shares will be transferred to the Participant. If the performance hurdles are not met, call or put options will be exercised so that the Trustee will be required to purchase the Plan Shares from the Participant for an amount equal to the amount of the outstanding Loan, settled by way of novation of the Loan to the Trustee. Further details of the Arrangement are set out in the paragraphs below. Office of the Chief Tax Counsel Te Tari o te Rōia Tāke Matua Asteron Centre 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Telephone: 04 890-1500 Facsimile Numbers: Chief Tax Counsel: 04 978-1630 Taxpayer Rulings: 04 978-1628 Escalations & Advising: 04 978-1630 Disputes Review: 04 978-1630 Public Rulings: 04 978-1633 2 Relevant documents 1. The documents relevant to the Arrangement are: • Pro Forma Offer Letter from SKYCITY to employees of SKYCITY Group (Offer Letter); • SKYCITY Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan Application Form (Application Form); • Executive Long-Term Incentive Plan Terms 2009 (versions dated 25 January 2011 and 17 October 2014) (Terms); • SKYCITY Simplified Disclosure Prospectus (versions dated 24 January 2011 and 14 August 2013) (Prospectus), which includes the Performance Hurdle Memorandum as a schedule (Hurdle Memo); • Deed of Trust relating to the SKYCITY long-term incentive plans dated 3 November 2009 (Trust Deed) entered into between SKYCITY and Public Trust (acting as the Trustee). 2. The documents, including those relating to future grants under the Arrangement, will be materially the same as those provided to Inland Revenue on 23 November 2015 and 11 December 2015. Objectives of the Incentive Plans 3. The primary objective of the Incentive Plan is to encourage executives to become shareholders in SKYCITY, thus aligning their interests with those of other shareholders. The Incentive Plan: • aims to reward and retain key employees; • drives long-term performance and alignment of incentives of participants with the interests of SKYCITY's shareholders; and • encourages long-term decision-making. The Arrangement Invitation 4. Potential participants in the Incentive Plan are provided with an Offer Letter and the Application Form. These documents provide details of the number of Plan Shares offered, the price of the Plan Shares, and the terms of the grant, including terms surrounding the Loan (discussed further below). Potential participants also receive details of the performance hurdles, which are attached as a schedule to the Prospectus. 5. The Participant may accept the grant by signing and returning the Application Form within a prescribed timeframe. In accepting the grant, the Participant acknowledges that they are bound by the Terms. 6. To date, there have been seven grant dates for the Incentive Plan, as follows: • 2 September 2009 3 • 31 August 2010 • 2 March 2011 • 31 August 2011 • 29 August 2012 • 28 August 2013 • 27 August 2014 7. All New Zealand Participants are employed by SKYCITY Management Limited, which is associated with SKYCITY for the purposes of the Act. The Participants are not associated with SKYCITY or any of its subsidiaries for the purposes of the Act. Terms of loan 8. On acceptance of the grant, SKYCITY Auckland advances an interest-free loan (the Loan) to the Trustee on behalf of, and at the request of, the Participant, solely for the purpose of purchasing the Plan Shares (cl 9(vii) of the Application Form and cl 4.4 of the Terms). 9. The Loan is only repayable by the application of a bonus payment if the performance hurdles are met or, if the performance hurdles are not met, by way of the novation arrangements that are triggered by the exercise of the put or call options (discussed further below) (cl 9(i) of the Application Form and cl 4.4 of the Terms). The Loan is repayable at the end of the restrictive period and otherwise in accordance with the Terms (cl 4.5 of the Terms). 10. The restrictive period is the period commencing when a beneficial interest is acquired by the Participant and ending when the performance hurdle has first been met (definition of Restrictive Period in the Terms). The restrictive period usually runs for three years. However, if the performance hurdles are not met at the initial performance testing date, there is a second and third testing date (being six and 12 months respectively after the initial performance testing date) that extend the restrictive period (explained in the Hurdle Memo). 11. Any dividends received in respect of a Participant’s Plan Shares during the restrictive period (after the deduction of any tax) must be applied to partially repay the relevant Participant's Loan amount (cl 9(ii) of the Application Form and cl 4.8 of the Terms). Acquisition and holding of Plan Shares 12. The Trustee uses the Loan proceeds to acquire Plan Shares on behalf of a Participant. The Trustee either acquires the shares on-market, is issued shares (either new or Treasury Stock) by SKYCITY, or transfers Plan Shares from the Unallocated Pool of Plan Shares that the Trustee already holds (cl 3.2 of the Terms and rules 1.1 and 5.5 of sch 1 to the Trust Deed). 13. The amount a Participant must pay for the Plan Shares is the volume weighted average sales price on the NZX Main Board over the ten business days commencing on the first business day following the company’s Preliminary Full 4 Year or Half Year Announcement, whichever is applicable (cl 4.1, and the definition of Offer Price in the Terms). 14. In respect of the Plan Shares, each Participant has the right to: • all cash dividends, capital returns or other cash distributions (cl 4.6 of the Terms) (SKYCITY will maintain a dividend-paying policy throughout the term of the Incentive Plans); and • exercise voting rights, either directly or by way of instructing the Trustee (cl 9.1 of the Terms). 15. During the restrictive period, a Participant cannot sell, transfer, mortgage, charge or otherwise encumber or dispose of the Plan Shares (cl 3 of the Application Form and cl 5.2 of the Terms). 16. Clause 2.11 of the Prospectus provides that, if a Participant requests to withdraw from the Incentive Plan prior to the end of the restrictive period, that Participant must transfer the beneficial interest in the Shares back to the Trustee under the terms of the Put and Call Options. However, the Applicant has confirmed that, despite this clause, Participants are required to obtain approval from the Board of SKYCITY to withdraw from the Incentive Plan. The Applicant has confirmed that approval will only be considered in situations provided for in cl 2.13 of the Prospectus, which applies in situations of “serious hardship”. For the avoidance of doubt, a situation where the value of the Plan Shares falls below the original purchase price paid by the Participant for those Plan Shares will not amount to “serious hardship”. This Ruling will cease to apply if the Participants do withdraw from the Incentive Plan other than for reasons of “serious hardship”, or as a result of ceasing to be employed with the SKYCITY Group, as discussed at \[35\] to \[36\]. Clause 10 of the Terms provides for corporate actions that may occur during the restrictive period. This includes consolidation or subdivision of shares, bonus issues, rights offers and share buy-backs. In these situations, cl 10 provides for any changes in the number of Plan Shares held on behalf of a Participant. Clause 10 also provides for what will happen if there is a takeover offer or amalgamation. In particular, cl 10 states when a Participant may be entitled to bring forward the performance testing date to determine whether Plan Shares will vest or be forfeited. The process for determining whether Plan Shares will vest or be forfeited is discussed further below. 17. The Trustee holds the Plan Shares as trustee on behalf of the Participant pursuant to the Terms and the Trust Deed. The Trustee is required to act in the interests of the Participants (cl 9.2 of the Terms). The Trustee must maintain an account for each Participant detailing the number of Plan Shares allocated and the Loan balance (rule 10.1 of sch 1 of the Trust Deed). 18. The Applicant considers that the SKYCITY Executive Share Trust is a "complying trust", as defined in s HC 10. Performance hurdles and vesting 19. Under the Incentive Plan, each Participant’s right to retain the Plan Shares allocated to them is dependent on the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) achieved by 5 SKYCITY relative to comparable companies and other companies on the New Zealand and Australian share markets. 20. Plan Shares will be transferred to the Participants if SKYCITY achieves a TSR greater than or equal to the average of the: • Peer Median TSR – the TSR representing the 50th percentile of the TSRs of members of the Peer Comparative Group. The Peer Comparative Group is generally a group of 16 entities the Board of SKYCITY (Board) considers to be appropriate peers of SKYCITY. • Index Median TSR – the TSR representing the 50th percentile TSR of NZX50 companies at the date the Participant first acquires a beneficial interest in the Plan Shares. 21. If this hurdle is met, legal title in the Plan Shares is transferred to Participants on a straight-line basis from a 50% transfer if the SKYCITY TSR equals the 50th percentile, to a 100% transfer if the SKYCITY TSR is equal to the 75th percentile. In addition, the Board has discretion to determine that up to 25% of the Plan Shares can be transferred to the Participants if SKYCITY’s TSR for the relevant assessment period does not exceed the average of the Peer Median TSR and Index Median TSR, but exceeds one or other of the Peer Median TSR or Index Median TSR. 22. All grants for the Incentive Plan have the same performance hurdles as those set out above, apart from the 27 August 2014 grant. For this grant, 50% of the Plan Shares were allocated to the Peer Median TSR Tranche and 50% of the Plan Shares were allocated to the Index Median TSR Tranche. Vesting of the Plan Shares in each Tranche is not interdependent. Therefore, the Board does not have discretion to determine that up to 25% of the Plan Shares can be transferred to the Participant if both hurdles are not met. If the performance hurdles are achieved 23. To the extent that the performance hurdles are met, the Participant’s employer or SKYCITY pays a cash bonus equal to the value of the original Loan to the Participant, grossed up based on the top marginal tax rate at the time the beneficial interest in the Plan Shares was acquired (cl 7.1 of the Terms). The after-tax amount of the bonus is paid to the Trustee and applied to repay the Loan balance (cl 7.2 of the Terms). 24. If dividends or other distributions have been received in relation to the Plan Shares during the restrictive period and applied in part payment of the Loan, the outstanding Loan balance is less than the after-tax amount of the bonus. In this situation, the balance of the bonus payment is paid to the Participant (cl 7.3 of the Terms). 25. In the 28 August 2013 and 27 August 2014 grants, cl 7.2 also stipulates that third-party source deductions (eg KiwiSaver, student loan or child support payments) should be deducted from the bonus payment. This may result in situations where the bonus does not fully cover the amount of the Loan balance. In that situation, the Participant is liable to pay the outstanding Loan balance (para 2.10 of the Prospectus). 6 26. The Trustee is required to transfer the legal title in the Plan Shares that vest as a result of meeting the performance hurdles within one month of the relevant performance testing date (cl 6.2 of the Terms). However, with the exception of the circumstances discussed at \[34\] to \[35\] below, the Plan Shares only vest if the Participant remains employed with the SKYCITY Group, and the Loan is repaid in full (cl 6.3 of the Terms). If the performance hurdles are not met 27. To the extent performance hurdles are not met, no cash bonus is paid (cl 7.1 of the Terms). 28. In addition, to the extent performance hurdles are not met, the Participant is required to forfeit their Plan Shares (cl 8 of the Terms). This occurs either by the Trustee exercising a call option requiring the Participant to sell their beneficial interest in the Plan Shares to the Trustee or, failing that, by the Participant exercising a put option requiring the Trustee to purchase the Participant’s beneficial interest in the Plan Shares (cl 8.4 of the Terms). 29. The consideration payable for the forfeited Plan Shares is the outstanding Loan balance relating to those shares. This is satisfied by the Participant novating all their rights and obligations under the Plan Shares and the Loan to the Trustee. After the novation, the Loan is owed by the Trustee to SKYCITY Auckland (cl 9(iv) of the Application Form and cl 8.5 of the Terms). 30. The Participant is not required to reimburse the Trustee for any loss in value of the forfeited Plan Shares compared to the outstanding Loan balance. Conversely, if the forfeited Plan Shares have increased in value, the Participant is not entitled to receive a benefit from the gain (cl 8.6 of the Terms). 31. If a call or demand is made by any person for repayment of the Loan other than in the circumstances expressly permitted (and summarised in this Arrangement Description), the put option will become immediately exercisable by the Participant (cl 9(vi) of the Application Form). 32. Where the Trustee purchases the beneficial interest in a Participant’s Plan Shares, SKYCITY provides the Trustee with a Trustee Loan that the Trustee uses to repay the novated Loan originally granted to the Participant (rule 5.4 of sch 1 of the Trust Deed). The Trustee then holds the Plan Shares in the Unallocated Pool to be allocated to a future Participant at a later date (rule 5.3 of sch 1 of the Trust Deed). 33. Where Plan Shares from the Unallocated Pool are subsequently sold by the Trustee to a future Participant, the amount of the Loan granted to that future Participant, which is used to pay for those Plan Shares, is used by the Trustee to repay any outstanding Trustee Loans (rule 5.5(d)(i) of sch 1 of the Trust Deed). Any surplus, arising from a difference between the purchase price payable by the future Participant for the Plan Shares and the price the Trustee paid to purchase forfeited Plan Shares, is distributed to SKYCITY as beneficiary income (rule 5.5(d)(iii) of sch 1 of the Trust Deed). 7 Cessation of employment 34. If, in the period of 12 months preceding the initial performance testing date, the Participant: • gives notice terminating their employment as a result of a material change to the terms and conditions of employment resulting in a diminution of the Participant’s status and responsibility without consent (definition of Fundamental Change in the Terms); or • has their employment terminated without cause; the Participant’s Plan Shares continue to be held by the Trustee for the Participant until the first performance testing date. If the Plan Shares do not vest in the Participant at that date, the Plan Shares are forfeited as discussed above (cl 11.2 of the Terms). 35. If the Participant ceases to be employed as a result of an involuntary event (eg death, redundancy or medical incapacity), and the cessation date is on or after the date half way through the period from acquisition of the Plan Shares to the initial performance testing date, the Board may determine that some or all of the Plan Shares be transferred to the Participant at its discretion (cl 11.3 of the Terms). However, for Participants involved in the 27 August 2014 grant, where employment ceases due to medical incapacity or permanent disability, then the Plan Shares vest on a straight-line basis depending on the time elapsed from the acquisition date to the cessation date, and such vesting is not subject to the performance hurdles. 36. If the Participant ceases to be employed for any other reason, the Plan Shares are forfeited (cl 11.1 if the Terms). 37. For the avoidance of any doubt, this Ruling only applies to the extent that any of the events described in the Arrangement Description above occur during the period of this Ruling. How the Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement The Taxation Laws apply to the Arrangement as follows: a) The Trustee’s purchase of the Plan Shares on behalf of a Participant does not give rise to any income to that Participant under subpart CE, provided the value of the Plan Shares on the date they are acquired by the Trustee on behalf of the Participant is equal to the price payable by the Participant for those Plan Shares. b) Cash bonuses paid by SKYCITY or SKYCITY Management Limited to eligible Participants are income of the Participant under s CE 1(1)(a). c) The transfer of legal title in the Plan Shares to a Participant does not result in the Participant deriving income under ss CA 1(2), CE 1(1) or HC 6. d) Where the Trustee derives dividends on Plan Shares that are held on behalf of the Participants, such distributions constitute “beneficiary income” of the relevant Participant in accordance with s HC 6 and not “trustee income” under s HC 7. 8 e) When a Participant transfers their beneficial interest in the Plan Shares to the Trustee following the exercise of the call or put option: • the Participant will not derive income under s CE 1; and • no fringe benefit tax will arise under s CX 2. f) Sections BG 1 and GA 1 do not apply to the Arrangement. The period or income year for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period beginning on 7 April 2016 and ending on 6 April 2019. This Ruling is signed by me on the 7 th day of April 2016. Howard Davis Director (Taxpayer Rulings)
