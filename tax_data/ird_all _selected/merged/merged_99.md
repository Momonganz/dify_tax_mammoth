The proposed changes would: • limit the deductibility of interest on residential investment property • introduce a five-year bright-line period for owners of new build properties • amend the current bright-line rules to accommodate the proposed changes • provide employers with another option for paying fringe benefit tax, and • clarify the application of the business continuity test for carrying forward losses. The proposed changes would amend the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. This Commentary provides information on the proposed changes. The structure of the Commentary follows the sequential process taxpayers would adopt to apply the proposed interest limitation changes. Interest limitation The interest limitation reform proposed is part of the Government’s initiatives to address housing affordability. The aim of the reform is to reduce investor demand for residential property. Many landlords invest in residential property expecting a large capital gain when they sell the property. The current tax system allows landlords to deduct all interest expenditure for residential rental property, even if no tax is paid on any capital gain on sale. The proposals would limit the deductibility of interest expenses incurred by residential property investors from 1 October 2021. The extent of the limitation would depend on whether the property was acquired on or after 27 March 2021. Summary of key proposals • Disallowed residential property subject to interest limitation: Property that is commonly and foreseeably used to provide residential accommodation on a long-term basis and is (or could be) used as an owner-occupied residence would be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. This property is referred to as disallowed residential property (DRP). • Excepted residential land: Certain types of property not suitable for long-term residential accommodation, and which cannot easily be substituted for such, would be excluded from DRP and not subject to the proposed interest limitation rules. • Application to certain companies: The provision allowing for an automatic deduction of interest for most companies would be overridden for certain close companies and companies whose assets are primarily DRP. These companies would be required to trace the use of their borrowed funds and would be denied deductions for interest incurred on borrowings used to derive income from DRP. 8 • Interposed entities: Interposed entity rules would ensure taxpayers could not claim interest deductions for borrowings used to acquire DRP indirectly through an interposed entity. • Exemptions: Land businesses, property development and new builds would be exempt from the interest limitation rules. • Interest subject to limitation: From 1 October 2021, deductions would be denied for interest incurred in deriving income from DRP acquired on or after 27 March 2021 (subject to certain exceptions). For DRP acquired before this date, deductions for such interest would be progressively denied over the period between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. DRP owners would be required to trace the use of their borrowed funds to ensure the limitation is applied to interest incurred on borrowings used to derive income from the DRP. The same tracing approach as currently applies (that is, tracing funds borrowed to taxable and non-taxable purposes to determine the deductibility of interest on a loan – unless the borrower is a company) would apply for loans used to fund DRP. This would include borrowings to fund expenses incurred in deriving income from the DRP, for example, interest on borrowings to pay a rental property’s rates (although the deductibility of the underlying rates expenditure would not be affected by the interest limitation rules). • Interest deductions on taxable sale of property: Interest deductions would be allowed on the taxable sale of the DRP. Bright-line test changes As another part of the Government’s initiatives to improve housing affordability, the Supplementary Order Paper also proposes several changes to the bright-line rules for sales of residential land be added to the Bill. Summary of key proposals • Bright-line test for new builds: Owners of new builds would be subject to a 5-year bright-line period, rather than the current 10-year period. • Amendment to main home exclusion: The portion of land attributable to the main home would not generally be taxed on disposal under either the 10-year or 5-year new build bright-line tests. • Rollover relief: Limited extensions to rollover relief from the bright-line test would be available for some common ownership change scenarios where economic ownership has not changed or is materially the same as it was before.

The definition would exclude “excepted residential land”. Application date The proposed amendments would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application from 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new subpart DH would introduce the interest limitation rules. These rules would deny an interest deduction for interest incurred for disallowed residential property (DRP) on or after 1 October 2021. Proposed new section DH 5 would define the key terms that give the scope of the land and property subject to the interest limitation regime. The relevant terms are “disallowed residential property” (DRP) (defined in subsection (2)) and “excepted residential land” (defined in subsection (3) and proposed new schedule 15). The proposed definition of DRP covers any land in New Zealand to the extent to which it has a place configured as a residence or abode, the owner has an arrangement to erect such a place, or it is bare land on which such a place could be erected. Note that the definition is proposed to apply to structures that could be used as a residence or abode. Whether they are used as such is not considered by the proposed definition. Excepted residential land would be excluded from being DRP. Excepted residential land is described in proposed new schedule 15. Where a single parcel of land contains both a place configured as a residence or abode and a structure that is listed in schedule 15 as being excepted residential land, apportionment principles would apply to exclude the part that is excepted residential land. This means that the proposed interest limitation rules would only apply to the portion of the land that relates to the residence or abode. 12 Background The proposed new interest limitation rules should apply to properties that are, or could be, commonly and foreseeably used to provide long-term residential accommodation. The focus should be on whether a property is physically configured or structured in such a way that could support the use of the property as a self-contained private residence. Effectively, the rule should apply to property that could be used for private owner-occupation. In practice, this would mean most houses and apartments would be subject to interest limitation unless a specific exclusion applies. A focus on use as long-term residential accommodation was not considered to be appropriate. This was because property owners would be able to circumvent the rules by changing the use of the property (for example, by listing the property on a digital platform for short-stay accommodation) and this could impact the supply of properties available for long-term occupation (either rented or owner-occupied). Broadly speaking, DRP should cover land that has a house, apartment, or flat on it, land on which such a structure is being, or is intended to be, erected, and bare land that could be used for erecting such a structure under the relevant district plan. However, certain types of land and property would be considered “excepted residential land” and would not be subject to interest limitation. This carve-out is necessary to ensure that other buildings on the same parcel of land as a house, apartment or flat would not be subject to interest limitation if they are not configured for residential accommodation – for example, a shop and flat on the same legal title. The proposed exclusions are included for a variety of reasons, such as the existence of regulatory frameworks or conditions of occupation that limit who can occupy or own certain properties, or significant legal or structural barriers preventing properties from being converted into standard residential properties or vice versa. 1 Detailed analysis Disallowed residential property Proposed new section DH 5(2) defines “disallowed residential property” as land in New Zealand to the extent to which: • it has a place configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is used as such (paragraph (a)(i)) • the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a place there, configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is, or is to be, used as such (paragraph (a)(ii)), or • it is bare land that, under rules in the relevant operative district plan, may be used for erecting a place there configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is, or is to be, used as such (paragraph (a)(iii)). In each case, it includes any appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with the place. 2 1 For more on this, see the “Excepted residential land – schedule 15” section of this Commentary. 2 A common example of an appurtenance is a driveway or path. 13 Residential properties that are not in New Zealand would not be DRP and would therefore not be subject to interest limitation under subpart DH. The proposed definition is based on the existing definitions of “residential land” and “dwelling” used for other purposes in the Income Tax Act 2007, but it has the benefit of being self-contained within proposed new subpart DH. Land would not be considered DRP, and therefore would not be subject to interest limitation, to the extent to which it is “excepted residential land” (proposed new section DH 5(2)(b)). Excepted residential land “Excepted residential land” is defined in proposed new section DH 5(3) as land to the extent to which it is described in proposed new schedule 15. The contents of schedule 15 are described in more detail in the “Excepted residential land – schedule 15” section of this Commentary. Use of the phrase “to the extent” means that where some areas of a given parcel of land or property meet the criteria but others do not, a reasonable apportionment would have to be made according to general tax apportionment principles. This would usually only be relevant where the different structures are on the same legal title. Where they are on separate legal titles, the accompanying loans may be structured separately, making it straightforward to distinguish between interest that relates to excepted residential land and interest that relates to the DRP. Example 1: Dual purpose land and interest limitation Tāmati owns a two-storey building with mixed residential and commercial use. The ground floor is a clothing store, and the upper storey is rented out as long-term residential accommodation. The whole building is on a single legal title. Tāmati has one loan that relates to the whole property. Tāmati’s building is DRP to the extent it is configured as a residence or abode and to the extent it is not excepted residential land. The upper-storey apartment would therefore constitute DRP, but the clothing store on the ground floor would not. Following standard principles for apportionment, Tāmati calculates that the clothing store on the ground floor accounts for 55%, and the upper storey for 45%, of the interest paid on his loan. Therefore, Tāmati would be subject to interest limitation under subpart DH for 45% of his interest expense, as this would be interest that relates to DRP. For the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025, a portion of the 45% would be denied in accordance with the table in proposed section DH 8(2). 14 SOCIAL, EMERGENCY, TRANSITIONAL, AND COUNCIL HOUSING Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 4(4), (5) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would exclude land used by a social housing provider or a council- controlled organisation to provide social, emergency, transitional and council housing from the proposed new interest limitation rules. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application from 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new section DH 4(4) provides that the proposed new interest limitation rules would not apply to interest incurred by a person to the extent the interest is incurred for a dwelling owned or rented by a social housing provider and used by a social housing provider to provide social, emergency or transitional housing. A social housing provider would be defined as a registered community housing provider (CHP), Kāinga Ora–Homes and Communities (Kāinga Ora), or another government department. Proposed new section DH 4(5) provides that the proposed interest limitation rules would not apply to interest incurred by a council-controlled organisation (CCO) to the extent to which the interest is incurred for a CCO-owned dwelling used to provide council housing. Proposed new section DH 4(6) provides that the proposed interest limitation rules would not apply to Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Background Social housing is accommodation provided at low or no cost to individuals, families and whānau who have an income below a specific threshold and are unable to afford or access housing at current market prices. It also aims to support people who are experiencing homelessness or who are at risk of homelessness. Social housing can take a variety of forms, depending on the level and type of need. Types of housing offered include public housing owned by Kāinga Ora, housing offered at below market rent by registered community housing providers, or council housing provided by local authorities. It also includes emergency housing and transitional housing that is provided to people in need while they seek, or are assisted in finding, more permanent accommodation. For most types of social housing, the cost to the individual, family and whānau is calculated according to their household income. The proposed interest limitation rules would not generally affect emergency, transitional or public housing properties owned by Kāinga Ora or CHPs. This is because proposed section DH 4(6) provides that the interest limitation rules would not apply to Kāinga Ora (which is subject to income tax), and CHPs will often be charities and therefore exempt from 15 income tax or subject to another income tax exemption (for example, section CW 42B). However, without a specific carve-out, properties used for emergency, transitional or public housing that are owned by a non-exempt CHP, or leased by private landlords to a CHP, Kāinga Ora, or the Crown, would be subject to the proposed rules. In addition, some council housing is provided by CCOs, which are not exempt from income tax, and would be subject to the rules. Social housing plays an important role in providing accommodation for low-income people in New Zealand. A carve out for social housing in its various forms would ensure that the supply of social housing is not disrupted because these properties are withdrawn from the market. Detailed analysis Social, emergency, and transitional housing Proposed new section DH 4(4) specifies that proposed subpart DH would not apply to interest incurred by a person to the extent to which the interest relates to a dwelling that is owned or rented by a social housing provider and used by a social housing provider for the provision of social housing or temporary accommodation for people in need. A “social housing provider” would be a person who is one or more of the following: • a registered community housing provider under the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 (section DH 4(4)(b)(i)) • Kāinga Ora or a wholly owned subsidiary of Kāinga Ora (section DH 4(4)(b)(ii)), or • a department listed in schedule 2, part 1 of the Public Service Act 2020 (section DH 4(4)(b)(iii)). To qualify for the exemption, the dwelling would have to be used by a social housing provider for the sole purpose of providing: • “social housing” as defined in section 2 of the Public and Community Housing Management Act 1992 (section DH 4(4)(a)(i)), or • temporary accommodation for people in need while they seek, or are assisted in finding, more permanent accommodation (section DH 4(4)(a)(ii)). The proposed exemption would only apply to the extent to which a given dwelling meets at least one of the conditions in each of both proposed sections DH 4(4)(a) and (b). If a property meets a condition in either section DH 4(4)(a) or (b) but not the other, it would be subject to interest limitation. For example, if a house owned by a community housing provider was rented out at normal market rent, and not as social housing, only section DH 4(4)(b) would be satisfied and the exemption from the interest limitation rules would not apply. Proposed section DH 4(4)(b) also provides that the dwelling would need to be either owned or rented by a social housing provider to qualify for the exemption. The social housing provider that owns or rents the dwelling would not need to be the same social housing provider that provides the social, emergency or transitional housing. For example, one entity may be responsible for managing the property portfolio but contract out the client relationship to another entity. In this case, the exemption would still be available. 16 A taxpayer who leases their property to a social housing provider would also be able to qualify for the exemption for the duration of the lease, even if they are not a social housing provider themselves and have no interaction with the individual tenant. However, the exemption would not apply to private property owners who lease their properties directly to low-income tenants, such as tenants in receipt of an accommodation supplement. The social housing exemption in proposed section DH 4(4) would apply on a dwelling-by- dwelling basis. If there are multiple buildings on a single piece of land (residential or commercial) and only of the buildings is used for social, emergency or transitional housing, the exemption would only be available for that particular dwelling. The person claiming the interest deductions may need to apportion their interest expense accordingly. In addition, the whole dwelling would need to be used for social, emergency or transitional housing to qualify for the exemption. If only one room in a dwelling is rented by a social housing provider and the other rooms are rented to third parties, the exemption in section DH 4(4) would not apply. The proposed exemption would cover periods of vacancy between social housing tenants if the property continues to be under lease to the social housing provider during that time. In the case of social housing, the definition in the Public and Community Housing Act 1992 includes premises that are “to be let” as community housing by a CHP or are “to be let” as Kāinga Ora housing. In contrast, for example, if a DRP is occasionally rented by a social housing provider to provide emergency or transitional housing, but no exclusive lease exists for the property, periods of vacancy would not be covered by the exemption. Example 2: Registered community housing providers and periods of vacancy Olivia owns a house in Christchurch and leases it to the Chan Community Housing Trust (CCH Trust), a registered community housing provider, for use as social housing. The lease is for a fixed period of three years starting from 1 July 2021. From 1 October 2021 until 7 June 2022, the CCH Trust rents the house as social housing to Jason. Jason moves out of the house on 7 June 2022. The house is temporarily vacant while the CCH Trust prepares it for another social housing tenant to move in. On 1 August 2022 the CCH Trust begins renting the house as social housing to Rosemary. Olivia’s Christchurch property would be exempt from the interest limitation rules while it is under lease to the CCH Trust. This would include the period it is vacant from 8 June 2022 to 31 July 2022. Example 3: Property occasionally rented by social housing provider Kris owns a house in the Bay of Plenty that is occasionally rented by a social housing provider when the provider requires emergency or transitional housing for its clients. The booking arrangement is on a casual basis and is dependent on the availability of the property, as the property can also be booked by members of the public for short-stay accommodation. During the 2022–23 tax year, the house is rented by the social housing provider for the provision of emergency or transitional housing from 16 June to 31 August, and again from 28 October to 17 November. For the remainder of the year, it is either rented by members of the public or not rented by anyone and vacant. For the 2022–23 tax year, Kris would qualify for the social housing exemption for interest incurred from 16 June to 31 August and from 28 October to 17 November. 17 Council housing Many local authorities around New Zealand provide council housing, similar to social, emergency or transitional housing, at below market rates. While local authorities are generally exempt from income tax under section CW 39, the properties may be owned by taxable CCOs. Proposed new section DH 4(5) specifies that subpart DH would not apply to interest incurred by a CCO to the extent the interest is incurred for a dwelling owned by the CCO and used by the CCO or a local authority for the sole purpose of providing housing to people assessed by a local authority as being eligible for housing at less than market rent. Interest incurred on a property would still be subject to interest limitation if the property is owned by a CCO but not used for council housing – for example, if the CCO provides rental housing at market rates. Note that this exemption would use the definition of “council-controlled organisation” provided in section 6 of the Local Government Act 2002, rather than the existing definition given in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 18 APPLICATION TO COMPANIES Clauses 57B, 64E (proposed sections DH 3, DH 5(4), (8), (9), (10), (11) and DH 12) and 127(7D), (16B) and (16C) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments would apply the interest limitation rules to all companies whose core business involves disallowed residential property (DRP) (other than DRP subject to the land business or development exemptions) and to most close companies that hold DRP. Companies that are not close companies and whose core business does not involve DRP would not have to apply the rules. Application date The proposed amendments would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to companies incurring interest on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Under the proposed amendments, “residential land companies” and “residential land wholly- owned group members” would have to apply the interest limitation rules. These are companies whose core business involves DRP (other than DRP subject to the land business or development exemptions). In general terms, a “residential land company” would be a company where the value of its DRP makes up more than 50 percent of the value of its total assets. A “residential land wholly-owned group member” would be a member of a wholly- owned group where the value of the group’s DRP makes up more than 50 percent of the group’s total assets. In addition, most close companies that own DRP would have to apply the rules, even if they are not a residential land company or a residential land wholly-owned group member. An exception would apply for a close company that is an “exempt Māori company”. An “exempt Māori company” would be a company that meets certain requirements and is not a residential land company or a residential land wholly-owned group member. Background Under current law (section DB 7), companies are generally allowed deductions for interest incurred without having to trace their borrowings or show a nexus with assessable income. There are two main reasons for this: • First, for companies and corporate groups with many different sources of funds, a tracing approach can be extremely difficult to apply. • Second, borrowings in companies will almost always have a nexus with income as taxpayers usually will not put private assets, such as a main home, into a company. This is because companies are legally separate from their shareholders and almost all distributions of value to shareholders are treated for tax purposes as taxable dividends to the shareholder. If a taxpayer put their main home into a company, the value of accommodation provided by the company to the shareholder would become a taxable 19 dividend (whereas the value of accommodation would not be taxed if the shareholder held their main home directly). 3 Since almost all borrowings in companies have a nexus with income, most companies would be able to deduct all their interest expenditure even without section DB 7. However, they may incur high compliance costs to do so. Section DB 7 was therefore intended to remove compliance costs in situations where taxpayers would usually be entitled to deductions anyway. However, for those companies that have to apply the proposed new interest limitation rules in subpart DH, section DB 7 will not apply. Detailed analysis The proposed new interest limitation rules in subpart DH would only apply to those companies included in proposed new section DH 3. All other companies would not be subject to the new rules. Even without proposed new section DH 3, those other companies would usually be able to deduct all their interest expenditure by ensuring that their borrowings are traced to non-DRP assets. Thus, proposed new section DH 3 is intended to reduce these companies’ compliance costs rather than change their tax position. Proposed new section DH 3 provides that the new rules would apply to a company that is: • a close company that is not an exempt Māori company • a residential land company that is not a member of a wholly-owned group, or • a residential land wholly-owned group member. Application to residential land companies and residential land wholly-owned group members Residential land companies and residential land wholly-owned group members are both included in section DH 3 and would have to apply the interest limitation rules. This is because these companies may not be able to ensure that all borrowings are traced to non- DRP assets. Residential land company A company would be a “residential land company” for an income year if the value of its disallowed property and indirect disallowed property is equal to or greater than 50 percent of the value of its total assets at any time during that income year. The formula is set out in proposed new section DH 5(8): (disallowed property + indirect disallowed property) ÷ total assets Although a company would be a residential land company if it reached the 50 percent threshold at any time during an income year, in practice it is not expected that companies would have to calculate their percentage daily. Companies whose core business does not involve DRP (other than DRP subject to the land business and development exemptions) would typically be well under the 50 percent threshold at all times and may choose to 3 For more on this, see Interest deductions for companies (Discussion document, September 1999) at chapters 7 and 8 \[taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz \] 20 perform the calculation only once to confirm that. If a company found it was close to the 50 percent threshold, it could either monitor its percentage carefully or decide to apply subpart DH and trace all its borrowings anyway. To apply the formula in proposed new section DH 5(8), the company would need to work out the value of its “disallowed property” and “indirect disallowed property” (as defined in proposed new section DH 5(9)). The proposed definition of “disallowed property” includes a company’s DRP but excludes property subject to the land business and development exemptions in proposed new sections DH 4(2) and (3). This is to reduce compliance costs for developers and other businesses relating to land. Such companies can hold significant amounts of property under development, and if such property were not excluded from “disallowed property”, the companies could have to trace all their borrowings. In contrast, new builds would be included in the proposed definition of “disallowed property”. This is because a company whose core business is residential rental may hold a mixture of new builds and old builds. Such a company would not automatically be allowed all its interest deductions if it held slightly more new builds than old builds; it would still have to trace its borrowings to work out which interest deductions were allowed. Moreover, if new builds were excluded from “disallowed property”, this could cause problems for companies in future years. For example, if a company initially held mostly new builds, it could later find itself holding mostly old builds (particularly because the new build exemption expires after 20 years) and having to apply subpart DH and trace its borrowings at that point. Unless the company had traced from the outset, it may not be able to do so. Indirect interests in disallowed property would also have to be taken into account in determining whether a company is a residential land company. However, companies would not be required to “look through” chains of companies to work out the precise amount of disallowed property held indirectly. Instead, companies would only need to consider the value of any shares in other companies that were residential land companies. Although this would be less precise, it is expected to be easier to apply and to reduce compliance costs for taxpayers. Example 4: Residential land company A Ltd’s total assets consist of the following: • DRP with a value of $400,000. • Other business property with a value of $500,000. • 50% of the shares in B Ltd with a value of $300,000. To determine if A Ltd is a residential land company, A Ltd would have to apply the formula in proposed new section DH 5(8): (disallowed property + indirect disallowed property) ÷ total assets A Ltd’s disallowed property is $400,000, the value of its DRP. However, to determine A Ltd’s indirect disallowed property, it must first determine whether B Ltd is a residential land company. B Ltd’s total assets consist of the following: • Disallowed residential property with a value of $400,000. • Other business property with a value of $200,000. Applying the above formula to B Ltd, the value of B Ltd’s disallowed property as a percentage of its total assets is 66.7% (being $400,000/$600,000). B Ltd is therefore a residential land company. A Ltd must therefore include the value of its shares in B Ltd ($300,000) as indirect disallowed property in the above formula. 21 The value of A Ltd’s disallowed property and indirect disallowed property as a percentage of its total assets is therefore 58.3% (($400,000 + $300,000)/$1,200,000). A Ltd is therefore also a residential land company. Residential land wholly-owned group member If a company is part of a wholly-owned group, the formula would be applied on a group basis to work out whether the company is a “residential land wholly-owned group member”. A company that is a “residential land company” but is also a member of a wholly-owned group would not need to apply subpart DH if the group is not a residential land wholly- owned group. A residential land wholly-owned group for an income year is a wholly-owned group of companies where, on a consolidated basis, the value of the group’s disallowed property and indirect disallowed property is equal to or greater than 50 percent of the value of the group’s total assets at any time during that income year (proposed new section DH 5(10)). Property subject to the land business and development exemptions, new builds, and indirect disallowed property would be treated in the same way as under the formula for residential land companies. Indirect disallowed property would be limited to the value of shares in non- group companies that are residential land companies to avoid double counting disallowed property held in the group. By applying the formula on a consolidated basis, intra-group shares and loans would also be disregarded when calculating total assets to avoid double counting property held in the group. Example 5: Residential land wholly-owned group – intra-group assets Land Group is a wholly-owned group of companies with the following members and assets: Holding Co Assets $ Liabilities $ Shares in A Co 4m Bonds 3m Shares in B Co 6m Equity Shareholder capital 7m Total 10m Total 10m A Co Assets $ Liabilities $ DRP 2m None Other business property 1.5m Equity Loan to B Co 0.5m Shareholder capital 4m Total 4m Total 4m B Co Assets $ Liabilities $ DRP 2.5m Loan from A Co 0.5m 22 Other business property 4m Equity Shareholder capital 6m Total 6.5m Total 6.5m As A Co and B Co are members of a wholly-owned group, it is not necessary to determine whether they are residential land companies. Instead, the formula in proposed new section DH 5(10) is applied to the Land Group: • The value of disallowed property would be: $2m (in A Co) + $2.5m (in B Co) = $4.5m • The value of indirect disallowed property would be zero (shares held by Holding Co are intra-group shares and therefore disregarded). • The value of total assets excluding intra-group assets would be: $3.5m (in A Co) + $6.5m (in B Co) = $10m. The value of Land Group’s disallowed property and indirect disallowed property as a percentage of its total assets would therefore be 45% ($4.5m/$10m). Land Group would therefore not be a residential land wholly- owned group. Holding Co, A Co and B Co would therefore not be residential land wholly-owned group members and would not have to apply subpart DH. This is despite the fact that, if the formula for an individual residential land company in proposed new section DH 5(8) was applied to A Co, A Co would be a residential land company. Valuations of assets When applying the formulas in proposed new sections DH 5(8) and (10), taxpayers would use the valuation rules set out in proposed new section DH 12. These rules are based on the existing valuation rules for residential rental loss ring-fencing in section EL 19. However, instead of requiring market value for all property other than land, section DH 12 requires the use of tax book values or accounting values (if their accounts are prepared according to relevant accounting or legislative standards). 4 This is intended to save compliance costs for taxpayers. Application to close companies Most close companies that own DRP would have to apply subpart DH, even if they are not residential land companies or residential land wholly-owned group members. Close companies are controlled by a small number of individuals. As such, if close companies with DRP comprising less than 50 percent of their total assets were excluded, taxpayers would have an incentive to set up a close company to hold DRP and then add other assets to the company, such as cash, bonds, and shares, to remain below the 50 percent threshold. This concern is significantly reduced for non-close companies, where control of the company is more dispersed. An “exempt Māori company” would not have to apply the rules even if it is a close company. An “exempt Māori company” is defined in proposed new section DH 5(4) as a company that is not a residential land company or a residential land wholly-owned group member and is one of the following: • a Māori authority or eligible to be a Māori authority, or • wholly-owned by a Māori authority or by a company or trust that is eligible to be a Māori authority. 4 For example, financial statements prepared in accordance with applicable minimum requirements prescribed by an Order in Council made under section 21C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 23 These exempt Māori companies would often legally be close companies because they are held by a single trust. However, where the company or its parent is a Māori authority (or eligible to be one), it will typically be for the benefit of, and accountable to, a very large number of members, sometimes thousands. So, in terms of control and governance, the company is not like a typical close company. Moreover, there are restrictions on the types of companies and trust that are eligible to become Māori authorities, and this means taxpayers would not be able to set up Māori authority companies simply to avoid the interest limitation rules. 24 LAND BUSINESS EXEMPTION Clause 64E (proposed section DH 4(2)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would provide an exemption from the interest limitation rules for interest incurred by a person in relation to land they hold as part of a business described in section CB 7. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new section DH 4(2) provides that interest incurred for land held as part of a business described in section CB 7 would be exempt from the proposed new interest limitation rules. Section CB 7 applies to land acquired for a land dealing, developing, subdividing or building business. This exemption is referred to as the “land business exemption”. The exemption would apply to interest incurred for land held by property developers, subdividers, dealers and builders for a land-related business described in section CB 7. If the exemption applied, interest that was deductible before the proposed new interest limitation rules (such as interest related to the land and development activities) would remain deductible. If all the taxpayer’s land is held on revenue account under section CB 7, all their interest incurred in carrying on the land business would qualify for the exemption. If they owned some land not held on revenue account under section CB 7, the interest for that land might be subject to interest limitation, unless another exemption applied (such as the development exemption or the new build exemption). The land business exemption would apply from the date the land was acquired for the land- related business. The exemption would cease when the taxpayer was no longer engaged in a business described in section CB 7. Background The aim of the land business exemption is to ensure new housing supply is not negatively impacted by the proposed new interest limitation rules. An exemption from the interest limitation for taxpayers who hold land on revenue account under section CB 7 is provided because land developers and builders play a significant role in the provision of new housing stock. The exemption is proposed to apply to interest for all land to which section CB 7 applies, even if there is no active work on the land at the time. This is because of the nature of these businesses in contributing to new housing supply. 25 Detailed analysis Exemption applies to land businesses The land business exemption is proposed to apply to interest incurred by a person to the extent it is incurred for land the person holds as part of a business described in section CB 7. Section CB 7 applies to land acquired by taxpayers for certain land-related businesses. These businesses are: • dealing in land • developing or subdividing land, and • erecting buildings. Practically, this means people who are professional land dealers, land developers or engaged in land subdivision would qualify for the land business exemption for interest incurred for the land they acquire and hold as part of their land business. Additionally, professional builders who acquire land for their business and make improvements to the land would also qualify for the land business exemption, provided they meet the requirements of section CB 7. Example 6 XD Developers is a company that regularly buys land, develops the land into residential subdivisions and sells the divided lots to buyers. XD Developers is a land-related business, and the sale of its land is taxable under section CB 7. XD Developers decides to acquire a new piece of land for property development. It obtains a loan from Big Bank to buy the land, and Big Bank obtains security over the land. Once XD Developers commences the development activity, it obtains further funding from Big Bank to help with its development expenses. Since XD Developers is a land- related business and has acquired the property for the business, the land business exemption applies. All interest on the loans obtained from Big Bank for the land would be deductible. If a person does not acquire land for a land-related business but later forms an intention to develop the land, the land business exemption would not apply. This is because section CB 7 would not apply to the land in this case. Instead, the person would need to meet the requirements of the proposed development exemption to avoid the application of the interest limitation rules. 5 Remediation Section CB 7 may also encompass professional developers and dealers who primarily remediate and renovate houses if their activities qualify as undertaking a business of land dealing or erecting buildings. If section CB 7 did apply to the land, all interest incurred for remediation of existing dwellings on the land would be exempt from the proposed new interest limitation rules under the land business exemption. 5 For more on the development exemption, see the “Exemption for property development” section of this Commentary. 26 Example 7: Renovating properties Rainbow Builders Ltd (RB) has a business of buying old properties, adding new features, and selling the properties for a profit. RB acquires a large number of old villas in an older neighbourhood to renovate and on sell. RB modernises the properties by updating their electrical systems and refitting their kitchens and bathrooms with new fixtures. RB also repaints the interiors and adds new decks to each of the properties. RB acquired the portfolio of villas to renovate and sell them as part of a land-dealing business under section CB 7, so the interest RB incurs for the properties would qualify for the land business exemption. All interest incurred for loans to acquire the villas, hold them, and renovate them would be deductible and not subject to the proposed new interest limitation rules. Land dealers The land business exemption would apply if section CB 7 applies to the land, regardless of what work (if any) is done to the land. This includes land dealers whose activity is often ancillary to the development process. Interest allowed by the exemption Where property is acquired for a land-related business, the exemption would apply to all interest incurred for the land. This would include interest on borrowings for the acquisition of the land, to pay land holding costs (like rates or insurance), or to fund the development of the land. If land held by a person qualified for the exemption, the person would be able to continue to deduct interest incurred for the land provided the existing tax rules (such as having a sufficient connection or nexus to income) allowed the deductions. Example 8: Land business exemption Kamal is a sole trader who carries on a successful business of building small houses and selling them to first home buyers. Kamal usually obtains a loan to buy the land and pay the related expenses of the building activity. This includes expenses such as the cost of buying the land, making any payments to local or building consent authorities in relation to the land, legal and other professional fees (such as for architects and surveyors) incurred in relation to the land, and the costs of building materials. Interest on the loan would be exempt from the proposed interest limitation rules under the proposed land business exemption and would be deductible (subject to general principles). Period exemption applies for The land business exemption would apply to interest incurred for land from the point where the land is held on revenue account under section CB 7. This would be from the point that a person engaged in a land-related business acquired the land for that business. Land owned by a land business that is not held on revenue account under section CB 7 If a taxpayer acquires land other than for a land business, the land business exemption would not apply to interest incurred for the land. However, the development exemption or another exemption may apply. Example 9 Jones Co is a business that subdivides rural land and sells it to property developers, who in turn develop and build on the land. Therefore, Jones Co’s income from disposing of the land held in the business is subject to tax under section CB 7, Because section CB 7 applies, the land business exemption would apply as soon as Jones Co purchases the land for its business and would apply for long as Jones Co continues its land- related business. The exemption would apply to interest incurred on all borrowing that is for land acquired for Jones Co’s business. 27 On one occasion, Jones Co decides to acquire land to try its hand at building a house to keep and rent out long term. In so doing, the relevant land is not held on revenue account under section CB 7. The land business exemption would therefore not apply. However, the development exemption may apply until the new build added to the land receives a code compliance certificate (CCC). Once a CCC has been issued, the new build exemption would apply. When any land to which the land business exemption has previously applied is sold, the land business exemption would continue to apply to the interest incurred on debt for the land for as long as the taxpayer continues to conduct a land-related business. For example, if a property was sold at a loss and debt remained, interest on the debt would continue to be deductible. Relationship with the new build exemption from interest limitation 6 If a property developer qualifies for the land business exemption and disposes of the property to an investor who will use it for rental property, the investor would not necessarily qualify for the new build exemption. The property would have to meet the definition of “new build land” for the investor to obtain that exemption. The definition would only be satisfied if a new self-contained residence or abode were added to the land. If the property were only remediated, that may not qualify for the new build exemption for the buyer even though the developer qualified for the land business exemption. If the property is new build land and so qualifies for the new build exemption for the purchaser, then crossover could exist between the land business exemption and the new build exemption. This is because, where a property is acquired off the plans, both exemptions could apply at the same time to different taxpayers. For example, when a house is purchased before the house is constructed (that is, off the plans), the developer or builder could qualify for the land business exemption while they are adding a residence or abode to the land, and the purchaser could qualify for the new build exemption 7 at the same time if they have already acquired an interest in the land. 6 For more on the new build exemption, see the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. 7 Qualifying for an exemption, such as the new build exemption, would not automatically mean a taxpayer is allowed a deduction for interest expense. It means interest limitation would not apply if the taxpayer was otherwise allowed a deduction. For example, if someone purchased a new build to live in, they would not be allowed an interest deduction because it was private expenditure (even though the new build exemption would apply). 28 EXEMPTION FOR PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT Clause 64E (proposed sections DH 4(3), DH 5(7)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would introduce an exemption from the proposed new interest limitation rules for one-off developments undertaken to create new build land. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new section DH 4(3) would introduce the development exemption. This is an exemption from the interest limitation rules for interest a person incurs on an undertaking or scheme involving developing, subdividing or building to create new build land. Unlike the land business exemption, 8 the development exemption would apply to a person even if section CB 7 does not apply to the land. If the development exemption applies, then all interest incurred for the land being developed would not be subject to the interest limitation rules. The interest would be deductible provided it was deductible under existing tax rules. This includes interest incurred on debt for the subdivision, development or erection of a building on the land, as well as interest incurred to fund the payment of costs associated with holding the land (such as rates or insurance). The exemption would apply from the commencement of the undertaking or scheme for the development, subdivision or building work and end on the earlier of: • the person disposing of the land • the development project ceasing (that is, if the project is abandoned), or • the land becoming “new build land”. Land would generally become “new build land” when a code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued for a new build added to the land. Once land has become “new build land”, the new build exemption would apply to the land instead of the development exemption. Detailed analysis The aim of the development exemption is to ensure the proposed new interest limitation rules do not disincentivise investments in new housing supply. The development exemption is intended to apply to taxpayers who do not qualify for the land business exemption but who build, develop or subdivide land to create new build land. 8 For more on this, see the “Land business exemption” section of this Commentary. 29 Undertaking or scheme The proposed exemption would apply if the land is subject to an undertaking or scheme involving development, subdivision, or building to create new build land. The existing meaning of “undertaking or scheme” (as used in section CB 12) would apply. An undertaking or scheme is a plan, design or program of action devised to attain some end result. For this development exemption, it would be sufficient to demonstrate a coherent plan or purpose that involves a series of steps to create new build land. The exemption would apply once the development undertaking or scheme begins. The point at which that occurs would be determined under current principles. 9 It would not matter if the land is not sold once the development is completed – the development exemption could still apply – but once a new build added to the land received its CCC, the development exemption would cease and the new build exemption would apply instead. Example 10 Anika owns Anika Rentals Ltd (ARL), which owns and manages a large number of residential rental properties. ARL owns a large section that it decides to subdivide and build new houses on. The land business exemption would not apply to this section. The development exemption would start once ARL’s undertaking or scheme to subdivide the land begins. For example, it may start once ARL engages a company to survey the land and prepare the subdivision plan. When an undertaking or scheme begins will depend on the facts of each case. Development, building, and subdivision The existing meanings of “development”, “building” and “subdivision” that apply for the land sale rules would also apply for the development exemption. These terms would include the following types of activities: • making improvements to land, for example, clearing the land, so a dwelling can be added, or installing power or water on the site • building a house, converting a single house into multiple flats, converting a commercial or industrial property to a residential property, or relocating a house onto the land, and • dividing one large piece of land into multiple pieces of land. Example 11 Aroha owns a property investment and rental company, Living Co. Living Co owns a piece of land that has an existing rental property on it. It decides to build a house to rent to another tenant. The existing rental property is an existing build that would not qualify for an exemption from interest limitation. The land was acquired before 27 March 2021, so the interest deductions for the portion of the land with the existing build on it would be phased out from 1 October 2021. Living Co is not in the business of developing land, so the portion of the land that it develops would not qualify for the land business exemption. However, interest deductions for this part of the land would qualify for the development exemption once the building/development undertaking or scheme starts on the land. This is because these activities have the purpose of creating a new residence. The new house Living Co is building would qualify for the development exemption while the development/building is taking place and 9 See, for example, IS 20/08 from \[35\] and QB 15/04 from \[39\]. 30 would then transition to the new build exemption once the new house’s CCC is issued. Living Co would be allowed to deduct all the interest incurred for the land and development while the exemptions applied. Purpose of creating new build land The development, building, or subdivision would have to have the purpose of creating new build land. If it does not, then the development exemption would not apply to the land. Remediation activity would not qualify for the development exemption if it does not result in new build land. The proposed definition of “new build land” is in proposed new section DH 5(7). It is set out in more detail in the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. The most important aspect of the definition is that at least one new self-contained residence or abode must be added to the land, whether by adding new buildings to the land or converting existing buildings on the land so that they meet the requirements of the definition. The definition of new build land requires a CCC to have been issued for the new build on or after 27 March 2020. The development exemption would apply while a scheme or undertaking is taking place, before a CCC is issued. 10 No denial of interest If the exemption applies, the proposed new interest limitation rules would not apply and therefore none of the interest incurred would be denied a deduction under those rules. Whether the interest would be deductible would depend on whether it is deductible under existing tax rules, for example, whether a sufficient nexus exists with assessable income. Example 12 • Amal has engaged a building firm to build a house on an empty piece of land. Amal intends to use this new build as a rental property in the future. In these circumstances, the development exemption would apply, but it is doubtful that the interest incurred by Amal for the development activity would be deductible unless there is a nexus with a larger property rental business. • Annie engages a builder to build a property on an empty piece of land. Annie intends to live in the property with her wife as their main home and has obtained a loan to fund the development. Although Annie has engaged in development activity and would be entitled to the development exemption from the interest limitation rules, she has not met the requirements to obtain an interest deduction – there is no nexus to an income-earning activity. When the development exemption ceases The development exemption would apply until the earlier of the land becoming new build land, the development activity ceasing (that is, the project being abandoned), or the property 10 An exception applies for new builds that were formerly hotels or motels. For these new builds, the development exemption (if it applies) would continue up until the point the hotel or motel conversion is recorded by a local authority or building consent authority as having been completed on or after 27 March 2020. After the conversion is recorded, the development exemption would cease and the new build exemption would start to apply. 31 being disposed of. Once the property becomes new build land, it would transition to the new build exemption. 11 Example 13 Romy has engaged in sufficient development activity on her land to obtain the development exemption. She is creating a new self-contained residence. The development exemption would apply to the land while Romy is completing the development and building of the new self-contained residence. Her interest would be deductible if the general deduction criteria set out in existing tax rules are met. Once a CCC is issued, the development exemption would end, and Romy’s property would transition to the new build exemption. If a property is disposed of and a balance remains on the loan for the property (for example, if the property is sold at a loss), the interest would not continue to be deductible after the property is disposed of. Example 14 Living Co owns a number of rental properties. It buys a house and land package. Once the house is built, Living Co intends to rent it out as an investment property. Once activity starts on the development, Living Co would qualify for the development exemption. As the build progresses, Living Co realises it needs more funds but is unable to obtain further funding through its bank. Living Co decides to sell the half-finished development to a new owner, who will be able to complete the build. The development exemption would end once the property is sold, and Living Co would no longer be able to deduct interest on the loan. The new purchaser of Living Co’s development would need to meet the land business or development exemption criteria to qualify for an exemption. 11 For discussion of the transition from the development exemption to the new build exemption, see the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. 32 EXEMPTION FOR NEW BUILD LAND Clauses 64E ( proposed sections DH 4(1), DH 5(1), (7)), 127(1E) and 127(10D) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would exempt new build land from the proposed interest limitation rules. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021 (although the definition of new build land applies from 27 March 2021 for the new build bright-line test). 12 Key features The proposed amendments would introduce the “new build exemption”. This exemption would ensure the interest limitation rules would not apply to prevent taxpayers deducting interest incurred in relation to “new build land” from 1 October 2021. New build land The definition of “new build land” is set out in proposed new section DH 5(7) and would mean: • Land to the extent to which it has a place configured as a self-contained residence or abode, where a code compliance certificate (CCC) has been issued on or after 27 March 2020 evidencing that the new build has been added to the land. This would include land exclusively used by the residents of the new build, plus a reasonable proportion of any shared areas (for example, a reasonable proportion of a driveway shared with the residents of an older building also on the land). • Land for which there is an agreement that a place configured as a self-contained residence or abode will be added to the land and a CCC will be issued on or after 27 March 2020 evidencing that the place was added to the land. • Land where a hotel or motel was converted into self-contained residences or abodes, provided the conversion was completed on or after 27 March 2020 and the conversion is recorded by a local authority or building consent authority. 13 The definition of “new build land” is relevant to both the new build bright-line test and the new build exemption. 12 For more on the proposed new build bright-line test, see the “5-year new build bright-line test” section of this Commentary. 13 “Building consent authority” would have the meaning given to it in the Building Act 2004. 33 Extent of exemption for new build land Proposed new section DH 4(1) provides that the new interest limitation rules in subpart DH would not apply to interest incurred by a person to the extent to which the interest is incurred: • in relation to new build land, and • before the expiry of 20 years since the CCC was issued for the new build added to the land. All owners of the new build land during the 20-year period would qualify for the exemption – this includes the initial owner and any subsequent purchasers within that period. Exception from the general rule for B2.3.1 modifications and hotel/motel conversions The 20-years is counted from the date of completion if a new build’s CCC was issued subject to a modification to clause B2.3.1 of the Building Code, or if the new build was previously a hotel or motel. Background The proposed interest limitation rules are aimed at tilting the playing field for existing residential property away from investors to first home buyers and owner-occupiers. But without new housing supply, the impact of the interest limitation rules on dampening house prices over time is likely to be somewhat limited. The proposed new build exemption is therefore aimed at ensuring the interest limitation rules do not negatively impact upon new housing supply. It does this by excluding new builds (referred to in the proposed legislation as “new build land”) from the interest limitation rule for 20 years. New build land The definition is aimed at ensuring only clear additions to housing supply qualify, which is why self-contained residences or abodes added to land would qualify, but just adding a room to an existing house or upgrading a kitchen would not qualify. When the exemption starts A CCC indicates when building work was completed. It is a tool that can be used, in conjunction with other records held by local authorities and building authorities, to objectively verify whether a new self-contained residence or abode has been added to the land and can be used by both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. Therefore, the new build exemption generally starts – and the 20-year exemption period is counted – from the point a CCC is issued for a new build. Exception for off-the-plans acquisitions Off-the-plans acquisitions are an important source of funding for property developers. Sometimes, deposits for new builds acquired off the plans are debt-funded, so may result in the person acquiring the new build incurring interest before a CCC is issued for the new build. A special rule is therefore proposed for new builds acquired off the plans, so that a taxpayer who acquires such a new build can access the exemption from the date they enter into an agreement to acquire it. If the interest would be deductible under existing tax rules, 34 then interest may be deducted from the date of acquisition for new builds acquired off the plans. Exception for hotel and motel conversions The definition of new build land would also cover situations where hotel or motel units are converted to residential accommodation. Since hotel and motel units are used for short-stay accommodation, and often already have some cooking facilities and bathrooms, less work may be required to convert them into places suitable for long-term accommodation compared to other conversions (for example, conversions of office blocks into apartments). As a result, a CCC may not be issued. Where this is the case, the proposed new build exemption would apply from the date that the local authority or building consent authority records indicate the conversion was completed. When the exemption ends The proposed new build exemption would need to apply for long enough that it does not discourage a person from making an initial investment in a new build, while also applying for a short enough period that it does not undermine the objective of the interest limitation rules. Different application periods were considered, including a 10- or 20-year exemption and/or potentially applying the exemption in perpetuity for the first owner of a new build. A shorter application period may reduce the likelihood a person would invest in a new build at all. The lack of interest deductions could reduce the attractiveness or viability of investing in a new build when compared with other investments, such as commercial property. A longer application period would mean more properties would be exempt from interest limitation for a longer period. The longer the exemption applies for, the less effective the interest limitation rules are likely to be at dampening house price inflation over time. This is because, as more new builds are created, a greater proportion of housing stock would become eligible for the exemption. An exemption that applies for 20 years was considered the most likely to balance these competing pressures. Impact of B2.3.1 modification on exemption period Where a CCC is issued subject to a B2.3.1 modification, then the exemption would end earlier because the 20-year period would be counted from the date the building work to add the new build to the land was substantially completed. Clause B2.3.1 of the Building Code concerns the durability of a building once it is completed. Normally the period for which a building is durable is counted from the date a CCC is issued for building work. However, where a CCC is significantly delayed (normally by more than 5 years), the CCC will often be issued subject to a B2.3.1 modification. The effect of a B2.3.1 modification is the durability period for the building is counted from the date the building work for the building was substantially completed, which will be a number of years before the CCC was issued. The purpose of the B2.3.1 modification rule is to ensure there is no tax benefit from significantly delaying the issuance of a new build’s CCC. 35 Detailed analysis The proposed new build exemption would apply to all owners of new build land for 20 years. 14 New build land The new build exemption would apply to interest incurred in relation to “new build land”. “New build land” is defined in proposed new section DH 5(7). Table 1 Proposed provision New build land would include: Analysis DH 5(7)(a) Land, to the extent to which the land has a place configured as a self-contained residence or abode, if a CCC has been issued on or after 27 March 2020 which shows the place was added to the land. This is expected to be the most common type of property that would qualify as “new build land”. It is where a new build is added to the land and receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020. “To the extent” means the land would have to be apportioned if it has both a new build and non-new build on it. It is proposed that existing tax apportionment principles would apply. DH 5(7)(b) Land exclusively used by residents of a new build. This is intended to cover both the floor area of the new build itself, as well as any outdoor areas that are exclusively used by the new build. For example, if there is an outdoor garden area that is only used by residents of a new build (and not by the residents of any other residences on the property), then those spaces would qualify as new build land as well. A reasonable proportion of shared areas of land appurtenant to a new build. This is intended to cover any areas of the land that are shared by a new build and a non-new build. For example, a shared driveway or garden area. If a new build shares a driveway with a non-new build, then a reasonable proportion could be 50% of the land area covered by the driveway. DH 5(7)(c) Land for which there is an agreement that a new build will be added to the land and a CCC will be issued on or after 27 March 2020 confirming the place was added to the land. This provision is intended to ensure that interest may be deductible from the date of acquisition for new builds acquired off the plans. A CCC would not need to have been issued for an off-the-plans new build to qualify for the exemption. Note that even if the exemption from the interest limitation rules applies, the interest 14 Except for new builds acquired off the plans, for which the proposed exemption could apply for slightly longer than 20 years. 36 Proposed provision New build land would include: Analysis can only be deducted if it is deductible under existing tax rules. DH 5(7)(d) Land that was previously a hotel or motel, to the extent to which a hotel or motel is converted into places configured as self-contained residences or abodes, provided this conversion is recorded in the records of a local authority or building consent authority as having been completed on or after 27 March 2020. This provision would apply to former hotel and motel units that are converted into new builds. The conversions need to be completed on or after 27 March 2020, and the conversion needs to be reflected in the records of a local authority or building consent authority for the exemption to apply. The record could be in the form of a building’s use changing in the records, or the rates that apply to the land switching from commercial rates to residential rates. The new build referred to in proposed new section DH 5(7)(a) must receive its CCC on or after 27 March 2020, confirming the new build has been added to the land. The acquisition date of the land is not relevant to whether land can qualify for the new build exemption – instead, it is the date a new build’s CCC is issued that is important. Example 15: Date of acquisition irrelevant Mark acquires residential land on 1 November 2019. He adds a self-contained dwelling to the land that is completed and receives its CCC on 31 March 2020. The land that the self-contained dwelling has been added to would qualify as new build land because the dwelling’s CCC was issued after 27 March 2020. It does not matter that Mark acquired the land before 27 March 2020, as the date of acquisition is not relevant to the application of the new build exemption. New builds do not have to be constructed out of new material or on-site, and they can include modular or older homes that are relocated. As long as the new build is self-contained and receives its CCC on or after 27 March 2020 confirming it has been added to the land, the land would qualify as new build land. Example 16: New build constructed off-site Sandy has a tiny home constructed off-site that is made from reclaimed materials. The tiny home contains its own kitchen and bathroom facilities. When construction is complete, Sandy adds the tiny home to her residential land, and it receives its CCC on 22 February 2021. As the tiny home is self-contained and received its CCC after 27 March 2020, Sandy’s land would qualify as new build land. A place would only qualify as a new build if it is self-contained. This means the new build would need to contain its own cooking and bathroom facilities and have its own entrance. The entrance could be from a shared accessway – for example, a hallway shared by a block of flats in the same building. Example 17: Sleepout without kitchen and bathroom facilities Kate owns residential land with an existing dwelling on it. She adds a sleepout to the property, which she intends to rent out, behind the existing dwelling. The sleepout can function as an extra bedroom, but it does not have its own kitchen and bathroom. Anyone staying in the sleepout would have to use the kitchen and bathroom located in the existing dwelling. Having no kitchen and bathroom means the sleepout is not self- contained and is therefore not considered a new build. The land attributable to the sleepout does not satisfy the definition of new build land. 37 Example 18: Sleepout converted to self-contained residence Assume the same facts as example XX. Six months later, Kate renovates the sleepout and adds a kitchen and bathroom. The building work receives its CCC on 3 March 2021. As the sleep-out is now self-contained, and it received its CCC after 27 March 2020, it would qualify as a new build. The land the new build is on, any land used exclusively by the residents of the new build, and a reasonable proportion of any shared areas, would be considered new build land. The remainder of the land (attributable to the existing dwelling) would not be considered new build land. Exemption applies for 20 years Proposed new section DH 4(1)(b) provides that the exemption would apply to interest incurred before the date that is 20 years after the earliest of the following dates: • a CCC is issued for a new build (subparagraph (i)) • a hotel or motel conversion is completed as recorded by a local authority or building consent authority (subparagraph (ii)), or • building work to add a new build to the land is recorded as substantially completed by a local authority or building consent authority, if the CCC for the new build was issued subject to a B2.3.1 modification (B2.3.1 modification rule) (subparagraph (iii)). The 20-year fixed period is effectively attached to the land and does not reset when new build land is sold. This means that all owners of the new build land during that 20-year period would qualify for the exemption. This would include the initial owner and any subsequent purchasers within that period. Example 19: New build receives CCC Penny acquires an already constructed townhouse in Petone that received its CCC on 24 October 2021. Under proposed new section DH 4(1)(b)(i), the new build exemption from the interest limitation rules would apply to interest incurred in respect of the townhouse for 20 years from this date. Penny would be able to deduct interest incurred in relation to the townhouse from the date title for the land is registered to her. Immediately after acquiring the townhouse, Penny rents the property out to Graham and Claire as a long- term residential rental property. Penny holds onto the property for the next thirty years and continues to use it as a long-term residential rental property during this period. Since Penny is using the townhouse for an income-earning activity, she would be able to deduct interest for the townhouse while the exemption applies, which is until 23 October 2041. From 24 October 2041 onwards, Penny would not be able to deduct interest for the property. This is because the new build exemption would cease to apply, and she would be denied a deduction for the interest under the interest limitation rules. Example 20: Hotel units converted to new builds Haydn owns a large hotel complex in Rotorua comprising 100 separate units. Ever since the borders closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduced number of tourists has meant that many of his units have sat empty or have only been booked a fraction of the time they were previously. He has heard there is a shortage of long-term rental accommodation in the region, so he decides to convert his units into places that can be let as long-term rentals instead. Since the units were already configured for short-term stays by tourists, they have kitchens and bathrooms. Haydn engages tradespeople to do some work to ensure the units are configured as self-contained residences or abodes. The work Haydn has done to the property is not significant enough to require building consents, which means CCCs are not issued for the work. Haydn gets in touch with his local authority (which is also a building consent authority) and notifies them that he has converted all his hotel units into residential accommodation. This conversion is noted down as 38 having been completed on 24 October 2021 in the authority’s records. Under proposed new section DH 4(1)(b)(ii), the new build exemption would apply to Haydn’s units for 20 years from this date, so until 23 October 2041. Example 21: B2.3.1 modification rule Rip owns a large section that has a residential rental property on one half of it. The rental was built on the land in the 1980s, so interest deductions would be progressively denied from 1 October 2021 under the interest limitation rules. However, Rip decides to develop the other half of the section to add a new build to it. He claims interest deductions in respect of the portion of the land he is developing under the development exemption. Although the building work for the new build is substantially completed by 24 October 2021, Rip decides he probably wants to sell the property sometime in the next ten years, so he deliberately holds off getting a CCC for the new build to maximise its potential value to a subsequent debt-financed purchaser. Eight years later, Rip decides he wants to sell the land. Rip gets in touch with his local council to request a CCC for the new build. The council issues a CCC for the new build on 24 October 2029 but issues it subject to a B2.3.1 modification. On the CCC, the substantial completion date for the new build is recorded as being 24 October 2021, which is the date the durability of the building is counted from (instead of the date the CCC was issued). Since Rip’s new build’s CCC was issued subject to a B2.3.1 modification, the 20-year period for the new build exemption would be counted from the date of substantial completion (24 October 2021), rather than the date the CCC for the new build was issued (24 October 2029), under proposed new section DH 4(1)(b)(iii). This means that Rip would gain no tax advantage by delaying the CCC for his new build. The new build exemption would still end on 23 October 2041, even though the CCC was not issued until 24 October 2029. Example 22: Office block conversion with new builds sold within 20 years Sandra owns an office block that she has decided to convert into 10 apartments. She arranges for extensive building work to be done to convert the office space into individual apartments, including adding in bathrooms and kitchens for each unit. CCCs are issued on 24 October 2021 confirming that the building work to convert the office space into apartments is complete. The new build exemption from the interest limitation rules would apply to the apartments from 24 October 2021 until 23 October 2041. Ten years later, on 24 October 2031, Sandra sells the apartment block because she is moving overseas. Sean acquires the apartment block and keeps it for five years. On 24 October 2036, Sean sells the apartment block to Josh. Josh holds the apartment block for fifteen years. The apartments are always rented out for the time period covered by this example. Sandra and Sean would be able to deduct interest for the apartment block for the entire period they own the apartments (from 24 October 2021 to 23 October 2031 for Sandra, and from 24 October 2031 to 23 October 2036 for Sean), because the new build exemption would apply. Josh would be able to deduct interest from 24 October 2036 to 23 October 2041. The new build exemption would end on 23 October 2041, 20 years after the apartments received their CCCs. Josh would be denied interest deductions from 24 October 2041 onwards under the interest limitation rules. Exemption applies to interest incurred in relation to new build land The effect of the new build exemption applying would be that the interest limitation rules in proposed new subpart DH would not apply to deny interest deductions. However, this does not mean that interest for a new build would automatically be deductible. The interest would have to be deductible under existing tax rules. If the interest would not be deductible under existing tax rules, then the interest could not be deducted. The interest that may be deducted if the exemption applies, and provided a deduction is allowed under existing tax rules, would include interest on loans to: 39 • acquire the land a new build is on, • construct or install a new build on the land, • pay for things like insurance and rates, and • renovate, maintain, or repair a new build. Example 23: Exemption applies to all interest for new build land Stephanie owns land that qualifies for the new build exemption. The land is always rented out. During the period the exemption applies, she decides to add a new deck to the new build on the land, as well as a new shared outdoor patio area. Stephanie would be able to deduct the interest she incurs on the loan she takes out to add the deck and outdoor patio area. Ten years after the new build receives its CCC, Stephanie decides to repaint it, as the initial painting was not done very well. She takes out another loan to pay for repainting the new build. The interest she incurs on that loan would also be deductible. If Stephanie is still incurring interest in relation to the new build land after the exemption expires, she would not be able to deduct that interest because the interest limitation rule would then apply. Apportionment required where land is only partially new build land If interest relates to land with both a new build and a non-new build, then only part of the land would be considered new build land. In these circumstances, the taxpayer would have to apportion the interest between the new build land and the non-new build land. Only interest incurred in relation to the new build land would qualify for the exemption. Example 24: Interest relates to land with a new build and a non-new build This example illustrates how interest could be reasonably apportioned where it only partially relates to new build land. There may be other apportionment methods that, if applied in accordance with existing tax principles, could also be considered acceptable. Viv and Adrian acquire 1500m2 of land in Kaitaia. The land has a 1970s standalone house (non-new build), as well as two new build townhouses. They take out a loan of $1m to acquire the land. All three buildings on the land are used as long-term rentals. The total land area of 1500m2 is used as follows: • 400m2 is used exclusively by the non-new build • 800m2 is used exclusively by the new builds, and • 300m2 is a shared outdoor area. After apportioning the shared outdoor area: • 500m2 is not considered new build land. This is the 400m2 used exclusively by the non-new build, plus one third of the shared outdoor areas (1/3 x 300m2 = 100m2). • 1000m2 is considered new build land. This is the 800m2 used exclusively by the new builds, and two thirds of the shared outdoor areas (2/3 x 300m2 = 200m2). It would be reasonable for Viv and Adrian to deduct two thirds of the interest they incur in relation to the land, because two thirds of the total land area (1000m2 of the total 1500m2) is attributable to the new builds. One third of the interest they incur would not be deductible, because it would be attributable to the non-new build portion of the land. 40 Relationship with other exemptions from interest limitation 15 Development exemption The proposed development exemption would apply to a taxpayer who adds a new build to their land and would last until the earlier of when the land becomes new build land or is disposed of. Once the land becomes new build land, the new build exemption would apply. Example 25: Land transitions from development exemption to new build exemption Amber and Sandy buy a large section in Orewa. They purchase the land with the intention of adding new builds to the land, renting these out for a short period, and then selling them off for a profit. Once they start an undertaking or scheme to develop and build on the land to add new builds, they would qualify for the development exemption. After construction is complete, the new builds receive their CCCs. At this point, the development exemption would cease to apply to the land, and instead the new build exemption would start to apply. The new build exemption would continue to apply to the land until 20 years have passed from the date the new builds received their CCCs. Three years after the residences receive their CCCs, Amber and Sandy sell the land to James. The new build exemption would continue to apply to the land, but it would only apply for another 17 years – the 20-year exemption period would not reset when the land is sold. Land business exemption If the land business exemption applies, the new build exemption would not be relevant for that taxpayer. Exemptions could apply concurrently for new builds acquired off the plans For new builds acquired off the plans, the new build exemption could apply concurrently with the development or land business exemptions. This would be for both the taxpayer adding the new build to the land and the taxpayer acquiring the new build off the plans. Example 26: Exemptions apply concurrently for land business taxpayer and purchaser Neo and Archie own a large property development business, Neo-Archie Homes Ltd, which specialises in building property that is sold off the plans during construction. They acquire some former farmland in South Wairarapa, which they intend to subdivide and construct new builds on. Bagheera enters into an agreement to buy a new build from Neo-Archie Homes Ltd on 1 October 2021. The new builds are still being constructed and do not receive their CCCs until 24 October 2022. On 31 October 2022, title for Bagheera’s new build is registered to him. The land business exemption would apply to Neo-Archie Homes Ltd while it holds the land, because it still holds the land as part of a land-related business. Bagheera would qualify for the new build exemption from 1 October 2021, because he has acquired a new build off the plans. He would be able to deduct interest from that date, provided he satisfies the requirements to do so under existing tax rules. The new build exemption would apply to the land until 23 October 2042, 20 years after the new build received its CCC. 15 For more on these, see the “Exemption for property development” and “Land business exemption” sections of this Commentary. 41 Relevance of the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules No changes to the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules are proposed. This means these rules will continue to apply as they currently do to interest deductions incurred in relation to rental properties. 42 EXCEPTED RESIDENTIAL LAND – SCHEDULE 15 Clauses 64E (proposed section DH 5(3)), 127(6B), (7B), (10C), (17B), 131B and schedule 1A Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would set out the types of land that would be “excepted residential land” and excluded from the proposed interest limitation rules. Application date The proposed amendments would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new schedule 15 provides that the following types of land would be considered excepted residential land: • Business premises (other than business premises that are used or available for use in a business of supplying accommodation). • Farmland. • A hospital, convalescent home, nursing home, or hospice. • A hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or camping ground. • A rest home or retirement village. • The person’s main home. • Student accommodation. • Employee accommodation. • Māori excepted land. Background The proposed new interest limitation rules would apply to disallowed residential property (DRP). DRP would include property in use as long-term residential accommodation (such as residential rental property covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 1986) or property whose structure would support long-term residential accommodation and is thus easily substitutable for such accommodation (such as homes converted into short-stay accommodation – commonly advertised on digital platforms). At the simplest level, it would include a house or apartment, regardless of whether it is used to provide long-term or short- stay accommodation. Given this intended scope, commercial properties that are not set up to provide accommodation (for example, office buildings and shops) are not intended to be covered by proposed new subpart DH. 43 However, some commercial properties are used to provide accommodation. Commercial accommodation can take a variety of forms. In some cases, the provision of accommodation is related, but ancillary, to another function of the property (for example, a hospital or hospice). In most cases, it is not intended that these types of property would be subject to interest limitation under subpart DH. This is because, while stays in such properties could be long term, they are generally not substitutable for an owner-occupied property. In other cases, the provision of accommodation is the core function of the property or business. Properties used to provide accommodation on a commercial basis can take a variety of forms. Some of these cannot easily be made suitable for owner-occupation (for example, a hotel or motel) and are thus more suitable for an exclusion, while others could more easily be used or converted to this purpose (for example, short-stay accommodation in what could otherwise be a regular residential home). Some property types are not necessarily commercial in nature, but they do not impact on the general New Zealand housing market and are proposed to be excluded from the rules. These include properties located outside New Zealand or regulated non-commercial residences only available to a particular subset of the population. Where a given property type is not suitable for long-term residential accommodation, and cannot easily be substituted for such, or is otherwise not likely to affect house prices in New Zealand, it is included in proposed new schedule 15. Schedule 15 lists the various forms of excepted residential land that would not be subject to interest limitation. In determining whether a property type should be outside the scope of subpart DH, the key consideration is whether the property is of a type that would normally be available for owner- occupiers. The following factors were relevant in the development of proposed schedule 15: • Regulatory framework and population: Is the property subject to a specific regulatory framework? Are there well-defined rules about who can reside in the accommodation? Is this limited to a certain sector of the population? Are wraparound services mandated? • Physical structure and configuration: Are the accommodation units configured so they could be occupied by a private owner-occupier as a stand-alone dwelling unit? • Unconditional occupation: Can a person occupy the residence indefinitely, or is their occupation conditional on factors other than a tenancy (for example, holding an employment position)? • Incentive for, and barriers to, conversion: Would exclusion of a particular category incentivise the conversion of existing residential property into this type of accommodation? What are the barriers to this conversion process? For example, is the existence of a regulatory framework a significant barrier to conversion? Detailed analysis Proposed new section DH 5(2)(b) provides that land would not be considered DRP for the interest limitation rules to the extent to which it is “excepted residential land”. Proposed new section DH 5(3) defines “excepted residential land” as land to the extent to which it is described in proposed new schedule 15. The schedule lists the different types of land and property that would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. Note that these land or property types would be excepted to the extent that they are described in the schedule. Where some areas of a given parcel of land or 44 property meet the criteria and others do not, a reasonable apportionment would have to be made on normal tax apportionment principles. 16 Main home (clauses 1 and 6) Clauses 1 and 6 of the schedule provide that a person’s main home would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. This would rely on the pre-existing definition of “main home” in section YA 1 – the one place that is used as a residence by the person or, if they have more than one residence, the residence with which they have the greatest connection. Proposed clause 6 is intended to permit interest deductions to continue to be taken where a homeowner rents out a room (or rooms) in their main home to flatmates, private boarders, or as short-stay accommodation. It would also apply to a non-accommodation income- earning use of the main home – for example, a workshop or a contractor’s home office. Proposed clause 1 is intended to mirror the business premises exclusion in the bright-line test, which provides that the business premises exclusion applies for premises used for an accommodation business only if it is the person’s main home. This is intended to capture, for example, a bed and breakfast establishment where the owner lives onsite. Example 27: Main home Tane owns two residential properties – one in Wellington and another up the coast at Waikanae beach. He spends most of his time in Wellington. Tane has a flatmate at his Wellington property. He spends many weekends at his property in Waikanae, normally driving up Friday night and returning to Wellington on Sunday. Tane’s Wellington property is his main home and would not be subject to interest limitation under subpart DH. However, the proportion of his interest expense he can deduct in relation to the rent from his flatmate is limited under other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007. Tane’s Waikanae property would be a DRP. An exception from the interest limitation rules in subpart DH does not mean that interest deductions would automatically be available for the main home. Other requirements in the Income Tax Act 2007 would need to be satisfied, including meeting the general permission (that is, a nexus to income exists) and not being subject to the general limitations. For example, to the extent an expense relates to private use, deductions are generally not available. In a flatmate situation, this would mean apportioning expenses between shared areas, areas exclusively used by the flatmate, and areas exclusively used by the homeowner to determine the amount that is deductible. Example 27 continued: Apportioning interest for the main home exception Consider Tane’s main home in Wellington and the income he derives from having a flatmate. Tane’s monthly interest expense is $600. Tane has exclusive use of one bedroom, an ensuite and a spare room, which he uses as an office. His flatmate has exclusive of a second bedroom and a different bathroom. They both have shared use of the lounge, dining room, kitchen and laundry. Looking at the shared-use and exclusive-use areas, Tane calculates that 30% of his interest expense relates to the income from his flatmate and is deductible, and the remaining 70% 16 For more on this interaction, see the “Definition of disallowed residential property” section of this Commentary. 45 is non-deductible due to the private limitation. Tane would be able to deduct $180 of his monthly interest expense. To qualify for the main home exception, the person who incurs the interest and the person who owns the main home would generally need to be the same person. In most cases, only natural persons can be considered to have main homes. However, an individual who holds their DRP through a transparent entity like a look-through company (LTC) may be able to qualify for the main home exception. This is because shareholders in LTCs are deemed to hold their proportion of LTC assets directly for tax purposes. Opaque structures such as (non-LTC) companies would not have access to the main home exception. Trusts are generally opaque, but it is not uncommon for people to structure their homes in trusts. Therefore, proposed clauses 1 and 6 contain an additional rule for trusts. Proposed clause 1 refers to existing section CB 16A(2), which provides that a property can be the main home for the trustee of a trust if it is the main home of one of the trust’s beneficiaries and a principal settlor does not have a different main home of their own. A principal settlor is someone whose settlements for the trust are the greatest, or greatest equal, by market value. It is intended that clause 6 would apply in similar circumstances to ensure that trusts cannot be used to gain an exception from the interest limitation rules if such an exception would not be available if the settlors held the property directly. Where there are multiple residential properties on the same parcel of land (for example, a self-contained flat or cottage, sometimes advertised as “home and income”), only the property used by the owner as the main home should qualify for the main home exception. Thus, the carve-out from DRP would only apply to the part that is the main home. Other properties on the same title would continue to be DRP and subject to interest limitation under proposed subpart DH. This would be the same result as if the multiple units or properties were on separate legal titles. Example 28: Multiple residences Mandi owns a property that was advertised as “home and income”. The building is split into two –a self- contained one-bedroom flat on the ground floor and a larger three-bedroom unit above it. Mandi lives in the upstairs three-bedroom unit. Mandi wants a flatmate in her unit and also wants to find a tenant for the downstairs flat. Mandi’s friend Miriama moves in to one of the bedrooms upstairs. Mandi advertises the downstairs flat online and finds a tenant to move into it. The upstairs three-bedroom unit is Mandi’s main home and qualifies for the main home exception. Mandi would be able to deduct some of her interest expense against her rental income from Miria ma. The downstairs one-bedroom flat is not part of her main home and would be DRP subject to the interest limitation rules. Business premises (clause 1) Proposed clause 1 of schedule 15 contains an exception for business premises. “Business premises” is defined in section DD 11 for the entertainment expenditure and land sales provisions, as follows: business premises— (a) means the normal business premises or a temporary workplace of the person (or an associate): 46 (b) does not include premises or a workplace established mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment. It is proposed to use this definition for the interest limitation rules. The business premises exception is intended to buttress the general rule in section DH 5(2)(a), which provides that land would only be DRP to the extent it has a place configured as a residence or abode. If the parcel of land does not contain such a structure, it would not be DRP. The interest limitation rules should not apply to property used for commercial purposes unrelated to accommodation (for example, shops, offices, entertainment venues, warehouses, factories). These kinds of property are not generally configured as residences and would therefore be unlikely to meet the basic definition of DRP, but the business premises exception is intended to put any ambiguity beyond doubt. In some cases, the property may originally have been configured a residence or abode but may have been reconfigured for a different purpose or be used for a non-accommodation business. For example, a villa that has been converted into a doctor’s surgery or a restaurant. Such properties should qualify for the business premises exception. Premises used for a business of supplying accommodation would not qualify for the business premises exception in clause 1 of schedule 15. This is to ensure that short-stay accommodation in a standard residential property would be subject to the interest limitation rules in the same way long-term rental property would be. An exclusion for such accommodation could have a detrimental impact on the supply of housing in New Zealand available for renters and owner-occupiers. An exception would exist to this rule where the premises used for a business of supplying accommodation are the person’s main home. This exception is intended to cover bed and breakfast establishments where the owner lives onsite and is discussed under the heading “Main home” above. Businesses providing accommodation on a commercial scale, such as hotels and motels, would be carved out in a specific exception in proposed clause 4, discussed below. Farmland (clause 2) Farmland would be excepted from the interest limitation rules under proposed clause 2 of the schedule. “Farmland” is defined in section YA 1 as land that is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the land’s owner or that, because of its area and nature, is capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business. A farming or agricultural business includes forestry, horticultural and pastoral businesses. To be “capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business”, the parcel of land must be capable of producing revenue sufficient to cover all costs of holding and operating the land over time. This includes the cost of capital employed and a reasonable recompense for the proprietor’s labour. However, given that the proposed new interest limitation rules would apply to land to the extent the land contains a place configured as a residence or abode, the proposed exception for farmland in schedule 15 also specifically includes such structures. This ensures that a farmhouse or workers’ quarters on the farmland would not be subject to interest limitation. 47 Accommodation in medical and care facilities (clause 3) Accommodation provided in hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, or hospices would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. These forms of accommodation are specifically intended for patients and those in need of care and are generally straightforward to distinguish from standard residential properties. These terms are not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each property. Excepted commercial accommodation (clause 4) Accommodation provided in hotels, motels, hostels, inns, or camping grounds would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. These terms are also not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each property. These forms of accommodation are designed predominantly for short-term use on a large- scale commercial basis. They are generally straightforward to distinguish from standard residential properties that could be a private owner-occupied residence. An exception for these listed types of accommodation would not disadvantage prospective owner-occupiers and would not generally impact the housing market. The proposed exceptions in schedule 15 are similar to those contained in the definition of “dwelling” in section YA 1, which applies for other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007. However, unlike the “dwelling” definition, no specific exception is proposed under the interest limitation rules for boardinghouses. This is due to potential confusion regarding the meaning of a “boardinghouse”, as the exceptions are intended to be relatively straightforward and easy to apply and boardinghouses are not straightforward to identify. Many landlords may be familiar with the term “boarding house” as used in the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. This is not necessarily the same as a “boardinghouse” for tax purposes, which is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. Whether a property is a boardinghouse for tax purposes is based on case law and would depend on the facts and circumstances of each property. Larger boardinghouses may be structurally similar to hostels and may not be suitable for owner-occupation, but smaller boardinghouses tend to resemble standard residential properties. Satisfying the definition of a boardinghouse for tax purposes requires some level of services to be provided, but the exact level depends on the specific circumstances. To reduce complexity and prevent confusion, boardinghouses would not be specifically excepted from interest limitation. It is anticipated that many larger-scale boardinghouses, which tend to be more commercial in nature, would be likely to qualify as hostels, which would be excepted. Rest homes and retirement villages (clause 5) Rest homes and retirement villages would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. Retirement villages are defined in the Retirement Villages Act 2003 broadly as premises containing two or more residential units that provide, or are intended to provide, residential accommodation together with services or facilities, or both, predominantly for persons in 48 their retirement. 17 The Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001 considers rest home care to be services provided on premises principally held out as “a residence for people who are frail because of their age”. 18 Both retirement villages and rest homes are subject to regulatory frameworks set out in the above Acts. Student accommodation (clause 7) Certain student accommodation would be excepted from the interest limitation rules. “Student accommodation” would be defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to align with the pre-existing regulatory regime in section 5(1)(h) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, as follows: • means a boarding establishment used for the accommodation of students enrolled at a registered school or premises described in section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, and • includes premises described in section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 even if they are used mainly, and not exclusively, for the accommodation of students. Broadly, section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 describes premises owned or operated by, or in conjunction with, a tertiary education provider and used to provide accommodation for students. A “tertiary education provider” is defined in section 10(1) of the Education and Training Act 2020 and includes universities, wānanga, Te Pūkenga—New Zealand Institute of Skills and Technology, private training establishments and government training establishments. This exception would be available for halls of residence and hostels that are either owned by the tertiary education provider, or another entity that has a specific arrangement with the tertiary education provider, and that meet the requirements under the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. This exception would not be available to a landlord who leases their residential rental property to students privately. This is because tertiary education providers are often located in urban centres and the properties rented by students could also be rented or occupied by other people, including workers and families. An exception for properties rented to students on the general market could therefore displace other renters or owner occupiers. Example 29: Accommodation rented to students that does not meet criteria Ralph owns a five-bedroom house in Kelburn, close to Victoria University of Wellington. Because of its proximity to the university, Ralph rents the rooms in the property exclusively to students on an individual basis. Ralph decided that this approach was more convenient and more appropriate for his investment strategy than renting out the house on a single lease. Although the property is accommodation provided exclusively to students, Ralph has no arrangement with the university as set out in section 5B(5) of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. Likewise, he does not provide any services for his student tenants over and above the minimum required under Part 2 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 (as would be required by section 5B(2)). The property would not be excepted residential land and would therefore be DRP and subject to the interest limitation rules. 17 See section 6 of the Retirement Villages Act 2003. 18 See section 6 of the Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001. 49 Section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 requires that the property must be exclusively used to provide accommodation to students. However, paragraph (b) of the proposed definition of “student accommodation” provides that exclusive use as student accommodation over the course of the year would not be required for the exception to be available. This is intended to allow the exception for student accommodation to continue to apply for the year where, for example, apartments in a hall of residence are rented out over the summer break to non-students. Example 30: Student accommodation used for other purposes over summer break StudyLyfe is a hall of residence owner, registered with a university in accordance with the requirements of section 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986. It operates a single building with 100 apartments. During semesters one and two, all 100 apartments are rented exclusively to students. However, over the summer, the reduced demand for tuition means the demand for student accommodation is also reduced. StudyLyfe continues to rent out 20 apartments to summer students but puts the other 80 on the general rental market on short-term leases. Although the hall is not exclusively used for student accommodation over the summer, paragraph (b) of the proposed definition of “student accommodation” means the building would qualify as excepted residential land for the whole year. No apportionment is required to reflect the change of use in the summer period. StudyLyfe’s building would not be subject to the interest limitation rules in subpart DH. Employee accommodation (clause 8) Employee accommodation would be excepted residential land and excluded from the proposed interest limitation rules. The proposed definition in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would define “employee accommodation” as property a person provides to their employees or other workers for accommodation in connection with their employment or service. However, it would not include accommodation provided to employees or other workers who are associated with the person, unless it is necessary for the person to provide the accommodation because of the nature or remoteness of their business. The proposed definition would follow the existing exclusion for employee accommodation in the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. Māori excepted land (clause 9) Clause 9 of schedule 15 would provide that “Māori excepted land” is excepted residential land and therefore excluded from being DRP. “Māori excepted land” would be defined in section YA 1 as follows: • Māori customary land, Māori freehold land, Crown land reserved for Māori, and land set aside as a Māori reservation (paragraph (a)(i)). • Housing on land owned by a Māori authority (including an entity which is eligible to be a Māori authority) that is provided as a residence to its shareholders or beneficiaries. The exclusion would apply regardless of whether the entity in question owns the housing. This is intended to cover Māori communal housing forms, such as papakāinga and kaumātua housing, where such housing is on general title land and not covered by proposed new paragraph (a)(i) (paragraph (a)(ii)). • Land acquired by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) under a Treaty settlement or a post-Treaty settlement mechanism (for example, through a right of first refusal). This should include land that is subsequently transferred by the post- settlement governance entity to members of the claimant group. However, where the 50 land is held by a Māori authority (or entity eligible to be one) and leased to an entity that is not a subsidiary of the Māori authority, the lessee should not be able to claim the exception. In this case, only the lessor would qualify for the exception from interest limitation (paragraph (a)(iii) and (b)). Paragraph (a)(i) Proposed paragraph (a)(i) is intended to provide an exception for papakāinga or kaumātua housing. The aims of papakāinga housing include providing whānau with quality affordable housing and promoting Māori community development. Papakāinga housing therefore plays an important role in supporting and fostering cultural identity and financial stability. Kaumātua housing can play a similar role, while also recognising the important role that elders have in society. The interest limitation rules should not hamper these aims. The terms in proposed paragraph (a)(i) should be understood as being synonymous with the relevant terms in the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. The legal framework in Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 governs the use of Māori land and how such land can be bought and sold. In many cases, the land in proposed paragraph (a)(i) would not satisfy the general definition of a DRP to begin with. In this situation, the exception would put beyond doubt that the rules in subpart DH would not apply. In other cases, where there is residential property on the land (for example, in the form of papakāinga or kaumātua housing), the ability to reside in the property would generally only be available through an occupation order or a licence to occupy and may be limited to those having a connection to the hapū or whānau who hold the land. It is uncommon that land such as that described in proposed paragraph (a)(i) would be able to be sold, or rented, to a member of the general public. It would not be straightforward for property investors to invest in Māori land or convert general title land to Māori land. Therefore, this exception would not be able to be used to avoid the application of the interest limitation rules, nor would an exception for these land categories disadvantage owner-occupiers relative to property investors. Paragraph (a)(ii) Not all papakāinga and kaumātua housing is on Māori title land and covered by the exception in paragraph (a)(i). The intent of proposed paragraph (a)(ii) is to provide an exception where papakāinga and kaumātua housing is located on general title land. Properties on general title land that have been used to provide long-term rental accommodation should, in most cases, be subject to interest limitation. This should include where a Māori authority holds a residential property on general title land that it rents out on arm’s length terms. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(ii) has been designed to not apply too broadly. The exception would only apply where housing on land owned by a Māori authority, or an entity eligible to be one, is provided to a shareholder or beneficiary of that Māori authority or eligible entity. 19 19 Māori authorities can be trusts or companies. 51 However, the entity that actually manages the housing would not need to be the one that owns the land. This is how the social housing exemption in proposed new section DH 4(4) would operate too. 20 In some situations, the Māori authority set up to hold the land is not the entity that develops the property or manages the papakāinga or kaumātua housing. This could be for a variety of reasons, for example, due to the original mandate of the land-owning Māori authority. The land-owning entity may contract out to a subsidiary or another party to manage the provision of housing. In such a case, the exception in proposed paragraph (a)(ii) would still be available. Example 31: Māori housing on general title managed by entity that is not a Māori authority An iwi acquires a large block of land on general title close to its marae. It decides to invest in a papakāinga housing development on this land to encourage community development around the marae. The land is held by a trust that is eligible to be a Māori authority, MATrust, which benefits the iwi and its members. MATrust has a loan that was drawn down to acquire the land. MATrust enters into an arrangement with a related entity, PPKCo, for the construction and management of the housing. PPKCo engages a private developer, DevCo, to construct the papakāinga housing. PPKCo takes out a loan to fund the construction of the papakāinga houses. It builds the houses and rents them to members of the iwi at affordable rates. Once constructed, PPKCo owns the housing on the land. While PPKCo manages the properties on a day-to-day basis, the land remains ultimately owned by MATrust. As the housing is on land owned by an entity eligible to be a Māori authority (MATrust) and provided as a residence to the beneficiaries (the iwi members who benefit from MATrust), the housing would be covered by paragraph (a)(ii). This is the case even though the housing is provided by a different entity, PPKCo. The exception in proposed paragraph (a)(ii) would apply for both MATrust and PPKCo. Paragraph (a)(iii) and (b) An exception is also considered to be appropriate in the context of land acquired under a Treaty settlement, given the role of Treaty settlements in acknowledging and addressing breaches by the Crown under Te Tiriti o Waitangi – The Treaty of Waitangi. It would not be appropriate for interest limitation to impact the value of Treaty settlements or the economic viability of Treaty settlement land. It could also create fairness issues between iwi groups that have already settled and those that have not. Therefore, proposed paragraph (a)(iii) would provide that land held by a Māori authority, or entity eligible to be one, where the land was acquired as part of a Treaty settlement (including post-Treaty settlement mechanisms such as a right of first refusal) would be Māori excepted land and not subject to the interest limitation rules. If the land is on-sold, for example, to a property investor beyond the claimant group, the exception would not apply to that subsequent owner. Note that for tax purposes, land includes an “interest in land”, which can include a ground lease from the perspective of the lessee. Many apartment buildings, particularly in Auckland city, are on ground lease land – this means that an investor in such an apartment would have 20 For more on the social housing exemption, see the “Social, emergency, transitional, and council housing” section of this Commentary. 52 a leasehold interest, rather than a freehold interest. They would own the physical apartment but not the underlying land. It is not uncommon for Treaty settlement land to be the subject of a long-term ground lease, for example, on a 99-year term. This allows the land to be developed and used efficiently by a third party, while ensuring continuing ownership of the land itself. Proposed paragraph (b) provides that the exception in paragraph (a)(iii) for Treaty settlement land would not apply to leasehold interests. The exception in proposed paragraph (a)(iii) is intended to apply only to the underlying owner of the land. For an investor purchasing a leasehold apartment, it should not matter to them who the ground lessor is or whether the land was returned under a Treaty settlement. Therefore, proposed paragraph (b) is necessary to ensure that a property investor with a leasehold interest in an apartment on Treaty settlement land would not be excluded from the interest limitation rules. In some situations, the Māori authority (or eligible entity) that holds the land may not be able to use that particular entity to undertake development activity or manage the use of the land. Instead, they may set up another entity to carry out these activities and, to permit full use of the land, a ground lease may be entered into with the subsidiary as the lessee. In this case, the restriction in paragraph (b) should not apply, and it is intended that both the land- holding Māori authority and the lessee subsidiary should satisfy the definition in paragraph (a)(ii) so that the land is Māori excepted land and excluded from the interest limitation rules. Example 32: Ground leases and Treaty settlement land exception LeaseCo is a private company engaged in property investment. LeaseCo has a 150-year ground lease for a parcel of land from a Māori authority for the purpose of building long-term rental properties. LeaseCo owns the properties and derives rental income from the tenants. The Māori authority retains underlying ownership of the land. The Māori authority acquired the land in question via a post-Treaty settlement mechanism that gave it a right of first refusal over the purchase of the land; however, the Māori authority had to take out a loan to purchase the land. The Māori authority would not be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules in relation to its loan for the land, as the land meets the requirements of the proposed definition of “Māori excepted land” (paragraph (a)(iii)) and is therefore excluded from being DRP. However, as LeaseCo is not owned by a Māori authority or an entity eligible to become one, the land would be excluded from the proposed definition for LeaseCo by paragraph (b). The land would therefore be DRP and LeaseCo would be subject to the proposed interest limitation rules in subpart DH in relation to the interest it incurs on the rental properties. 53 TRANSITIONAL RESIDENTIAL INTEREST Clauses 64E (proposed sections DH 5(5), DH 7, DH 8(1), (2), DH 9) and 127(7E) and (17C) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would progressively deny deductions for “transitional residential interest” from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025. From 1 April 2025, such deductions would no longer be allowed. “Transitional residential interest” is interest on the principal of a grandparented transitional loan, to the extent the interest is incurred for disallowed residential property (DRP) or treated as being incurred for DRP. “Grandparented transitional loans” are New Zealand dollar denominated loans first drawn down before 27 March 2021, though there are some exceptions for DRP acquired near the 27 March 2021 date. Application date The proposed amendments would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features In general, interest incurred for DRP would be denied from 1 October 2021. However, interest under a “grandparented transitional loan” may qualify as “transitional residential interest”. A grandparented transitional loan will generally be a loan drawn down before 27 March 2021, with some exceptions for DRP acquired near the 27 March 2021 date. For transitional residential interest, the amount of the interest deduction denied would be progressively increased from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025. From 1 April 2025, deductions for transitional residential interest would no longer be allowed. Background The proposed interest limitation rules would apply to interest incurred for DRP, even if the DRP was acquired before the policy was announced on 23 March 2021. As such, the rules would impact some taxpayers who made decisions before the policy was announced and may face cashflow problems if interest deductions were denied in full immediately from 1 October 2021. The provisions dealing with transitional residential interest seek to mitigate the cashflow impacts of the rules on those who purchased property before the policy’s announcement. They would do so by increasing the amount of interest denied gradually from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025, until interest is fully denied from 1 April 2025. This is to allow taxpayers more time to adjust to the new interest limitation rules. 54 Detailed analysis From 1 October 2021 until 31 March 2025, a percentage of deductions for transitional residential interest would be denied under grandparenting rules in proposed new section DH 8(2). The percentages are set out in the table below. From 1 April 2025, deductions for transitional residential interest would be fully denied (that is, transitional residential interest would be treated the same as other interest incurred for DRP). Table 2 Period that transitional residential interest is incurred Percentage denied 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 25% 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 25% 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025 75% On and after 1 April 2025 100% The periods in the table above would apply regardless of a taxpayer’s balance date. Therefore, taxpayers who do not have a 31 March balance date may have to apply different percentages from the table above as relevant to the transitional residential interest incurred within their income year, depending on whether the interest was incurred before or after 31 March. The portion of the interest expense not denied under proposed new section DH 8 would remain deductible provided the other requirements for deductibility are met. This may include satisfying the general permission in section DA 1 and ensuring none of the general limitations in section DA 2 apply. Transitional residential interest “Transitional residential interest” is defined in proposed new section DH 7 and is interest on the principal of a “grandparented transitional loan” to the extent to which the interest is incurred for DRP or treated as being incurred for DRP. 21 Example 33: Transitional residential interest Joe took out an interest-only loan to acquire a DRP in 2017. As at 26 March 2021, the balance of Joe’s loan is $500,000 and the interest rate is 4.0% pa. Joe does not make any principal repayments on the loan. The loan would be a grandparented transitional loan and the grandparenting rules would apply to Joe as follows: • From 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $10,000, which is fully deductible. • From 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $10,000, but 25% of this ($2,500) is denied. 21 For more on the situations where interest is treated as being incurred for DRP, see the “Grandparented transitional loans that cannot be traced” section of this Commentary. 55 • From 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 25% of this ($5,000) is denied. • From 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 50% of this ($10,000) is denied. • From 1 April 2024 to 31 March 2025, Joe incurs interest expenditure of $20,000, but 75% of this ($15,000) is denied. From 1 April 2025 onwards, Joe would not be allowed any deductions for interest under his loan. Grandparented transitional loan A “grandparented transitional loan” is defined in proposed new section DH 5(5). A grandparented transitional loan would generally be a loan first drawn down before 27 March 2021 for DRP. Re-drawings and additional borrowings under the same loan facility on or after 27 March 2021 do not form part of the grandparented transitional loan. 22 The definition of “grandparented transitional loan” would also extend the grandparenting rules to two types of loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 – for DRP acquired before 27 March 2021 or for DRP acquired from an irrevocable offer made on or before 23 March 2021. Property acquired before 27 March 2021 Proposed new section DH 5(5)(b) would include within the definition of a grandparented transitional loan a loan that funds the acquisition of DRP acquired before 27 March 2021 where the loan is not drawn down until on or after that date. This would be relevant where someone entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement before 27 March 2021, but settlement did not occur until on or after 27 March 2021. Interest under such loans would be transitional residential interest. Example 34: Grandparented transitional loan – settlement on or after 27 March 2021 Petra entered into a binding sale and purchase agreement to acquire a property in February 2021. Settlement did not take place until April 2021, when she drew down a $400,000 loan to complete the purchase. The $400,000 loan would be a grandparented transitional loan under proposed new section DH 5(5)(b). Petra’s interest on her loan is $1,000 per month and would qualify as transitional residential interest. Between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2023, $250 of her monthly interest expense would be denied, and the remaining $750 may be deductible subject to other income tax rules. Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, $500 of her monthly interest expense would be denied. Between 1 April 2024 and 31 March 2025, $750 of her monthly interest expense would be denied. From 1 April 2025, Petra would not be able to claim any interest deduction. Example 35: Additional borrowings In May 2021, Petra drew down an additional $100,000 to add an extra floor onto the same property. Interest on this $100,000 is $250 per month. The additional $100,000 was not part of the loan required to complete the terms of the sale and purchase agreement signed before 27 March 2021. Therefore, it does not qualify as a grandparented transitional loan (or part of such a loan). From 1 October 2021, Petra cannot claim any deduction for the $250 per month interest expense incurred on the additional $100,000. 22 An exception to this is the proposed high water mark rules: see the “High water mark” section of this Commentary. 56 For tax purposes, a property is generally acquired on the date a binding sale and purchase agreement is entered into (even if some conditions still need to be met). Further information on when a property is acquired can be found in QB 17/02. 23 Irrevocable offers made on or before 23 March 2021 Proposed new section DH 5(5)(c) would include within the definition of a grandparented transitional loan a loan that funds the acquisition of DRP if the acquisition resulted from an offer made on or before 23 March 2021 that could not be revoked by the purchaser before 27 March 2021. Irrevocable offers are common when sale is by tender. Prospective purchasers are required to make irrevocable offers for a property by a certain date, with the vendor accepting an offer after that date. The subsection only applies to offers made on or before 23 March 2021, which was the date the proposed interest limitation rules were announced. A purchaser who made an offer on or before 23 March 2021 that was irrevocable before 27 March 2021 was legally committed to purchase the property if their offer was accepted. They are therefore in a similar position to people who purchased a property before 27 March 2021 and can also benefit from the grandparenting rules described above. Example 36: Grandparented transitional loan – irrevocable offer Ted made an offer to purchase a property through a tender process that closed on 22 March 2021, but the offer was not accepted until 27 March 2021. The terms of the tender stated that he could not withdraw the offer until 28 March 2021. Therefore, Ted would meet the requirements of section DH 5(4)(c) and his loan to acquire the property would be a grandparented transitional loan. Foreign currency loans Proposed new section DH 5(5) provides that grandparented transitional loans must be denominated in New Zealand Dollars. Proposed new section DH 9 also excludes a foreign currency loan from the limited denial of interest under proposed new section DH 8(2). “Interest” for income tax purposes includes amounts calculated under the financial arrangements rules. 24 For a foreign currency loan, income under the financial arrangements rules will include foreign exchange gains and losses, which can fluctuate from year to year. These fluctuations would make the calculation of transitional residential interest for a foreign currency loan too complex. This means a deduction for interest for a foreign currency loan would be fully denied from 1 October 2021. It is intended that a person with a foreign currency loan for DRP could refinance the loan in New Zealand Dollars and that New Zealand Dollar loan would become transitional residential interest for the period from when the New Zealand Dollar loan is drawn down. 23 QB 17/2: Income tax – date of acquisition of land, and start date for 2-year bright-line test, \[TIB Vol 29, No 4, May 2017, taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz\] 24 See paragraph (c) of the definition of “interest” in section YA 1. 57 GRANDPARENTED TRANSITIONAL LOANS THAT CANNOT BE TRACED Clauses 64E (proposed sections DH 5(5), DH 7, DH 8(1), (2) and DH 12) and 127(7E) and (17C) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would apply where a grandparented transitional loan was used for both disallowed residential property (DRP) and other taxable uses and it is not possible to determine how much of the loan was used for DRP. The proposed amendment would deem a portion of the loan principal as having been used to acquire DRP, and interest on that portion would qualify for the grandparenting rules. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Proposed new section DH 7 deals with transitional residential interest. The proposed section would effectively treat a grandparented transitional loan that cannot be traced (an untraceable loan) as being used to acquire “allowed property” before being used to acquire DRP. This would be done based on the value of allowed property held by the relevant taxpayer on 26 March 2021. Allowed property is property that gives rise to assessable income and is not DRP, other than DRP subject to the new build, land business or development exemptions. If the balance of the untraceable loan is less than the value of allowed property held on 26 March 2021, interest on the loan would not be subject to limitation under proposed subpart DH. If the balance of the untraceable loan exceeds the value of allowed property held on 26 March 2021, the excess would be the “notional loan principal” and treated as being used to acquire DRP. Interest on that notional loan principal would be transitional residential interest and would be denied under proposed new section DH 8 on a progressive basis between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. If a portion of an untraceable loan is treated as being used to acquire DRP, loan repayments would generally be treated as being applied to reduce the notional loan principal until it reached zero. An exception to this general rule is if the repayment is funded from a disposal of allowed property. In that case, the repayment would not reduce the notional loan principal. Background Generally, interest would be denied under the proposed new interest limitation rules if it is incurred for DRP. Taxpayers must apply the same general principles used in other parts of the Income Tax Act 2007 – such as the general permission in section DA 1(1)(a) – to determine whether interest is incurred for DRP. 58 A grandparented transitional loan would almost always be a loan drawn down before 27 March 2021. 25 It may not always be possible to trace such a loan and determine how much of the loan proceeds were used for DRP. This could be the case for grandparented transitional loans in companies, as companies did not previously need to trace their borrowings because of section DB 7. It could also be the case for a taxpayer who has used borrowed funds for both DRP and for other income-earning purposes and cannot determine retrospectively how much of the borrowings were used for DRP. The rule in proposed new section DH 7 would only apply to grandparented transitional loans that cannot be traced. If a grandparented transitional loan can be traced, even if it is difficult or inconvenient to do so, the rule would not apply. Detailed analysis Grandparented transitional loans and transitional residential interest Proposed new section DH 8(1)(a) would deny a deduction for interest incurred for DRP but would exclude interest under a grandparented transitional loan, while proposed new section DH 8(1)(b) would deny a deduction for transitional residential interest. The reason for this is because a grandparented transitional loan could have been for both DRP and other property, 26 and interest on only a portion of that loan should be denied under subpart DH. For such loans, only a portion of the interest on the loan would be “transitional residential interest” and the remaining portion would not be subject to limitation under subpart DH at all. “Transitional residential interest” is defined in proposed new section DH 7 and would be interest under a grandparented transitional loan that is: • interest for the loan’s principal to the extent to which the interest is incurred for DRP, or • if the loan is an untraceable loan, the portion of interest calculated by reference to a notional loan principal. An untraceable loan is a grandparented transitional loan used for both DRP and allowed property where the portion incurred for DRP cannot be determined. The notional loan principal is an amount that the taxpayer is treated as having used on 26 March 2021 to acquire DRP. It is determined by applying proposed new sections DH 7(2) and (4). Notional loan principal A taxpayer with an untraceable loan would have to apply the formula in proposed section DH 7(2) to work out their notional loan principal. The formula is: outstanding borrowings – allowed property 25 There are two situations in proposed new section DH 5(5)(b) and (c) where a grandparented transitional loan may be drawn down on or after 27 March 2021. However, the transitional rule in proposed new section DH 7 would not apply to such loans as taxpayers would be able to trace these loans. 26 To be a “grandparented transitional loan”, the loan would have to be drawn down for DRP. A loan that was for both DRP and other purposes is still for DRP, so may still qualify as a grandparented transitional loan. 59 If the formula gives rise to a negative amount, it would be treated as zero. An amount of zero would mean that the untraceable loan is effectively treated as being applied entirely to allowed property, with no portion treated as being applied to DRP. The terms used in the formula are explained further in proposed section DH 7(3): • outstanding borrowings is the principal of the underlying grandparented transitional loan, on 26 March 2021, to the extent it is used for both DRP and allowed property. Outstanding borrowings used for private or non-taxable purposes are excluded because interest on such borrowings has never been deductible. Taxpayers claiming a deduction for interest relating to DRP have always been required to trace their private borrowings separately from such property. Therefore, the formula only applies to borrowings for which interest expenses were deductible for tax purposes before 1 October 2021. • allowed property is the total of the taxpayer’s property on 26 March 2021, ignoring property that is not used in deriving assessable income and only including DRP if it is subject to a new build, land business or development exemption. To apply the formula, taxpayers would need to use the valuation rules set out in proposed new section DH 12. These rules are based on the existing valuation rules for residential rental loss ring-fencing in section EL 19. If an untraceable loan is less than the value of allowed property held on 26 March 2021, interest on the loan would not be subject to limitation under proposed new subpart DH. If the untraceable loan exceeds the value of allowed property held on 26 March 2021, a notional amount of the loan exceeding the value of allowed property would be treated as being used to acquire DRP. Interest on that notional amount would be subject to limitation as transitional residential interest under proposed new section DH 8. Example 37: No notional loan principal On 26 March 2021, Tiffany owns two properties that she uses to earn taxable rental income. Both properties were acquired at around the same time in the 1990s: • a DRP, purchased for $300,000, with a current capital value of $900,000, and • a commercial rental property, purchased for $400,000, with a current capital value of $850,000. She acquired the two properties using a combination of loans and savings. Over the years, Tiffany has refinanced and restructured her loans several times and has made many repayments. On 26 March 2021, she has a single grandparented transitional loan of $200,000 and no other debt. Although Tiffany never used her loan for personal purposes, she did not trace exactly how the borrowed funds were applied to each property in the past and does not have the records to do so now. Applying the formula in proposed new section DH 7(2), outstanding borrowings less allowed property is: $200,000 – $850,000 = negative $650,000 As the amount is a negative number, it is treated as zero. Therefore, Tiffany would not have a notional loan balance under proposed new section DH 7(2), so none of the interest incurred under her grandparented transitional loan would be transitional residential interest. The interest under her grandparented transitional loan would therefore not be subject to limitation under proposed subpart DH, and Tiffany can continue to deduct all her interest expenditure under the loan indefinitely. In summary, under proposed new section DH 7, untraceable loans for which interest expenses were previously allowed are first treated as being applied to any allowed property owned by the taxpayer before being applied to DRP. This ensures that taxpayers’ borrowings for allowed property are not affected by the interest limitation rules. 60 Repayments As explained above, proposed new section DH 7 may treat interest on only part of a loan as transitional residential interest, with interest on the remaining part not being subject to limitation under proposed subpart DH. The proposed section would therefore treat a single loan as two loans – one being for DRP, the other being for allowed property. An effect of this is that when a repayment is made reducing the balance of the single loan, it is necessary to establish whether the amount treated as being for DRP or the amount treated as being for allowed property is reduced. Under proposed new section DH 7(4), the general rule is that repayments are treated as being applied to the notional loan balance first (that is, the amount treated as being for DRP), until the notional loan balance reaches zero. Once the notional loan balance reaches zero, none of the interest incurred under the (actual) loan will be transitional residential interest. Example 38: General rule for repayments Sanjay earns income from rental properties. On 26 March 2021, Sanjay owns the following assets that he uses to earn taxable rental income: • a DRP in Christchurch, with a current capital value of $500,000 • a commercial rental property in Ashburton, with a current capital value of $400,000, and • a commercial rental property in Timaru, with a current capital value of $200,000. Sanjay’s assets were acquired using a combination of loans and savings. On 26 March 2021, he has one outstanding interest-only loan of $800,000 and no other debt. Sanjay has always been careful never to use his borrowings for personal purposes, but he did not trace how the borrowed funds were applied in the past and does not have the records to do so now. For the income year ended 31 March 2022 From 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021, Sanjay’s interest expenditure under his loan totals $18,000. From 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022, Sanjay’s interest expenditure under his loan totals $20,000. Sanjay’s $18,000 interest expenditure incurred before 1 October 2021 would not be affected by the proposed new interest limitation rules and remains fully deductible. For the remaining $20,000 interest expenditure incurred after 1 October 2021, Sanjay would have to apply the rules in proposed new section DH 7. Applying the formula in proposed new section DH 7(2), outstanding borrowings less allowed property is: $800,000 – ($400,000 + $200,000) = $200,000 Sanjay’s notional loan balance would therefore be $200,000. Interest on $200,000 of Sanjay’s loan would be transitional residential interest. Interest on the remaining loan portion of $600,000 would not be subject to limitation. To work out his transitional residential interest, Sanjay would have to divide his notional loan principal by his total outstanding borrowings and multiply the result by his interest under the loan: 200,000/800,000 x $20,000 = $5,000 of transitional residential interest The amount of interest denied under proposed new section DH 8 would therefore be $5,000 x 25% = $1,250. For the income year ended 31 March 2023 Sanjay receives an inheritance, and he uses it to make a lump sum repayment of $100,000 on his loan on 1 April 2022. His total interest expenditure incurred under the loan for the income year is $30,000. Sanjay’s loan balance on 31 March 2023 is $700,000. Applying the rule in proposed new section DH 7(4), the reduction in the loan balance would be applied against his notional loan balance. Therefore, Sanjay’s notional loan principal would be reduced from $200,000 to $100,000. The amount that is transitional residential interest would be calculated as follows: 61 100,000/700,000 x $30,000 = $4,286 The amount of interest denied under proposed new section DH 8 would therefore be $4,286 x 25% = $1,071. Proposed new section DH 7(4) contains an exception to the general rule for repayments. The exception would apply when allowed property that was held on 26 March 2021 is sold, and the sale proceeds are used to repay the outstanding borrowings. If allowed property were sold, the part of the loan treated as being for allowed property should be reduced, instead of the part treated as being for DRP. Therefore, the notional DRP loan would not be reduced. Example 39: Repayments from sale of allowed property Assume the same facts as in example 38, but instead of receiving an inheritance, Sanjay sells his Timaru property for $200,000 and uses the proceeds to make the $100,000 lump sum repayment. He uses the remaining $100,000 from the sale proceeds to pay for repairs and improvements to his Ashburton property. For the income year ended 31 March 2023 Sanjay’s loan balance on 31 March 2023 is $700,000 and his total interest expenditure under the loan for the income year is $30,000. Applying the rule in proposed new section DH 7(4), Sanjay’s notional loan principal would be unchanged from $200,000. The amount that is transitional residential interest would be calculated as follows: 200,000/700,000 x $30,000 = $8,571 The amount of interest denied under proposed new section DH 8 would therefore be $8,571 x 25% = $2,143. Existing law on tracing applies to changes of use on or after 27 March 2021 Under existing law on tracing of funds, where funds have been borrowed and the use of the borrowed funds changes, the deductibility of interest on those funds may also change as the funds are “traced” to a new use. For example, if a taxpayer borrows to acquire a van for their business, interest on their borrowings will be deductible. If they then sell the van and use the sale proceeds to go on holiday, interest on the borrowings will become non-deductible. These situations can give rise to complexity, but taxpayers can avoid this by ensuring that proceeds from the disposal of business property are only used for other busines purposes. As explained above, proposed new section DH 7 may treat a single loan as being partly for DRP and partly for allowed property, or entirely for allowed property. Existing law on tracing would apply if the DRP or allowed property held on 26 March 2021 is disposed of, and the proceeds are applied to new uses. Example 40: Disposal of allowed property held on 26 March 2021 LandCo is a close company that earns income from some residential and commercial rental properties. On 26 March 2021, LandCo holds the following; • a DRP, with a current capital value of $500,000 • a commercial rental property, with a current capital value of $500,000, and • an untraceable interest-only loan of $600,000 at 4% pa. For the income year ended 31 March 2022 From 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021, LandCo’s interest expenditure totals $12,000. From 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022, LandCo’s interest expenditure totals $12,000. 62 LandCo’s $12,000 interest expenditure incurred before 1 October 2021 would not be affected by the proposed new interest limitation rules and remains fully deductible. For the remaining $12,000 interest expenditure incurred after 1 October 2021, LandCo would have to apply the rules in proposed new section DH 7. Applying the formula in proposed new section DH 7(2), outstanding borrowings less allowed property is: $600,000 – $500,000 = $100,000 LandCo’s notional loan balance would therefore be $100,000. Interest on $100,000 of LandCo’s loan would be transitional residential interest. Interest on the remaining loan portion of $500,000 would not be subject to limitation. To work out its transitional residential interest, LandCo would have to divide its notional loan principal by its total outstanding borrowings and multiply the result by its interest under the loan: 100,000/600,000 x $12,000 = $2,000 of transitional residential interest The amount of interest denied under proposed new section DH 8 would therefore be $2,000 x 25% = $500. For the income year ended 31 March 2023 On 1 April 2022, LandCo sells the commercial rental property and uses the proceeds to acquire an old-build DRP. Under existing tracing principles, interest on the $500,000 loan portion would be fully denied under proposed new section DH 8. Interest on the $100,000 notional loan balance would remain transitional residential interest. 63 HIGH WATER MARK Clause 64E (proposed section DH 10) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would simplify the calculation of transitional residential interest for taxpayers with variable balance loans. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features The proposed amendment would introduce a transitional rule, referred to in the discussion document as a “high water mark”, to simplify the calculation of transitional residential interest for taxpayers with variable balance loans (such as a revolving credit facility or an overdraft). This would mean taxpayers with such loans would not be required to trace each individual withdrawal and deposit to that loan account between 27 March 2021 and 31 March 2025. A taxpayer who has used a variable balance loan for disallowed residential property (DRP) would be able to treat this loan as a grandparented transitional loan while the balance of the loan (the affected loan balance) remains less than or equal to the initial loan balance on 26 March 2021. The interest would be transitional residential interest and subject to the grandparenting rules. 27 If the affected loan balance is higher than the initial loan balance on 26 March 2021, only interest on the initial loan balance would be transitional residential interest. Background Under the current law, a variable balance loan can result in declining interest deductions over time if the loan is used to finance a mixture of taxable and private activities. However, if a variable balance loan is used to finance only taxable activity, such as owning a residential rental property, this can provide the taxpayer with flexibility in their funding while ensuring all interest will be deductible. Without proposed new section DH 10, a variable balance loan that finances DRP under the interest limitation proposals could result in the amount treated as a grandparented transitional loan declining faster than the underlying loan balance. That is because each loan payment (such as deposit of rent received) would reduce the amount of the grandparented transitional loan, while each drawdown (such as a regular interest charge) would be treated as new borrowing that did not qualify as a grandparented transitional loan. This would mean that 27 For more on this, see the “Transitional residential interest” section of this Commentary. 64 the amount of transitional residential interest could also reduce even if the balance of the loan, and the interest charged on that loan, remained constant. The high water mark proposal is designed to simplify the calculation of transitional residential interest for variable balance loans. It should also prevent the need for taxpayers to refinance with a less desirable standard loan simply because of its more favourable tax treatment. Detailed analysis Application Although this proposed provision is designed to apply to variable balance loans (such as a revolving credit facility or an overdraft), the application provision in proposed new section DH 10(1) does not include this restriction. This is to prevent the need to define the boundary of what is a variable balance loan. For loans that do not have a variable balance, such as table loans or interest-only loans, this provision would typically not have any practical effect as the balance would not increase above that owed on 26 March 2021. The provision specifically provides that it would only apply to those who choose to rely on it. What interest can be transitional residential interest Proposed new section DH 10(6) provides that a person’s transitional residential interest (that is, the amount of interest incurred under the loan that would be affected by the denial of deductibility under the grandparenting rules) would be calculated based on the lower of: • the amount of their loan that is for DRP (the affected loan balance), and • the initial loan balance on the date transitional residential interest is first calculated (usually 26 March 2021 but see below). The advantage of this is that a person with a variable balance loan that has been applied solely to DRP would be able to treat all interest as transitional residential interest provided their affected loan balance remains at or below their initial loan balance. For a person who has also applied their loan for other purposes (for example, a deductible purpose, such as a new build or commercial property, or on private expenditure) or who has increased their affected loan balance above the initial loan balance, the calculation of transitional residential interest would still be simpler and result in a higher amount of transitional residential interest than if proposed new section DH 10 was not available. Initial loan balance The initial loan balance for most taxpayers would be the balance of their grandparented transitional loan at the end of 26 March 2021. For taxpayers who borrowed after this date to acquire a DRP that meets paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of a “grandparented transitional loan”, it is intended that the initial loan balance would be set on that date. Affected loan balance The affected loan balance is the actual loan balance, at any particular time, applied to DRP that qualifies for grandparenting. Under proposed new section DH 10(5), this amount requires adjustments for further amounts borrowed under the loan since the date of the initial 65 loan balance. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure the amount that has been spent on grandparented DRP can be determined and compared against the initial loan balance. If the affected loan balance was above the initial loan balance for only part of a year, it is intended that separate transitional residential interest calculations would be completed for each of these periods to arrive at a single transitional residential interest calculation for the year. As a lender is unlikely to provide a breakdown of interest charged on a daily basis, a taxpayer in this situation would be required to breakdown their interest calculations beyond that provided by their lender. While this would add complexity, it is seen as an unavoidable consequence of the overall approach; a taxpayer who keeps their affected loan balance below their initial loan balance will not face this complication. An example of the intended calculation of the affected loan balance is included in example 41 below. This example shows the effect (excluding adjustments for interest) when a single loan has been applied for a mixture of DRP, fully deductible activities and private purposes. If a variable balance loan is only applied for DRP, no adjustments between the balance of the loan and the affected loan balance would be required, which would simplify the required calculations. Example 41: Revolving credit facility On 26 March 2021, Darryl owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility used to fund his residential rental property. The revolving credit facility has a limit of $600,000. Darryl does not use this account to fund any private expense or for any other deductible uses. His initial loan balance is therefore $500,000. Although the balance fluctuates as he receives rent and pays expenses, by 30 September 2021 the balance of the revolving credit facility (the affected loan balance) is $480,000. Provided the affected loan balance does not go above $500,000 before the transitional period ends on 31 March 2025, Darryl would be able to calculate the amount of his interest deductions that were denied by multiplying all the interest charged on the revolving credit facility by the relevant percentage in proposed new section DH 8(2). Example 42: Private expenditure On 26 March 2021, Ariana owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility used to fund her residential rental property. Her initial loan balance is $500,000. Although the balance of the revolving credit facility, and the affected loan balance, fluctuates as she receives rent and pays expenses, by 30 September 2021 the affected loan balance is $460,000. The affected loan balance remains below $500, 000 until Ariana withdraws $70,000 on 1 April 2023 to buy a car for personal use. This increases the balance of the revolving credit facility from $460,000 to $530,000. However, the affected loan balance remains at $460,000 as the revolving credit facility balance is adjusted down by the private expenditure of $70,000. The amount of transitional residential interest is calculated based on the lower of: • the initial loan balance = $500,000; and • the affected loan balance = $530,000 – $70,000 = $460,000 Ariana would calculate her deductible interest by multiplying the affected loan balance of $460,000 by the interest rate and the relevant percentage in proposed section DH 6(2). The portion of the revolving credit facility used to buy the car ($70,000) is fully non-deductible. Example 43: Significant repayment On 26 March 2021, Kristina owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility used to fund her residential rental property. Her initial loan balance is $500,000. The balance of the revolving credit facility, and the affected loan balance, fluctuates as she receives rent and pays expenses, and by 30 September 2021 the affected loan balance is $520,000. For the period the affected loan balance is above the initial loan balance, Kristina is only entitled to deductions for the interest on the initial loan balance of $500,000 multiplied by the relevant percentage in proposed new section DH 8(2). For the period the affected loan balance is below the initial 66 loan balance, Kristina would calculate her interest deductions based on the affected loan balance rather than the initial loan balance. On 17 April 2023, she receives an inheritance of $200,000 and uses it to reduce the balance of the revolving credit facility, and thus the affected loan balance, from $550,000 to $350,000. As this is below the initial loan balance, Kristina can deduct all the interest after applying the 50% reduction for the 2023–24 year. On 3 August 2024, Kristina withdraws $100,000 from the revolving credit facility to renovate her rental property. The balance of the revolving credit facility increases from $370,000 to $470,000. This work does not qualify for the new build exemption. As this is not private expenditure, nor fully deductible, no adjustments are needed to Kristina’s affected loan balance. As the balance of the revolving credit facility, and thus the affected loan balance, is below the initial loan balance, Kristina is entitled to deduct all the interest after applying the 75% reduction for the 2024–25 year. If not for the high water mark approach, Kristina could have achieved a similar outcome by retaining $100,000 of the inheritance in a separate account and using this to pay for the renovations. This would, however, have resulted in her incurring higher net interest expenditure between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2024 due to the interest rate charged on the revolving credit facility being higher than the interest rate paid on a savings account. Example 44: Detailed calculation Mikkel has a revolving credit facility that he used to fund his DRP. On 26 March 2021, the facility has a balance of $500,000. The following transactions occur: • Interest is charged at 4% x 1/12 on the closing monthly balance. • Rent of $2,400 is deposited on the 1st day of each month. • $5,000 is withdrawn on 15 May 2021 and spent on private expenditure. • $20,000 is withdrawn on 10 August 2021 and spent on Mikkel’s separate taxable business. • On 20 November 2021, $6,500 is spent on repairs to the DRP. Mikkel’s initial loan balance is $500,000 and he calculates the loan balance that has deductions limited under section DH 8(2) as follows: Date Transaction Amount Loan Balance Affected Loan Balance Loan Balance under s DH 10(6) Comment 26-Mar-21 End of day balance -500,000 -500,000 31-Mar-21 Interest -1,667 -501,667 -501,667 1-Apr-21 Rent 2,400 -499,267 -499,267 30-Apr-21 Interest -1,664 -500,931 -500,931 1-May-21 Rent 2,400 -498,531 -498,531 15-May-21 Private expenditure -5,000 -503,531 -498,531 Private expenditure not deductible and affected loan balance does not increase 31-May-21 Interest 28 -1,678 -505,209 -500,209 1-Jun-21 Rent 2,400 -502,809 -497,809 30-Jun-21 Interest -1,676 -504,485 -499,485 1-Jul-21 Rent 2,400 -502,085 -497,085 31-Jul-21 Interest -1,674 -503,759 -498,759 1-Aug-21 Rent 2,400 -501,359 -496,359 28 $5,000 x 0.04 ÷ 12 x 16/31 = $6.45 of interest relates to private expenditure so would also be added back to the affected loan balance. For simplicity, this example assumes no adjustments to the affected loan balance for private and business interest charges. 67 10-Aug-21 Business expenditure -20,000 -521,359 -496,359 Business expenditure fully deductible and affected loan balance does not increase 31-Aug-21 Interest -1,738 -523,097 -498,097 1-Sep-21 Rent 2,400 -520,697 -495,697 30-Sep-21 Interest -1,736 -522,432 -497,432 1-Oct-21 Rent 2,400 -520,032 -495,032 -495,032 31-Oct-21 Interest -1,733 -521,766 -496,766 -496,766 1-Nov-21 Rent 2,400 -519,366 -494,366 -494,366 20-Nov-21 House repairs -6,500 -525,866 -500,866 -500,000 Expenditure on DRP.

This is an identical calculation to that required under the current legislation to determine the amount of deductible interest allocated to the rental property. Until 30 September 2021, the interest limitation proposals do not apply, so the balance that generates interest deductible against the rental property is the affected loan balance. Between 1 October 2021 and 19 November 2021, the affected loan balance is lower than the initial loan balance so interest on the affected loan balance is deductible subject to the 25% denial in section DH 8(2). On 20 November 2021, the house repairs take the affected loan balance above the initial loan balance. Therefore, between 20 November 2021 and 31 December 2021, interest on the $500,000 initial loan balance is deductible subject to the 25% denial. Interest on the difference between the affected loan balance and the initial loan balance, which varies between $219 and $2,619 during this period, is non-deductible under section DH 8(1). On 1 January 2022, the rent payment reduces the affected loan balance below the initial loan balance. Between 1 January 2022 and 30 January 2022, interest on the affected loan balance is deductible subject to the 25% denial. On 31 January 2022, the interest charged increases the affected loan balance above the initial loan balance. For that day, interest on the initial loan balance is deductible subject to the 25% denial. Interest on the difference between the affected loan balance of $1,318 is non-deductible. On 1 February 2022, the rent payment reduces the affected loan balance below the initial loan balance. Interest on the affected loan balance is deductible subject to the 25% denial. This will remain the case until 31 March 2023, provided the affected loan balance remains below $500,000. 68 REFINANCING \* A proposed amendment with this effect is not yet included in the Supplementary Order Paper. This section of the commentary is provided to summarise the policy intention. Summary of proposed amendment A taxpayer with a loan that is a grandparented transitional loan (or would have been a grandparented transitional loan if it was in New Zealand dollars) can take out a second loan to repay the first loan. It is intended that the second loan, provided it is in New Zealand dollars, should follow the treatment of the first loan. It should be for the disallowed residential property (DRP) and the interest should be transitional residential interest. Application date A proposed amendment is intended to apply to refinancing on or after 27 March 2021. Key features A taxpayer with a grandparented transitional loan would have their interest deductions progressively denied by proposed new section DH 8(2). A taxpayer can refinance that grandparented transitional loan by taking out a New Zealand dollar loan and using the proceeds to repay the first loan. In these circumstances the purpose of the first loan and the deductibility of interest on that loan should be maintained for the second loan. A taxpayer that has a foreign currency loan for DRP would not have a grandparented transitional loan as it would not meet that definition in proposed new section DH 5(5). Consequently, interest on such a loan would be non-deductible after 1 October 2021. If the taxpayer refinances that loan with a New Zealand dollar loan, the new loan should meet the definition of grandparented transitional loan. Interest on the New Zealand dollar loan should be eligible for limited deductions under proposed new section DH 8(2) from the date interest is incurred on the New Zealand dollar loan. 69 ROLLOVER RELIEF – TRANSFER OF DISALLOWED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY Clauses 80B, 80C and 80D Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would provide rollover relief for certain transfers or disposals of disallowed residential property (DRP) to ensure that transitional residential interest on a grandparented transitional loan remains deductible throughout the full transition period between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025. Relief would be provided for some transfers to family trusts, and to or from look-through companies and partnerships. Specific relief is proposed for transfers to trusts constituted under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers to land trusts as part of settling claims under te Tiriti o Waitangi – Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti). Relief would also be provided for relationship property settlements and transfers on death. Application date The proposed amendments should apply to transfers of DRP occurring on or after 27 March 2021. Key features Consistent with existing relief available under the bright-line test, rollover relief is proposed to apply for interest limitation purposes when DRP is transferred: • under a settlement of relationship property, or • following the death of the owner of the property, to an executor or administrator of the estate or to a beneficiary of the estate. Family trusts Rollover relief is also proposed to apply for transfers of DRP to family trusts, provided that: • each transferor of the DRP is also a beneficiary of the trust • at least one of the transferors of the DRP is also a principal settlor of the trust, and • each beneficiary – except for the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors – has a family connection with a principal settlor, is a company controlled by a family member beneficiary or is a charity. Different conditions would apply for transfers to a Māori authority (or a person eligible to be a Māori authority) as the trustee of a trust. Rollover relief would apply if: • the DRP is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, and • the transferors and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either: 70 – members of the same iwi or hapū, or – the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead). Transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships Rollover relief is also proposed to apply to transfers to or from LTCs and partnerships where the persons transferring the DRP to the LTC or partnership (or acquiring it from the LTC or partnership) have ownership interests in the LTC or partnership interests in the partnership in proportion to: • their individual interests in the property, and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the property. Background From 1 October 2021, it is proposed that new interest limitation rules would deny interest deductions for loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 for DRP. Loans drawn down before 27 March 2021 would be grandparented transitional loans and interest deductions would be progressively denied over the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025 as transitional residential interest. In limited circumstances, loans drawn down on or after 27 March 2021 would also qualify as grandparented transitional loans. 29 In general, simple refinancing should not result in a loan losing its grandparented transitional loan status. However, this may not be the case for a person with a grandparented transitional loan who restructures the legal ownership of the property and the accompanying loan on or after 27 March 2021. In the absence of rollover relief, the person may no longer be considered to have a grandparented transitional loan and would not be entitled to deduct any interest expense incurred for the property from 1 October 2021 or for the remainder of the period to 31 March 2025. This would be the case even if the economic ownership of the property remains the same. Rollover relief may therefore be justified on equity grounds in common ownership change scenarios where economic ownership has not materially changed. The policy intent is that, if the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, the recipient should effectively step into the shoes of the transferor (the original owner with the grandparented transitional loan). This would ensure the recipient can deduct a reducing portion of their interest expense between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 for the DRP. The recipient would still need to satisfy the other requirements in the Income Tax Act 2007 to be able to deduct the interest expense (for example, satisfying the general permission and not being subject to a general limitation). The recipient’s maximum grandparented transitional loan should not exceed the transferor’s loan balance before or at the time of the disposal – that is, if they borrow more than the transferor, the excess part of the loan would not be grandparented. 29 For more on grandparented transitional loans and transitional residential interest, see the “Transitional residential interest” section of this Commentary. 71 Detailed analysis The proposed amendments would replicate existing categories of relief available under the bright-line test for the proposed new interest limitation rules. Rollover relief would also be provided for some transfers to family trusts and to or from look-through companies and partnerships. Specific relief is proposed for land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. Relationship property settlements Proposed amendments to section FB 3A provide that the section would apply when DRP is transferred on a settlement of relationship property on or after 27 March 2021. “Settlement of relationship property” is defined by existing section FB 1B(a) as a transaction under a relationship property agreement that creates a disposal and acquisition of property between two persons who are both either a party to the agreement or associated with a party to the agreement. The intention is that a loan drawn down by, or transferred to, the recipient of DRP under a relationship property agreement between 27 March 2021 and 31 March 2025 would be treated as meeting the requirements of proposed new section DH 5(5), that is, it would be a grandparented transitional loan. This would be the case if the loan held by the transferor before the relationship property settlement was also a grandparented transitional loan. The recipient of the property would be able to deduct a reducing portion of their interest expense during the remaining transition period to 31 March 2025, provided the general requirements for deducting expenses are met (for example, a nexus with income exists). This transitional residential interest incurred on the recipient’s loan would only be deductible to the extent that the recipient’s loan balance does not exceed the transferor’s grandparented transitional loan balance before or at the time of the transfer. Example 45: Relationship property settlement Dale and Dawn, a married couple, decide to separate in April 2022. As part of the relationship property settlement, they agree that Dale will keep the family home and Dawn will keep the investment property they acquired back in 2003, shortly after they got married. Dawn decides to retain the property as an investment rather than move into it herself. There is an existing mortgage over the property that has an outstanding loan balance of $20,000. Dawn has agreed to take this over. Since the loan was drawn down before 27 March 2021, the loan would be a grandparented transitional loan and the interest on the loan would be transitional residential interest. Dale and Dawn are entitled to deduct 75% of the amount of mortgage interest they each incurred for the property over the period from 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Rollover relief would apply to the transfer of Dale’s share of the property to Dawn in April 2022, so the $20,000 loan would continue to be a grandparented transitional loan and Dawn would be entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest over the remaining period to 31 March 2025. Inherited property When a person dies, all their property (their estate) is transferred to the executor appointed under the deceased’s will or, if there is no will, the administrator of the estate appointed by the court. The executor or administrator is then responsible for dealing with any taxes and debts due out of the estate and distributing any remaining property to the beneficiaries of the estate. 72 Generally, all of the deceased’s debt will be repaid by their estate when they die, provided there are sufficient assets to cover the debt. Even if the debt is not repaid in full, any remaining debts are not required to be repaid by the beneficiaries of the estate. However, there may be some situations where a property with a registered mortgage is transferred to a beneficiary of the estate, provided the beneficiary is willing to voluntarily make the mortgage repayments so that they may keep the property. Proposed amendments to section FC 9 provide that the section would apply when DRP is transferred (following the death of the owner of the property) to an executor or administrator, or to a beneficiary of the deceased’s estate, on or after 27 March 2021. The intention is that interest on a loan transferred to, or serviced by, the recipient of the property would continue to be transitional residential interest on a grandparented transitional loan if the deceased had a loan for the same property that qualified as a grandparented transitional loan under proposed new section DH 5(5). This would mean that the recipient of the property may be able to deduct interest in accordance with the transitional residential interest rules in subpart DH for the remainder of the transition period to 31 March 2025. This is only to the extent that the loan balance does not exceed the grandparented transitional loan balance immediately before the transfer of the property. This is intended to ensure that: • If the property was held by the deceased as a rental property, the executor or administrator (when filing the estate’s income tax return) would be entitled to deduct at least some of the interest incurred by the estate between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 (if any) on any loans for the property that were still outstanding at the time of death of the owner. • A beneficiary of the estate inheriting the DRP would also benefit from the transition period and would be able to deduct some of the interest on the grandparented transitional loan to 31 March 2025. This assumes the beneficiary would be repaying or taking over any loans for the property not fully repaid by the deceased’s estate. Example 46: Inherited property Pat purchased a house as a private residence for himself in 2010 and borrowed $200,000 at that time to finance the purchase. In his will, Pat has provided that all his property should be inherited by his son Robin when he dies. At the time of Pat’s death in July 2021, $40,000 is still owing on the loan. This loan is a grandparented transitional loan. Robin would like to keep Pat’s house and use it as a rental property to supplement his income, so he agrees with the executors of Pat’s estate that he will obtain a loan from another bank to repay the loan outstanding to Pat’s bank. Robin borrows $90,000 – of which $40,000 is used to repay Pat’s bank and the remaining $50,000 is used to fund renovations before Robin finds tenants. Rollover relief would apply to the transfer of the property to Robin, meaning that Robin would be deemed to have a grandparented transitiona l loan. However, the grandparenting rules would only apply to the $40,000 required to repay Pat’s bank. Robin would be entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest for the $40,000 over the transition period (1 October 2021 to 31 March 2025) as transitional residential interest. Transfers to family trusts Proposed new section FC 9B would provide rollover relief for transfers of DRP to trustees in certain situations. The section would apply when DRP is transferred to the trustees of a trust (the test trust) as a settlement on the trust or a sale to those trustees. Proposed new 73 section FC 9B(2) would provide rollover relief for such a transfer if all the following conditions are satisfied: • Each transferor of the DRP is also a beneficiary of the trust (paragraph (a)). • At least one of the transferors of the property is also a principal settlor of the trust, as defined in section CB 16A(7) (paragraph (b)). • Each beneficiary who is not a principal settlor is– – within four degrees of blood relationship with, or married to, or in a civil union or de facto relationship with, a beneficiary who is a principal settlor (referred to here as a “family member beneficiary”) (subparagraph (c)(i)) – a company where a 50% voting interest (or 50% market value interest, if a market value circumstance exists) is owned by a family member beneficiary (subparagraph (c)(ii)) – a trustee of another trust that has a beneficiary who is also a family member beneficiary of the test trust (subparagraph (c)(iii)), or – a charity (subparagraph (c)(iv)). To qualify as a family member beneficiary, the conditions in proposed new sections FC 9B(3) and (4) would need to be met. Proposed new section FC 9B(3) provides that beneficiaries would have to be within four degrees of blood relationship with a beneficiary who is a principal settlor. The proposed rules are intended to mirror the existing associated person rules in sections YB 4(1), (3) and (4), but with an expansion from two degrees to four degrees of association. This is to account for the fact that many family trusts include a wider range of family members than simply those only two degrees removed. Proposed new section FC 9B(3)(b) provides that the association test would include people who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship, while proposed new section FC 9B(3)(c) would extend coverage to include stepchildren and in-laws. Adoption is covered in proposed new section FC 9B(4)(a) to ensure that adopted children would be counted as natural children of their adoptive parents. Proposed new section FC 9B(4)(b) mirrors existing section YB 4(4) and provides that the association test would not be met if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know both that the other person exists and they are within four degrees of blood relationship. This is designed to deal with a small minority of situations, such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other’s existence. Some common examples of familial relations and the degrees of blood relationship for a principal settlor are as follows (please note this list is non-exhaustive): • One degree of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s parents and children, or spouse. • Two degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s grandchildren, grandparents, siblings, stepparents, stepchildren, and parents-in-law. • Three degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, great-grandchildren, and great-grandparents. 74 • Four degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s cousins, great-nieces, great- nephews, and great-great-grandchildren. Further information on how degrees of association are determined in family situations can be found in IR620. 30 Example 47: Sale to family trust 1 Neo acquired a rental property and drew down a loan of $500,000 for the property on 3 March 2017. The rental property is DRP. On 29 October 2022, Neo sells the DRP to his family trust. He and his son, Archie, are beneficiaries of the trust. Neo’s outstanding balance of his loan, which is a grandparented transitional loan, is $400,000. The trustee takes out a loan of $450,000 to purchase the property from Neo. Neo uses $400,000 of the sale proceeds to repay the outstanding balance of his loan. The transfer of the DRP to the trust would qualify for rollover relief and therefore enable the trustee to deduct limited interest deductions until 31 March 2025. However, only interest on $400,000 of the trustee’s loan would be deductible as transitional residential interest. Interest on the additional $50,000 borrowed would not qualify for rollover relief and would not be deductible. This is because the $50,000 exceeds the balance of Neo’s grandparented transitional loan at the time of transfer. Example 48: Sale to family trust 2 Maude acquired an investment property in 2017 using a combination of savings and a loan from the bank. In April 2021, Maude sold the property to her family trust, the beneficiaries of which are her and her adult children, Fran and Josiah. At the time of sale, the outstanding balance on Maude’s grandparented transitional loan is $150,000. To finance the purchase of the property, the trustees of the trust borrow $150,000 from the bank. Rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property. This means the trustees have a grandparented transitional loan with a balance of $150,000 and interest incurred on the loan is transitional residential interest. Māori family trust proposal Proposed new section FC 9C would provide rollover relief for transfers of DRP that is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 to trustees in certain situations. The policy intent is to recognise that land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 has alienation restrictions that lead to interests in land being passed from generation to generation. These interests are often fragmented and can result in a large number of owners all belonging to the same iwi or hapū or who are all descendants of the same tipuna. Proposed new section FC 9C provides that rollover relief would be available for a transfer of DRP to a Māori authority, or person eligible to be a Māori authority, as the trustee of a trust if: • the DRP is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (subsection (1)) • each transferor is a beneficiary of the trust (subsection (2)), and • the transferors of the DRP and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either: – members of the same iwi or hapū, or – the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead) (subsection (2)). 30 IR620 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes, available at www.ird.govt.nz 75 Example 49: Sale of property subject to TTWM Act to a trust eligible to be a Māori authority Rewi and several of his family members hold interests in a parcel of land that is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993. All the family members are descendants of Rewi’s late great-great-grandfather. Several townhouses are on the land, and these are all rented out to tenants. In 2023, Rewi and his relatives decide to sell their interests in the land to a family trust that was settled by Rewi for the benefit of all surviving descendants of Rewi’s great-great-grandfather. The trust is eligible to be a Māori authority, but it has not elected to be one. Rewi and his relatives took out a loan in 2019 to finance improvements to some of the townhouses on the land. This loan is a grandparented transitional loan. At the time of the sale to the trustees in 2023, $120,000 was still outstanding on the loan. The trustees take out a loan for $500,000 to fund part of the purchase price of $1m. Rollover relief would apply to the transfer of the property under proposed new section FC 9C. This means the trustees would be deemed to have a grandparented transitional loan, but the amount of that loan would be limited to the transferors’ loan balance of $120,000 that was outstanding at the time of the sale. The interest incurred on the $120,000 would be transitional residential interest and partially deductible until 31 March 2025. Interest on the remaining $380,000 balance of the trustees’ loan would not be deductible. Transfers to and from look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships Shareholders in LTCs are treated as directly holding the LTCs’ assets, deriving income and incurring expenses in accordance with their shareholding percentage. In effect, LTCs are transparent for tax purposes, which means that the income tax consequences for someone who holds DRP directly are generally the same as for someone who instead holds DRP through an LTC. The intent is that, under proposed new section FC 9E(4)(b), rollover relief should apply to a transfer to or from an LTC when the persons transferring DRP to the LTC – or acquiring it from the LTC – are all shareholders in the LTC in proportion to: • their individual interests in the DRP, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate (subparagraph (i)), and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the DRP (again, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate) (subparagraph (ii)). Like LTCs, partnerships are also transparent for tax purposes. As for transfers to or from LTCs, the intent is that under proposed new section FC 9E(4)(c), rollover relief should apply to a transfer to or from a partnership when the group of persons transferring DRP to the partnership – or acquiring it from the partnership – are all partners in the partnership and their respective partnership interests are in proportion to: • their individual interests in the DRP, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate (subparagraph (i)), and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the DRP (again, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate) (subparagraph (ii)). Example 50: Transfer to look-through company Mary and Bob, a married couple, are the shareholders in a look-through company, Company A. Mary and Bob jointly own an investment property in equal shares. They each have the same cost base in the property and hold 50 percent of the shares in Company A. Mary and Bob had drawn down a loan in 2018 to purchase the property. In September 2021, the loan has an outstanding balance of $100,000 and is a grandparented transitional loan. 76 In September 2021, Mary and Bob sell the property to Company A. Company A borrows $150,000 from the bank for the purchase of the property and uses its equity to fund the remainder of the purchase price. Partial rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property, meaning that Company A has a grandparented transitional loan balance of $100,000 (being the amount of Mary and Bob’s grandparented transitional loan balance on the date of the transfer). Company A’s excess loan balance of $50,000 does not qualify for rollover relief. 77 MIXED USE ASSETS Clauses 64B and 64D Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would integrate the proposed new interest limitation rules in subpart DH with the existing rules for apportioning expenditure in relation to mixed use assets in subpart DG. Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 27 March 2021. Key features The proposed amendments would ensure the proposed new interest limitation rules in subpart DH integrate with the existing mixed use asset rules in subpart DG. Proposed new section DG 2(3B) would ensure that when interest subject to apportionment under sections DG 8 and DG 9 is for disallowed residential property (DRP), or an interest in an interposed residential property holder (IRP holder), the deductibility of that interest would be subject to denial under the interest limitation rules in subpart DH. This treatment would not apply to interest expenditure subject to apportionment under sections DG 11 to DG 14, as this debt is not allocable to the property under a tracing approach. Proposed new section DG 11(2B) would ensure DRP, debt on that DRP and interest on that debt is excluded from the apportionment calculation for close companies under section DG 11. Background Subpart DG has two main features. First, it specifies how expenses relating to mixed use assets should be apportioned between deductible and non-deductible purposes. Second, for mixed use assets held in close companies, it also determines when interest expense should be treated as relating to a mixed use asset (including some cases where the interest expense is incurred by a person who does not own the asset). In relation to this second feature, it does not trace debt to assets, as is required for most purposes of the Income Tax Act, including the proposed new interest limitation rules. Instead, it allocates debt first to mixed use assets, and if there is not enough debt owed by the close company, it attributes debt owed by related persons to the mixed use asset. In relation to the first feature, the proposed amendments ensure that interest expense identified under a tracing approach as relating to a mixed use asset that is a DRP is denied a deduction under subpart DH if appropriate. In relation to the second feature, the proposed amendments are intended to ensure that the same amount of debt is not allocated to different assets under different sets of rules. 78 Detailed analysis When interest expenditure is subject to apportionment under sections DG 8 and DG 9 and it relates to DRP or an interest in an IRP holder, proposed new section DG 2(3B) would ensure the deductibility of that expenditure is subject to the application of the proposed new interest limitation rules in subpart DH (and not conclusively resolved by section DG 8(1)). A deduction would not be allowed for that portion of the interest expenditure identified as deductible by section DG 8(1) that would be denied under proposed new section DH 8. This treatment would not apply to interest expenditure subject to apportionment under sections DG 11 to DG 14. Such interest expenditure does not relate to the asset under the tracing approach that applies for subpart DH. Instead, it is allocated to the asset under the “stacking” approach set out in sections DG 11 to DG 13. This means that the interest is not subject to denial under subpart DH. Proposed amendments to section DG 11(1)(b) would clarify that the section only applies if the asset-owning close company has interest expenditure that is not traced to DRP or an interest in an IRP holder. This is because that interest expenditure would have already been allocated to those assets and could not be allocated again by section DG 11. Proposed new section DG 11(2B) would apply where a close company has some interest expenditure that is traced to DRP or an interest in an IRP holder, and some interest that is not. The proposed provision would ensure that section DG 11 would not apply to: • interest subject to subpart DH • debt giving rise to that interest, and • assets to the extent they are funded by the debt giving rise to that interest. Example 51: Mixed use assets RB Ltd is a close company. For the year ended 31 March 2023, RB Ltd owns a holiday home that is both a mixed use asset and DRP and a boat that is also a mixed use asset. The holiday home has a rateable value of $180,000 and the boat has a depreciated value of $60,000. The company has debt of $150,000, $50,000 of which was used to acquire the holiday home and meet expenses related to it, and $100,000 of which was used to acquire the boat and meet miscellaneous expenses related to it. The holiday home debt bears interest at 5% and the remaining debt bears interest at 5.5%, giving RB Ltd a total interest expense of $8,000 for the year. The formulas in sections DG 8 and DG 11 produce an income-earning use percentage of 45% for the holiday house and 70% for the boat. Section DG 8 will apply to determine the apportionment between private and income-earning purposes of the $2,500 of interest for the holiday home. The 45% (or $1,125) that is allocated to income-earning purposes, and is therefore deductible under section DG 8(1), would nevertheless be non-deductible under section DH 8(1)(a). If the loan is a grandparented transitional loan, the deduction may be progressively denied under section DH 8(2) until 31 March 2025. The non-deductible portion remaining (after any partial allowance under section DH 8(2)) may be allowed if the sale of the property is taxable. Because RB Ltd is a close company and has debt that is not traced to DRP or an IRP holder (that is, the $100,000), it must apply section DG 11. In applying section DG 11, RB Ltd disregards the $50,000 of traced debt and associated $2,500 of interest. RB Ltd can apply section DG 11 first to either the holiday home or the boat. Generally, it would apply the section first to the asset with the higher percentage of income-earning use. In this case, that is the boat. Applying section DG 11 to the boat first, RB Ltd determines that its debt value of $100,000 exceeds its asset value of $60,000. Section DG 11(2) therefore requires RB Ltd to apply sections DG 11(4) to (6). Section DG 11(4) calculates a reduced amount of $5,500 x $60,000/$100,000, or $3,300. RB Ltd is therefore allowed a deduction of 70% of that amount under section DG 11(6), or $2,310. 79 Because RB Ltd has a remaining mixed use asset (that is, the holiday home), RB Ltd must undertake the same calculations for the holiday home and the remaining unallocated debt amount of $40,000. In this case, the asset value must be determined by reducing the value of the holiday home by the debt related to it under a tracing approach. The asset value is therefore $130,000. This is more than the remaining debt value of $40,000, and so section DG 11(3) applies. RB Ltd is allowed a deduction of $2,200 (being $5,500 –$3,300) x 45% or $990. The end result is that, of RB Ltd’s total interest expenditure of $8,000 incurred in the year ended 31 March 2023: • $1,375 of interest is apportioned under section DG 8 to private use of the holiday home and is non- deductible. • $1,125 of interest is apportioned under section DG 8 to income-earning use of the holiday home – under proposed new subpart DH, 25% of this amount is non-deductible and 75% is deductible. • $3,300 is allocated to the boat under section DG 11 and 70% or $2,310 of this is deductible. • $2,200 is allocated to the holiday home under section DG 11 and 45% or $990 of this is fully deductible. Proposed new subpart DH does not apply to this interest because it is allocated to the holiday home under the stacking approach in section DG 11, not the tracing approach. 80 LOANS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY Clauses 55B and 64E (proposed section DH 9) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would treat income arising from a foreign currency loan used for disallowed residential property (DRP) as exempt income. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to income derived on or after 1 October 2021. Key features Although property outside New Zealand would not be covered by the interest limitation proposals, DRP in New Zealand could still be financed by a loan denominated in a foreign currency. Unlike a New Zealand dollar loan, a loan in foreign currency can result in assessable income, under the financial arrangements rules, if the person has a foreign exchange gain for the year. Proposed new section CW 62C would treat income arising from a foreign currency loan used for DRP as exempt income. The treatment of these foreign currency loans would therefore be consistent with New Zealand dollar loans, except they would not be eligible for the phasing out of interest deductions under proposed new section DH 8(2) and any income derived would be exempt income under proposed new section CW 62C. Note that a foreign currency loan would not be a grandparented transitional loan so would not generate transitional residential interest. 31 31 For more on this, see the “Transitional residential interest” section of this Commentary. 81 DISPOSAL OF DISALLOWED RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY SUBJECT TO INTEREST LIMITATION Clause 64E (proposed section DH 11) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would allow interest that has been denied a deduction under the interest limitation provisions to be deductible in the year of disposal of the disallowed residential property (DRP) if the disposal is taxable. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to disposals of disallowed residential property on or after 1 October 2021. Key features The proposed new section DH 11 would allow interest that has been denied a deduction under the interest limitation provisions to be deductible, subject to certain restrictions, in the year of disposal of the DRP if the disposal is taxable. This reflects that it may not be known until the year of disposal whether the disposal will be taxable and also that any taxable gain is not taxable until then. If the amount derived on disposal of the DRP is income under the bright-line test, the amount of the previously denied interest would be treated as if it were part of the cost of the property. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss would be limited under the current rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. Under that rule, the loss would only be able to be deducted against other taxable gains on real property. Any excess loss would be carried forward and could be deducted against other land sale gains in later income years. If the amount derived on disposal of the DRP is income under a provision other than the bright-line test, the amount of the previously denied interest would be allowed as a deduction in the year of disposal. Where the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules apply (which would usually be the case if the property is subject to interest limitation), the interest, together with other expenditure for the property or portfolio, would be subject to those rules. If the disposal of the DRP is not taxable, the interest previously denied a deduction under proposed new section DH 8 would remain non-deductible. If one of the land business, development or new build exemptions applies, this proposed amendment would not apply. In that situation, the interest would not have been subject to interest limitation and would have been deductible in the year it was incurred. 82 Detailed analysis General criteria Under proposed new section DH 11, interest that was previously denied a deduction under the interest limitation in proposed new section DH 8 would be deductible in the year of disposal of the DRP only if the disposal is on revenue account (that is, any gain is taxable, and any loss is deductible). Even where the disposal is on revenue account, the interest will only be deductible if the interest would have been deductible when incurred if proposed new section DH 8 had not applied. In other words, the interest would have to have met the general permission (section DA 1) and not been denied under the private limitation or another limitation (section DA 2). If the disposal is on capital account (that is, any gain is not taxable, and any loss is not deductible), any interest previously denied deductibility under section DH 8 would remain non-deductible. Example 52: Sale of bach subject to the bright-line test Jack and Aria buy a bach in November 2021 for $700,000. They borrow $400,000 at 4% interest to complete the purchase. Six years later, in October 2027, they sell the bach for $750,000. Only Jack and Aria, and their friends and family, used the bach. They did not rent it out. Jack and Aria paid a total of $96,000 interest. They did not deduct any for tax purposes. The amount derived on the sale of the bach would be income under the bright-line test. None of the $96,000 interest they paid would be deductible in the year of sale because, regardless of section DH 8, the interest would not have been deductible when it was incurred. This is because the bach was used for personal purposes and was not used to derive taxable income. The gain on sale of $50,000 would be income under the bright-line test and none of the interest would be deductible. Interest deductible when it was incurred would not be deductible again in the year of disposal. This would include interest: • incurred before 1 October 2021 • relating to pre-27 March 2021 property and debt that was allowed partial deductions under the grandparenting provisions, and • that was deductible because an exemption from the interest limitation rules applied (the land business, development, or new build exemptions). Interest may be deductible when incurred but contribute to a net rental loss that is suspended as a deduction and carried forward under the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. Such interest would also not become deductible in the year of disposal. Instead, it would remain part of the excess residential deductions carried forward and would only be deducted as allowed under the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. If the disposal of the DPR was taxable, different rules would apply depending on whether the disposal was taxable under the bright-line test (sections CB 6A or CZ 39) or another provision. 83 Disposal taxable under the bright-line test If the amount derived on disposal of the DRP is income under the bright-line test, the amount of the previously denied interest would be treated as if it were part of the cost of the DRP under section DB 23. If this results in a net loss, the deduction for the net loss would be limited under the anti-arbitrage rule that applies to losses from the disposal of bright-line property. The anti-arbitrage provision (section EL 20) provides that a net loss from a bright-line disposal may only be deducted to the extent of net taxable gains the taxpayer has from other land sales in the year of the disposal. Any excess net loss deduction (that is, the amount by which the net loss exceeds the net taxable land sale gains) is carried forward and may be used in future years against other land sale gains of the taxpayer. This rule is necessary because, by choosing to dispose of the property before the end of the bright-line period, a taxpayer can ensure the disposal is on revenue account and therefore deduct a loss that could not be deducted if they waited until after expiration of the bright-line period. Allowing a deduction for the previously denied interest expense in the year of a taxable disposal would raise the same arbitrage issue. Disposing of the DRP before the expiration of the bright-line period would mean the interest was deductible, whereas waiting until after the expiration of that period would mean it was not. To address this, proposed new section DH 11(1) provides that, for bright-line disposals, the previously denied interest is treated as part of the cost of the DRP, rather than being deductible. The cost of the DRP may be deductible in the year of disposal (under section DB 23), but the anti-arbitrage rule in section EL 20 will apply if there is a net loss on sale. Example 53: Sale of rental property subject to the bright-line test Assume the same facts as example 5 2, except that Jack and Aria bought a rental property instead of a bach. The $96,000 interest they paid would have been deductible if section DH 8 had not applied, because the property was used to derive taxable income. Therefore, the interest is potentially deductible in the year of sale. The property was bought for $700,000 and sold for $750,000 six years later. In the year of sale, the $750,000 sale price is income under the bright-line test, and the cost of the property may be deducted under section DB 23. Proposed section DH 11(1) provides that the original cost of $700,000 is deemed to be increased by the disallowed interest of $96,000. However, section EL 20 provides that, in the year of sale, the amount of the deduction is limited to income from the sale ($750,000) plus net gains from other taxable land sales. If this is the only property Jack and Aria sold that year, the deduction would therefore be limited to $750,000 (resulting in no net income to be taxed or loss deducted). This would mean only $50,000 of the disallowed interest would be deductible. The excess amount of $46,000 would be carried forward and applied against any taxable land sale gains Jack and Aria have in later years. Disposal taxable under another land sale provision If a disposal is taxable under a provision other than the bright-line test, the same level of concern with arbitrage does not exist. The character of the disposal (non-taxable or taxable) cannot be determined by choosing the time of the disposal. In this case, the anti-arbitrage rule would not apply, but the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules would (proposed new section DH 11(2)). If a property disposal was taxable under a provision other than the bright-line test, the interest would retain its character as interest (and not be recharacterised as part of the cost of the property). Any gain on sale would be taxable and any loss deductible. The previously denied 84 interest would be deductible, but it would be subject to the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. Application of the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules would mean the previously denied interest and any other expenditure would be netted against the income from the property or portfolio. If these total deductions exceeded the income, the treatment of the excess deductions (that is, the net rental loss from the property or portfolio) would depend on whether the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules were being applied on an individual property or portfolio basis. If the rules were being applied on a portfolio basis (that is, together with other properties), the net portfolio rental loss in the year of a taxable disposal would be deferred and carried into the next income year to be deducted against later residential property income. However, if the taxpayer was applying those rules on an individual property basis, the net rental loss would usually be fully deductible in the year of taxable disposal. 85 INTERPOSED ENTITY RULES Clauses 64E (proposed sections DH 5(6), DH 6, DH 8, DH 12) and 127(10B), (16D) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would introduce interposed entity rules to deny interest deductions for a person who indirectly holds disallowed residential property (DRP) through an interposed residential property holder (IRP holder). Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021 with application to interest incurred on or after 1 October 2021. Key features It is proposed to introduce interposed entity rules to support the integrity of the proposed new interest limitation rules. The rules would deny interest deductions for a person who indirectly holds DRP through an IRP holder. An IRP holder for a person can be a company or a trust that is not a unit trust. 32 The proposed interposed entity rules would not apply to look-through companies (LTCs) or to partnerships that have DRP. The proposed interposed entity rules are based on the residential property percentage. If a close company, other company, or trust has a residential property percentage over the relevant threshold, that entity would be an IRP holder. The residential property percentage is the value of the entity’s DRP (excluding property subject to the new build, land business or development exemptions and, in the case of close companies, certain mixed-use assets) as a percentage of the value of the entity’s total assets. The relevant threshold of the residential property percentage for determining if an entity is an IRP holder for a person differs depending on whether the entity is a close company, other company, or a trust. Where a person has voting interests or market value interests in a company, the company would be an IRP holder for that person if the company has a residential property percentage: • for close companies, of more than 10% at the end of a quarter in the income year, or • for other companies, of more than 50% at any time in the income year. Where the person is a direct or indirect beneficiary of a trust (other than a unit trust), the trustees of that trust would be an IRP holder for that person if the trust has a residential property percentage of more than 10% at any time in the income year. If a close company is an IRP holder for a person, the interest incurred by the person as the owner, or to become the owner, of the IRP holder would be limited in proportion to the close company’s residential property percentage. If a company, other than a close company, is an IRP holder for a person, all interest incurred by the person for legal or beneficial ownership of the company would be denied. 32 Unit trusts are treated as companies for tax purposes. 86 If a trust (other than a unit trust) is an IRP holder for a person, all interest incurred by the person for legal or beneficial ownership of the trust would be denied. Background Interposed entity rules are required to support the integrity of the proposed new interest limitation rules. Without such rules, people could borrow for DRP indirectly through an IRP holder and obtain deductions for interest incurred on money borrowed to acquire shares in, or to become a beneficiary of, the IRP holder. The use of interposed entity rules as an integrity measure is an existing feature of the Income Tax Act 2007. For example, subpart EL contains interposed entity rules to support the integrity of the residential rental loss ring-fencing rules. Detailed analysis Deduction denied Proposed new section DH 8(1)(c) provides that a person is denied a deduction for interest if and to the extent to which the interest is incurred in relation to the legal or beneficial ownership of an IRP holder. The proposed section would apply not only to interest incurred to become an owner but also to interest incurred in relation to the legal or beneficial ownership of an IRP holder. This ensures that if a person borrows money to acquire an ownership interest and later refinances the initial borrowing, the interest limitation rule would apply to the later borrowing. Interposed residential property holder “Interposed residential property holder” is defined in proposed new section DH 5(6). An IRP holder for a person may be one of three types of DRP holders: • A close company 33 for which the person has voting interests or market value interests and the company has, at the end of each quarter in the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 10%. • A company that is not a close company for which the person has voting interests or market value interests and the company has, at any time during the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 50%. • Trustees of a trust of which the person is a direct or indirect beneficiary, and the relevant trust has, at any time during the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 10%. 33 A close company is a company that has five or fewer natural persons or trustees whose combined voting interests, or market value interests, in the company is more than 50% (treating all associated natural persons as one person). 87 Residential property percentage “Residential property percentage” is defined in proposed new section DH 6(1). It is the amount, for an IRP holder, calculated using the following formula and expressed as a percentage: disallowed assets ÷ total assets “Disallowed assets” and “total assets” are defined in proposed new sections DH 6(2)(a) and (b): • “Disallowed assets” means the value of the IRP holder’s DRP but excluding property subject to the new build, land business and development exemptions 34 or, for a close company, property subject to the mixed use asset rules in subpart DG. • “Total assets” means the total value of the IRP holder’s property excluding, for a close company, property subject to subpart DG. Proposed new section DH 6(3) contains a special rule to deal with the situation where a company holds interests in subsidiary companies that hold DRP. The company’s “disallowed assets” and “total assets” would be calculated by applying the look-through rule in s YC 4. The company would be treated as the ultimate shareholder, and the assets held by the subsidiary companies would be attributed to that company in proportion to its ownership interests in the subsidiary companies. For example, a person holds shares in Holdco Ltd and Holdco holds 50% of the shares in Subco Ltd. If Subco Ltd owns DRP and other assets, 50% of SubCo’s DRP and other assets would be attributed to Holdco Ltd when calculating Holdco’s residential property percentage. Valuation of property for residential property percentage formula Proposed new section DH 12 contains rules for valuing property for subpart DH. These rules would apply to determine the value of land and other property for the residential property percentage formula. Interposed close companies Interposed close companies present the greatest integrity concerns. This is because control can be concentrated in a single natural person, or a small group of natural persons, and a close company can be easily established to own DRP. This concern is reflected in the 10% residential property percentage threshold and quarterly calculation requirement for close companies. 10% threshold Proposed new section DH 5(6)(a) provides that a close company would be an IRP holder for a person if the person has voting interests or market value interests (generally, shares) in the company and the company has, at the end of a quarter in the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 10%. The purpose of the proposed interposed entity rules is to limit interest deductions where borrowed money has indirectly funded DRP. In principle, this would justify having no 34 For more on these exemptions, see the “Exemption for new build land”, “Land business exemption” and “Exemption for property development” sections of this Commentary. 88 residential property percentage threshold (that is, the rule would apply if the interposed close company had any DRP). However, as the proposed interposed entity rules would create compliance costs, a de minimis threshold of 10% applies so that shareholders in close companies with only very small amounts of DRP as a proportion of their total assets would not need to apply the rules. Quarterly calculation The greater the frequency of the residential property percentage calculation, the greater the accuracy of the calculation in limiting interest deductions on borrowings that indirectly fund DRP. The requirement to calculate the residential property percentage at the end of each quarter strikes a balance between the greater accuracy of a daily calculation and the potential for significant inaccuracy, and possibly abuse, of an annual calculation. Proposed section DH 8(3) contains the quarterly calculation for determining the amount of interest denied for a person who is an owner of an IRP holder that is a close company. The provision would apply to interest incurred by the person as the owner, or to become an owner, of the IRP holder. The proposed formula multiplies the amount of the interest incurred by the person in a quarter by the residential property percentage of the IRP holder at the end of the quarter. The total of the amounts denied in each quarter is the amount of interest denied for the income year. Example 54: Interposed close company rule Purchase DRP for $600K Buys shares for $1m Loan $1m Bank NewCo Figure 1 Interest Purchase commercial property for $400K Catherine borrows $1m from Bank. She sets up a company, NewCo, and is issued 1000 shares at $1k per share. NewCo buys a DRP for $600k and a commercial property for $400k using the share issuance proceeds. Under proposed new sections DH 6 and DH 8, NewCo’s disallowed assets would be $600k and its total assets $1m. NewCo’s residential property percentage would therefore be 60% at the end of each quarter of the income year. 89 NewCo would be an IRP holder for Catherine under proposed new section DH 5(6)(a). Applying proposed new section DH 8(3), 60% of the interest incurred by Catherine during the income year on the $1m loan used to set up NewCo would be denied. Interposed non-close companies Under proposed new section DH 5(6)(b), a company that is not a close company would be an IRP holder for a person if the person has voting interests or market value interests in the company and the company has, at any time during the income year, a residential property percentage of more than 50%. Under proposed new section DH 8(1)(c), if a person incurs interest in relation to the legal or beneficial ownership of an IRP holder that is a non-close company, all interest incurred by the person would be denied. The denial of all interest incurred by the person is a simplification measure to avoid an apportionment approach like the one that would apply to interposed close companies under proposed new section DH 8(3). Although apportionment is more accurate, it would usually be much more complex for shareholders in non-close companies to apply. The higher residential property percentage threshold of 50% should ensure that full denial would not apply if the company has modest amounts of disallowed assets. In practice, companies that do not hold DRP as a core part of their business are likely to have a residential property percentage well below the 50% threshold. Interposed trusts Proposed new section DH 5(6)(c) provides that the trustees of a trust (that is not a unit trust) would be an IRP holder for a person who is a direct or indirect beneficiary of the trust if the trust, at any time in the income year, has a residential property percentage of more than 10%. 35 For income tax purposes, a unit trust is treated as a company. 36 If a unit trust holds DRP and a person has incurred interest to participate as a beneficiary in the unit trust, the person would need to determine whether the unit trust was an IRP holder under either proposed new section DH 5(6)(a) or (b), rather than section DH 5(6)(c). If a trustee is an IRP holder for a person, all interest incurred by the person to become a beneficiary of the trust would be denied under proposed new section DH 8(1)(c). Applying an apportionment approach, like the one proposed for interposed close companies, to an interposed (non-unit) trust would often be impossible, as a person’s control or ownership of a trust cannot be readily measured. The denial of all interest incurred is therefore a simplification measure. In practice, it would be very uncommon for a person to incur interest as a beneficiary of a (non-unit) trust. 35 As mentioned, existing subpart EL contains interposed entity rules. Those rules also provide for the possibility of an interposed trust that is not a unit trust. 36 The definition of “company” in section YA 1 includes a unit trust. “Unit trust” is defined in section YA 1 and means “a scheme or arrangement that is made for the purpose or has the effect of providing facilities for subscribers, purchasers, or contributors to participate, as beneficiaries under a trust, in income and capital and capital gains arising from the property that is subject to the trust”. 90 Look-through companies and partnerships The proposed interposed entity rules would not apply to persons who borrow to acquire shares in a look-through company (LTC), or a partnership share in a partnership, that has DRP. This is because LTCs and partnerships are transparent for income tax purposes. Under section HB 1, owners of LTCs are treated as holding any property held by the LTC in proportion to the owner’s effective look-through interest 37 in the LTC, and the LTC is treated as not holding the property. If a person incurs interest to acquire shares in an LTC, the person is treated as incurring interest to acquire any DRP held by the LTC in proportion to their effective look-through interest. Similarly, under section HG 2, partners of partnerships are treated as holding any property held by the partnership in proportion to the person’s partnership share 38 in the partnership, and the partnership is treated as not holding the property. If a person incurs interest to acquire a partnership share, the person is treated as incurring interest to acquire any DRP held by the partnership in proportion to their partnership share. LTC elections It is possible for a close company that is an IRP holder to make an election to become an LTC. In this case, if a shareholder in that company incurred interest in relation to their ownership of the company before the effective date of the LTC election, 39 they would have applied the interposed close company rule. For simplicity, the policy intent is that if the shareholder also incurs interest in relation to their ownership of the company after the effective date of the LTC election, they would continue applying the interposed close company rule. Accordingly, notwithstanding its LTC status, the policy intent is that an LTC will be treated as an IRP holder for a person if: • before the effective date of the LTC election, the person was denied a deduction for interest incurred in relation to the ownership of the LTC under proposed new section DH 8(1)(c), and • the interest denied related to borrowings that are still outstanding at the effective date of the LTC election. 37 “Effective look-through interest” is defined in section HB 1(5). In broad terms, it is the number of shares held by a person in an LTC as a percentage of all the shares issued by the LTC. 38 “Partnership share” is defined in section YA 1 and means, for property, the share that a partner has in the partnership. 39 The effective date of an LTC election is determined under section HB 13. 91 SPECIFIC ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULES Clause 85D Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would insert two new specific anti-avoidance rules to support the integrity of the interest limitation rules. Application date The proposed amendment would come into force on 27 March 2021. Key features • Proposed new section GB 53B would address situations where a change in value affects the residential property percentage calculation for an interposed residential property holder. • The residential property percentage determines whether a company or trust is an interposed residential property holder for a person. If it is, interest incurred by that person may be subject to limitation. 40 A change in value that affects the residential property percentage could, for example, be due to the disposal or acquisition of disallowed residential property (DRP) before or after a calculation date. • For proposed new section GB 53B to apply, the change in value would have to have a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH. If the section did apply, the effect of the increase or decrease in value would be ignored in calculating the residential property percentage of the interposed residential property holder. • Proposed new section GB 53C would address arrangements where a person (on- lender) on-lends borrowed money to an associated person at a lower rate of interest than the rate payable by the on-lender. For the proposed new section to apply, the associated person, or a person associated with them, would have to own DRP and the arrangement would have to have a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH. If the section did apply, the amount of interest incurred by the on-lender would be limited to and calculated using the lower rate, with the higher rate being ignored. Detailed analysis Residential property percentage – increases or decreases in value Proposed new section GB 53B is based on the current specific anti-avoidance rule in section GB 51B, which supports the integrity of the thin-capitalisation rules. 40 For more on the residential property percentage and interposed residential property holders, see the “Interposed entity rules” section of this Commentary. 92 Proposed new section GB 53B would address situations where: • there is a change in value that affects, or would affect, the result of the residential property percentage calculation for an interposed residential property holder, and • the change in value has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH. A change in value that defeats the intent and application of subpart DH could occur, for example, if a close company (that would otherwise satisfy the requirements to be an interposed residential property holder) disposes of DRP shortly before a quarterly calculation date so that it falls below the 10% residential property percentage, and therefore the rules do not apply, but then reacquires the same or similar DRP shortly after the calculation date. If a change in value had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH, the change in value would be ignored when calculating the residential property percentage of the interposed residential property holder. On-lending at lower rate Proposed new section GB 53C would address situations where a person (the on-lender) indirectly funds DRP by borrowing money and on-lending the money at a lower rate to an associated person (for example, a close company owned by the on-lender) that either owns DRP or is associated with a person that owns DRP (the DRP holder). Although the interest at the lower rate incurred by the DRP holder might be denied under subpart DH, the higher rate of interest expenditure paid by the on-lender on the borrowings that, in reality, funded the DRP might not be subject to any limitation in the absence of a specific anti-avoidance rule. Without such a rule, taxpayers may be able to enter into on-lending arrangements to lower the amount of interest denied under subpart DH. Proposed new section GB 53C would apply when an arrangement involves a person on- lending funds at a lower rate to an associated person who owns DRP (or whose associate owns DRP) and the arrangement has a purpose or effect, not being a merely incidental purpose or effect, of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH. If that is the case, the amount of interest incurred by the on-lender would be limited to, and calculated using, the lower interest rate, and the higher rate would be ignored. Example 55: On-lending at a lower rate Zeean is the sole shareholder of LandCo. She borrows $800,000 from her bank at a 5% interest rate and on- lends the money to LandCo, at a 1% interest rate. LandCo uses the money to acquire DRP. LandCo’s 1% interest expenditure on the loan from Zeean would be subject to limitation under subpart DH because LandCo used the borrowed funds to acquire DRP. In the absence of an anti-avoidance rule, Zeean’s 5% interest expenditure on her loan from the bank may not be subject to limitation under subpart DH. This is because she used the borrowed funds to derive interest income from LandCo, rather than for DRP or in relation to her ownership of an interposed residential property holder. If the particular facts indicate that the arrangement has a purpose or effect, that is not a merely incidental purpose or effect, of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH, Zeean’s interest deduction would be limited to 1% rather than 5%. 93 Purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH Both of the proposed new specific anti-avoidance rules would require a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of subpart DH. A considerable body of case law exists on when an arrangement has the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the Act, or a part of the Act. 41 It is intended that this case law will inform the meaning and application of proposed new sections GB 53B and GB 53C. 41 For example, see Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v CIR \[2008\] NZSC 116. 94 ADMINISTRATION TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED INTEREST LIMITATION RULES Further guidance Residential rental property owners would have to consider and apply any new interest limitation rules in their 2022 income tax return. To support the administration and integrity of the proposed rules, additional information would be required in their return about interest incurred and interest deductions claimed for residential rental properties, as well as reasons for any exclusion or exemption claimed. Inland Revenue will provide guidance to help taxpayers comply with the new rules should the interest limitation proposals become law. Record keeping No specific amendments to existing record-keeping rules are proposed. Current law would require taxpayers to keep and retain records for at least seven years after the end of the income year in which they claimed a deduction. Records to be kept include information or documents about sales, income and expenses, and assets and liabilities. However, residential rental property owners should be aware that they might need to keep records for longer than seven years in some situations. For example, they might need records older than seven years to support their claim for interest deductions if a residential property is taxed on sale under the 10-year bright-line test and previously denied interest deductions are then allowed. They would then also have to retain those records for a further seven years. 95 Bright-line test changes 96 5-YEAR NEW BUILD BRIGHT-LINE TEST Clauses 48, 49, 64E (proposed section DH 5(7)), and 127(1B) and (1C) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would introduce a 5-year bright-line test for new builds. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021, provided a new build was on the land when it was sold by the acquirer. 42 Key features The proposed amendments would introduce a 5-year bright-line test for new builds. The shorter bright-line period would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 if: • the land – has a new build on it, and was acquired no later than 12 months after the code compliance certificate (CCC) was issued for the new build 43 – was acquired with an agreement in place for the construction of a new build (an off-the-plans purchase), or – has a new build constructed on it by the owner, and • a new build is on the land when it is sold. Apportionment is proposed where both a new build and an old build are on the land to ensure only the portion of the land attributable to the new build is subject to the 5-year bright-line test. Background The bright-line test taxes gains from residential land disposed of within a specified period after acquisition (the bright-line period). The length of the bright-line period depends on when the land was acquired. If land was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021, a 5-year bright-line period applies. For land acquired on or after 27 March 2021, the general bright-line period is now 42 However, it would not apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. 43 An exception exists for hotels or motels converted to residential accommodation that do not require a CCC – see the Detailed analysis discussion below. 97 10 years, which means land will be taxed if disposed of within 10 years of acquisition unless an exclusion 44 or the proposed 5-year new build bright-line test applies to the land. The proposed amendments would introduce a 5-year bright-line period for new builds (new build bright-line test). This is intended to ensure the supply of new houses is not discouraged by the 10-year bright-line test. The land would not need to be used to provide long-term residential accommodation for the new build bright-line test to apply instead of the 10-year bright-line test – for example, the property could be used as a holiday home. It would be difficult for Inland Revenue to determine how a property is used, and in most cases, properties are put to the most efficient use for the owner, either as a main home or rental accommodation. The new build bright-line test would apply to new build land more narrowly than the new build exemption from the interest limitation rules (the new build exemption). 45 The new build exemption applies to all owners within the 20-year exemption period starting from the date the CCC is issued for the new build. The new build bright-line test, however, only applies to taxpayers who acquire the land no later than 12 months after the new build on the land receives its CCC. Detailed analysis Existing settings that would apply for the new build bright-line test The following policy settings that currently apply for the 5-year and 10-year bright-line tests would also apply for the proposed new build bright-line test. Most of these settings are located in section CB 6A, while the main home exclusion is in section CB 16A. Table 3 Setting Explanation The rules that determine when the property is acquired and disposed of, and when the bright-line period is counted from (section CB 6A) The existing rules that determine when property is acquired and disposed of and when the bright-line period is counted from will continue to apply. The bright-line period will not restart when a new build is added to the land. This is even where a commercial building is converted into new builds – the bright-line period starts when the land is first acquired, not when the land first becomes residential land. The definition of “residential land” covered by the bright- line test (section YA 1) This includes land that has a dwelling on it, land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on the land, and bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the relevant operative district plan. “Residential land” does not include farmland or land used predominantly as business premises (unless it is a business of 44 There are exclusions for main homes, inherited property, and land transferred under settlements of relationship property – refer to sections CB 16A, CB 6A(12), FC 9, and FB 3A. 45 For more on the new build exemption, see the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. 98 Setting Explanation providing accommodation in a dwelling that is not the owner’s main home). The main home exclusion (section CB 16A) The main home exclusion will continue to: • apply where a property is used as a main home, or not used as a main home for consecutive periods of 12 months or less (although changes are proposed to ensure the main home is not taxed even when more than half of the land is not used as a main home 46 ) • be available to certain properties held in trust, although people cannot use the main home exclusion for multiple properties held through trusts (a continuation of current settings), and • be unavailable if it has already been used twice in the two years before the date of disposal, or if there is a regular pattern of buying and selling main homes. Other exclusions and forms of relief (sections CB 6A, FB 3A, FC 9) Other current exclusions and forms of relief will continue to apply, including: • transfers on death, and any subsequent disposal by the beneficiary will be exempt, and • a person who receives land under a relationship property agreement will take on the bright-line start date (the date from which the bright- line period is counted) and cost of the transferor. Additional forms of rollover relief are proposed for both the 10-year bright-line test and the 5-year new build bright-line test. 47 Residential land withholding tax (RLWT) (subpart RL; sections 54B–54D of the Tax Administration Act 1994) RLWT will continue to apply to taxable sales by anyone who is an “offshore RLWT person” (defined in section YA 1) – in short, a vendor who is living or established outside New Zealand. Specific anti-avoidance rules (sections GB 52 and GB 53) These will continue to counter companies and trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test. Deduction settings (sections DA 1, DA 2, DB 23 and DB 23C) Vendors will continue to be allowed deductions for property subject to the bright-line test according to ordinary tax rules. Loss ring-fencing (subpart EL) Losses arising from a bright-line sale will continue to be ring-fenced and available only for use against taxable gains from other land sales. 46 For more on this, see the “Amendment to the bright-line test for main homes” section of this Commentary. 47 For more on this, see the “Rollover relief” section of this Commentary. 99 New settings that would only apply to the new build bright-line test Apportionment where land contains a “new build” and an “old build” Proposed new section CB 6A(1) would provide that an amount from disposing of residential land is income to the extent to which, using a land area test, it is for “10-year test land” or “5- year test land”. 10-year test land is residential land to the extent to which it is not new build land and was acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and disposed of within 10 years of acquisition. 5- year test land is residential land to the extent to which it is new build land and: • the person acquires it no later than 12 months after the land first meets the definition of “new build land” • it is disposed of within 5 years of acquisition, and • it is “new build land” when disposed of. In the straightforward case of a new build being acquired and sold within 5 years, the new build bright-line test would apply to tax the entire piece of land. However, in cases where a new build and an old build are on the same legal title, “to the extent” means that: • the portion of the land with a new build on it is subject to the 5-year new build bright- line test, and • the portion of the land with an existing build on it is subject to the 10-year bright-line test. The portion of land that relates to each dwelling includes the land immediately beneath the dwelling, as well as outdoor areas exclusive to the dwelling, and a reasonable proportion of shared areas. 48 Example 56: New build bright-line test Steph purchases a new build in May 2021. She sells the property in June 2027. Since she sold a new build, the 10-year bright-line test would not apply. Steph has owned the property for more than 5 years when she sells it, so she will not have to pay tax on any gain on sale under the bright-line test. Example 57: Apportionment where “new build” and “old build” on same title Amber purchases an existing dwelling (old build) situated on an 800m2 section for $1m in 2022, which she rents out. She builds a second dwelling on the site (on the same title) in 2025 (new build). Building the new build costs $400,000, and after it is constructed, she rents it out. After building the new build, Amber’s property is comprised of the following areas: • the old build, which covers 200m2 • exclusive areas attributable to the old build, which cover 200m2 • the new build, which covers 200m2 • exclusive areas attributable to the new build, which cover 150m2, and 48 See the definition of “new build land” in proposed new section DH 5(5) and the discussion of this definition in the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. 100 • a common area (a shared driveway) of 50m2, which is available for use by occupants of both the existing dwelling and the qualifying new build. After constructing the qualifying new build, Amber has spent a total of $1.4m on the property. She sells the property in 2028 for $3m, so makes a total gain on sale of $1.6m. Amber’s calculation under the bright-line test would be as follows: New build The portion of the land with the new build on it is subject to the 5-year new build bright-line test. This portion of the land is 375m2 (being the land under the dwelling, the exclusive outdoor area and a half share of the common driveway). This is 46.9% of the total 800m2 land area. Amber disposes of the land more than 5 years after acquiring it – the property was purchased in 2022 and sold in 2028. It does not matter that the new build was only built in 2025 – the new build bright-line test would apply provided a new build is on the land when it is sold. Therefore, 46.9% of the gain would not be taxed on sale. Old build The proportion of the land with the old build on it is subject to the 10-year bright-line test as it is disposed of within 10 years of acquisition. The old build makes up 425m2 of the land (being the land under the dwelling, the exclusive outdoor area, and a half share of the common driveway). This is the remaining 53.1% of the land. Therefore, Amber will be required to pay tax on the following amount of her gain on sale: ($3,000,000 - $1,400,000) x 53.1% = $849,600 At her marginal tax rate of 39% she has tax to pay of $331,344 on her $849,600 taxable gain on sale. Acquired no later than 12 months after meeting the new build land definition Under proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(i), if a person acquires land that already has a new build on it, the person must acquire the land no later than 12 months after first meeting the definition of “new build land” to qualify for the new build bright-line test. The definition of “new build land” is set out in proposed new section DH 5(7) and discussed in detail elsewhere in this Commentary. 49 Generally, the definition would be met when the new build received its CCC confirming it was added to the land. Therefore, when acquiring an existing new build, the land would have to be acquired no later than 12 months after the CCC was issued for the 5-year new build bright-line test to apply. New builds purchased off the plans and a new build constructed on land already owned by the person would also qualify, provided these new builds have received their CCCs by the time the land is disposed of. 49 See the “Exemption for new build land” section of this Commentary. 101 Example 58: Property acquired no later than 12 months after becoming a new build Catherine purchases a new build from a developer in May 2022. The property received its CCC in April 2022. She sells the property to Peter in January 2023. The 5-year new build bright-line test would apply to the land, rather than the 10-year bright-line test, because Peter has acquired the new build no later than 12 months after it received its CCC. Peter sells the property in December 2028. As he has sold the property more than 5 years after acquiring it, he would not be subject to tax under the 5-year new build bright-line test. Fact variation: Peter acquires property in January 2024 If Peter acquires the property in January 2024, instead of January 2023, then the 10-year bright-line test would apply to the land. Peter would not qualify for the 5-year new build bright-line test, because he acquired the land more than 12 months after the new build received its CCC. If he sells the property in December 2028, he will have sold it within 10 years of acquisition, so his gains on the land would be subject to tax under the 10-year bright-line test. Disposed of within 5 years of acquisition Under proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(ii), the land must be disposed of within 5 years of acquisition to be subject to tax under the 5-year new build bright-line test. Adding a new build to land after acquisition does not restart the bright-line period from the date of the new build being added. Example 59: Adding a new build does not restart the bright-line period James signs a sale and purchase agreement for a section in March 2023. Settlement occurs and title is transferred to James on 12 April 2023. James adds a new build to the section. The new build receives its CCC confirming it has been added to the land in June 2025. James sells the property in October 2029. The bright-line period begins on 12 April 2023 (when title was issued to James) and not from June 2025 (when the new build receives its CCC). Therefore, James would only be taxed on the gains on sale if he sold the property by 11 April 2028 (that is, within 5 years of title for the property transferring to James). Since James sold the land outside of that period, the 5-year new build bright-line test would not apply. Must be “new build land” when disposed of Under proposed new section CB 6A(2)(b)(iii), the land must have a new build on it when it is sold for the 5-year new build bright-line test to apply. This means that provided you add a new build to land before you sell it, the new build bright-line would apply. It also means that if you buy a new build, and it is destroyed or removed before you sell the land, the 5-year new build bright-line test would not apply. Generally, under the proposed definition, “new build land” would mean residential land with a self-contained dwelling on it, provided the dwelling received a CCC on or after 27 March 2020 confirming it was added to the land. Example 60: New build must be on land when sold for new build bright-line test to apply Daniel acquires bare land in June 2025. A new build is added to the land and receives its CCC in December 2028, at which point the land would satisfy the definition of “new build land”. Daniel sells the land in November 2031. The 10-year bright-line test would not apply because Daniel has sold “new build land”. Daniel would also not be taxed under the 5-year new build bright-line test as more than 5 years have passed since he acquired the land in June 2025. 102 Example 61: No CCC before sale Melissa purchases bare land in April 2027. She commissions Bob the Builder Ltd to add a new build to the land. Bob the Builder Ltd does a substandard job of constructing Melissa’s new build and goes into liquidation before the defects can be remedied. Melissa is not able to get a CCC for the new build and the bank forces a sale of the property in June 2034. The 5-year new build bright-line test would not apply. The land would not satisfy the definition of “new build land” because the new build does not have a CCC when it is sold. However, the 10-year bright-line test would apply to tax any gains Melissa makes on selling the property. This is because she has sold the property within 10 years of acquiring it. Example 62: Commercial to residential conversion Erica purchases a commercial property in May 2022. She converts it to residential apartments and a CCC is issued for the residential apartments in June 2024. She sells the property in December 2028. The bright-line period begins in May 2022, which is when Erica purchased the property. It does not matter that it was commercial land at that time. This is because the bright-line test applies whenever residential land is sold, and the land was residential land by the time it was disposed of. The residential apartments would be considered “new builds”, so the land would be “new build land” at the time it is sold. Therefore, the 10-year bright-line test would not apply, because Erica has sold “new build land”. Erica would also not be taxed under the 5-year new build bright-line test as more than 5 years have passed since she acquired the land. Application date Clause 48(4) sets out the proposed application date for the 5-year new build bright-line test. The test would apply to property acquired on or after 27 March 2021. However, it would not apply to property acquired on or after 27 March as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, if the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. An irrevocable offer is one that cannot be withdrawn before a certain time. For example, it is common as part of the tender process to sign a tender document that states the person cannot withdraw their offer until 5 working days after the tender has closed. In a typical sale and purchase, a property is acquired for tax purposes when there is a binding agreement between the vendor and purchaser. This includes the situation when the vendor accepts an offer with standard conditions that are still to be satisfied (such as obtaining finance or a building report). The property is acquired by the purchaser at the date the vendor accepts the offer and not on a later date when those conditions are satisfied or settlement occurs. Note that, in most cases, a different date is relevant for calculating the person’s period of ownership for the bright-line rules – the bright-line period is generally counted from the date the land is transferred under the Land Transfer Act 2017. 103 Example 63: Which bright-line test applies? Will submits an offer for a new build property as part of a tender process that closes on 23 March 2021. The new build received its CCC in May 2020. The tender document states that the offer cannot be withdrawn until 29 March. The vendor accepts the offer on 27 March and the sale and purchase agreement is signed. While Will acquired the land on 27 March, the carve-out for irrevocable offers made on or before 23 March 2021 would apply. The existing 5-year bright-line test would apply, rather than the 5-year new build bright- line test. The existing 5-year bright-line test applies for the same period as the 5-year new build bright-line test, and the two tests share the same settings, with only one key difference. This key difference is that the existing 5-year test has no time- or space-based apportionment for main homes. Fact variation: Offer made on 27 March 2021 If the same facts applied as above, except that Will did not make his offer until 27 March 2021, then the 5- year new build bright-line test would apply instead. 104 AMENDMENT TO THE BRIGHT-LINE TEST FOR MAIN HOMES Clauses 48, 49 and 61B Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would ensure a main home is not taxed under the bright-line test while it is used as a main home. Application date The proposed amendment would apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 50 This means the proposed changes would apply to the 10-year bright-line test and the proposed 5-year new build bright-line test, but not the existing 5-year bright-line test. Key features The proposed changes would ensure that for both the 10-year bright-line test and the proposed 5-year new build bright-line test, 51 while the property is used as the person’s main home, the following would apply: • If a main home makes up more than half the land, the existing main home exclusion would continue to apply in accordance with current law. Any gain on sale that relates to periods the land was used as a main home would not be taxed under the 5- year new build bright-line test or the 10-year bright-line test. • If the existing main home exclusion would not apply because the main home makes up less than half the land, an apportionment test would apply instead. Under the apportionment test, only the non-main home portion of the land would be taxed under the bright-line test. Thus, a main home would not be taxed while it is being used as a main home. 52 A person who builds a second dwelling on the same land as their main home (for example, a granny flat) would continue to benefit from the existing main home exclusion where that second dwelling takes up less than half the land. The main home would also not be taxed where the portion of the land used as a main home is smaller than the non-main home portion. The time apportionment rule, which applies when a property is not used as the main home for more than 12 consecutive months, would continue to apply regardless of whether the main home takes up more or less than half the land. This rule ensures that tax is paid on those periods of non-main home use – for example, while a dwelling is used as a rental property. 50 However, it would not apply to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021 as a result of an offer made by the purchaser on or before 23 March 2021, provided the offer could not be revoked before 27 March 2021. 51 For more on this, see the “5-year new build bright-line test” section of this Commentary. 52 With the existing exceptions of situations where the main home exclusion has been used twice in the last two years or there is a regular pattern of acquiring and disposing of residential land. 105 If land is used for both a main home and business premises (for example, a hair salon and main home on the same land), the rules would continue to apply as they currently do. That is, if the land is used predominantly as business premises, the bright-line test would not apply. On the other hand, if the business premises take up less than half the land, and the existing main home exclusion does not apply, the business premises would be taxed. However, the main home portion of the land would not be taxed under the bright-line test because of the proposed changes. Background The current main home exclusion from the bright-line test in section CB 16A applies where more than half the land is used for a main home. This means that a main home can fall outside the existing main home exclusion, and be subject to tax, if less than half the land is used as a main home. For example, if two rental properties were built on the same title as a main home and those rental properties took up more than half the land, the existing main home exclusion would not apply. All the gain on the sale of the property would be taxed if the land was sold within the applicable bright-line period, not just the gain attributable to the rental properties. With the bright-line period having been extended significantly, from five years to ten years, these settings are no longer appropriate. A 10-year bright-line period makes it more likely that main homes that make up less than half of the land would be taxed on sale, such as in the scenario above, because the bright-line test applies for a longer period. It is proposed that the amendments to how main homes are treated would also apply for the purposes of the 5- year new build bright-line test, to ensure only one set of rules apply going forward. Detailed analysis Quantification It is proposed to amend the quantification provision in the bright-line test to include a space- based apportionment test (this is in addition to the existing time-based apportionment test). Under section CB 6A, the amount a person derives from disposing of residential land is prima facie income. The purpose of the quantification provision is to determine the amount attributable to the use of the property as a main home and subtract that from the income on disposal of the property. The amended quantification provision in proposed new section CB 6A(8) is as follows: unadjusted amount × ( main home days × main home percentage ) + adjustment days total days 106 Table 4 Key terms Meaning Further explanation Excluded main home 53 (proposed new section CB 6A(14)) Land that has been used to some extent, but not predominantly, for a dwelling that was the main home of the person (or beneficiaries of a trust in certain circumstances). This definition substantially replicates existing section CB 16A(2). The difference is that for the definition of “excluded main home”, only some of the land needs to have been used as a main home, rather than more than half of the land. Unadjusted amount (proposed new section CB 6A(10)) The full amount of income the person derives from disposing of the land. Main home days (proposed new section CB 6A(11)) The total number of days in the relevant bright-line period where less than half the land has been used as an excluded main home (that is, the “predominantly” criterion in section CB 16A(2) is not satisfied), but some of the land has still been used for a main home. It also includes days where the property has not been used as an “excluded main home”, provided the non-main home use period does not exceed 365 consecutive days. There is no limit on the number of non-main home use periods that are 365 consecutive days or less. The quantification formula only needs to be used if the property is the person’s main home for only some of the time it was owned, or if the main home and relevant outdoor areas take up less than half the land (for example, because the land is also used for a rental property). The effect of the formula is to evenly apportion the sale proceeds from the property over the period it is held and over the areas used for different purposes (that is, main home and other purposes): • The amount attributable to the part of the property used for the main home, and the period for which it was used as the main home, is not income for tax purposes. • The amount attributable to the part of the property not used for the main home, or any period of more than 365 consecutive days the property was not used as the taxpayer’s main home, is income for tax purposes. There is no option to pay tax based on the actual valuations of the property at the start and end of the period the property was not the taxpayer’s main home. 53 While not directly used in the formula itself, “excluded main home” is referred to by other terms in the formula. 107 Example 64: Apportionment of time and space under the bright-line test Everly purchased a property for $500,000. It was transferred to her on 28 June 2022. She sold the property on 25 August 2028 for $1 million (2,250 days of ownership). The property is made up of her main home (70% of the land, including outdoor areas) and a minor dwelling (30% of the land, including outdoor areas). She: • lived in the main home for 400 days • went overseas for 250 days and rented the main home out while away • returned to live in the main home for 300 days • went overseas for 800 days and rented the main home out • returned from overseas and stayed in the minor dwelling for 400 days (which therefore became her main home during this period), and • moved out and left the minor dwelling vacant for 100 days before selling. Everly’s income calculation The formula in proposed new section CB 6A(8) is: unadjusted amount × ( main home days × main home percentage ) + adjustment days total days Applying the formula to Everly’s facts: • Unadjusted amount is $1 million. This is the full amount Everly sold her property for. • Main home days is 500. This is the 400 days Everly lived in the minor dwelling plus the 100 days it was vacant before she sold it (because the non-main home use is 365 days or less). • Main home percentage is 30%. This is the portion of land taken up by the minor dwelling while Everly lived in it. • Adjustment days is 950. This is the sum of the 400 days Everly lived in the main home, the 250 days she rented the main home out while she was away (because the non-main home use is 365 days or less), plus the remaining 300 days Everly lived in the main home after returning from her first period overseas. The 800 days Everly rented out the property while she was overseas a second time do not count as adjustment days because they exceed 365 days. • Total days is 2,250. This is the total days in the bright-line period. So, applying the formula to the facts in this example: $1,000,000 × ( 500 × 30% ) + 950 2250 =$488,889 The $488,889 is then subtracted from Everly’s sale price to give her total income of $511,111 under section CB 6A(1) ($1,000,000 – $488,889 = $511,111). Cost of some residential land reduced (DB 23C) The Income Tax Act 2007 operates on a gross basis, with the income and deduction provisions in different subparts. Therefore, to ensure the gain attributable to the main home portion of land is not taxed under the bright-line test, it is necessary to reduce both the income and deduction that may be claimed. The quantification provision in proposed new section CB 6A(8) would reduce the income from the property to the extent it was used as a main home. The proposed amendment to section DB 23C would reduce the cost base. Section DB 23(1) provides that a person is allowed a deduction for the acquisition cost of the land and any capital improvements. The proposed changes to section DB 23C would 108 reduce the deduction a person can claim under section DB 23 if the proposed new quantification provision in section CB 6A(8) applied. If the income was reduced under proposed new section CB 6A(8) because there was a main home on the land, then the proposed changes to section DB 23C would ensure that the amount the person was allowed to deduct was correspondingly reduced to the extent the cost of the land relates to the main home. The rationale for this is that some of the cost was incurred for a private benefit (that is, main home use) and should not be deductible. This is in line with general tax principles, but the specific reduction calculation makes it clear what would be able to be deducted. The proposed amendments to section DB 23C would reduce the amount a person can deduct under section DB 23 as follows: cost × ( main home days × main home percentage ) + adjustment days total days “Main home days”, “main home percentage”, “adjustment days” and “total days” have the same meaning as in section CB 6A (set out above). “Cost” means the cost of the residential land. Example 64 continued: Cost of residential land reduced This example uses the same facts as the example above. Everly bought her property for $500,000 and sold it for $1 million. For the formula in proposed new section DB 23C(2): • Cost is the $500,000 Everly paid for the property. • Main home days is 500. • Main home percentage is 30%. • Adjustment days is 950. • Total days is 2,250. Using the formula in proposed new section DB 23C(2) gives the following amount, which has to be subtracted from the amount Everly would otherwise have been able to deduct under section DB 23: $500,000 × ( 500 × 30% ) + 950 2250 =$244,444 Everly’s deduction under section DB 23, after subtracting the $244,444, would therefore be $255,556 ($500,000 – $244,444 = $255,556). Combined impact of proposed changes to sections CB 6A and DB 23C The combined impact of proposed changes to sections CB 6A and DB 23C would ensure the net gain on sale, after carving out amounts attributable to a main home on the land, is taxed. Example 64 continued: Combined impact of sections CB 6A, DB 23, and DB 23C This example uses the same facts as the examples above: • Everly’s income under proposed new section CB 6A is $511,111. • Everly’s deduction for the cost of the property under section DB 23 (after applying proposed new section DB 23C) is $255,556. 109 Her net income from the sale would therefore be $255,555 (which is $511,111 less $255,556). Everly’s income from other sources is $70,000, so she would pay income tax on her gain as follows: • At 33% (total income between $70,001 and $180,000): $36,300, being $109,999 of Everly’s gain multiplied by 33%. • At 39% (remaining total income exceeding $180,000): $56,767, being the remainder of Everly’s gain that was not taxed at 33%, multiplied by 39%. Everly would have tax to pay of $93,067. This example does not include any other deductions that Everly may be entitled to, for example certain interest expenses or rates and insurance. 110 ROLLOVER RELIEF Clauses 48(1) and 80D Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would extend the rollover relief already available for certain transfers or disposals of residential land under the bright-line test to provide relief for certain transfers to family trusts and to or from look-through companies and partnerships, and also for certain transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 or made as part of a settlement of a claim under te Tiriti o Waitangi – the Treaty of Waitangi (te Tiriti). An additional amendment would ensure that transfers to effect a change in co-ownership do not reset the bright-line period. Application date The proposed amendments would apply to disposals of “residential land” occurring on or after the date of enactment. Rollover relief would be available even if the original acquisition pre-dates the introduction of the bright-line test. The proposed amendment to insert sections CB 6A(5B) and (5C) (to ensure that transfers to effect a change in co-ownership do not reset the bright-line period) should apply from 1 October 2015. Key features Rollover relief is proposed for certain transfers or disposals of residential land for the purposes of the bright-line test in section CB 6A. Relief would be provided for some transfers to family trusts, and to or from look-through companies and partnerships. Specific relief is also proposed for transfers to trusts constituted under the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and transfers to land trusts as part of settling claims under te Tiriti. The proposed amendments ensure the bright-line test would not be triggered in certain situations when there is a legal transfer of residential land. This means that a transfer would either remain outside the ambit of the bright-line rules altogether, or the transfer would not create an income tax liability under the bright-line test. Family trusts Rollover relief is proposed to apply for transfers of residential land to family trusts, provided that: • each transferor of the land is also a beneficiary of the trust • at least one of the transferors of the land is also a principal settlor of the trust, and • each beneficiary – except for the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors – has a family connection with a principal settlor, is a company controlled by a family member beneficiary or is a charity. 111 Different conditions would apply for transfers of residential land to a Māori authority (or a person eligible to be a Māori authority) as the trustee of a trust. Rollover relief would apply if: • the land is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993, and • the transferors and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either: – members of the same iwi or hapū, or – the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead). Land transferred to a trust as part of a settlement of a claim under te Tiriti Rollover relief would be provided for transfers of residential land to a trust as part of a settlement of a claim under te Tiriti from a post-settlement governance entity to members of the claimant group, for example, hapū, provided that: • the land is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 • the land is transferred to a trustee of a trust who is a Māori authority, or is eligible to be a Māori authority, and • the trustees meet the requirements of section HF 2(3)(e)(i) (that is, they are the trustees of a trust who, on behalf of Māori claimants, receive and manage assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti). Transfers to or from look-through companies (LTCs) and partnerships Rollover relief is also proposed to apply to transfers to or from LTCs and partnerships where the persons transferring the residential land to the LTC or partnership (or acquiring it from the LTC or partnership) have ownership interests in the LTC or partnership interests in the partnership in proportion to: • their individual interests in the land, and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land. Transfers must not be above cost In addition to the conditions outlined above, rollover relief would only be available for these specific types of transfers if the transfer is made for an amount of consideration that is less than or equal to the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. Remedial amendment to the bright-line test A proposed remedial amendment would ensure that transfers to effect a change in co- ownership do not reset the bright-line period to the extent they do not change a person’s proportional or notional proportional interest in the land. Background The bright-line test provides that when residential land is disposed of within ten years of acquisition, the income is taxable under section CB 6A. The bright-line test was introduced as a 2-year test for residential land acquired between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018. A 5- year test applies for residential land acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021, 112 and the 10-year bright-line test applies to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. Under the current bright-line test, when residential land is gifted or sold below market value, the deemed gross income for the disposal is the market value of the land. This is an integrity measure, but some circumstances exist where a disposal may not be an appropriate taxing point. In such cases, it can be justified to apply rollover treatment to ignore the disposal for the purposes of the bright-line test. Rollover relief is not an exemption from income tax. In the context of the bright-line test, rollover relief defers the taxing point until a subsequent disposal of the land occurs that does not qualify for rollover relief. To achieve this, rollover relief disregards an intervening disposal by treating the transfer as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. For the bright- line test, the recipient is deemed to take on the transferor’s original date of acquisition along with the transferor’s cost base. Rollover relief ensures the recipient can benefit from the transferor’s years of ownership of the residential land to determine whether they are inside or outside the relevant bright-line period. It also ensures the recipient is subject to the same bright-line period as the transferor. For example, if a person acquired residential land before 1 October 2015 (that is, before the bright-line test applied) and it was subsequently transferred to someone else in a transaction that qualified for rollover relief, the recipient would not be brought within the ambit of the 10-year bright-line test even if the transfer occurred on or after 27 March 2021. Limited rollover relief is currently available under the bright-line test. However, as the test was originally introduced as a 2-year test, extensive rules providing for rollover relief were not designed. Rollover relief is currently only provided for residential land transferred under a relationship property agreement and for certain company amalgamations. However, full relief is provided for inherited residential land. If disposal of residential land takes place within the bright-line period, the disposal is taxed based on the market value of the land at the time of disposal in the absence of any rollover relief. This is the appropriate outcome in most cases, but there may be situations where there is a disposal for legal purposes or for the Income Tax Act 2007, but no disposal of the land in economic substance. Rollover relief may be appropriate in some of these situations to prevent an adverse tax outcome that may arise when a person disposes of land but has continuous economic ownership of that land. This would be achieved by treating the recipient as having acquired the land on the date that it was acquired by the transferor and for the same cost. Detailed analysis The proposed amendments would provide limited extensions to the rollover relief already available under the bright-line test. Relief would be available for certain transfers to family trusts and to or from look-through companies and partnerships. Relief is also proposed for certain transfers of land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 or made as part of a settlement of a claim under te Tiriti. 113 Settlements on or sales to family trusts (sections FC 9B and FC 9C) Under the current bright-line test, a transfer of residential land on trust (via settlement or sale) constitutes a disposal by the transferor and an acquisition by the trustee of the trust. Depending on the circumstances this can create an income tax liability under the bright-line test or restart the bright-line period even if the settlor originally acquired the land before 1 October 2015. 54 Proposed new section FC 9B would apply when residential land is transferred to the trustees of a trust (the test trust) (as a settlement on the trust or a sale to those trustees). Proposed new section FC 9B(2) would provide rollover relief for such a transfer if all the following conditions are satisfied: • Each transferor of the land is also a beneficiary of the trust (paragraph (a)). • At least one of the transferors of the land is also a principal settlor of the trust, as defined in section CB 16A(7) (paragraph (b)). • Each beneficiary who is not a principal settlor is– – within four degrees of blood relationship with, or married to, or in a civil union or de facto relationship with, a beneficiary who is a principal settlor (referred to here as a “family member beneficiary”) (subparagraph (c)(i)) – a company where a 50% voting interest (or 50% market value interest, if a market value circumstance exists) is owned by a family member beneficiary (subparagraph (c)(ii)) – a trustee of another trust that has a beneficiary who is also a family member beneficiary of the test trust (subparagraph (c)(iii)), or – a charity (subparagraph (c)(iv)). To qualify as a family member beneficiary, the conditions in proposed new sections FC 9B(3) and (4) would need to be met. Proposed new section FC 9B(3)(a) provides that beneficiaries within four degrees of blood relationship with a beneficiary who is a principal settlor would qualify as a family member beneficiary. The proposed rules are intended to mirror the existing associated person rules in sections YB 4(1), (3) and (4), but with an expansion from two degrees to four degrees of association. This is to account for the fact that many family trusts include a wider range of family members than simply those only two degrees removed. Proposed new section FC 9B(3)(b) provides that the association test would include people who are married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship, while proposed new section FC 9B(3)(c) is intended to cover stepchildren and in-laws. Adoption is covered in proposed new section FC 9B(4)(a) to ensure that adopted children are counted as natural children of their adoptive parents. Proposed new section FC 9B(4)(b) mirrors existing section YB 4(4) and provides that the association test would not be met if the person cannot reasonably be expected to know both that the other person exists and that they are within four degrees of blood relationship. This 54 The original 2-year bright-line test applied to properties acquired on or after 1 October 2015. 114 is designed to deal with a small minority of situations, such as when siblings are separated at a very young age and do not know of each other's existence. Some common examples of familial relations and the degrees of blood relationship for a principal settlor are as follows (please note this list is non-exhaustive): • One degree of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s parents and children, or spouse. • Two degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s grandchildren, grandparents, siblings, stepparents, stepchildren, and parents-in-law. • Three degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, great-grandchildren, and great-grandparents. • Four degrees of blood relationship: the principal settlor’s cousins, great-nieces, great- nephews, and great-great-grandchildren. Further information on how degrees of association are determined in family situations can be found in IR620. 55 In addition, proposed new section FC 9B(5) would require the amount of consideration provided by the trustees (if any) to be less than or equal to the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. If the amount of consideration exceeds the cost of the land to the transferor, then rollover relief would not apply even if all the other requirements of proposed new section FC 9B are met. If the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, proposed new section FC 9B(5) would provide the recipient trustees with a deemed acquisition cost and date that mirrors the total cost of the land to the transferor and the transferor’s acquisition date. If, after land is transferred to the trust, new beneficiaries are added with the purpose of defeating the bright-line test, the land-rich trust anti-avoidance rule in existing section GB 53 would apply to reverse the rollover relief by deeming the trustee to have disposed of the land at market value. The rollover relief in proposed new section FC 9B would not cover disposals from trustees to beneficiaries. Disposals of residential land from the trustee to a beneficiary, where the residential land is disposed of to the beneficiary within the relevant bright-line period for the trustee, may still be subject to the bright-line test and may produce income to the trustee. Example 65: Settlement on family trust Married couple Sunita and Ronald purchase residential land in their own names for $1 million on 9 November 2021. On 20 July 2023 Sunita and Ronald decide to settle the land on a trust with Sunita’s sister and her sister’s spouse as the trustees. Sunita, Ronald and their children are beneficiaries of the trust. The only property settled on the trust is the residential land and the trustees provide consideration of $1 million (even though in that intervening period the market value of the property has increased to $1.2 million). The trustees then sell the residential land for $1.7 million on 31 January 2027. Sunita and Ronald are both beneficiaries of the trust. Sunita and Ronald are also both principal settlors, given that the trust has no other property and Sunita and Ronald have each made the greatest equal settlements. Sunita and Ronald are associated through marriage, and both non-settlor beneficiaries (the two children) are associated with a principal settlor (in this case, both settlors) within the required four degrees 55 IR620 A guide to associated persons definitions for income tax purposes, available at www.ird.govt.nz. 115 of blood relationship (being one degree of blood relationship). This means they would satisfy the requirements in proposed new section FC 9B(2) for rollover relief. The consideration paid by the trustees to Ronald and Sunita is equal to the price they originally paid for the property, so the transfer would also satisfy the requirements in proposed new section FC 9B(5) (which requires that the consideration they received is equal to or less than their cost base). Sunita and Ronald would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test on the disposal of their residential land to the trustees of their family trust on 20 July 2023. Instead, the trustees would be deemed to have an acquisition date of 9 November 2021 for the residential land and a cost base of $1 million. The trustees’ bright-line period would end on 31 January 2027 on the sale of the land for $1.7m. As this is within the 10- year period for the bright-line test (9 November 2021 to 8 November 2031), the sale would be subject to income tax under the bright-line test. Ignoring other income tax deductions, the trustees would have net bright-line income of $700,000. Example 66: Disposal to yourself as trustee of a trust Neo acquired residential land on 3 March 2017 for $500,000. On 29 October 2022, Neo settles the residential land on a trust with him and his son, Archie, as beneficiaries of the trust. Neo’s outstanding mortgage is $400,000. The trustee provides consideration of $450,000, of which Neo uses $400,000 to discharge his outstanding mortgage. Current law Neo is subject to the 2-year bright-line test for the land. 56 The settlement on the trust is a disposal, but there is no tax liability under the bright-line test because Neo held the land for more than two years. However, the settlement on 29 October 2022 restarts the bright-line clock and the trustee of the trust would be subject to a 10-year bright-line test. Outcome under proposed amendment Full rollover relief would be provided and the settlement on trust on 29 October 2022 would effectively be ignored. The trustee would take on Neo’s acquisition date of 3 March 2017 and Neo’s acquisition cost of $500,000, even though the trustee only provided consideration of $450,000. A subsequent disposal by the trust in 2025, for example, would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test because the 2-year test applied when Neo first acquired the land. Māori family trust proposal Proposed new section FC 9C would provide rollover relief for transfers of residential land that is subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 to trustees in certain situations. The policy intent is to recognise that land subject to the Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 has alienation restrictions that lead to interests in land being passed from generation to generation. These interests are often fragmented and can result in a large number of owners all belonging to the same iwi or hapū or who are all descendants of the same tipuna. Proposed new section FC 9C provides that rollover relief would be available for a transfer of residential land to a Māori authority, or a person eligible to be a Māori authority, as the trustee of a trust if: • the land is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (subsection (1)) • each transferor is a beneficiary of the trust (subsection (2)), and • the transferors of the land and the beneficiaries of the trust are all either: – members of the same iwi or hapū, or – the descendants of the same tipuna (living or dead) (subsection (2)). 56 The 2-year test applied to residential land acquired between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018. 116 Consistent with the rule in proposed new section FC 9B(5), proposed new section FC 9C(3) sets out that the amount of consideration provided by the trustees (if any) must be less than or equal to the total cost of the residential land to the transferor for rollover relief to apply. If the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, proposed new section FC 9C(3) would provide the recipient trustee with a deemed acquisition cost and date that mirrors the transferor’s cost base in the land and acquisition date. Transfers of residential land as part of a settlement under te Tiriti Settlements of claims under te Tiriti can be a multi-stage process. The Crown will transfer Treaty settlement property to a single governance entity (post-settlement governance entity or PSGE) that may act on behalf of several groups, for example, different hapū or as a collective for a number of iwi groups. The PSGE will then transfer settlement assets to different members of the claimant group as required under the deed of settlement or settlement legislation. This transfer from the PSGE to a member of the claimant group could be subject to income tax under the bright-line test for the PSGE. It could also start the bright-line clock for the member to whom the residential land has been transferred. The transfer of residential land from the PSGE to a claimant group member was less likely to trigger the bright-line test under the previous 2-year and 5-year tests. However, with the extension of the test to 10 years, this could become an impediment for iwi to transact efficiently with settlement assets involving residential land. Proposed new section FC 9D provides that rollover relief would be available for a transfer of residential land that is subject to Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 and part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti to a trustee of a trust who: • is a Māori authority or is eligible to be a Māori authority (subsection (1)(a)), and • on behalf of Māori claimants, receives and manages assets that are transferred by the Crown as part of the settlement of a claim under te Tiriti (subsection (1) (b)). It is intended that this would provide rollover relief for the transfer of Treaty settlement residential land from the PSGE to a member of the claimant group, for example, hapū. If the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, it is intended that under proposed new section FC 9D(2) the receiving trust would be deemed to have acquired the residential land at the same time the PSGE received the property from the Crown and for the same acquisition cost. This would mean that if the residential land is then disposed of beyond the claimant group, the disposal would only be subject to the bright-line test if it occurs within 10 years of the first transfer from the Crown. Consistent with the rule in proposed new section FC 9B(5) for other trusts, proposed new section FC 9D(2) sets out that the amount of consideration provided by the trustees (if any) must be less than or equal to the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer for rollover relief to apply. Look-through companies (LTCs) Shareholders in LTCs are treated as directly holding the LTCs’ assets, deriving income, and incurring expenses in accordance with their shareholding percentage. In effect, LTCs are transparent for tax purposes, which means that the income tax consequences for someone 117 who holds residential land directly are generally the same as for someone who holds residential land through an LTC. Nonetheless, the process of transferring residential land from an individual shareholder into the LTC (or vice versa) currently constitutes a bright- line disposal and acquisition. The intent is that under proposed new section FC 9E(4)(b), rollover relief should apply to a transfer to or from an LTC when the persons transferring the residential land to the LTC – or acquiring it from the LTC – are all shareholders in the LTC in proportion to: • their individual interests in the land, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate (subparagraph (i)), and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land (again, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate) (subparagraph (ii)). Consistent with the rollover relief for trusts in proposed new section FC 9B(5), proposed new section FC 9E(2) sets out that the amount of consideration provided (if any) would need to be less than or equal to the total cost of the land to the transferor for rollover relief to apply. If the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, proposed new section FC 9E(2) would provide the recipient with a deemed acquisition cost and date that mirrors the total cost of the land to the transferor at the date of the transfer and the transferor’s acquisition date. Partnerships Like LTCs, partnerships are also transparent for tax purposes. Equally, the process of transferring residential land from the partners in a partnership to the partnership constitutes a bright-line disposal and acquisition at present. Proposed new section FC 9E would provide rollover relief for partnerships. As for transfers to or from LTCs, the intent is that under proposed new section FC 9E(4)(c), rollover relief should apply to a transfer to or from a partnership when the group of persons transferring the land to the partnership – or acquiring it from the partnership – are all partners in the partnership and their respective partnership interests are in proportion to: • their individual interests in the land, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate (subparagraph (i)), and • their cost base relative to the total cost base in the land (again, either before or after the transfer, as appropriate) (subparagraph (ii)). Proposed new section FC 9E(2) also applies to partnerships and sets out that the amount of consideration provided (if any) would need to be less than or equal to the total cost of the land to the transferor for rollover relief to apply. If the requirements for rollover relief are satisfied, proposed new section FC 9E(2) would provide the recipient with a deemed acquisition cost and date that mirrors the total cost of the land to the transferor at the date of the transfer and the transferor’s acquisition date. Start of bright-line period when effecting a change in co-ownership Under New Zealand law, it is possible for a person to transfer land to themselves by changing the form of co-ownership of the land (for example, changing from holding land as tenants in 118 common to holding it as joint tenants) or by transferring it from sole ownership to a form of co-ownership (or vice versa). While the registration of a transfer instrument to effect a change in the form of co-ownership of land should not be considered a disposal for the bright-line test, registration of a transfer instrument under the Land Transfer Act 2017 sets the start date of the bright-line period. 57 As such, there is a question of whether the registration of a transfer instrument to change the form of co-ownership of a parcel of land resets the bright-line “clock”, meaning the bright- line period would start again from that point. Proposed new sections CB 6A(5B) and (5C) would clarify that the bright-line clock is not reset when a transfer instrument is registered to effect a change in the form of co-ownership of land, provided that economic ownership of the land has not changed. As the proposed amendments are intended to clarify an ambiguity in the current drafting of section CB 6A, the proposed application date aligns with other proposed changes to section CB 6A in the Supplementary Order Paper. 57 For further information, see draft interpretation statement PUB00411: “Income tax – application of the land sale rules to changes to co-ownership, subdivisions, and changes of trustees”, published on 28 September 2021, available at taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz 119 Remedials 121 LOSSES CARRIED FORWARD AFTER AN OWNERSHIP CONTINUITY BREACH Clauses 89B–89K Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify that losses incurred after an ownership continuity breach that occurred before the 2019–20 income year can be carried forward to the 2020–21 year under the business continuity test (BCT) in section IB 3. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020–21 income year. Background The BCT was introduced by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2020–21, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. It allows companies to carry forward tax losses to future years when they have an ownership continuity breach provided there is no major change in the nature of the business activities of the company. It was intended that tax losses incurred after an ownership continuity breach in an income year before the 2020–21 income year could be carried forward under the new BCT. However, the drafting in section IB 3(3) technically does not allow this in all the intended circumstances. The proposed amendment would clarify this. 122 PART-YEAR LOSSES AND THE BUSINESS CONTINUITY TEST (BCT) Clauses 89B–89K Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment would clarify the application of the part-year loss rules to the BCT. It would ensure companies that have a major change in the nature of their business activities and fail the BCT during an income year would be able to use losses up to the day of the breach. This would be the same as under the current part-year loss rules for a breach in ownership continuity. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the 2020–21 income year. Background The current BCT does not work well with the part-year loss rules. Where a company has a major change in its business, and therefore fails the BCT during an income year, the current rules are unclear about how part-year losses should be treated. From a policy viewpoint, losses incurred up to the date of the BCT breach should be available for use or offset (if possible). Tax loss components incurred after the breach should be able to be carried forward (subject to any future ownership continuity breach). This is in line with the current part-year loss rules on an ownership continuity breach. Example 67: Business continuity test and part-year losses Wilma Widgets Limited (WWL) had a breach in ownership continuity on 1 April 2022. However, WWL maintained a similar business before and after the ownership continuity breach, and therefore, the company carried forward its tax losses under the BCT. On 1 October 2023, however, the company made a major change in the nature of its business activities and therefore breached the BCT. This resulted in WWL being unable to carry forward its losses. As this change happened during the year, WWL should be able to offset any losses incurred up to 30 September 2023 (the day before the breach) against any net income for the same period (or to offset the losses against income of other group companies, if permitted). WWL should also be able to carry forward any losses incurred from 1 October 2023 (the day of the breach), subject to meeting the other requirements of the part-year loss rules (such as providing part-year accounts). 123 FBT – POOLED ALTERNATE RATE OPTION Clauses 114B to 114E Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would provide employers with a new option for calculating fringe benefit tax (FBT). Application date The proposed amendments would apply from 1 April 2021, except for the amendments to sections RD 50(5) and RD 60(3), which would apply for the 2021–22 and later income years. Key features Many fringe benefits are required to be attributed to those employees receiving the benefits. This can make the calculation of an employer’s FBT liability a complex exercise. Employers can choose different calculation options. They may choose to pay FBT at the flat maximum rate of 63.93% (49.25% before 1 April 2021) or to calculate their FBT liability for each individual employee using the applicable FBT rate for each dollar of “all-inclusive pay” received by the employee. Under the proposed new pooled alternate rate option, employers would pay FBT at the rate of 63.93% only for those employees with all-inclusive pay of $129,681 or more. This would generally only be those employees earning over $180,000 in pre-tax salary or wages (or close to that threshold), assuming employees do not receive significant fringe benefits. FBT would be payable at the rate of 49.25% for all employees with all-inclusive pay under $129,681. Employers currently using any of the single rate, full alternate rate or short form alternate rate options would be able to switch to the new pooled alternate rate option. This means that employers who used another option for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year would be able to switch to the new option for the fourth quarter of the 2021–22 tax year. Amendments to the existing provisions setting out the close company and small business options are also proposed. The proposed amendments would allow employers using those options to pay FBT at the rate of 49.25% for all employees with all-inclusive pay under $129,681. Consistent with the approach under the proposed new pooled alternate rate option, FBT would be payable at the rate of 63.93% only for employees with all-inclusive pay of $129,681 or more. A similar amendment is also proposed to the existing provision setting out employers’ options for paying FBT when they have stopped employing staff. Background An employer who provides a fringe benefit to an employee is liable to pay FBT. Most fringe benefits are required to be attributed to individual employees to calculate the employer’s FBT liability. Attributed benefits include: 124 • making available a motor vehicle for an employee’s private use • employment-related loans • the provision of certain benefits, such as subsidised transport and contributions to superannuation schemes, where each category of benefit has a taxable value of $1,000 or more per year per employee, and • any unclassified benefit provided with a taxable value of $2,000 or more per year per employee. Generally, all other fringe benefits (non-attributed benefits) must be pooled. FBT is calculated on the annual taxable value of these pooled benefits at the rate of 63.93% (for benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders or to persons associated with an employee who is a major shareholder) or 49.25% (for benefits provided to all other employees). Currently, employers may use any of the following three options to calculate their FBT liability on attributed benefits: • the single rate option • the full alternate rate option, and • the short form alternate rate option. The lowest compliance cost option is the single rate option. Under the single rate option, an employer pays tax at the highest FBT rate (currently 63.93%) on all fringe benefits provided (including non-attributed benefits) without having to carry out a compliance cost intensive calculation for each employee who receives a fringe benefit. Applying tax at the highest FBT rate is a deliberate policy setting that is intended to avoid the possibility of under-taxation. The rate of FBT for the single rate option was increased from 49.25% to 63.93% when the new top personal tax rate of 39% for income over $180,000 was introduced. However, under this tax setting, the single rate option may result in many employers having a significantly higher FBT liability for employees receiving less than $129,681 in all-inclusive pay than if the employer attributed benefits directly to the individual employees. This is an issue where employers have no, or few, employees earning income over $180,000. The full alternate rate option is a more accurate alternative available to employers, but it requires calculations of the employer’s FBT liability for each individual employee to be carried out, which may increase compliance costs. Under the full alternate rate option, attributed benefits provided in the first three quarters are initially taxed either at the second highest FBT rate of 49.25% or at the highest FBT rate of 63.93%. A “wash-up” calculation is then performed after the end of the fourth quarter to tax every dollar of attributed benefits provided to an employee during the year at the applicable FBT rate, which is based on the employee’s “all-inclusive pay”. The short form alternate rate option is an easier option for employers, but like the single rate option, it may also result in over-taxation given the top FBT rate of 63.93%. Instead of carrying out calculations of the employer’s FBT liability for each employee, under the short form alternate rate option attributed benefits are taxed at a flat rate of 63.93%. Non-attributed benefits are taxed at the 49.25% rate (except where they are provided to employees who are major shareholders or to their associates). 125 The proposed amendments would introduce a new alternate rate option (the pooled alternate rate option) for calculating FBT. It is intended to strike a better balance between accuracy and simplicity for most employers than the existing FBT payment options. Employers with no, or very few, employees earning near or above $180,000 in salary or wages would be expected to benefit the most from the new option. Detailed analysis Existing calculation of FBT Existing section RD 50(2) provides that the employer’s FBT liability for fringe benefits attributed to an employee is the amount of tax on all-inclusive pay less tax on cash pay. “Tax on all-inclusive pay” is defined in subsection (3)(a) as the amount determined at the rate set out in schedule 1, part C, table 1 (reproduced below) on the amount of the employee’s all- inclusive pay. Calculation of all-inclusive pay (section RD 51) The calculation of an employee’s all-inclusive pay is set out in existing section RD 51(2). This amount is calculated as cash pay less tax on cash pay, plus the taxable value of all fringe benefits attributed to the employee (or a person associated with the employee) in the tax year. “Cash pay” is the cash pay of the employee for the income year in which the fringe benefit is attributed that is paid to the employee by the employer or a related employer (subsection (3)(a)). This amount includes dividends and interest derived by the employee from their employer or a related employer. FBT rates are currently based on all-inclusive pay, rather than monetary remuneration, because it is important to include the value of fringe benefits when determining an employee’s FBT rate – otherwise employers might be incentivised to provide fringe benefits instead of cash remuneration to employees earning near the personal income tax brackets. 58 58 For this reason, the respective levels of all-inclusive pay at which a higher FBT rate applies are determined by reference to the personal income tax rates and the income brackets at which these rates apply. For example, the all-inclusive pay of an employee earning a before-tax salary of $180,000 and receiving no fringe benefits is $129,680. Hence, the all-inclusive pay of an employee earning more than $180,000 will be $129,681 or more. 126 Alternate rate options (section RD 59) Existing section RD 59 sets out how the alternate rate options work. Most relevantly, subsection (2) provides that an employer may pay FBT for any, or all, of the first three quarters of a tax year at 49.25% of the taxable value of a fringe benefit. Subsection (4) sets out the wash-up calculation for the final quarter of the tax year under the alternate rate options. Under subsection (4), the employer must calculate the total FBT payable for each employee for the tax year and subtract the amount of FBT payable for the previous three quarters of the tax year. The difference is the amount payable for the final quarter. Proposed amendment to allow use of pooled alternate rate option (section RD 50(5)) Existing section RD 50(5) provides that an employer may choose to pay FBT at a flat rate of 63.93% on the taxable value of attributed benefits (rather than calculating the difference between tax on all-inclusive pay and tax on cash pay under section RD 50(2)). The proposed amendment to section RD 50(5) would provide employers with a further option. Under the proposed new pooled alternate rate option, an employer would be able to choose to pay FBT at the rate of 63.93% on the total taxable value of benefits attributed to an employee whose all-inclusive pay is $129,681 or more. For all other employees, the proposed amendment would allow the employer to pay FBT at the rate of 49.25% on the taxable value of attributed benefits. Non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are not major shareholders will continue to be pooled and taxed at the 49.25% rate. Non-attributed benefits provided to employees who are major shareholders or to their associates will also continue to be required to be pooled and taxed at the 63.93% rate. Employers using any of the three currently available options for the first three quarters would be able to switch to the new option. An employer switching from one of the existing options to the pooled alternate rate option may be asked to provide the information necessary for calculating its FBT payable for the final quarter. Example 68: Pooled alternate rate option Company A employs full-time and part-time staff in a range of roles requiring different skill sets, qualifications, and levels of experience. Salaries range from $30,000 to $178,000. However, only Employee X earns $178,000 before tax, with the next highest-paid employee earning $120,000 before tax. In the 2021–22 tax year, Company A provides fringe benefits totalling $100,000 to all its staff members in the form of subsidised transport and some low interest, employment- related loans. No individual staff member received more than $6,000 in attributed benefits, with Employee X receiving attributed benefits to the value of $5,000. Company A has calculated its FBT liability for attributed benefits for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year under section RD 59(2). This means it paid FBT at the rate of 49.25% of the taxable value of attributed benefits for those first three quarters. As fringe benefits totalling $75,000 were provided in the first three quarters, Company A has paid FBT of $36,937.50 for that period. Company A decides to use the pooled alternate rate option to calculate its FBT liability for the final quarter of 2021–22. When preparing the FBT return for the final quarter, Company A identifies that only one employee received all-inclusive pay of $129,681 or more in the 2021–22 tax year, being Employee X. Even if the next highest- paid employee (the employee earning $120,000) received $6,000 in attributed benefits, their all-inclusive pay would only be $95,480. 127 FBT for Employee X The calculation of the total tax on Employee X’s cash pay is set out below. Income tax thresholds Applicable marginal tax rate Income of Employee X taxed at marginal rate Tax on cash pay $0 to $14,000 10.5% $14,000 $1,470 $14,001 to $48,000 17.5% $34,000 $5,950 $48,001 to $70,000 30% $22,000 $6,600 $70,001 to $180,000 33% $108,000 $35,640 > $180,000 39% $0 $0 Total $178,000 $49,660 Thus, the tax on Employee X’s cash pay is $49,660. As Employee X received $5,000 in attributed benefits, Employee X’s all-inclusive pay is $133,340 ($178,000 - $49,660 + $5,000 = $133,340). Under the pooled alternate rate option, as Employee X’s all-inclusive pay is more than $129,681, Company A is required to pay FBT on the taxable value of the attributed benefits provided to Employee X at the 63.93% rate. Therefore, Company A’s FBT liability for Employee X for the 2021–22 year is $3,196.50 ($5,000 × 63.93%). FBT for other employees The total FBT payable for all other employees for the 2021–22 year is calculated by subtracting the taxable value of benefits attributed to Employee X from the taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 and then applying the 49.25% rate to this amount. The taxable value of attributed benefits Company A provided to all its staff during 2021–22 is $100,000. Employee X received $5,000 of these benefits. This means that the total FBT payable for Company A’s employees (excluding Employee X) for the 2021–22 tax year is $46,787.50 (($100,000 - $5,000) × 49.25%). Total FBT liability Therefore, Company A’s total FBT liability for all employees (including Employee X) for the 2021–22 tax year is $49,984 ($46,787.50 + $3,196.50). As Company A has already paid $36,937.50 in FBT for the first three quarters of the 2021–22 tax year, the FBT payable for the final quarter is $13,046.50 ($49,984 - $36,937.50). Example 69: Employer switches from single rate option to pooled alternate rate option Company B did not employ any staff that received $129,681 or more in all-inclusive pay in the 2021–22 tax year. Company B used the single rate option to pay its FBT liability for the first three quarters of that year and wishes to switch to the pooled alternate rate option for calculating its FBT payable for the final quarter. Company B provided $50,000 in attributed benefits to its employees during the 2021–22 tax year and no non-attributed benefits. The taxable value of the benefits that were provided in the first three quarters was $37,500. Therefore, Company B has already paid $23,973.75 in FBT for the 2021–22 tax year using the single rate option ($37,500 × 63.93%). Since none of its employees received $129,681 or more in all-inclusive pay, Company B calculates its FBT payable for the final quarter by simply applying the 49.25% rate to the taxable value of benefits provided to its employees during the year ($50,000 × 49.25% = $24,625) and subtracting from the resulting figure the amount of FBT it has already paid for the first three quarters of the year. This gives an amount of FBT payable for the final quarter of $651.25 ($24,625 – $23,973.75). 128 Proposed amendments to close company and small business options (sections RD 60 and RD 61) Existing sections RD 60 and RD 61 set out the close company and small business options for paying FBT. Section RD 60 applies to close companies providing fringe benefits to shareholder- employees in an income year if, in the preceding income year: • the gross amounts of tax for both PAYE income payments and employer’s superannuation cash contributions withheld were no more than $1 million • the only benefit provided was making one or two motor vehicles available to shareholder-employees for their private use, or • the company did not employ anyone. The small business option in section RD 61 applies to employers providing fringe benefits to employees who are not shareholder-employees in a tax year if in the preceding tax year, the gross amounts of tax for both PAYE income payments and employer’s superannuation cash contributions withheld were no more than $1 million, or the employer did not employ any employees. Instead of paying FBT quarterly, employers using the small business option pay their FBT liability on an annual (tax year) basis, while employers using the close company option pay on an income year basis. Under both these options, an employer must either calculate its FBT liability for each individual employee under section RD 50 (and calculate the amount of FBT on non-attributed benefits under section RD 53) or pay FBT on the taxable value of all fringe benefits at 63.93%. Proposed amendments to sections RD 60(3)(b) and RD 61(3)(b) would ensure an employer using either the close company option or the small business option could choose to pay FBT at a flat rate of 63.93% only on benefits attributed to those employees receiving $129,681 or more in all-inclusive pay, with benefits provided to all other employees taxed at 49.25%. The proposed amendments would replace the words “the total pay of each employee” with “their FBT liability” in each of the sections. This would clarify that calculating the amount of FBT for each individual employee (which involves calculating each employee’s all - inclusive pay) should not be required as a practical matter if the employer opts to pay FBT at the flat rates of 63.93% on attributed benefits provided to employees receiving $129,681 or more in all-inclusive pay and 49.25% on attributed benefits provided to all other employees (as provided for in proposed new section RD 50(5)). When an employer stops employing staff (section RD 63) Existing section RD 63 applies to an employer who stops employing staff and does not intend to replace them. 59 Subsection (2) provides that the employer must pay FBT using section RD 59 (the full alternate rate option), treating the quarter of the tax year in which the employment ended as if it were the final quarter. Essentially this means the final quarter wash-up calculation to tax all attributed benefits at the appropriate rates must be performed in the quarter in which the employment ended. However, as an alternative to full attribution, 59 However, the section does not apply if the employer continues to provide a fringe benefit to a former employee. 129 subsection (3) provides that the employer may choose to pay FBT under the single rate option. The proposed amendment to the cross-references in section RD 63 would clarify that the full alternate rate and single rate options are not the only options available to employers that have stopped employing staff. The short form alternate rate and pooled alternate rate options would also be available, with the quarter of the tax year in which the employment ended being treated as the final quarter under these options too.

COVID-19 resurgence support payments The proposed CRSP scheme, to be administered by Inland Revenue, supports the Government’s economic response to COVID-19. By providing financial support to businesses in the event of alert level escalations, the CRSP scheme aims to limit the economic and social impact of public health restrictions at higher alert levels. The proposed scheme may be activated in the event of an increase in alert levels from alert level 1 to alert level 2 or higher, and after remaining at an alert level higher than 1 for seven days or more. The scheme would be available to all businesses in New Zealand each time it activates. The scheme would not be restricted to a particular region even in the event of a regional increase in alert levels as even a regional public health restriction may impact businesses across New Zealand. To be eligible for the grant, applicants must have suffered a decline in revenue of 30% or more. This is calculated by comparing a seven-day period at alert level 2 or higher with the typical weekly revenue in the six weeks preceding the move from alert level 1. In addition, applicants must have been in business for at least six months. The proposed CRSP scheme proposes a one-off support payment to businesses in the form of a grant. The proposed payment will comprise a base amount of $1,500 per applicant plus $400 per full-time equivalent 1 (FTE) up to a cap of 50 FTEs. Although the payment is capped at 50 FTEs, businesses with more than 50 FTEs may still apply. The payment is further capped by four times the amount the applicant declares their revenue has declined by. The amount an applicant may receive under the scheme is the lower of the amount calculated using the formula above ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE), and four times the amount their revenue has declined by as declared by the applicant as part of their application. The policies proposed in this Bill authorises Inland Revenue to make grant payments under the scheme, and other legislative amendments to support Inland Revenue’s administration of the scheme. Minimum family tax credit threshold The MFTC is one of the Working for Families tax credits. Its purpose is to incentivise families with children to move off the benefit and into “full-time” work. 2 The MFTC achieves this by “topping up” the incomes of working families to an amount that is more than what they could potentially receive on a benefit. When benefit rates and thresholds are 1 For the purposes of the CRSP scheme, employees who work 20 hours or more per week counts as 1.0 FTE, while employees who work less than 20 hours per week count as 0.6 FTE. 2 For the purposes of the MFTC, “full-time” work is defined as 20 hours or more per week for sole parent families, and 30 hours or more per week for two-parent families. 8 increased, the MFTC must also be adjusted to ensure working families continue to be better off in work and receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on the benefit. From 1 April 2021, the benefit abatement thresholds will increase, allowing beneficiaries to earn a greater amount of additional income before their benefits start to reduce. As a consequence of the increase in benefit abatement thresholds, this Bill increases the MFTC threshold from 1 April 2021 meaning sole parent families remain financially better off in full-time work and receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on the benefit. 9 COVID-19 resurgence support payments scheme 11 COVID-19 RESURGENCE SUPPORT PAYMENTS (CRSP) SCHEME (Clauses 4 – 7, 9 and 11) Summary of proposed amendment This Bill proposes a new one-off support payment in the form of a grant to be paid out to eligible businesses in the event of a resurgence of COVID-19 and an escalation in alert levels. The Bill amends the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from the date of enactment. Key features In the event of the COVID-19 resurgence support payments (CRSP) scheme being activated, following an increase in alert levels, businesses would be able to apply for a grant from Inland Revenue. The Bill contains amendments facilitating the administration of the scheme by Inland Revenue, including: • providing for the scheme to be activated by Order in Council • authorising the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to pay these grants • directing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to determine and publish the eligibility requirements and the terms and conditions for the scheme • noting the circumstances under which the applicant is obligated to repay the grant • noting the records that must be kept by the applicant for the purpose of this scheme, and • allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information related to the CRSP scheme including the names of persons to whom the Commissioner has made a grant. Background The proposed CRSP scheme relates to the Government’s objective to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19. This objective includes protecting jobs and livelihoods as well as strengthening the economy. To support this objective, a suite of financial supports is being put in place for businesses and individuals in the event of further alert level escalations following future resurgences of COVID-19 in the community. The aim of these financial supports is to reduce the risk and impact of resurgences by supporting workers to stay at home when sick and to encourage the support of this by businesses by sharing the cost of increased alert levels. The following describes the features of the CRSP scheme that are not specified in the Bill. The proposed CRSP scheme would be a one-off resurgence support payment which businesses can apply for each time the scheme is activated. The scheme may activate in the 12 event of an increase in alert levels from alert level 1 to alert level 2 or higher, and after remaining at an alert level higher than 1 for seven days or more. The scheme would be available to all businesses in New Zealand. The proposed scheme would not be restricted to a particular region even in the event of a regional increase in alert levels as even a regional public health restriction may impact businesses across the rest of New Zealand. To be eligible to apply for a grant, applicants must have suffered a decline in revenue of 30% or more. This is calculated by comparing a seven-day period at alert level 2 or higher with the typical weekly revenue in the six weeks preceding the move from alert level 1. The payment would comprise a base amount of $1,500 per applicant plus $400 per full-time equivalent 3 (FTE) up to a cap of 50 FTEs. Though the payment is capped at 50 FTEs, businesses with more than 50 FTEs may still apply. Small to medium-sized businesses are the main beneficiaries of this scheme, as reflected by the payment cap, because smaller firms are less resilient to economic shocks than larger businesses. The amount of decline in revenue will also be used to determine the size of the grant the applicant is eligible to receive. The amount of the grant will be the lower of the amount calculated using the formula ($1,500 plus $400 per FTE) and four times the amount the applicant’s revenue has declined by as declared by them for the eligibility criteria. In addition, applicants must have been in business for at least six months. Detailed analysis The Bill proposes to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. The definition of “tax” in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be amended to include an amount payable in relation to the grant made under the CRSP scheme. The amendment would allow Inland Revenue to use its existing debt management and care and management powers to administer the grant. The Bill proposes to add sections 7AAB and 7AAC to the Tax Administration Act 1994. The proposed new section 7AAB authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a grant under the CRSP scheme to an eligible applicant when the scheme has been declared active. The proposed new section outlines: • the main criteria for activating the CRSP scheme – an escalation in alert levels for a week or longer, and • the main eligibility criteria – that the applicant has suffered a significant reduction in revenue as a result of the escalation in alert levels. While the details of these two criteria have not been specified in the Bill, the policies underpinning the scheme are that: • The scheme may be activated when there is an increase in alert level from alert level 1 to alert level 2 or higher, and after remaining at an alert level higher than 1 for seven days or more. 3 This is calculated as 1.0 FTE for employees who work 20 hours or more per week and 0.6 FTE for employees who work less than 20 hours per week. 13 • A reduction in revenue of 30% or more constitutes “a significant reduction in revenue”. This is to be calculated by comparing a seven-day period at alert level 2 or higher with the typical weekly revenue in the six weeks preceding the move from alert level 1. In the event of an increase in alert levels from alert level 1 for seven days or more, the proposed new section 7AAB authorises the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make a grant under the CRSP scheme to an eligible person provided that the CRSP scheme is activated by an Order in Council made under the proposed new section 7AAC. Once the proposed scheme is activated, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue would be required to determine and publish the eligibility criteria and determine the terms and conditions of the scheme. The proposed new section 7AAB also requires the entire amount of the grant, and any amount payable under the CRSP terms such as interest and penalties if any, to be paid back to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under particular circumstances. This would ordinarily be when a person receives the grant despite not meeting the eligibility requirements, or when the recipient of the grant subsequently breach the terms and conditions of the grant. However other circumstances may be specified in the terms and conditions. The proposed new section 7AAB clarifies that the recipient of the grant must keep sufficient records to demonstrate that they meet the eligibility requirements and that they have not breached the terms and conditions. This information keeping requirement extends to the person who applied for the grant on behalf of the recipient. The proposed new section 7AAB also allows for the CRSP scheme to be activated and grants made under this scheme for increases in alert levels prior to the enactment of this Bill. The proposed new section 7AAC allows the scheme to be activated by Order in Council. Such an Order in Council may: • specify the period in which the scheme will operate • describe a class or classes of persons who may apply for support under the scheme • the amount of the grant, and • specify any amendments to the scheme as required. The proposed new section 7AAC also allows the Order in Council to extend, renew, or replace a time limit in relation to the publication of information in relation to the CRSP scheme. The definition of “income tax” in section 157(10) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be amended to include the entire amount of the grant that the recipient has to pay back. In the event that the recipient makes a default in the repayment of the grant to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, the Commissioner is able to pursue the outstanding balance by issuing a notice under section 157. The proposed new clause 13B into schedule 7, Part A, of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publish information relating to the CRSP scheme. Information that the Commissioner intends to publish include the names of the persons to whom the Commissioner makes a grant to under the scheme. However, the Commissioner is limited in the types of information that can be published and the proposed 14 new clause imposes a time limit of 24 months for the information to remain published. This time limit may be extended by Order in Council made under the proposed new section 7AAC on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue. The proposed amendment to section MB 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007 excludes a payment under the CRSP scheme from the calculation of a person’s family scheme income. The rationale behind this is a grant made under the CRSP scheme is for business purposes only. As the grant is not available for private use, it should not be included in calculating a person’s family scheme income. The definition of “exempt interest” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would be amended to include interest payable in relation to the repayment of a grant under the CRSP scheme. This amendment relates to resident withholding tax (RWT) and ensures the grant recipient does not have to deduct RWT on any interest charged by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. 15 Minimum family tax credit threshold 17 MINIMUM FAMILY TAX CREDIT (MFTC) THRESHOLD (Clause 10) Summary of proposed amendment The Bill proposes an adjustment to the minimum family tax credit threshold to align with increases in benefit abatement thresholds. The proposed increase in the MFTC means that single parent families would remain better off in full-time work (defined as 20 hours for sole parents and 30 hours for couples) and are receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on a benefit. Application date The proposed amendment would apply from 1 April 2021. Key features The Bill proposes an increase to the MFTC threshold from $29,432 per year (after tax) to $30,576 per year (after tax). This represents a $22 increase in weekly income. The proposed new MFTC threshold is intended to apply from 1 April 2021. Background The MFTC is one of the Working for Families tax credits. Its purpose is to incentivise families with children to move off the benefit and into full-time work. The MFTC achieves this by “topping up” the incomes of working families to an amount that is more than what they could potentially receive on a benefit. When benefit rates and thresholds are increased, the MFTC must also be adjusted to ensure families continue to be better off in full-time work and receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on the benefit. From 1 April 2021, the benefit abatement thresholds will increase, allowing beneficiaries to earn a greater amount of additional income before their benefits start to reduce. As a consequence of the increase in benefit abatement thresholds, this Bill would increase the MFTC threshold from 1 April 2021 so that single parent families will remain financially better off in full-time work and receiving the MFTC, rather than remaining on the benefit.

This consultation document seeks public feedback on design matters for implementing this proposal. The objective is to introduce the changes as fairly and simply as possible, and public feedback will help achieve that. This document also seeks views on some aspects of the bright-line test for taxing residential property sales. The Government has made clear that none of the proposed changes apply to the family or main home. 1.2 In introducing these changes, the Government’s housing objectives are to: • ensure that every New Zealander has a safe, warm, dry, and affordable home to call their own – whether they are renters or owners • support more sustainable house prices, including by dampening investor demand for existing housing stock, which would improve affordability for first-home buyers, and • create a housing and urban land market that credibly responds to population growth and changing housing preferences, that is competitive and affordable for renters and homeowners, and is well-planned and well-regulated. 1.3 New Zealand has a long-standing housing affordability problem. To address the role of tax in this problem, the Government introduced changes to the taxation of residential property in 2018 and 2019 to make residential property investment less tax advantageous. These measures included lengthening the period of the bright-line test and introducing rules to ring-fence losses on residential investment property. The Government now believes further changes are desirable. 1.4 While the Government is aware that tax is neither the sole cause nor the sole solution to the housing issue, it does contribute to investor demand. This consultation round therefore aims to gather views on design considerations for implementing the announced tax policy proposals in interest limitation. Things to bear in mind 1.5 In developing these rules, the Government must balance several housing, economic and tax policy objectives. Submitters should also consider these in considering the proposals. • Housing affordability The Government wishes to reduce the incentive for non-owner-occupiers to invest in existing residential properties. This will reduce the upward pressure on housing prices. The goal is to make 8 the purchase of residential properties more affordable for potential owner-occupiers. • Housing supply The interest limitation and bright-line extension should not discourage new additions to the stock of housing. • Efficiency The interest limitation measure should not have unintended effects on the efficient allocation of investment. For instance, the measure should not increase after-tax financing costs for other business activities. • Coherence of tax system The rules should reduce opportunities for changes in the timing or form of arrangements and transactions, to alter tax results in ways that could frustrate achieving the housing objectives • Complexity of the tax system The rules should not be unduly complex, so that they raise unnecessary administrative and compliance costs. 1.6 Inevitably it will be necessary to make trade-offs between these objectives. We welcome submissions on the proposed design of the rules for interest limitation and the additional bright-line rules. The proposals 1.7 The housing market is complex with a wide spectrum of owners, with differing levels of complexity, and this discussion document aims to cover the proposals as they relate to all residential property investors. This document has therefore been drafted so that for most owners, it is not necessary to read the entire document, but to go to the chapters relevant to different investors. Individual chapters contain specific questions for submitters to consider. Here is a brief overview of what is covered. The matters described below are explored in more detail in the chapters named. High level outline 1.8 Deductibility of interest expenses incurred by residential property investors will be restricted from 1 October 2021. The amount of the restriction will depend on whether the interest is “grandparented” or not. 1.9 Grandparented interest is interest on debt drawn down before 27 March 2021 relating to residential investment property acquired before 27 March 2021. For grandparented interest, deductions will be gradually phased out between 1 October 2021 and 31 March 2025 as follows: Date interest incurred Percent of interest you can claim 1 April 2020–31 March 2021 100% 1 April 2021–31 March 2022 (transitional year) 1 April 2021 to 30 September 2021 – 100% 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022 – 75% 1 April 2022–31 March 2023 75% 1 April 2023–31 March 2024 50% 1 April 2024–31 March 2025 25% From 1 April 2025 onwards 0% 9 1.10 Non-grandparented interest is interest on debt funding the purchase of a property acquired on or after 27 March 2021, and drawdowns of debt which relate to the ownership or use of residential investment property on or after 27 March 2021. For non-grandparented interest, all deductions will be disallowed from 1 October 2021. 1.11 There will be favourable treatment for property being developed and owners of new build properties (see chapters 6-9). Who will be subject to the rules Chapter 2 - Residential investment property subject to interest limitation 1.12 This chapter aims to establish a shared understanding of the scope of the proposals and the terms used. It sets out the policy objectives of the proposals. This chapter covers the types of residential property subject to the proposed interest limitation rules and outlines issues the Government has identified in defining the types of affected property. It also suggests exclusions from the interest limitation proposal for specific property types. 1.13 In general, the proposals will apply to interest on debt used to purchase or operate residential investment property, which is primarily residential property rented to tenants. 1.14 Among the residential property that are proposed to be excluded are: • Land outside New Zealand • Employee accommodation • Farmland • Care facilities such as hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, and hospices • Commercial accommodation such as hotels, motels, and boarding houses • Retirement villages and rest homes; and • Main home - the interest limitation proposal would not apply to interest related to any income-earning use of an owner-occupier’s main home such as a flatting situation. 1.15 The Government is interested in feedback on these issues in order to better understand the complexities faced in these areas. 1.16 Possible exclusions for certain student accommodation, serviced apartments, and Māori land are also considered. Chapter 3 - Entities affected by interest limitation 1.17 The proposals will affect entities like companies differently from individuals. Companies are generally allowed deductions for interest without needing to 10 trace the use of their borrowed funds. The interest limitation rules will override this general rule for close companies and companies whose assets are primarily (more than 50%) residential investment property so that taxpayers cannot circumvent the interest limitation proposal by using companies to borrow to acquire residential investment property. 1.18 The Government proposes to exempt Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules. If there are other organisations that submitters consider should not be subject to the interest limitation proposal, we invite submitters to provide a description of those organisations’ activities and explain why they consider an exclusion is appropriate. Interest that would be affected Chapter 4 - Interest subject to limitation 1.19 Where a loan is used for a mixture of taxable and non-taxable purposes it is already necessary to trace the funding to each purpose to determine deductibility (unless the borrower is a company). This chapter proposes the same approach for loans used to fund residential investment property. It also covers refinancing an existing loan and transitional issues relating to pre- 27 March debt. The aim is to have fair and consistent results, taking into account the Government’s overall objectives, and to minimise administrative and compliance costs. Chapter 5 - Disposals of property subject to interest limitation 1.20 This chapter considers whether interest deductions should be allowed in some cases when a property is sold. Specifically, the chapter considers whether a property owner can get a deduction for interest when they sell the property (for example when the property is subject to tax on sale due to the bright-line test). It also considers the interaction of any deduction with the bright-line test and rental loss ring-fencing rule. Exemptions Chapter 6 - Property development and related activities 1.21 The Government has decided that property developers should be exempt from the proposed interest limitation rules. This supports the policy objective of increasing housing supply through the construction of new builds. This chapter considers the definition of “development” and the scope of the development exemption. It also considers options for applying the exemption to one-off developments as well as to professional developers. It discusses whether some remediation work may qualify for the development exemption where it adds to the housing stock, for example by extending the life of older buildings or making a building habitable. Chapter 7 - Definition of “new build” 1.22 The Government has decided that “new- build” residential properties should be exempted from the proposed new interest limitation rules and subject to a 11 five-year bright-line test (rather than a ten-year test). Chapter 7 suggests property could be considered a “new build” when: • a dwelling is added to vacant land • an additional dwelling is added to a property, whether stand-alone or attached • a dwelling (or multiple dwellings) replaces an existing dwelling • renovating an existing dwelling to create two or more dwellings. • a dwelling converted from commercial premises such as an office block converted into apartments. Chapter 8 - New build – exemption from interest limitation 1.23 This chapter sets out the proposed design of the new build exemption from the interest limitation rules (the new build exemption), including for how long the exemption should apply to early owners. It proposes that early owners (those who acquire a new build no later than 12 months after its Code Compliance Certificate (CCC) is issued, or add a new build to their land) would be eligible for the new build exemption. This chapter also asks whether subsequent purchasers (those who acquire a new build more than 12 months after the new build’s CCC is issued and within a fixed period such as 10 or 20 years from the date that CCC is issued) should qualify for the exemption. Chapter 9 - Five-year bright-line test for new builds 1.24 Owners of new builds would be subject to a five-year bright-line period rather than the extended ten-year period. This chapter discusses what the new build bright-line test is and who it applies to. Chapter 10 - Rollovers – bright-line test and interest limitation 1.25 This chapter proposes some limited relief from the interest limitation rule and bright-line test in relation to transfers to trusts and transfers where there is no significant change in ownership. This relief involves deferring the taxing point until there is a future disposal of the property that does not qualify for rollover relief. This chapter proposes some limited rollovers to deal with transfers to trusts and transfers where there is no significant change in ownership. It is relevant for both the interest limitation rule and bright-line test. Technical issues Chapter 11 - Interposed entities 1.26 Under current law, taxpayers are normally allowed to deduct interest on loans used to acquire shares in a company. This chapter proposes interposed entity rules to ensure that taxpayers cannot claim interest deductions for borrowings used to acquire residential investment property indirectly, through an interposed entity. 12 Chapter 12 - Implications for rental loss ring-fencing rules 1.27 Ring-fencing rules restrict rental loss expenses that can be claimed against residential property income. This restricts the tax benefits of residential property investments. The interest limitation rules will further reduce these benefits. There is likely to be significant interplay between the proposed interest limitation rules and the existing ring-fencing rules. 1.28 This chapter discusses the overlap between the ring-fencing rules and the proposed interest limitation rules and the technical issues that are likely to arise. Chapter 13 - Effect on property subject to tax under the mixed-use asset rules 1.29 The focus of the interest limitation rules is on debt relating to residential investment property, but they will also apply to baches and other second homes if used to earn income. This chapter considers how the proposal will be coordinated with the existing MUA rules. Chapter 14 - Compliance and administration 1.30 This chapter considers the administrative aspects of the interest limitation rule and bright-line extension. It outlines the proposed approach to administering these changes in terms of making the rules work, ensuring compliance, and informing Government about appropriate targeting and effectiveness.

It first outlines how the Government’s stated objectives can be used to provide a broad roadmap to inform the scope of property. The chapter then discusses the appropriateness of existing definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA). It also outlines various issues the Government has identified in defining the scope of affected property and seeks feedback on these. 2.2 An exemption from the interest limitation rule is proposed for interest on loans relating to new builds. What constitutes a new build is covered in chapter 7. Policy objectives and broad scope 2.3 As a starting point, the Government’s intention is for the proposals to cover property that is commonly and foreseeably used to provide residential accommodation on a long-term basis. 2.4 In line with the Government’s objective to tilt the playing field away from property investors and towards first home buyers, the scope of the proposed new rules can be further refined to types of property that could be used as a private owner-occupied residence. 2.5 The Government considers that the proposed rules should be restricted to property located in New Zealand on the basis that investments in properties outside New Zealand have no direct impact on New Zealand housing. 2.6 In-scope residential property would include property in use as long-term residential accommodation (such as residential rental property covered by the Residential Tenancies Act 1986) or property that is easily substitutable for long-term residential accommodation (such as homes converted into short-stay accommodation – commonly advertised on digital platforms). At the simplest level, it should include a house or apartment, regardless of whether it is used to provide long-term or short-stay accommodation. Income tax should not play a role in determining whether a given property is used to provide long-term rental accommodation or short-stay accommodation. 2.7 Given the scope outlined above, commercial properties that are not set up to provide accommodation (for example, office buildings and shops) are not intended to be covered by the proposed interest limitation rule. 2.8 However, there are commercial properties that are used to provide accommodation. Commercial accommodation can take a variety of forms, and each category should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 15 2.9 In some cases, the provision of accommodation is related but ancillary to another function of the property (for example, a hospital or hospice). The Government considers that in most cases, these types of properties should not be impacted. This is because while stays in such properties could be long-term, they are generally not substitutable for an owner-occupied property. 2.10 In other cases, the provision of accommodation is the core function of the property or business. Properties used to provide accommodation on a commercial basis can take a variety of forms, of which some cannot easily be made suitable for owner-occupation (for example, a hotel or motel) and some could more easily be used or converted this purpose (for example, short-stay accommodation in what could otherwise be a regular residential home). 2.11 In determining whether a property in this category should be within scope of the interest limitation rule, the Government’s key consideration is whether the property is of a type that would normally be available for owner-occupiers. If a property is not of a type that is generally available for owner-occupation or easily convertible to owner-occupation, there is a greater argument for exclusion. 2.12 The Government has identified the following relevant factors as a guideline to help determine whether a property type is generally suitable for owner- occupation: • Regulatory framework and population: is the property subject to a specific regulatory framework? Are there well-defined rules about who can reside in the accommodation and is this limited to a certain sector of the population? Are wraparound services mandated? For example, section 5 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 provides that the Act does not apply to specific types of student accommodation or retirement village accommodation. • Physical structure and configuration: are the accommodation units configured in such a way that they could be occupied by a private owner- occupier as a stand-alone dwelling unit? • Unconditional occupation: can a person occupy the residence indefinitely, or is their occupation conditional on factors other than a tenancy (for example, holding a particular position such as employment)? • Incentive for, and barriers to, conversion: would exclusion of a particular category incentivise and enable the conversion of existing residential property into this type of accommodation? What are the barriers to this conversion process? For example, is the existence of a regulatory framework, as described above, a significant barrier to conversion? Where there are multiple accommodation units on a single title, could they be converted with relative ease to separate titles? 2.13 It is anticipated that most property types carved out will meet some of these factors but not others. In developing a final set of criteria, the Government’s decision making will be informed by a balance of these factors, rather than whether a type of property meets or does not meet any given factor. 16 Proposed approach 2.14 Given the scope outlined above, the Government considers that existing definitions used in the ITA provide a reasonable basis for developing the scope of the proposed rules – in particular, definitions used for the purposes of the bright-line test and the residential ring-fencing rules. Broadly, these definitions cover land which is, is planned to be, or could be used for residential accommodation. 2.15 There are a number of areas where the Government is considering modifications or departures from existing definitions to support the intent of the interest limitation rules. These areas are discussed in the next section: Issues for further discussion. 2.16 This section sets out the relevant existing definitions and describes their features. It also covers aspects of existing definitions that would align with the Government’s stated intent, and changes that may be appropriate. Key definitions in the Income Tax Act 2007 2.17 The key definitions for the bright-line test are the definitions of “residential land” and “dwelling” in section YA 1 of the ITA. 1 Related definitions include the definitions of “farmland”, “business premises”, and “main home” in section YA 1. The definitions of “residential land” and “dwelling” were updated by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2021–22, Feasibility Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2021. 2.18 These definitions are provided in this section for reference and discussion: Residential land (a) means— (i) land that has a dwelling on it, unless the land is farmland, or is used predominantly as business premises: (ii) land for which the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling, unless the land is farmland or is used predominantly as business premises: (iii) bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under rules in the relevant operative district plan, unless the bare land is farmland or is used predominantly as business premises; and (b) includes land that has a dwelling on it, if it is used by a person predominantly as business premises for a business of supplying accommodation and the dwelling is not a main home for the person or 1 or more other persons referred to in section CB 16A(2) (Main home exclusion for disposal within 10 years). 1 Note that definition of “dwelling” used for income tax purposes differs to that used for GST purposes as the two regimes apply for different purposes. 17 Dwelling (a) means any place configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is used as a place of residence or abode, including any appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with the place: (ab) despite paragraph (a), for the purposes of subpart EE and the definitions of commercial building, commercial fit-out, and residential building, means any place used predominantly as a place of residence or abode, including any appurtenances belonging to or enjoyed with the place: (b) does not include any of the following, in whole or part: (i) a hospital: (ii) a hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse: (iii) a serviced apartment for which paid services in addition to the supply of accommodation are provided to a resident, and in relation to which a resident does not have quiet enjoyment, as that term is used in section 38 of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986: (iv) a convalescent home, nursing home, or hospice: (v) a rest home or retirement village, except to the extent that, in relation to a relevant place, it is, or can reasonably be foreseen to be, occupied as a person’s principal place of residence for independent living: (vi) a camping ground: (c) despite paragraph (b)(iii) and (v), for the purposes of section CB 16A (Main home exclusion for disposal within 5 years) and the definition of residential land— (i) includes a serviced apartment described in paragraph (b)(iii): (ii) does not include, in whole or part, a rest home or retirement village Business premises (a) means the normal business premises or a temporary workplace of the person (or an associate): (b) does not include premises or a workplace established mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment Farmland means land that— (a) is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the land’s owner: (b) because of its area and nature, is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business Main home means, for a person, the 1 dwelling— (a) that is used as a residence by the person (a home); and (b) with which the person has the greatest connection, if they have more than one home 18 Land in New Zealand 2.19 While the bright-line test applies to worldwide property, the Government proposes to restrict the application of the interest limitation rules to properties located in New Zealand. It proposes to exclude foreign properties on the basis that New Zealanders investing in properties outside New Zealand do not have a direct impact on the New Zealand housing market. Residential land 2.20 “Residential land” is land which has a dwelling on it, on which a dwelling is being or intended to be erected, or which is bare land that could be used for erecting a dwelling. This is captured by the definition in paragraph (a). This seems appropriate for the interest limitation rule. 2.21 Note that the definition of “residential land” hinges on the definition of “dwelling”, which is discussed from paragraph 2.34 onwards. 2.22 The definition of “residential land” means that a piece of land can be residential land if there is a dwelling on the land, even if there are other buildings on the land that are not dwellings. However, there are carveouts for farmland and business premises. Farmland 2.23 Farmland is carved out of the definition of “residential land”. “Farmland” is defined as land that is being worked in the farming or agricultural business of the land’s owner, or which is capable of being worked as a farming or agricultural business. Farmland with a dwelling on it is still farmland and therefore excluded, even where the dwelling is used to provide accommodation – either to employees or a third party. 2.24 The Government does not intend that the interest limitation rules would impact interest deductions that are taken in relation to a farming business for the provision of employee accommodation. The Government therefore considers that it would be appropriate to for farmland to be similarly carved out from the scope of the interest limitation proposal. The Government seeks submissions on whether the existing definition of “farmland” is appropriate for the interest limitation rules. 2.25 There are potential issues where the employee accommodation is on a separate piece of land to the farmland. This issue is discussed in the section titled Issues for further discussion. Business premises 2.26 The definition of “residential land” also excludes a piece of land that is predominantly used as business premises. 2 This is important as otherwise the existence of a dwelling on a piece of land would characterise the whole piece 2 Note that while providing long-term rental accommodation can potentially constitute a business, the rental properties are unlikely constitute business premises. 19 of land as residential land, even where there are also commercial premises on the land. 2.27 Dual-purpose buildings are found in many towns and cities around New Zealand, for example, a building where there is a shop on the ground floor and one or more floors containing apartments above. Sometimes the different parts of these buildings might be on separate titles, or they could be on one single title. 2.28 The business premises exclusion is relevant where the dual-purpose building is on a single title. It is also relevant where a residential property has been converted to business premises but still meets the definition of a “dwelling”. It is not relevant where the commercial (non-accommodation) part of a building is on one title and the residential accommodation part is on a separate title. 2.29 The business premises exclusion operates on all-or-nothing basis by looking at the different uses of the property on a time and space basis (for example, floor area). The requirement of predominant use is effectively a “more than 50%” test. Residential land with greater than 50% of area used as business premises is carved out, while a building with 50% or less area used as business premises is residential land. This approach minimises compliance costs by providing a simple test for dual-purpose buildings. 2.30 If this carveout is adopted in the context of the interest limitation rule, there may be concerns about interest deductions being denied in respect of an office or shop space on the same title as residential accommodation. For example, if the office or shop accounted for 25% of the land, no interest deductions would be available at all. 2.31 The Government considers that a business premises exclusion would be appropriate for the proposed interest limitation rule, particularly given the prevalence of dual-purpose buildings around New Zealand. However, the all- or-nothing approach used for the bright-line test may not be appropriate for interest limitation and these concerns are considered in the next section titled Issues for further discussion. 2.32 Paragraph (b) of the definition of residential land disqualifies a dwelling used to provide certain types of short-stay accommodation from the business premises exclusion. Where short-stay accommodation is provided in a dwelling that is business premises, the exclusion from “residential land” is only available where the residential land is also the owner’s main home (for example, a traditional bed and breakfast where the owner lives on site). 2.33 Similar treatment is proposed for the interest limitation rules. The underlying policy rationale is equally applicable in the context of the interest limitation rules – the Government considers it important that where a residential property could be used to provide long-term rental accommodation, the income tax treatment is the same whether the property is used to provide long-term rental accommodation or short-stay accommodation. Any income tax advantage provided for properties used for short-stay accommodation could reduce effective housing supply. 20 Dwelling 2.34 A “dwelling”, for the purposes of the bright-line test, is defined in paragraph (a) as a place configured as a residence or abode, whether or not it is used as such, and includes any appurtenances (that is, assets that are attached to and used as part of the dwelling). 2.35 The carveouts in paragraph (b) are broadly intended to cover housing units that serve purposes other than long-term residential accommodation – including commercial short-term housing such as hotels and motels, care facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes, and retirement villages. Since the bulk of property being carved out is not substitutable for private owner occupation and any long-term accommodation in the facility is incidental, or ancillary to the provision of other services, the Government considers that most of these carveouts could readily be imported into the interest limitation regime. 2.36 Under the previous formulation in paragraph (a) of the definition of “dwelling”, which focused on use as a residence or abode, these carveouts put beyond doubt that these facilities are not included, even though in some situations, they could be used by a person for longer-term accommodation; for example, emergency housing can be provided by hotels and motels. Under the current formulation of (a), many of these facilities would not meet the requirement of configuration as a place of residence or abode in any event, but again, the carveouts in (b) provide certainty. Configuration as a residence or abode 2.37 The reference to configuration in paragraph (a) ensures that unoccupied residential properties (vacant or so-called “ghost” houses) and typical residential properties used solely to provide short-stay accommodation are captured. The amended definition removes any potential ambiguity in relation to baches and holiday homes that are rented out occasionally. 2.38 The Government considers it appropriate that these kinds of dwellings are within the interest limitation rules. The rationale in paragraphs 2.32 and 2.33 applies here too. Care facilities 2.39 Subparagraphs (b)(i) and (iv) carve out accommodation in the context of medical care: hospitals, convalescent homes, nursing homes, and hospices. These forms of accommodation are specifically intended for patients and those in need of care, and are easy to distinguish from housing typically available as a private residence for owner-occupiers. 2.40 The Government considers that the carveouts for these forms of accommodation are appropriate in the context of interest limitation. 21 Commercial accommodation 2.41 Subparagraphs (b)(ii) and (vi) in the definition of dwelling carve out specific types of commercial accommodation (that is, hotels, motels, inns, hostels, boardinghouses, and camping grounds) from the definition of a dwelling. 2.42 These forms of accommodation are designed predominantly for short-term use on a commercial basis, often at scale. They are straight-forward to distinguish from properties that could be a private owner-occupied residence. 2.43 The Government does not intend that such properties are within scope. While there may be instances where commercial short-term accommodation providers are used to provide long-term accommodation (for example, a motel used to provide emergency housing), this is not their main function and they do not generally compete with long-term residential housing. Serviced apartments 2.44 Serviced apartments provide long-term or short-term accommodation, with amenities provided for use. These apartments are carved out of the definition of “dwelling” by subparagraph (b)(iii) for the purposes of certain tax rules relating to commercial buildings (for example, the commercial fit-out depreciation rules). However, such apartments are brought back into the “definition” of dwelling specifically for the purposes of the bright-line test (subparagraph (c)(i)). 2.45 These units have physical characteristics shared by both hotel rooms and residential apartments, and can resemble either. Unlike hotels, it is not straight- forward to distinguish them from properties typically suitable for owner- occupation. This issue is discussed in more detail in the next section Issues for further discussion. Retirement villages and rest homes 2.46 Subparagraph (c)(ii) carves out retirement villages and rest homes from the definition of “dwelling” for the purposes of the bright-line test. Retirement villages are defined in the Retirement Villages Act 2003 as premises containing 2 or more residential units that provide, or are intended to provide, residential accommodation together with services or facilities, or both, predominantly for persons in their retirement. The Health and Disability Services (Safety) Act 2001 considers rest home care to be services provided on premises principally held out as “a residence for people who are frail because of their age”. Both retirement villages and rest homes are subject to regulatory frameworks set out in the above Acts. 2.47 The Government proposes to exclude retirement villages and rest homes from the proposed interest limitation rules. Income derived from a main home 2.48 Generally, an owner-occupier of a residential property cannot claim a deduction for interest on loans relating to that property, since there is no nexus 22 (or connection) between the interest expense and the homeowner’s income earning process or due to the inability to deduct private expenditure. 2.49 However, an owner-occupied dwelling can be used to derive income while also being the owner’s home. For example, a homeowner may receive income from renting out part of their home to a flatmate, a private boarder, or a short- stay guest. 2.50 All of these types of rental income are taxable, but the person can deduct their actual costs related to earning this rental income to reduce the income tax they need to pay. This includes a portion of the interest on their home loan, using existing rules on apportionment. This is called the actual-cost method. 2.51 Slightly different rules apply where someone has private boarders or provides short-stay accommodation to a paying guest in their main home. 3 As an alternative to the actual-cost method outlined above, there are simplified rules that may be available, known as the standard-cost method. If this method is used, standard costs are determined by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, reflecting the likely average costs incurred by hosts of private boarders or those providing short-stay accommodation in their home. Income below the set standard cost does not need to be included in a person’s income tax return. Some standard costs factor in a portion of home loan interest. 2.52 The Government considers that it would be appropriate to continue to permit interest deductions to be taken where a homeowner rents out a room (or rooms) in their main home to flatmates, private boarders, or as short-stay accommodation. These arrangements fall outside of the scope of the Government’s objectives for the proposed interest limitation rules. Some first- home buyers may rent out a room in their main home to help with servicing their mortgage. Denying interest in these situations would not further the policy objective of making home ownership more affordable. Allowing interest deductions in these situations may assist in mitigating under-utilisation of owner-occupied property, as it would not discourage homeowners from taking on flatmates. 2.53 This means the current rules on allowable interest deductions would continue to apply in these situations. When using the actual-cost method, the homeowner would continue to be able to deduct the appropriate portion of mortgage interest. Similarly, if the homeowner uses the standard-cost method, the homeowner’s “standard costs” would continue to factor in financing costs. 2.54 However, the proposed interest limitation rules would apply where a property owner rents out a separate dwelling that is not part of their home but is on the same land as their main home (for example, a self-contained flat or a cottage). 2.55 This proposal would rely on the existing definition of main home as replicated above. 3 Private boarders are different to flatmates. When private boarders rent rooms in a house, part of the rent they pay is for services. These are services like regular meals or laundry. A common example of a private boarder is a home- stay student staying with a host family in their home. 23 2.56 A further issue relates to where there is a change of use from the owner’s main home during the phase-out period for properties acquired before 27 March 2021. This is discussed in the next section: Issues for further discussion. Issues for further discussion 2.57 This section discusses potential limitations of using the bright-line test definitions in the context of the proposed interest limitation rules. Some of these issues have been raised elsewhere in this chapter. 2.58 There are places where the objectives of the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rules differ, so the Government is considering whether the carveouts in the interest limitation rules should align fully or differ in certain respects from those used for the bright-line test. 2.59 The main areas identified in this section are: • Change of use from a main home during the phase-out period (paragraphs 2.61 to 2.63) • The business premises exclusion, particularly in relation to dual-purpose buildings on a single title (paragraphs 2.64 to 2.69) • Employee accommodation (paragraphs 2.70 to 2.74) • Student accommodation (paragraphs 2.75 to 2.79) • Short-stay accommodation in a place that is not typically suitable for owner occupation (paragraphs 2.80 to 2.82) • Serviced apartments (paragraphs 2.83 to 2.86) • Māori land, particularly in the context of papakāinga housing (paragraphs 2.87 to 2.96). 2.60 The Government is interested in feedback on these issues and better understanding the issues and complexities faced in these areas. Change of use from main home during the phase-out period for properties acquired before 27 March 2021 2.61 It is proposed that interest deductions in respect of residential property acquired on or after 27 March 2021 would not be allowed from 1 October 2021. Interest on loans for property acquired before 27 March 2021 would still be able to be claimed as a deductible expense, but would be phased out over four income years. Further discussion on the proposed phase-out can be found in chapter 1. 2.62 Whether interest deductions are fully denied from 1 October 2021 or are phased out hinges on when the property was acquired, not its use as at 27 March 2021. As such, the phase-out will apply where a property was acquired before 27 March 2021, is used as the owner’s main home on or after 27 March 2021, and the property subsequently becomes a rental property (for 24 either long-term or short-stay accommodation) during the phase-out period. The Government considers that this is appropriate. 2.63 Where a property is converted to business premises (excluding for the provision of short-stay accommodation), interest deductibility on an ongoing basis beyond the phase-out period would be provided in one of two ways. If it is still configured as a dwelling, the business premises exclusion would apply (presuming predominant use as business premises). If the conversion process is extensive and, as such, the property is no longer configured as a residence or abode, it would fall outside the scope of the interest limitation rules altogether. Example 1: Change of use during phase-out period Katie acquired her main home in 2017 and lives in it until she permanently moves to a different city for a new job at the end of September 2022. She rents out her property from 1 October 2022. Katie is charged $1,250 interest each month on her mortgage, or $7,500 every 6 months. Katie has a standard balance date, ending 31 March. Katie cannot claim any interest for the 2021–22 income year as it was her main home for the full year. For the 2022–23 income year Katie claims a deduction of $5,625 interest (being 75% of $7,500 for the 6-month period of 1 October 2022 to 31 March 2023). For the 2023–24 income year she claims $7,500 interest charged as an expense (50% of $15,000). In the 2024–25 income year she claims $3,750 (25% of $15,000). From the 2025–26 income year onwards Katie is no longer able to claim any interest against her rental income. Business premises and dual-purpose buildings on the same title 2.64 As mentioned in paragraph 2.26, the existing definition of “residential land” excludes land that is predominantly used as business premises. As such, where there are multiple buildings or dual-purpose buildings on the same title there will be a question about what the land is predominantly used for. 2.65 This business premises carveout from “residential land” for the bright-line test operates on an all-or-nothing basis based on predominant use (effectively a “more than 50%” test). This test is intended to minimise compliance costs for dual-purpose buildings where the different parts are on a single legal title. If the business premises are more than 50% of the total residential land, it is fully excluded; if not, it is fully included. 2.66 In the context of the proposed interest limitation rules, this approach would mean either all interest deductions are allowed or all interest deductions are denied. This could lead to some harsh results, where a few square metres could result in all interest deductions being denied, or interest deductions in relation to residential property being inappropriately provided. 25 Example 2: Dual purpose buildings under “predominant use” business premises carveout Tāmati owns a two-story building with mixed residential and commercial use. The ground floor is a clothing store and the upper storey is rented out as long- term residential accommodation. The ground floor is on one title and the upper storey is on a separate title. The ground floor is not land with a dwelling on it and is therefore out of scope of the proposed interest limitation rules. Tāmati would be permitted to claim interest deductions in relation to the ground floor. However, he would not be able to claim interest deductions in relation to the apartment on the upper storey as this is land with a dwelling on it. David owns a similar building next door with mixed residential and commercial use. However, the whole building is on a single title. He rents the ground floor to a fish-and- chip shop, while the upper storey is an apartment which David rents out separately. Under the rules for apportionment, the ground floor for the fish and chip shop accounts for 45% and the upper storey 55%. As the business premises exclusion for the bright-line test requires that the land be used “predominantly” for business purposes, the land does not meet the requirements for the carveout. David would not be able to claim any interest deductions if the same predominant use test were adopted for interest limitation. Next door, Yumei owns a similar two-storey building with mixed use. Her ground floor is rented by a real estate agency as their office, while the upper storey is again an apartment which she rents out. However, in Yumei’s building, the real estate agency office accounts for 55%, with the apartment only accounting for 45%. The land would qualify as business premises under a predominant use test and Yumei would be able to claim all of her interest expense as deductions. 2.67 The Government is interested in receiving feedback on whether an apportionment calculation allowing for interest deductions in relation to the business premises of a dual-purpose building may be preferable over the all- or-nothing approach. 2.68 The current law already contains rules regarding apportionment, which generally focus on time and space. The Government’s starting position is to follow general principles used in income tax law for apportionment but would be interested in feedback on other feasible methods of apportionment. 2.69 There is an additional issue of whether a specific definition of “business premises” would be required for the purposes of the interest limitation regime. The term is already defined in section DD 11 of the ITA for the purposes of entertainment expenditure and the land sales provisions. In addition, the exclusion from the land sale rules in section CB 19 of the ITA contains additional requirements. DD 11 Some definitions \[...\] business premises— (a) means the normal business premises or a temporary workplace of the person (or an associate): (b) does not include premises or a workplace established mainly for the purpose of enjoying entertainment. 26 CB 19 Business exclusion from sections CB 6 to CB 11 Exclusion (1) Sections CB 6 to CB 11 do not apply to a disposal of land by a person (person A) if — (a) the land is the premises of a business; and (b) person A acquired and occupied, or erected and occupied, the premises mainly to carry on a substantial business from them.... Meaning of land (3) In this section, land includes land that— (a) is reserved, with the premises, for the use of the business; and (b) is of an area no greater than that required for the reasonable occupation of the premises and the carrying on of the business. Questions for submitters • Would an all-or-nothing predominant use approach for business premises used by the bright-line test appropriate for interest limitation, or would an apportionment approach be more suitable? • How could an apportionment approach work? − Should it follow general tax principles, or is there another approach that might be more appropriate? − Are there any apportionment calculations regularly done by landowners for other purposes (for example, insurance and mortgages) that might be useful in this context? • How might “business premises” be defined for the purpose of interest limitation? − To what extent is it possible to reuse the definitions outlined above for this purpose? What issues might this cause? Employee accommodation 2.70 Some types of employee accommodation may already be implicitly excluded from the scope of the interest limitation rules, based on the Government’s proposal to use existing definitions as a starting point. Where employee accommodation is provided on farmland, the accommodation would be excluded. Where employee accommodation is on land that would qualify for an all-or-nothing business premises exclusion, the employee accommodation would also be excluded. 2.71 However, the employee accommodation may not always be on the same land as the farmland or business premises. 27 2.72 For this reason, the Government considers employee accommodation to be a separate category that may warrant further analysis. Businesses provide employee accommodation for any number of reasons. In some instances, the accommodation could be specifically designed to suit the needs of the business, while in other cases, the business may simply acquire standard residential property for the provision of employee accommodation. 2.73 Employee accommodation is not generally substitutable for owner-occupied housing and would not compete with regular residential property, placing it outside the scope of the Government’s objectives. While sometimes the employee accommodation could be suitable for owner-occupiers, it may not be practicable to accurately distinguish between different types of employee accommodation based on structural characteristics without creating complexity and compliance costs. 2.74 For this reason, the Government proposes a carveout for all employee accommodation, with satisfactory integrity measures to minimise the potential for abuse. The residential ring-fencing rules contain a specific carveout for employee accommodation in section EL 13 of the ITA. The Government is interested in feedback on whether this would be an appropriate starting point for designing a carveout for employee accommodation under the proposed interest limitation rules and what other integrity issues may need to be considered. EL 13 Exclusion for property provided as employee accommodation Accommodation connected with employment or service (1) Section EL 4 does not apply to residential land of a person that is property that a person provides to their employees or other workers for accommodation in connection with their employment or service. Associated employees or workers (2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the employees or other workers are associated with the person, unless it is necessary for the person to provide the accommodation because of the nature or remoteness of a business carried on by them. Questions for submitters • Should a carveout for employee accommodation be provided under the interest limitation rules? • Does the employee accommodation carveout in the residential ring- fencing rules provide a useful basis for an interest limitation carveout? Can you see any issues with using these rules? • What integrity issues might arise from carving out employee accommodation, and how could these be mitigated? 28 Student accommodation 2.75 The Government is also considering a carveout for purpose-built student accommodation (for example, halls of residence). These residential buildings do not compete with owner-occupied accommodation and would not typically be set up in a way that would be conducive to owner-occupation. This category of accommodation is not connected with the Government’s objective of tilting the playing field toward owner-occupiers. 2.76 Depending on the facts and circumstances, student accommodation could be covered under the existing carveout for hostels in the definition of a dwelling (paragraph (b)(ii)). Therefore, in some situations, a carveout may not actually be required. 2.77 However, the Government considers that certainty could be provided with a specific carveout for specified types of student accommodation. 2.78 A potential carveout for student accommodation could be based on the requirements in sections 5(1)(h) and 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, reproduced below: Section 5(1)(h) (1) This Act shall not apply in the following cases: \[...\] (h) where the premises are used to provide accommodation to students— (i) at a school hostel (being a hostel within the meaning of section 10(1) of the Education and Training Act 2020); or (ii) in accordance with the requirements of section 5B: Section 5B (1) For the purposes of section 5(1)(h)(ii), this Act does not apply to premises if— (a) the premises are used to provide accommodation exclusively for students of 1 or more tertiary education providers; and (b) the premises are owned or operated by a person (an accommodation provider) who is— (i) a tertiary education provider; or (ii) a person who has entered into a written agreement of the kind described in subsection (5) with each tertiary education provider whose students are accommodated at the premises; and (c) the accommodation provider complies with subsections (2) to (4). (2) The accommodation provider must provide services to the students accommodated in the premises that are over and above the services that a landlord must provide under Part 2 or 2A. 29 (3) The accommodation provider must have in place house rules that aim to create an environment that fosters personal development and encourages a sense of community and association with fellow students. (4) The accommodation provider must take all reasonable steps to ensure that prospective and current student tenants are made aware of, and have access to copies of, the house rules. (5) An agreement referred to in subsection (1)(b) is one that sets out— (a) the rights and obligations of the accommodation provider and the tertiary education provider; and (b) a dispute resolution process by which disputes between the accommodation provider and the tertiary education provider may be resolved. (6) In this section, tertiary education provider has the same meaning as in section 10(1) of the Education and Training Act 2020. 2.79 By linking into an existing regulatory framework, the risk of abuse is reduced and appropriately targets the carveout. Additionally, it reduces concerns about whether a carveout could create an incentive to convert residential apartment buildings into student accommodation. Questions for submitters • Should a specific carveout for student accommodation be provided? Is it necessary? • Are there any issues with using the regulatory framework in sections 5(1)(h) and 5B of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986 as a basis for this carveout? • Could a carveout encourage the conversion of regular residential rental properties into student accommodation? How could this risk be mitigated? Short-stay accommodation substitutability issues 2.80 The general intent is for both long-term residential accommodation and property that is easily substitutable for long-term residential accommodation to be included in the scope of the interest limitation rules. This covers standard housing that is neither owner-occupied nor rented on a long-term basis, but instead is used to provide short-stay accommodation. However, there are certain types of short-stay accommodation that are neither traditional commercial accommodation covered by the legislated carveouts (for example, a hotel or motel) nor a standard residential property (for example, a house or apartment). 2.81 Where such places cannot be refitted into houses suitable for residential living (for instance, if there is not enough space to install the necessary amenities), 30 they are not suitable for long-term habitation and may not therefore be considered substitutable with property available to owner-occupiers. As such, they arguably fall outside the intended scope of the interest limitation regime. 2.82 The Government is interested in submissions on whether a specific carveout could be designed in such a way as to distinguish this type of short-stay accommodation from short-stay accommodation provided in a traditional house or apartment that could be suitable for private owner occupation. In some cases, these properties would not satisfy the legal definition of dwelling and a carveout would simply provide additional certainty. Questions for submitters • Should short-stay accommodation that is not substitutable for long- term accommodation be carved out from the interest limitation rules and why? • How could this carveout be designed to avoid capturing short-stay accommodation that could be substitutable for owner-occupied housing? • How could this carveout be designed to prevent short-stay accommodation that is substitutable for owner-occupied housing from being converted so that it is not substitutable? • How could a carveout be designed to reflect a sense of commercial scale akin to a hotel or motel? Serviced apartments 2.83 The exclusion of serviced apartments from the definition of dwelling in the ITA was originally introduced for the purposes of depreciation of commercial fitout. Serviced apartments are specifically carved back in for the bright-line test. 2.84 In some situations, a serviced apartment may be more akin to a hotel, but in others, the physical structure may mean that it is more like a residential apartment building. 2.85 The Government is concerned that a carveout allowing owners of serviced apartments to claim interest deductions may lead to the conversion of regular apartments into serviced apartments, which would reduce effective housing supply. This would be counter to the Government’s intent and stated objectives. 2.86 The Government is interested in exploring whether a carveout for serviced apartments that more closely resemble hotels might be warranted, and how such a carveout might be constructed to prevent standard residential apartments from being converted into serviced apartments. 31 Māori collectively-owned land 2.87 The Crown has an obligation under the principles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi/ the Treaty of Waitangi to understand the impact of proposed policy changes on Māori and balance the consideration of any impacts for Māori with broader public policy objectives, including the Government’s stated housing objectives outlined in paragraph 1.2 of this discussion document. 2.88 The Government is considering issues that relate to Māori freehold land and Māori customary land (Māori land). These issues extend to general title land collectively owned by Māori used to provide residential rental accommodation, either to whānau or the general public. Māori collectively- owned land cannot generally be bought and sold, and in most instances would not be considered residential land if it does not have a dwelling on it or is not bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under rules in the relevant operative district plan. 2.89 The Government acknowledges that using concepts from the bright-line test could result in Māori land being impacted by the proposed interest limitation rules. 2.90 The Government notes that rental income derived (and interest expenses incurred) through a registered charity (registered under the Charities Act 2005) should not give rise to tax implications arising under the proposed interest limitation rules, given the tax exemption that applies to these entities. Therefore, this section is mainly relevant where a different taxpaying structure is used – for example, a company or trust, whether or not it is a Māori authority. Papakāinga housing 2.91 The Government is interested in understanding the potential impact on papakāinga housing, which can include both rental accommodation and “owner-occupied” accommodation,4 sited on Māori land or general title land. Particularly on Māori land, papakāinga housing does not compete with general owner-occupied housing and a carveout may be appropriate. 2.92 The aims of papakāinga housing include providing whānau with quality affordable housing and promoting Māori community development. Papakāinga housing therefore plays an important role in supporting and fostering cultural identity and financial stability. The Government is considering how the interest limitation rules can be designed to not hinder this. 2.93 A carveout would not be required for owner-occupied papakāinga due to existing rules that do not permit interest deductions to be taken against personal income, like salary and wages. The interest limitation rules would not change this current treatment. 4 Owner-occupied papakāinga on Māori land is not actually transferred to the individual, but instead they are provided an occupation order (through the Māori Land Court) and they simply own the dwelling on the land. Where an occupation order is not required, a licence to occupy is generally provided by the relevant land trust. 32 2.94 However, where the papakāinga housing is rented out, there may be interest expenditure which relates to the acquisition or construction of the papakāinga development. The interest limitation rules could therefore impact the ability to deduct interest expenses from the relevant rental income for income tax purposes. 2.95 The Government seeks comment on the issues related to kaumātua rental housing and financing structures used to support kaumātua in this way. Papakāinga housing is not necessarily age restricted, but a papakāinga development may include specific housing set aside for kaumātua. Alternatively, kaumātua housing may be separate to a papakāinga development and includes legacy housing stock. The objectives of kaumātua housing go beyond the simple provision of housing and acknowledge the important role elders have in society. Therefore, specific consideration is being given to kaumātua housing. 2.96 There are additional chapters in this discussion document that may be relevant for the construction of papakāinga and kaumātua housing, including the chapters relating to new builds (chapters 7-9) and the chapter on development activity (chapter 6). The treatment of Māori collectively-owned land is also considered in chapter 10 on the design of rollover relief. 33 Questions for submitters • Would a carveout for papakāinga housing be appropriate to support the aims of papakāinga and the Government’s wider housing objectives? • Is papakāinga housing straightforward to identify? − Are there certain characteristics that could assist with identification? − How common is it for papakāinga housing to be provided on general title land (as opposed to Māori land)? − Is it possible to easily differentiate between papakāinga housing on general title land from standard rental properties? • Can housing on Māori land be rented to non-whānau, and how common is this? • How are papakāinga housing developments structured and financed? − How common is it for papakāinga housing to be provided through a registered charity? − To what extent is interest incurred on loans related to papakāinga housing? − Are bank loans the most common form of debt finance used? What other forms of debt finance are used? • Should separate consideration be given to a carveout for kaumātua housing? − Are there issues that need to be considered in relation to legacy kaumātua housing? − Is it common for interest expenses to be incurred in the provision of kaumātua housing? − How could the interest limitation rules impact a decision to take out a loan to upgrade existing or construct new kaumātua housing? • Beyond papakāinga and kaumātua housing, what other ways are iwi and hapū supporting whānau through housing, in particular the provision of rental accommodation? − What structures are used? (for example, joint ventures) − How is such housing financed? 34 Chapter 3 Entities affected by interest limitation Companies 3.1 Companies are generally allowed deductions for interest incurred without needing to trace the use of their borrowed funds (see section DB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 5 The Government proposes to override the general rule in section DB 7 for residential investment property owned by close companies and residential investment property-rich companies. Accordingly, if a close company or residential investment property-rich company borrowed for residential investment property purposes, its interest deductions would be limited to the extent that its borrowings are traced to residential investment property purposes (unless an exemption applies). Section DB 7 would still apply to the extent that interest expenditure is not traced to residential investment property. Example 3: Close company acquiring residential investment property Harry is the sole shareholder in a company, MixedCo. MixedCo borrows $800,000 from a bank at a 5% interest rate. MixedCo uses $300,000 of the borrowed funds to acquire a residential investment property, which it rents out. The remaining $500,000 is applied to business purposes unrelated to the residential investment property. MixedCo’s interest deductions on the $300,000 portion of the loan will be subject to limitation. 3.2 This override of section DB 7 would mean that taxpayers cannot get around the interest limitation proposal by using close companies to borrow to acquire residential investment property. It is also more neutral in that it will not create a tax incentive to form widely held companies to debt-fund residential property investments. 3.3 The Government does not propose to extend the interest limitation rule to all companies, in order to reduce compliance costs for companies whose main business does not involve residential investment property. Tracing can be difficult for companies with many sources of funds and a variety of different assets. 6 If a company holds relatively small amounts of residential investment property, it would usually be able to obtain full deductibility of interest under the tracing approach anyway by ensuring all borrowing is used to fund non- 5 This is subject to some exceptions, such as for the mixed-use asset rules: section DB 7(6B) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 6 Although tracing may also be difficult for some close companies and residential investment property-rich companies, it is important to ensure that taxpayers cannot circumvent the interest limitation proposal by acquiring residential investment property through close companies. It will also usually be easier for shareholders in close companies to restructure to ensure that interest deductions for other business purposes are not effected (for example, shareholders may set up a separate sister company to hold any residential investment property). 35 residential assets. Moreover, companies that hold small amounts of residential investment property (relative to their total assets) are unlikely to contribute significantly to high house prices. What is a “close company”? 3.4 A “close company” is a company where five or fewer natural persons or trustees directly or indirectly hold more than 50 per cent of the company. 7 3.5 The “close company” definition treats all associated natural persons as a single person but does not apply that same treatment to trustees of trusts settled by the same person (or their associates). It might therefore be possible for a person to avoid having a “close company” by settling multiple trusts and splitting the share ownership among those trusts, while still maintaining overall control of the company. 3.6 The Government therefore proposes to amend the definition of “close company” by treating all trustees of trusts settled by the same person (or their associates) as a single trustee. What is a “residential investment property-rich” company? 3.7 A company would be residential investment property-rich if, at any time during the income year, 8 the company’s residential investment property percentage exceeds a specified threshold. A company’s residential investment property percentage would be calculated using the following formula, which compares a company’s residential investment property with its total assets: value of residential investment property value of total assets 3.8 The Government proposes to use the same 50 percent (by value) threshold that is used in the “residential land-rich entity” definition for the residential loss ring-fencing rules. 9 The “residential investment property-rich” threshold would apply on a company-by-company basis, but companies that are part of a tax consolidated group would be treated as a single company. Companies that are not close companies with a residential investment property percentage below this 50 percent threshold will continue to be allowed their interest deductions unless one of the exceptions to section DB 7 applies. This would mean that a non-close company with some minor residential investment property holdings (as compared with assets for its other, dominant, business or investment activity) could disregard the rules in this discussion document. 7 Section YA 1. 8 The reason this is applied at any point in the income year, rather than only at the end of the income year, is to ensure that taxpayers cannot avoid the interest limitation proposal by changing the company’s assets portfolio at year-end. The purpose of this threshold is to ensure that companies with minor or incidental holdings of residential investment property are not subject to interest limitation, and such companies are unlikely to ever exceed the threshold. 9 For clarity, although the current definition of “residential land-rich entity” does not extend to widely held companies, officials propose that all companies would have to apply tracing if they exceed this “residential investment property-rich” threshold. 36 3.9 The “value of residential investment property” in the formula refers to the value of in-scope residential property (as discussed in chapter 2) owned by a company. An issue that arises is how the following types of assets are treated for the purposes of the “residential investment property-rich” threshold: • ownership interests in residential investment property-rich companies; • new builds (see chapters 7 and 8); and • residential investment property subject to the development exemption (see chapter 6). Ownership interests in residential investment property-rich companies 3.10 The definition of a “residential land-rich entity” in the residential loss ring- fencing rules looks at the value of residential land owned by an entity, whether directly or indirectly. 10 The Government proposes a simpler approach, which is to treat all ownership interests (for example, shares) in a residential investment property-rich company as “residential investment property” for purposes of the “residential investment property-rich” threshold. This mitigates the need to “look through” chains of companies to determine the value of residential investment property held by each subsidiary (at least in cases where it is clear whether or not the subsidiary is residential investment property-rich, which is expected to be most cases). Example 4: Residential investment property-rich threshold – shares in other companies At the end of the 2023 income year, A Ltd’s total assets consist of the following: • residential investment property with a value of $400,000; • commercial property with a value of $500,000; • 50% of the shares in B Ltd with a value of $300,000. At the end of the 2023 income year, B Ltd’s total assets consist of: • residential investment property with a value of $400,000; and • commercial property with a value of $200,000. B Ltd’s residential investment property percentage is $400,000/($400,000 + $200,000) = 66.7%. B Ltd is therefore a residential investment property-rich company. To work out if A Ltd exceeds the residential investment property-rich threshold, its $300,000 holding in B Ltd is treated as “residential investment property”. A Ltd’s total value of residential investment property is therefore $400,000 + $300,000 = $700,000, and its total assets are $1.2m. Its residen tial investment property percentage is therefore $700,000/$1.2m = 58.3%. A Ltd is a residential investment property-rich company. New builds 3.11 New builds are residential investment property and should be treated as such for purposes of the “residential investment property-rich” threshold. The carveout for companies that are not “residential investment property-rich” is 10 Section EL 3. 37 aimed at removing compliance costs and providing certainty for companies that hold residential investment property incidental to their core business. A company with an asset portfolio comprising 60 per cent new builds and 40 per cent existing rental properties still has a core business involving residential investment property and should not be allowed to obtain interest deductions on borrowings used for its existing rental properties; it should still have to trace to work out which interest deductions are limited. 3.12 In addition, if the new build exemption is for a fixed time period (see paragraphs 8.20 and 8.21 in chapter 8), a company that only acquires new builds will have to work out how much of its interest deductions are limited when some of its properties no longer qualify for the new build exemption. It may not be able to do this unless it had traced its borrowings to the properties initially. Residential investment property subject to the development exemption 3.13 The development exemption is proposed to apply on a property-by-property basis (see chapter 6). A property that qualifies for the development exemption may later stop qualifying for it (for example, if development ceases). For reasons similar to those outlined in paragraph 3.11 for new builds, officials propose that residential property under development should still be considered “residential investment property” for purposes of the “residential investment property-rich” threshold. 3.14 If all residential investment property held by a developer company is covered by the development exemption, it would be allowed all of its interest deductions anyway (regardless of whether or not it is “residential investment property-rich”). If the developer company holds a few rental properties subject to limitation, interest expenditure on borrowings traced to those properties will be limited. Valuation 3.15 The Government proposes to determine the asset values for the residential investment property percentage calculation using the same rules as those applied for residential loss ring-fencing (section EL 19), with one possible exception. 3.16 For land, the value would be the later of its most recent capital or annual value as set by a local authority or its acquisition cost (or its market value if acquired from an associate). For depreciable property, the value would be the property’s adjusted tax value. For all other property, however, officials consider a change may be desirable. Instead of requiring taxpayers to use market value for all “other property” (as required by section EL 19(1)(c)), there may be merit in allowing taxpayers to use accounting or tax book values where market value cannot be easily ascertained. Submissions are invited on this potential change. 38 Feedback on companies Questions for submitters The Government invites submissions on the proposals outlined above and is particularly interested in: • Does treating new builds and residential property covered by the development exemption as “residential investment property” for purposes of the “residential investment property-rich” threshold cause issues for any developer companies? If so, what are those issues? • Do you prefer to use accounting or tax book values for calculating the residential investment property percentage for assets other than land, improvements and depreciable property? Why? Kāinga Ora 3.17 The Crown agency, Kāinga Ora-Homes and Communities (Kāinga Ora), provides public housing for people in need of assistance. It does this through its own housing and through housing held by its wholly-owned subsidiary, Housing New Zealand Limited. 3.18 Together, public housing and community housing are referred to as social housing. Registered community housing providers are separate from the Crown, and many are charities and therefore exempt from income tax. Other community housing providers may be exempt under section CW 42B of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). Since Kāinga Ora is not a charity or a community housing provider, it does not qualify for these exemptions. The Government therefore proposes to exclude Kāinga Ora and its wholly-owned subsidiaries from the interest limitation rules. 3.19 Kāinga Ora also undertakes property development and building activity through its other wholly-owned subsidiary, Housing New Zealand Building Limited. These activities would likely be exempt from the interest limitation proposal under the development exemption (see chapter 6) even in the absence of an exclusion. Other organisations 3.20 The Government does not propose to exclude other entities from the interest limitation rule, though exemptions are proposed for land being developed and for new builds (see chapters 6, 7 and 8). 39 Questions for submitters • Are there other organisations that should not be subject to the interest limitation proposal? • If so, please provide a description of those organisations’ activities and explain why an exclusion is appropriate. In particular, please explain why an exclusion should apply to the organisation as a whole, rather than to the type of land held by, or activities undertaken by, that organisation. Exclusions for particular organisations, rather than for types of land or activities, are more likely to be appropriate when the organisation’s functions are prescribed or circumscribed by law. 40 Chapter 4 Interest allocation: how to identify which interest expenses are subject to limitation Introduction 4.1 In tax law, whether a deduction is allowed for expenditure generally depends on the purpose of the expenditure. Generally, expenditure is only deductible if it has a sufficient connection or “nexus” with assessable income. For interest expenses, the relevant issue is what the corresponding loan (under which the interest is paid) was used for. 11 This can be described as a “tracing” approach as the value of the borrowed funds are traced to the value of any asset acquired using those funds or, if the funds have been applied to an expense, the cost of that expense. 4.2 If a taxpayer uses a loan for non-taxable purposes, such as to buy their family home, or private beach house, or to fund their holiday, they are not allowed a tax deduction for interest on that loan. The Government generally proposes to follow the same tracing approach for the interest limitation rules such that interest on loans used for residential investment purposes 12 will also become non-deductible. Why tracing is the preferred approach 4.3 Tracing is already the approach generally used by taxpayers (other than companies) to determine when interest expenses are deductible. The vast majority of taxpayers owning residential investment properties are not companies. 13 4.4 Using a tracing approach means that taxpayers borrowing for non-residential investment purposes will be unaffected by the interest limitation proposal. This accords with the Government’s desire to ensure that the proposal will not affect loans for non-residential investment purposes. How the tracing approach works 4.5 The tracing approach works by identifying what money has been borrowed by a taxpayer and determining what that money has been used for. If borrowings have been used for residential investment purposes, interest deductions on those borrowings will no longer be deductible (subject to exemptions such as 11 The position is different for companies with interest expenditure. Under section DB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007, interest expenditure for companies is generally deductible, with some exceptions (that is, companies usually will not have to trace). 12 This term is intended to cover purposes relating to deriving income from residential investment property (unless a specific exemption applies) and includes, for example, costs of acquiring, selling, or holding a residential investment property. 13 Based on 2019 returns, around 96% of taxpayers returning rental income were not companies (excluding look- through companies, which are not treated as companies for tax purposes). 41 for new builds and developers). Borrowings for residential investment purposes include not just the borrowings to fund the purchase of a residential investment property, but also borrowings to fund expenses incurred in deriving rental income (for example, borrowings to pay for repairs and maintenance, rates, insurance and property manager fees – the underlying expenses would still remain deductible, though). 4.6 Importantly, under tracing, deductibility does not depend on the security or collateral for the loan. This is because the security for the loan often has little or no relation to the purpose of the loan. Mortgage agreements also often provide that any security given by the borrower secures any loans the borrower has with the particular bank, as well as any future loans the borrower may have with that bank. Example 5: Loan used for residential investment property Avon owns a commercial property valued at $1.5m. He decides to buy a residential investment property for $400,000 in November 2021. Avon borrows $400,000 from the bank to pay for the residential property. The loan is secured against his existing commercial property only. Because Avon used the $400,000 loan to buy a residential property, he cannot claim interest deductions on the $400,000 loan. The fact that the loan is secured against the commercial property is irrelevant. Example 6: Loan used for business purposes Maia owns a residential investment property valued at $500,000. She takes out a $200,000 loan, secured against her residential investment property, to buy a food truck and catering equipment to start a business. Maia will be allowed to claim interest deductions incurred under her $200,000 loan, because it was used for non-residential business purposes. 4.7 A taxpayer may own some assets for which interest deductions may be allowed (for example, new builds, other business assets) alongside other assets for which interest deductions may not be allowed (for example, a family home, residential investment property acquired on or after the “effective date” of 27 March 2021). For some assets such as pre-27 March residential investment property, partial interest deductions may be allowed. 4.8 Taxpayers holding such a variety of assets will often take care to ensure their interest deductions for new builds and other business assets can be clearly traced to those assets. One way to do this is to keep loans for different types of assets separate. For example, instead of taking out a single $1m loan to buy a new build for $500,000 and a post-27 March property for $500,000, a taxpayer can take out two separate $500,000 loans to make tracing easier. 42 Example 7: Tracing with multiple assets Neo has an existing loan of $375,000 that he used to buy a residential rental property in Stratford. In May 2022, Neo wants to buy two residential apartments - one in Auckland and one in Hamilton. The Auckland property is a new build with a purchase price of $500,000. The Hamilton property is not a new build, with a purchase price of $400,000. He has existing savings of $350,000 but needs to borrow a further $550,000 from the bank to fund the two purchases. He uses his existing savings to put down a $100,000 deposit for the new build and borrows the remaining $400,000 from the bank. He uses his remaining savings of $250,000 along with a further $150,000 bank loan to buy the Hamilton property. Under the interest limitation rule, the treatment of interest deductibility for each of the properties is as follows: • Interest on the existing $375,000 loan used to buy the Stratford property will be subject to phasing. 14 • Interest on the $400,000 loan used to buy the Auckland new build will be fully deductible (in accordance with the new build rules). • Interest on the $150,000 loan used to buy the Hamilton property will not be deductible. If Neo had funded his purchases differently, his interest deductions would be different. For example, if he had used more savings (and less debt) to fund his purchase of the new build, his interest deductions would be less. Tracing and change of use 4.9 Consistent with current law, if the use of the borrowed funds changes, the deductibility of interest may also change as the funds are “traced” to a new use. Example 8: Change of use of borrowed funds from business to residential On 1 April 2022, Billy borrows $50,000 to buy a vehicle to be used solely for his business. On 1 October 2022, Billy sells his business vehicle and uses the sale proceeds to pay for repairs, rates, insurance and property manager fees for his residential rental property. Billy can deduct interest on the loan incurred up to 30 September 2022. He will not be able to deduct interest on the loan after that. Tracing and repayments 4.10 When a loan is applied to different purposes, some of which are deductible and some of which are not, there is a question about how repayments of that loan should be allocated — whether they should be allocated to the deductible or non-deductible purposes. 14 Refer to chapter 1 for detail on how interest deductions will be phased out for pre-27 March property. 43 Example 9: Partial repayment of a loan used for both deductible and non-deductible purposes Bharat has an overdraft facility with his bank for $50,000, with a balance of $0 as at 1 April 2022. The bank calculates interest daily but charges it monthly at the end of each month to the same overdraft facility, increasing the amount owing under the facility. On 1 May 2022, Bharat draws down $20,000 to buy a van for his plumbing business. Interest on the $20,000 drawdown should be fully deductible (assuming the van is used exclusively for the business). On 31 May, interest of $50 is added to the amount Bharat owes under the facility. On 1 June 2022, Bharat draws down another $10,000 to pay for a new fence for his residential rental property. Interest on the $10,000 drawdown will not be deductible under the new interest limitation proposal. On 30 June, interest of $75 is added to the amount Bharat owes under the facility. On 28 August 2022, Bharat makes a deposit of $10,000 into his overdraft facility. The question is how the $10,000 should be allocated. Should it be applied first to the interest of $12 5, or should it reduce Bharat’s deductible $20,000 loan by $10,000, or should it eliminate his non-deductible $10,000 loan? 4.11 This issue already exists. A sole trader may use an overdraft facility for both business and private purposes. There is no statutory ordering rule prescribing how repayments under such a facility should be allocated for tax purposes. Instead, relevant case law applies. 15 4.12 Given the complexity of the case law in this area, a statutory ordering rule for tax purposes may have some merit, but is not a priority for this reform. Feedback on tracing Questions for submitters • Do you agree with the proposed approach to generally rely on the existing law on tracing, except where it would cause transition issues? (Transition issues are discussed at paragraphs 4.17 to 4.40.) • Are there other issues with applying tracing that have not been identified in this discussion document? The Government is interested in issues that are particular to interest limitation, and not issues that already exist more generally. Refinancing 4.13 While interest on new loans for residential rental properties will generally not be deductible under the proposals an exception to this will be for refinancing 15 See for example Falk v Haugh (1935) 53 CLR 163, Devaynes v Noble (1816) 35 ER 781 (Clayton’s case); Foskett v McKeown \[2001\] 1 AC 102 (HL) and Re Registered Securities Ltd \[1991\] NZRL 545 (CA). 44 pre-27 March loans that apply to property held (or acquired) before 27 March 2021. 4.14 When a residential rental property owner draws down a new loan to repay a pre-27 March loan, it is proposed that the treatment of interest on the existing loan will carry through to the new loan. As well as being consistent with the tracing approach, this proposal will allow borrowers to restructure their funding sources when it is commercially sensible to do so. The proposed refinancing exception is largely consistent with existing case law but the Government proposes a specific legislated exception to ensure the phased transition and any other factors stay consistent with the existing loan. 4.15 If a new loan is larger than the existing loan, a tracing approach, as outlined will need to be applied to determine whether the interest on the additional lending is deductible or not. If the loan has been used solely for pre-27 March residential rental property any break costs added to the loan will not result in deductible interest. 4.16 One exception to the tracing proposals for refinancing pre-27 March loans used to acquire pre-27 March residential property is in the unlikely scenario where a residential rental property that has been funded by a New Zealand Dollar (NZD) loan is refinanced with a loan denominated in another currency. The Government proposes that refinancing an NZD loan with a loan in another currency will also not be subject to any refinancing exception. Accordingly, any interest incurred or foreign exchange movements on these foreign currency loans would not be deductible or assessable. This is consistent with the proposed treatment of foreign currency loans over New Zealand residential rental property (refer to paragraphs 4.45 – 4.52). Feedback on refinancing Questions for submitters • Do you agree that a new loan to refinance a pre-27 March loan would benefit from a specific provision? • Are there any commercial reasons a loan that is in New Zealand dollars would be restructured to a loan in a foreign currency? • Are there other issues with refinancing that we have not considered? Transition issues 4.17 While there are generally no proposed changes to the existing law around tracing, there are two situations involving transition for which particular rules are proposed. 4.18 The first situation involves pre-27 March loans used to finance income producing residential and non-residential assets. When such loans were taken out, the borrower did not need to trace their borrowings, and it may now be difficult or impossible for them to trace their borrowed funds retrospectively 45 to work out which interest deductions are limited. Two alternative rules are proposed to address these issues. These rules would only need to be applied once to allocate pre-27 March loans to existing assets. After pre-27 March loans have been allocated accordingly, the tax treatment of interest deductions would follow on from that allocation. 4.19 The second situation involves commonly offered loan products that raise specific issues. These issues can occur for transactions made from 27 March 2021 throughout the entire transitional period (during which phased deductions may be allowed). Examples of this are revolving credit facilities and possibly offset accounts. A high water mark proposal aimed at these issues is outlined in paragraphs 4.33 – 4.40. Pre-27 March loans that cannot be traced 4.20 As set out above, the interest limitation proposal may give rise to difficulties for taxpayers who were previously not required to trace, and who may therefore not hold the records necessary to show that a pre-27 March loan was applied to a particular business use as opposed to a residential-related use. 4.21 Two alternative rules are proposed for taxpayers to allocate their pre-27 March loans across their assets. • Option 1: Apportionment. Under this option, taxpayers may apportion their pre-27 March loans across their assets based on their original acquisition cost, including any improvements. Apportioning based on original cost (including improvements) instead of, for example, market value makes sense because the aim of apportionment in this context is to provide some basis to work out how funds are deemed to have been applied. Taxpayers should also be able to work out their original cost relatively easily, whereas market value can be costly to work out (for example, if a taxpayer owns unlisted shares). We propose that apportioning should be done based on loan balances as at 26 March 2021, with repayments of any apportioned loans after that date allocated to assets in the same proportions. Increases in debt balances on or after 27 March 2021 would represent new drawdowns (not pre-27 March loans), for which tracing should be applied. • Option 2: Stacking. Under this option, taxpayers would allocate their pre-27 March loans, excluding any loans traced to private purposes, 16 first to assets that are not residential investment properties. The rationale for this approach is that well-advised taxpayers would be able to restructure to achieve the same tax outcome under tracing anyway. 17 Allowing this tax outcome without requiring a restructure would therefore reduce compliance costs and help taxpayers who do not have 16 Where loans have been applied to both taxable and private purposes, taxpayers have always needed to trace to ensure that they do not claim interest deductions for borrowings applied to private purposes. 17 For example, a taxpayer could sell their non-residential assets to a wholly-owned company for market value, and the company could borrow to acquire those assets. The taxpayer would then use the sale proceeds to repay the pre- 27 March loan. As the company’s borrowings are traced to the acquisition of non-residential business assets, its interest deductions would be allowed in full (subject to possible application of the general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007). 46 professional advice. For this option, stacking will be based on the market value of assets as at 26 March 2021. Example 10: Transition of pre-27 March loan As at 26 March 2021, Tiffany owns two properties, both acquired at around the same time in the 1990s: • a residential rental property purchased for $300,000, with improvements of $100,000 carried out in the 2000s; and • a commercial rental property, purchased for $400,000, with no improvements. She acquired the two properties using a combination of loans and savings. Over the years, Tiffany has refinanced and restructured her loans several times and has made many repayments. As at 26 March 2021, she has a single outstanding loan of $200,000 and no other debt. Although Tiffany never used the loans for personal purposes, she did not trace exactly how the borrowed funds were applied to each property in the past and does not have the records to do so now. Option 1: apportionment based on cost Under the apportionment approach, 50% (being $400,000 divided by the total asset costs of $800,000) of Tiffany’s $200,000 loan is treated as having been used to acquire the commercial property. The remaining 50% of her loan is treated as having been used to acquire the residential property. From 1 October 2021 until the loan is fully repaid, Tiffany will be able to deduct 50% of the interest expenditure incurred under her loan. The remaining 50% of interest expenditure will be subject to phasing. Option 2: stacking based on market values Under the stacking approach, Tiffany’s $200,000 loan is stacked against her commercial property first. Assuming the market value of the commercial property on 26 March 2021 is at least $200,000, Tiffany can continue to deduct all her interest expenditure under the loan indefinitely. 4.22 Where sufficient evidence exists for tracing to be applied, taxpayers will still have the option to trace. The transition approach proposed above will therefore be optional. Example 11: Transition of pre-27 March loan combined with tracing As at 1 October 2021, Mikael owns the following assets: • a family home, acquired in the 1980s for $200,000; • a farm, acquired in the 1990s for $300,000; • a tractor, acquired in the 2000s for $60,000; • a residential rental property, acquired in 2007 for $400,000; and • shares in a listed company, acquired in 2010 with a cost base of $100,000. As at 1 October 2021, Mikael has the following debt: 47 • $100,000 loan, used to acquire the family home and pay for other private expenses; • $10,000 loan, used to pay for the tractor; and • $400,000 loan, used to pay for the farm and residential rental property and related expenses over the years. Option 1: apportionment based on cost Mikael’s $100,000 loan would not be subject to apportionment. Mikael can trace the loan to the purchase of the family home and private expenses. Taxpayers have always needed to trace funds applied to private purposes separately from funds applied to business purposes, and the interest limitation proposal does not change this. Interest on the $100,000 loan will therefore continue to remain fully non-deductible. Interest on Mikael’s $10,000 loan will remain fully deductible, as the loan can be traced to the purchase of the tractor. The $400,000 loan will need to be apportioned between the farm, shares, and residential rental property (total cost of $800,000). The portion allocated to residential rental property is 50% (being its $400,000 cost divided by $800,000 total cost), with the remaining 50% allocated to the farm and shares. Mikael can therefore continue to deduct 50% of his interest expenses under the $400,000 loan. The remaining 50% will be subject to phasing. Option 2: stacking based on market values Again, the $100,000 loan would not be subject to stacking and would remain fully non- deductible. Interest on the $10,000 tractor loan would remain fully deductible. The $400,000 loan will be allocated to the farm and shares first. As long as the combined market value of the farm and shares as at 26 March 2021 is at least $400,000, Mikael can continue to deduct all interest expenditure under the $400,000 loan. However if, for example, the combined market value of the farm and shares as at 26 March 2021 is $380,000, Mikael will have to treat interest on $380,000 of their loan as being fully deductible, with interest on the remaining $20,000 being subject to phasing. Feedback on pre-27 March loans that cannot be traced Questions for submitters: The approaches proposed above are aimed at making compliance easier for taxpayers who would otherwise have to apply tracing to pre-27 March loans. • Which of the proposed approaches do you prefer? • Do you have any suggestions on how the proposed approaches can be made simpler? • Are there alternative approaches you would prefer? If so, how would that alternative approach work? 48 Issues caused by specific types of loans and high water mark proposal 4.23 Although pre-27 March borrowing to fund a pre-27 March residential rental property will be deductible subject to phasing, the same will not apply to new lending. This can create compliance costs and different treatment for different loan products. This section sets out some of those issues and a proposed concession that seeks to address them. Revolving credits and other variable loans 4.24 A revolving credit facility and an overdraft essentially operates the same way. The borrower has a limit approved by their lender and can withdraw up to this limit without having to seek further approval from the lender. They may also make repayments (deposits) at any time. Revolving credit facilities are often used like chequing accounts, with everyday income and expenses going through that account. 4.25 An example of how a revolving credit facility is analysed for tax purposes is provided in example 12. Essentially each time the borrower withdraws money from their facility this must be traced as new lending and, as outlined, any repayments are not necessarily allocated against this new lending or any private lending first. This can, even under current law, result in revolving credit facilities having undesirable tax outcomes when the facility is used to fund a mixture of private and taxable expenditure. 4.26 However, if a taxpayer has a revolving credit facility that is only used to fund and operate residential rental property (or other taxable activity) all expenditure would relate to taxable activity so, currently, all interest would be deductible. 4.27 Under the interest limitation proposal, interest on loans used for costs related to holding or maintaining a residential rental property will become non- deductible, if the loans are drawn down after 27 March 2021. This rule has the potential to create complexity in some very common situations. The simplest example is a loan to fund the purchase of a pre-27 March residential rental property. Interest on the original amount borrowed would be subject to phasing but if interest on that loan was capitalised after 27 March, so the loan value increased, any interest on that increased balance would not be deductible. 4.28 Any expenditure on or after 27 March 2021 made from a revolving credit facility, including all interest charged under that facility, would be treated as new lending. Unless that expenditure is traceable to a deductible use, the interest on that lending would not be deductible after 1 October 2021 in the absence of a special rule. 49 Example 12: Revolving credit facility and existing residential rental property On 26 March 2021 Serghei owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility used to purchase a residential rental property. Serghei collects rent of $1,000 each fortnight and is charged interest of $1,000 per fortnight. There are no other transactions involving this account. Date Transaction Amount Balance Balance generating deductible interest 26 March 2021 Opening balance ($500,000) ($500,000) 31 March 2021 Rent $1,000 ($499,000) ($499,000) 31 March 2021 Interest ($1,000) ($500,000) ($499,714) 18 14 April 2021 Rent $1,000 ($499,000) ($498,714) 19 14 April 2021 Interest ($1,000) ($500,000) ($498,714) 28 April 2021 Rent $1,000 ($499,000) ($497,714) 28 April 2021 Interest ($1,000) ($500,000) ($497,714) Between 26 March and 28 April, the balance of Serghei’s revolving credit facility has remained at $500,000; however, the portion that will generate deductible interest after 1 October 2021 has reduced by $2,286. If this trend continued by 31 March 2025, when interest deductions are phased out, the balance would still be $500,000 but the amount generating deductible interest would be only $395,714. Offset arrangements 4.29 An offset arrangement operates through a combination of one or more loan accounts and one or more deposit accounts. Interest is charged on the net borrowing across all accounts in the offset arrangement, which allows a borrower to reduce their interest costs and provides similar flexibility to a revolving credit facility. Deposit accounts can be an asset of the borrower or, in some circumstances, an asset of another person such as a close family member. 20 4.30 An offset arrangement can function very similarly to a revolving credit facility. For example, instead of owing $200,000 on a revolving credit facility with an approved limit of $250,000 a borrower can achieve an equivalent outcome by borrowing $250,000 and placing $50,000 back on deposit, offset against the borrowing. 4.31 However, the tax analysis of an offset arrangement is somewhat different. As interest and other expenses can be funded by a withdrawal from a deposit account this would not constitute new borrowing, even though the net loan balance would increase and therefore higher interest would be charged. 18 Interest incurred on the 10 days before 27 March 2021 will increase the balance eligible to generate deductible interest. The 4 days from 27 March 2021 to 30 March 2021 will not result in deductible interest. $1,000 has been apportioned by 10/14 to get $714 (rounded). 19 This calculation assumes the entire payment is applied to reducing the balance of deductible lending – that is, to the oldest debt first. Refer to discussion on this from paragraph 4.10. 20 Inland Revenue has issued six product rulings for offset products that explain in more detail how these products operate. The most recent is BR Prd 18/03. 50 Example 13: Offset arrangement Ari borrows $50,000 to buy a vehicle for his business, so the interest on the $50,000 loan will be deductible. Ari operates an offset facility and, over a year, deposits $50,000 of business profits into a deposit account so interest charged reduces to zero. Ari withdraws $50,000 from the deposit account to pay for renovations on his home. As the balance of the deposit account is now zero, the net loan balance returns to $50,000 and interest is charged. As the loan to purchase the business ve hicle has always been outstanding, this interest will continue to be deductible. 4.32 Although the amount of total borrowing may remain unchanged, the withdrawal of amounts to apply to residential rental property and the allocation of repayments when there is lending for more than one purpose can lead to complexity. However, it is clear that an offset account can result in more deductible interest than an equivalent revolving credit facility even though both products are very similar economically. High water mark proposal 4.33 While interest on pre-27 March loans will be deductible subject to phasing, any borrowing to fund expenditure on these properties after this date will be subject to interest limitation. This could result in taxpayers being required to trace interest expenditure that is low value relative to the total borrowing, creating high compliance costs. This tracing will only have an impact on tax deductions until the transitional phasing period ends. 4.34 Furthermore, if there is no special rule for revolving credit facilities, the outcomes for individual taxpayers in similar circumstances could be quite different depending on their funding arrangements. Taxpayers with offset accounts may have higher interest deductions than taxpayers with revolving credit facilities and taxpayers may have higher interest deductions if they can fund expenditure by deferring principal repayments they would have otherwise made. 4.35 To remove this inequity and reduce compliance costs, the Government proposes a high water mark approach. The approach would operate, for each loan, as follows: 51 Step 1: Determine the high water mark This is the amount of funding allocated to residential rental property on 26 March 2021 using the proposals outlined elsewhere in this document. 21 Step 2: Adjust loan balance for private and other deductible expenditure after 26 March 22 The loan balance for the purpose of the high water mark is reduced by any borrowings 23 used to fund private expenditure or deductible expenditure (for example, borrowings for a new build or commercial property) Step 3: Determine the amount of borrowing that generates deductible interest subject to phasing • If the adjusted loan balance is lower than the high water mark, all interest on the adjusted loan balance is deductible subject to phasing • If the adjusted loan balance is higher than the high water mark, interest up to the high water mark is deductible subject to phasing. • Deductibility of interest on the loan balance above the adjusted balance will depend on the purpose it has been traced to. 4.36 The loan balance for a revolving credit loan would be the amount drawn down rather than the total credit limit that could have been borrowed. 4.37 As with any loan that is applied to multiple purposes which have differing tax treatments the calculation of deductible interest may have to be done each time the balance of the loan changes. The high water mark proposal will reduce this complexity where a loan is only drawn on for the purpose of meeting expenses on pre-effective date residential rental property. Example 14: Revolving credit facility On 26 March 2021, Darryl owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility to fund his residential rental property. The revolving credit facility has a limit of $600,000. Darryl does not use this account to fund any private expense or any other deductible uses. His high water mark is therefore $500,000. Although the balance fluctuates as he receives rent and pays expenses, by 30 September 2021 the balance is $480,000. Provided the balance does not go above $500,000 before the phasing ends at the end of the 2024–25 income year, Darryl will be able to calculate his interest deductions by multiplying all the interest charged on the revolving credit facility by the relevant phasing percentage. 21 This would be tracing (if possible) or the transitional proposal outlined above. 22 If the loan has only been used for pre-27 March residential rental property this step is not required. 23 This would be borrowings net of any subsequent repayments allocated against that borrowing. As the borrowings occur after 27 March 2021 there will usually be no repayments before the end of the phasing period unless the loan has been repaid in full. 52 Example 15: Private expenditure On 26 March, Ariana owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility to fund her residential rental property. Her high water mark is $500,000. Although the balance fluctuates as she receives rent and pays expenses, by 30 September 2021 the balance is $46 0,000. The balance remains below $500,000 until Ariana withdraws $70,000 on 1 April 2023 to buy a car for personal use. This increases the loan balance from $460,000 to $530,000. The high water mark remains at $500,000 but the adjusted loan balance reduces to $530,000 - $70,000 = $460,000. The amount of the loan allocated to the residential rental property is the lower of: • the high water mark = $500,000; and • the actual balance adjusted for private expenditure = $530,000 - $70,000 = $460,000 Ariana calculates her deductible interest by multiplying the adjusted loan balance of $460,000 by the interest rate and the relevant phasing percentage. The portion of the loan used to buy the car ($70,000) is fully non-deductible. Example 16: Significant repayment On 26 March 2021, Kristina owes $500,000 on a revolving credit facility to fund her residential rental property. Her starting high water mark is $500,000. Although the balance fluctuates as she receives rent and pays expenses, by 30 September 2021 the balance is $520,000. As this is above the high water mark Kristina is only entitled to interest deductions on $500,000 of the loan balance multiplied by the relevant phasing percentage. On 17 April 2023 she receives an inheritance of $200,000 which she uses to reduce the balance of the revolving credit facility from $550,000 to $350,000. As this is below the high water mark, Kristina can deduct all the interest after applying the 50% phasing reduction for the 2023–24 year. On 3 August 2024 Kristina withdraws $100,000 from the revolving credit facility to renovate her rental property. The balance of the revolving credit facility increases from $370,000 to $470,000. This work does not qualify for the new build exemption. As this is not private expenditure nor fully deductible no adjustments are needed to Kristina’s loan balance. As the balance of the revolving credit facility is below the high water mark, Kristina is entitled to deduct all of the interest after applying the 75% phasing reduction for the 2024– 25 year. If not for the high water mark approach, Kristina could have achieved a similar outcome by retaining $100,000 of the inheritance in a separate account and using this to pay for the renovations. This would, however, have resulted in her incurring higher net interest expenditure between 1 April 2023 and 1 April 2024 due to the interest rate charged on the revolving credit facility being higher than the interest rate paid on a savings account. Further details 4.38 Many taxpayers will have more than one loan funding their residential rental property (or properties); for example, a mixture of a fixed term loan and a revolving credit account. The Government considered whether the high water mark proposal could apply on a portfolio basis, but proposes it apply on each loan separately. While a portfolio basis would be needed to have the same 53 treatment as an equivalent taxpayer with a single loan, the loan by loan basis will still be taxpayer favourable compared with not applying a high water mark and will remove significant complexity. Submissions are sought on whether there are any significant adverse effects that could occur under a loan by loan basis that would not occur with a portfolio basis. 4.39 If the person acquired the property in an agreement that met the requirements to be pre-27 March property but settlement and/or the loan draw down were not until after 26 March 2021 the high water mark calculation would be identical except it would be at the date the loan was drawn down to complete settlement rather than 26 March 2021. Conclusion 4.40 This proposal means that where a person has a loan account that funds pre-27 March residential property investment, that account can continue to be used to receive and make payments relating to that investment without creating compliance difficulties or inappropriate deduction denial. The Government expects this would significantly lower compliance costs, remove the disincentive to defer principal repayments and align the treatment of different funding products. Feedback on high water mark Questions for submitters: • Do you agree with the proposed approach to a high water mark? • Are there some products that can be excluded (for example, loans that only decrease) or should the high water mark apply to all loans? • Are there any situations when a portfolio basis for a high water mark could be necessary? • Are there other issues with applying a high water mark that have not been considered above? • Are there other products that raise issues that are not addressed by the high water mark proposal? Foreign currency loans 4.41 While the majority of lending on New Zealand properties will be in NZD there may be some in foreign currencies. Pre-27 March residential rental properties 4.42 A foreign currency loan to finance a residential rental property in New Zealand would be subject to the financial arrangements rules. These rules cover the NZD equivalent of foreign currency interest as well as any foreign exchange gains and losses on the principal outstanding. There would be significant complexity in designing transitional phasing rules for these loans. Instead, the 54 Government proposes that any interest on a foreign currency loan that funds a pre-27 March residential rental property would become non-deductible on 1 October 2021 with no phasing period. 4.43 However, a loan funding the same property in NZD would be subject to phasing and it is proposed that the refinancing exception, covered above, would allow a foreign currency loan to be refinanced with an NZD loan. Therefore, a foreign currency loan over a residential rental property in New Zealand could be refinanced with an NZD loan to retain interest deductibility subject to phasing. If the refinancing was before 1 October 2021 all interest deductions would be subject to phasing. If the refinancing was after 1 October 2021 there would be a period between 1 October 2021 and the date of the refinancing where no interest would be deductible after which interest would become subject to phasing. Post-27 March residential rental properties 4.44 For properties acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and financed with a foreign currency loan no interest would be deductible. This is consistent with the same property financed with a NZD loan. Other borrowing 4.45 Any foreign currency loans that could be traced to a deductible purpose (for example, properties qualifying for the new build exemption or other business activities) would continue to be deductible under the current rules. Hedges 4.46 A foreign currency loan may be hedged so the New Zealand borrower is not subject to gains and losses from foreign currency movements. These hedging gains and losses are not treated as interest for New Zealand tax purposes. 4.47 However, to ensure symmetry, it is proposed that gains and losses on a hedge, to the extent it is a hedge of a foreign currency loan that is covered by the interest limitation proposals, should also be removed from the tax base. This means losses on that portion (or all) of the hedge would not be deductible and gains would not be assessable. 4.48 This language is similar to that already applied in the Fair Dividend Rate foreign exchange hedging rules and would apply from when the hedge is entered into (or the proposals apply for existing hedges). It would be a question of fact whether, and to the extent, a hedge was for the foreign currency loan. Taxpayers would not be able to determine this after at the time of taking a tax position as this could result in losses being deducted and gains being non- assessable. 55 Chapter 5 Disposal of property subject to interest limitation Introduction 5.1 Interest deductions for residential investment property are to be disallowed from 1 October 2021, unless the property qualifies for the development or new build exemption. The reason for this treatment is to reduce a tax advantage for property investment in that full deductions for interest have been allowed, while income from capital gains has often not been taxed. This leaves the following questions for cases where property is sold: • should a deduction for interest be allowed at the time of sale if the sale is taxable (on revenue account), as in that case all the income from investing in the property is taxed; and • is there a case for deducting some interest where the amount of interest incurred exceeds the non-taxable capital gain on sale (that is, where disallowing the interest deduction results in taxing more than actual income from the property even if the property was sold for a non-taxable capital gain)? 5.2 There are a number of rules that limit tax benefits for investors and support system integrity. Most important are the rental loss ring-fencing rules and bright-line anti-arbitrage rules. The former “ring-fence” expenditure on loss- making residential investment properties, meaning an investor cannot deduct such expenditure from their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income) to reduce their tax liability. The latter similarly ensure that any losses from a property sold under the bright-line rules are ringfenced and cannot be offset against income other than gains from the sale of land. Options for the treatment of interest on disposal will have to include consideration of how they interact with these provisions. 5.3 This chapter sets out different options for allowing interest deductions on disposal. These options meet housing and tax policy objectives to different degrees while protecting the tax base from selective actions of taxpayers. 5.4 Consequently, design details have not been decided and the Government welcomes submissions on the relative merits of the design options proposed. Specific questions in relation to the options are listed at the end of this chapter. Amount of interest potentially deductible on sale 5.5 The interest potentially deductible on sale would only be interest that under existing rules would be deductible (whether in the year incurred or allocated to a subsequent year because of the ringfencing rules). For example, interest attributable to private use of a second home or bach is not deductible now and would not become deductible on sale under this proposal. 56 Options for treatment of interest when sales are on revenue account (gain is taxable) Revenue account sales 5.6 Land is held on revenue account when it will be taxed on sale. Examples of properties held on revenue account include those purchased with the intention of disposal or acquired for purposes of business relating to land, such as development. 5.7 Properties taxed on sale under the bright-line rules are held on revenue account only once it is known that they will be sold within the bright-line period. They are not held on revenue account otherwise. 5.8 Residential land that is held on revenue account falls into a number of categories. For example, an amount will be income if derived from disposing of residential land: • within ten years of acquisition (s CB 6A); • that was acquired with an intention or purpose of disposing of it (s CB 6); • that was acquired by a person (or someone associated with them) for the purpose of a business of dealing in land, developing land, dividing land into lots, or erecting buildings (s CB 7); or − within ten years of its acquisition, if at the time of acquisition the person was (or was associated with someone who was) in the business of dealing in land, or developing or dividing land (ss CB 9 and CB 10); or − within ten years of the completion of improvements to the land, if at the time the land was acquired the person was (or was associated with someone who was) in the business of erecting buildings (s CB 11); or − that was part of an undertaking or scheme, meeting certain criteria, that involved the development of land or the division of land into lots (ss CB 12 and CB 13); or − within ten years of acquisition if it was disposed of for more than the cost of the land and at least 20 percent of the excess arises from one or more of the factors listed. These factors include the removal of a heritage order, a change to the rules, likelihood of consent being granted, and similar (CB 14). 5.9 Any rules for the treatment of interest on revenue account sales will apply to property held on revenue account that is not a development or new build (where deductions will continue to be available for interest as incurred). In practice, almost all of the properties held on revenue account for which a deduction for interest on sale may be allowed would be those taxable under sections CB 6A or CB 6 (bright-line or purchase with intention of resale) given that most property held on revenue account because it is used for development would also qualify for the development exemption. 57 Options for the treatment of revenue account disposals 5.10 Currently, where property is held on revenue account, any rental income is taxable, expenses (including interest) are deductible and any gains or losses at point of sale are taxable or deductible as appropriate. As set out above, bright- line land is not held on revenue account unless and until it is known that it will be sold within the bright-line period. 5.11 Several options for deferring or denying the deductibility of expenses have been explored, along with their associated design issues. Four of these options relate to property held on revenue account. These are: Option A – Deductions denied Option B – Deductions allowed at point of sale Option C – Deductions allowed at point of sale to the extent they do not create a loss Option D – Anti-arbitrage restriction of interest Option A – Deductions denied 5.12 Under this option, interest deductions would be permanently denied in all circumstances (subject to those allowed under the developer or new build exemptions). 5.13 Complete denial is simple and would maximise the impact on the housing market by most strongly discouraging investments in residential rental property. Denying these deductions could therefore put the most significant downward pressure on house prices of all the options and increase accessibility for first-time buyers. 5.14 However, permanently denying deductions could raise questions around fairness and coherence. The effective tax rate for residential property investments could be raised above the effective tax rate of other investments. This means that permanent denial of a deduction could lead to taxation that is much higher than full taxation of the total actual income generated by the property investment, and higher than for any other investments. Similarly, this introduces the possibility for scenarios where taxpayers who have lost money overall would be subject to tax. These factors are likely to reduce investor demand overall but could also be viewed as unfair for investors subject to high effective tax rates. 5.15 Although it is very difficult to predict the full impacts of this option, overall, it is likely to be the most favourable one for first-time buyers. It will, however, also lead to the most instances of over-taxation of property investors relative to their income from the property. 5.16 This option is likely to be simpler than the other options which allow interest to be deducted on a deferred basis. 58 Option B – Deductions allowed and deferred to point of sale 5.17 Under this option, interest deductions would be allowed in full at point of sale. Net rental losses are already ringfenced under the existing rental loss ringfencing rules but are generally released when property is sold on revenue account. 5.18 Deducting at the time of sale when the gain is taxed ensures an investor’s total actual income is taxed (and not overtaxed). 5.19 That deductions are deferred means the taxation of residential investment property held on revenue account is increasing relative to the status quo. This will still shift the housing market in favour of first-home buyers, although not as strongly as option A. Arbitrage issues 5.20 By allowing deductions at the time of sale, this option increases the risk of arbitrage. For example, if deferred interest is taxable in the year of sale, there could be an incentive to sell property within the bright-line period. Property could be sold before the bright-line date to create a revenue account loss or held until after the date for a capital account gain. 5.21 Options C and D address arbitrage risk and this is also discussed in chapter 12 on Residential loss ringfencing. Example 17: Option B Annette buys a house for $1m. Three years later she sells the house for $1.2m. The house was used as a residential rental property for the whole period. Over the three years she incurred $300k of accumulated interest deductions. In the year of sale, she is able to deduct $200k against her tax liability arising from the sale of the property. The remaining $100k can be offset against other income resulting in a net taxable income reduction of $100k from the combination of the taxable gain and the interest deduction. If Annette sold the property on capital account, she may not get a deduction for the interest (if option E below applies). This would give her an incentive to sell on revenue account. 5.22 This option has slightly higher compliance costs than option A as it requires taxpayers to keep track of deferred interest expense and to deduct it in the year of sale. Option C – Deductions allowed at point of sale to the extent they do not create a loss 5.23 Under this option, deductions would be allowed at point of sale but only to the extent that they do not create a loss. Any interest in excess of this would be non-deductible. This is similar to option B except it addresses arbitrage risk. 5.24 It is possible that the loss limitation could be confined to those properties that are most subject to arbitrage risk bright-line property and possibly property on 59 revenue account under section CB 6 (intention test). For other revenue account property, the sale could release all of the deferred interest as discussed in option B. Example 18: Option C Assume Annette buys and sells a house as she did above (in example 17), accumulating the same amount in interest deductions. Under this option, her interest deductions are limited to $200k. So overall, she is not taxed on the disposal, but she does not get a net deduction of $100k as she does in Option B. The remaining $100k of interest expense cannot be deducted and is forfeited. 5.25 This option is likely to have similar levels of compliance and administrative costs as option B. Option D – Anti-arbitrage restriction for interest 5.26 Under this option, interest would be deductible at the time of sale subject to restrictions. Rather than simply denying the interest deduction to the extent it exceeds the gain on disposal, it would be taken into account in section EL 20 as if it were part of the cost of the property. This would incorporate the current bright-line anti-arbitrage rule that would allow the excess interest to potentially be deductible against other income from revenue account property derived in the same or a later income year. 5.27 Another option to achieve a similar anti-arbitrage outcome would be to modify the residential rental loss ringfencing rules to incorporate it. This is described in chapter 12 on the residential loss ringfencing rules. Example 19: Option D Under this option, Annette would not have $100k permanently forfeited as in the previous example. Instead, the excess interest would be ringfenced and so could be offset against other real property gains under section EL 20. Options for treatment of interest when sales are on capital account (gain is non- taxable) 5.28 The following paragraphs outline options for deductions for interest in the case of property sold on capital account. In all cases, interest deductions should not be allowed to the extent of any untaxed gain. This is the clearest case where the tax system is not fully taxing investment in residential property. Option F considers the case to allow a deduction of interest in excess of the untaxed gain. Option E – No deductions allowed Option F – No deductions allowed up to amount of non-taxed gain with the excess deductible, potentially subject to anti-arbitrage rules. 60 Option E – No deductions allowed 5.29 Under this option no deductions would be allowed, as a rough offset for the benefit of capital gains not being taxed. All interest deductions associated with the property would be forfeited. This has the strongest impact on reducing investor demand for residential property. It has the potential to produce a high tax rate on the property, but this is mitigated by the fact that the capital gain is not taxed. Overall, the property owner could be taxed on more or less than their actual income. Option F – No deductions allowed up to amount of non-taxed gain with the excess deductible 5.30 Under this option, interest could not be deducted to the extent of any untaxed gain. This amount of interest is forfeited. Deductions in excess of a non-taxable gain can be deducted. 5.31 In the case where deferred interest deductions are less than the non-taxable capital gains, all interest deductions would be forfeited. This is because overall, the taxpayer is still paying tax on less than their actual income from investing in the property. The denied interest deductions will reduce the tax benefit from investing in the property but not completely eliminate it. Example 20: Option F – interest less than the untaxed gain Reuel sells his residential rental property for an untaxed gain of $200k, but $150k of interest has been disallowed during the period the property was rented. Under the current tax rules, Reuel would be taxed on income from the property that is $200k less than his actual income. Under option F, because his deferred interest deduction ($150k) is less than his untaxed capital gain ($200k), all his interest deductions are disallowed and forfeited. This means his taxable income is $50k less than his actual income (compared to $200k under current law). 5.32 In the case where deferred interest deductions are more than the non-taxable capital gains, interest deduction up to the amount of the untaxed capital gain would be forfeited. The amount of interest in excess of this amount would be deductible. This would have the same effect as if all income from the investment were taxable (including capital gains) and expenses were deductible. Example 21: Option F – interest more than the untaxed gain Reuel sells his residential rental property for an untaxed gain of $200k, but $250k of interest has been disallowed during the period the property was rented. Under the current tax rules, Reuel would be taxed on income from the property that is $200k less than his economic income. Under option F the amount of interest up to the untaxed gain ($200k) would be permanently disallowed. 61 The $50k of excess interest would be deductible. This is the same result as if all of the $200k gains were taxable, and all of the $250k interest expense were deductible. In this case, all of Reuel’s actual income from the investment would be taxed. 5.33 This option does introduce risks of arbitrage relative to the ringfencing of losses from revenue account sales described in Option D. This would require similar anti-arbitrage measures. These measures could be achieved through loss ringfencing or modifying the current bright-line anti-arbitrage provision. Relationship between options for property held on revenue or capital account 5.34 The options proposed above represent various degrees of deduction denial. It is important to ensure how interest is treated for both revenue account and capital account properties is consistent and ensuring that any restrictions or anti-arbitrage restrictions are also matched. 5.35 One approach would be that even if some interest on revenue account property is deductible, no interest would be deductible on a capital account sale. This has simplicity advantages while being a rough offset for the non-taxation of capital gains. 5.36 If a more targeted approach were considered, then options A and C should be considered as potential matches for option E, as none of these options allow excess interest (the amount that exceeds a gain on sale) to be deducted. Option B would be a potential match for option F without anti-arbitrage, as they both potentially allow all interest in excess of non-taxable gain to be deducted. Option D could be matched with option F with anti-arbitrage, as both would potentially allow a deduction of interest in excess of non-taxable gain but subject to some restrictions. A table summarising the key impacts of these options is at the end of this chapter. Implementing anti-arbitrage provisions 5.37 Option D incorporates anti-arbitrage provisions, and option F could also incorporate anti-arbitrage provisions. These are important for the Government to discourage the selective sale of residential property to minimise taxable gains and maximise deductible losses, including the deduction for deferred interest expense. This raises conceptual issues (is this a residential rental loss or a capital loss) and mechanical issues for the best way to address it. 5.38 There is an anti-arbitrage provision in the Act to address arbitrage on the sale of bright-line property by ringfencing the bright-line revenue account loss so it can only be used to offset other real property gains (section EL 20). This could be extended to property sold for a loss on revenue account under section CB 6 (purchased with the intention of resale) as it is difficult to determine a taxpayer’s intention. We seek feedback on whether such a provision is desirable or necessary. 5.39 One possibility to apply anti-arbitrage principles to the deferred interest deduction would be to effectively treat the deferred interest as part of the cost of acquisition. In that case, the interest could only be deducted against gains on the sale of property. The restriction would apply to deductible interest 62 related to revenue account properties, and any interest that is deductible for capital account properties. 5.40 Mechanically, this approach could be adopted by amending the bright-line anti-arbitrage rule (section EL 20) to treat the interest deductible on sale as if it were part of the cost of the property. If this means there is a net loss on sale, that provision would restrict the deduction only to offset other real property gains in the same or a later income year. If it is a capital account sale and option F is adopted, the potentially deductible interest could be treated as if it were a revenue account loss on sale of bright-line property under section EL 20, and so the excess interest could only be deducted against taxable gains from the sale of real property. Interest would then not be taken into account for residential rental loss ringfencing. 5.41 Another approach would be to modify the residential loss ring-fencing rules to incorporate anti-arbitrage provisions. In this approach, the separate bright-line anti-arbitrage provision (section EL 20) could be repealed. Instead, a loss on disposal of residential rental property would be treated as a rental loss and be subject to potential deferral of deduction under those provisions. Taxable gains on the sale of residential rental property are already treated as residential rental income, so deductible losses (including the interest component) could be offset against taxable gains and net rental income. 5.42 Chapter 12 on interaction with the residential rental loss ringfencing regime provides additional discussion on how these different disposal options could be incorporated. 5.43 The Government would like to hear from submitters on how different approaches to allowing some interest to be deducted (or no interest to be deducted) on the sale of residential investment property might or might not achieve the Government’s policy objectives. 63 Questions for submitters Below are questions the Government is posing to help focus discussion, though comments on all aspects of these proposals are welcome: • Which option for the treatment of interest on sales of revenue account property best balances housing market incentives, efficient and fair taxation, and protection of the tax base against arbitrage risk? • Should the bright-line anti-arbitrage provision be extended to sales taxable under section CB 6 (purchased with the intention of resale)? • Should some interest deductions be allowed when property is sold on capital account? • What are the trade-offs in considering housing market objectives and tax policy efficiency and equity objectives? • How could anti-arbitrage provisions be incorporated? Do you have any preferences between amending the bright-line anti-arbitrage rule to incorporate interest, or the residential rental loss ringfencing rules to incorporate a revenue account loss? Do you have another approach to suggest? 64 Table 2: Summary of option key impacts Revenue Account Property Options Impact on housing market Degree of taxation Compliance costs, complexity Fiscal Impact Option A – Deductions denied This option would have the greatest impact on the housing market by offering the greatest disincentive to property investment of the options provided. This will likely shift the market in favour of first- time buyers. This option would introduce the highest degree of over taxation for investors by allowing instances where individuals are taxed on losses. Overall, this option represents a significant increase in the amount of taxation compared to the status quo. This is a very simple option and therefore the compliance costs are low. This option is likely to have the highest tax effect as no deductions are permitted. Option B – Deductions allowed but deferred to time of sale As deductions are deferred, this represents a disincentive to property investment compared to the status quo, only to a much lesser degree than option A. This will still likely shift the market in favour of first- time buyers. This option would come closest to taxing economic income. This still represents an increase in taxation compared to the status quo due to the deferral of the interest deduction. The compliance costs for this option are low but slightly higher than option A. Taxpayers must keep track of their incurred interest expense in order to deduct in year of sale. This option will have a low tax effect due to the interest deduction being claimed on sale. Option C – Deductions allowed at time of sale to the extent As deductions are both deferred and limited under this option, this represents a greater The chance that tax will be payable on a net loss is lessened Similar to option B and D. Tax effect is less than option A but higher than option B. 65 Revenue Account Property Options Impact on housing market Degree of taxation Compliance costs, complexity Fiscal Impact they do not create a loss disincentive to property investment than option B, but not to the extent of option A. Consequently, the shift in favour of first- time buyers is likely to be similar to that seen in options A and B. compared to option A. Option D – Deductions allowed at time of sale with anti- arbitrage provisions This option is an alternative approach to achieving a similar outcome as seen in option C. It is more generous than option C, but the impacts should be broadly similar. As above. Higher compliance cost than the others due to the additional requirements of anti- arbitrage.

More taxation than option F as no interest would be deductible. 67 Chapter 6 Development and related activities Government decision on a development exemption 6.1 The Government has agreed in principle that property developers should be provided an exemption from the interest limitation rules. This chapter will consider the scope of the development exemption and the definition of “development.” 6.2 Unless explicitly stated, qualifying for the development exemption from interest limitation does not override or change other provisions which relate to the allowance of deductions for interest. For example, if someone incurs interest to build a house to live in, that would qualify for the development exemption as proposed, but the interest would nevertheless not be deductible due to the private limitation. 24 Design of the exemption 6.3 The exemption should be wide enough in scope to encompass development activity which may result in the construction of a new build (as defined in chapter 7). For certainty and simplicity, the exemption should be largely based on existing tax concepts and provisions relating to property development. 6.4 If a development meets the requirements of the exemption, the exemption will apply whether or not the person holds their property on revenue account (taxable on sale). 6.5 This exemption will apply on a property basis, rather than on a taxpayer basis. Applying the exemption on a property basis allows it to apply to one-off developments as well as developments undertaken as part of a business of developing property. Qualifying development 6.6 Development should include activity which results in a new dwelling that qualifies as a “new build,” consistent with the definition provided in chapter 7. However, development may also be broader than activity that results in a new build. It could include, for example, development which extends the life of a building for the purpose of its continued use (rental) by an investor. This is discussed later under remediation work. 24 The private limitation provides that deductions for expenses are not allowed if they are for private or personal activities and not for earning taxable income. For example, interest incurred on a debt to purchase a home to live in is not deductible as the debt was used to purchase a house used for private purposes. 68 6.7 The intention is that development for these purposes will include making improvements to land which contribute to increasing housing supply. This will include improvements to land, erecting a building or otherwise, that contribute to the creation of a new build. 6.8 The Government proposes to define the activity qualifying for the development exemption based on current terminology in the land sale provisions of the Income Tax Act 2007. This will be broader than what is encompassed by the term “development” in the land sale rules (for example, including erecting buildings). 6.9 The exemption is intended to cover: • land being developed by persons in the business of developing or dealing land or erecting buildings (captured under section CB 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007), and • other developments which may not be covered under section CB 7 but contribute to the creation of a new build. For example, persons undertaking a one-off development or developing properties to rent out themselves (if they are not already in the business of developing or dealing in land or erecting buildings). Statutory provisions relating to development - s ection CB 7 6.10 Section CB 7 provides that land acquired for use by taxpayers as part of certain land-related businesses is held on revenue account. These businesses are: • Dealing in land; • Subdividing and developing land; and • Erecting buildings. 6.11 It is anticipated that almost everyone who develops residential property will hold the property on revenue account under section CB 7 because they are in one of the above businesses. This will account for almost all developments of residential property. We therefore propose that residential investment property that is held on revenue account under section CB 7 should qualify for the development exemption. Other developments 6.12 Although most property developments will be covered by the exemption for property held in section CB 7 businesses, there may be other development activity which creates a new build on land that is not within that exemption. 69 6.13 The exemption should also capture other developments such as: • one-off developments by people not in the business of developing property; and • property development on land not captured by section CB 7 (for example, because the land was not acquired for the purpose of a development business but was nevertheless developed). 6.14 Persons who undertake this type of development activity may not necessarily consider themselves to be “property developers”, however, their activity will still result in an increase to New Zealand’s housing stock. For this reason, they should be able to claim the development exemption. Example 22 – development that is not on revenue account under section CB 7 Aroha buys an empty piece of land to build a house for her whānau. Since it is a large section, she decides to build a second house to rent out. Aroha is not in the business of developing land, so she would not qualify for the exemption for property held in CB 7 businesses. However, her building activity would mean the property qualifies for the development exemption – she has engaged in development activity which has created a new dwelling. Aroha’s property will qualify for the development exemption 25 while the development is taking place and may later transition to the new build exemption. 6.15 We propose that for this type of one-off development, the exemption will apply where: • there is interest on debt relating to residential investment property; • the debt is used for subdivision, development, or erecting a building; and • the activity is carried out for the purpose of creating one or more new builds. 6.16 Other requirements for obtaining an interest deduction, such as incurring the interest in order to derive taxable income, will still need to be met to claim the deduction. 6.17 Examples of developments that may qualify (activities related to creating a new build) include: • building a house; • converting a single house into multiple flats; • converting a commercial or industrial property to a residential property; and • relocating a house; 25 Aroha must still meet the other requirements to obtain a tax deduction for the interest, such as incurring the interest to derive assessable income. Whether these tests are met will depend on the facts of each situation. 70 to the extent that the activity is subdivision or development of land or erecting a building. Remediation 6.18 Remediation work is a grey area where it may be difficult to draw a well- defined boundary on whether it is a development. However, there are grounds for regarding some remediation work as adding to housing supply in the long- term. 6.19 Taxpayers who carry out remediation work professionally as a part of development activity (that is, they buy properties, renovate them, and then sell them) will generally be captured under section CB 7 and will be included in the exemption. 6.20 It may not be appropriate for a property owner who engages in some one-off renovations of a property that are not substantial (such as renovations of a kitchen or bathroom) to get the development exemption, because even though the renovations may make the dwelling more attractive, they do not add to housing supply. On the other hand, remediation can be part of structural improvements (such as, earthquake strengthening and weather tightening) that allow the housing structure to be viable longer than it otherwise would. This kind of remediation adds to housing supply in the longer term and should obtain the development exemption. 6.21 One option would be to only include remediation work as “development” where the work makes a building habitable or extends the life of a building. It would also include work to convert a building from non-residential use (such as a commercial building) into a residential building. 6.22 Remediation may be particularly important to extend the life of some buildings that are not suitable for demolition or where demolition is restricted, such as for heritage buildings. 6.23 If the development exemption is extended to include remediation work, the exemption will only be available for interest on debt used to fund costs that have been or will be capitalised, not where the costs are deductible as incurred. 6.24 The Government seeks submissions on whether remediation work should be included in the exemption, and if so, how this would work. How would remediation that qualifies for the exemption be defined? Should any special criteria apply for buildings that have restrictions on demolition, such as heritage buildings? Timing 6.25 The Government also seeks submissions on when the development exemption should begin. When property is acquired with an intention develop it (for example, land held on revenue account under section CB 7), it would generally be from the time of acquisition of the property. What about properties not 71 acquired with that intention, but where that intention is formed later? Current provisions applicable when a property is converted from a personal use to a taxable use may be relevant, for example, when substantial work is commenced. The Government seek submissions on this. 6.26 The exemption would apply while the property is being developed until the earlier of when the property is sold (settlement date) or until the CCC for a new build is issued. If the property is being held for rental or sale after the CCC is issued, the developer may qualify for the new build exemption from the time the CCC is issued until the property is sold. In the case of remediation of a building for which no new CCC is issued, the exemption would apply until the remediation work is complete. This supports cashflow during the build but prevents overextending the exemption. Amount of interest qualifying for development exemption 6.27 Where property is acquired for a land business (taxable under CB 7) and developed, the exemption should apply for interest related to the acquisition cost, with that interest being deductible immediately. 6.28 Where property is not acquired for the purpose of a land business (for example, it is not on revenue account) but an intent to develop the land is formed sometime after the acquisition, the exemption will apply to the interest on additional debt acquired for the development activity. This approach will apply for debt used to fund qualifying remediation work. In addition to interest on debt to fund the development, interest may be deducted on debt used to acquire the property from the time the development activity is started. How to determine the commencement date and how to apportion if only a portion of the land is being developed would be determined under current practice. Relationship with new build exemption 6.29 In many cases the property resulting from a development benefiting from the development exemption will constitute a new build and will therefore qualify for the new build exemption when sold to an investor or the code compliance certificate (CCC) is issued. How these exemptions relate to each other is discussed in chapter 7 (refer to paragraphs 7.9 to 7.11) and chapter 8 (refer to paragraph 8.12). 6.30 The Government seeks submissions on how the development exemption should work and whether our framing has appropriately captured relevant types of development. 72 Questions for submitters Comments on all aspects of the proposals are welcomed. Below are several questions officials would specifically like to seek feedback on from submitters: • Are there other types of developments or activity which should be covered under this exemption? • Should land dealers (who are included under section CB 7) be carved out from the proposed section CB 7 safe harbour? • Do you agree with the proposed criteria for the development exemption to apply? • Should remediation work be included? If so, what types of remediation work should be included? If some remediation work is included, how would this relate to the new build exemption? How does partially including remediation work impact heritage buildings? • When should interest begin to be deductible when property is not acquired for the purpose of development, but that intention is formed later? • What is the amount of interest on debt that should qualify for the exemption when property was not acquired for the purpose of development, but development activity commenced some time later? 73 Chapter 7 Definition of new build What does this chapter cover? 7.1 The Government proposes that owners of new builds will have: • a five-year bright-line test (“new build bright-line test”); and • an exemption from the proposed interest limitation rules. 7.2 This chapter sets out a proposed definition of a “new build”. The Government invites your views on how a new build should be defined to best achieve the objective for the new build rules, which is to maintain new housing supply notwithstanding the extended ten-year bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rule. Definition of new build 7.3 The Government considers property should only qualify as a new build where residential housing supply has clearly increased. This will occur where a self- contained dwelling (with its own kitchen and bathroom) has been added to residential land and the dwelling has received a code compliance certificate (“CCC”). However, this must be balanced with the need for simple and accessible rules that can be easily understood and complied with by taxpayers, and readily administered by Inland Revenue. 7.4 Throughout this discussion document three new build categories are used: simple new builds, complex new builds, and commercial-residential conversions. Each category is considered in more detail below. Simple new builds 7.5 Simple new builds involve adding one or more self-contained dwellings to bare residential land. This includes: • Adding a dwelling to bare land. This is where one or more dwellings are added to bare residential land. It does not matter whether a new build is fully or partially constructed on-site, so it can include a modular home, and would include a dwelling that has been relocated onto the land. 26 • Replacing an existing dwelling with one or more dwellings. This is where an existing dwelling is removed or demolished and is replaced with one or more dwellings. It is proposed that one-for-one replacements would qualify even though there is no increase in housing supply, 26 While relocated dwellings are existing buildings, most of these dwellings would likely be demolished if they were not relocated and installed on new sites. Dwellings are regularly relocated off a site to allow for land to be developed. Installing and making any necessary improvements to relocated dwellings is also likely to require fewer building materials than constructing completely new dwellings. By adding a relocated dwelling to land, housing supply is increased. 74 because it may be administratively difficult to distinguish between cases where an existing dwelling is replaced with multiple new dwellings and where a new dwelling is replacing an existing dwelling one-for-one. A CCC for a new dwelling may not show what was on the land before the new dwelling was added but may instead just show that a new dwelling has been added to the land. In most cases it is also expected that where an existing dwelling is replaced, it will be replaced with multiple new dwellings. Complex new builds 7.6 Complex new builds involve adding one or more self-contained dwellings to residential land that already has an existing dwelling on it, without separate title being issued for the new build portion of the land. 27 This includes: • Adding a standalone dwelling. This is where a dwelling is added to residential land without making any changes to the existing dwelling. For example, adding a dwelling to an existing dwelling’s front or backyard. • Attaching a new dwelling to an existing dwelling. For example, where a dwelling is added on top of, underneath, or next to an existing dwelling on residential land. • Splitting an existing dwelling into multiple dwellings. This is where residential land has an existing dwelling on it that is converted into multiple self-contained dwellings. For example, where a six-bedroom house is converted into three two-bedroom units. While conversions utilise existing buildings, they add to housing supply by enabling multiple households to occupy a space that previously only accommodated one household. Significant renovations may be required as part of conversions, including adding in new kitchens and bathrooms, as well as firewalls between the dwellings. 7.7 These new builds are considered complex because the presence of an existing dwelling on the land means apportionment is likely to be required for both the new build exemption from interest limitation and the new build bright-line test (refer to paragraphs 8.27 to 8.29 and paragraphs 9.10 to 9.13 for more information). Commercial to residential conversions 7.8 This new build category covers the conversion of commercial buildings into self-contained dwellings. An example is an office building that is converted into apartments, or a large commercial heritage building such as a harbour warehouse that is converted into townhouses. While conversions make use of existing buildings, including them in the definition of a new build supports the Government’s objective of increasing housing supply, and should be administratively simple to verify. It may also be faster to convert commercial 27 It is proposed that where land is subdivided and a new build is added to the subdivided section, the subdivided section with the new build on it would be considered a new build (and would fall within the “adding a new dwelling to bare land” category mentioned in paragraph 7.5 above. Apportionment may be required in these cases. Refer to paragraphs 8.27 to 8.29 as well as paragraphs 9.10 to 9.13 for more information. 75 property into dwellings than it is to build brand new dwellings, and should require the use of fewer building materials. Renovations that do not clearly increase housing supply excluded 7.9 The Government proposes that renovations to existing dwellings that do not result in an additional dwelling on the land would not be eligible for the new build rules. For example, adding a new room to an existing dwelling, or improving the quality of an existing dwelling by modernising an outdated kitchen or bathroom, would not be eligible. These sorts of renovations do not clearly increase housing stock, and it could be hard to distinguish between substantial and minor renovations. Some remediation work done to existing dwellings may be eligible under the development exemption – refer to paragraphs 6.18 to 6.24 for more information. 7.10 In principle, renovating an uninhabitable dwelling so that it becomes habitable seems similar to replacing an existing dwelling with a new dwelling, especially if the dwelling is brought up to the standard of a new build. However, differentiating between this and other renovations is likely to be difficult so the Government proposes that these properties would not be considered new builds. The Government invites your views on this issue and is particularly interested in whether there are any tools that could be used to verify that a once uninhabitable house has been renovated so that it becomes habitable. If a significantly renovated (formerly uninhabitable) dwelling were to be eligible for the new build exemption, any overlap with or transition from the development exemption would need to be considered further (to the extent any remediation work done to the dwelling would also be eligible for the development exemption). Impact of eligibility for the development exemption on definition of new build 7.11 New builds may also potentially be eligible for the development exemption while they are being constructed or added to the land. Whether property is eligible for the development exemption does not affect whether that property is later considered a new build. For more information on the development exemption, refer to chapter 6. The transition from the development exemption to the new build exemption for the proposed new interest limitation rules is specifically considered in paragraph 8.12. 76 Questions for submitters Comments on all aspects of the proposals are welcomed. Below are several questions that the Government would specifically like to seek feedback on from submitters: • What do you think of the proposed definition of new build? • Are there any issues that you think the Government should consider in relation to the definition of new build and: − papakāinga housing? − heritage buildings? • Is there some tool that could be used to identify when a dwelling that is completely uninhabitable has been improved significantly, such that it has added to housing supply? 77 Chapter 8 New build exemption from interest limitation What does this chapter cover? 8.1 This chapter considers the design of the new build exemption from the proposed interest limitation rule. In this chapter, “new build exemption” specifically refers to the exemption from the interest limitation rule for new builds. 8.2 The main issues in this chapter that the Government would like your views on are who the new build exemption should apply to (only the early owner of a new build, or also subsequent purchasers) and for how long. The Government’s proposed definition of new build is covered separately in chapter 7. 8.3 The Government is not consulting on whether there should be a new build exemption from the proposed interest limitation rule – this has already been decided. What is the new build exemption? 8.4 The new build exemption is an exemption from the proposed interest limitation rule. If the exemption applies, then the interest limitation rule does not apply. This means interest that would have been deductible absent the interest limitation rule will continue to be deductible for debt relating to new builds. This includes interest on borrowings to acquire residential land that a new build is on, to construct a new build, or to fund other expenses relating to a new build such as maintenance, rates, or insurance. The new build exemption will not allow interest deductions that are not available under current law (for example, a taxpayer acquiring a new build to live in will still be denied interest deductions under the private limitation 28 ). 8.5 The new build exemption applies to new builds as defined in chapter 7. This includes simple new builds, complex new builds, and commercial to residential conversions. For complex new builds (where land has both a new build and a non-new build on it), only interest relating to the new build is eligible for the new build exemption (refer to the section on apportionment from paragraphs 8.27 to 8.29 for more information). 28 The private limitation in section DA 2(2) denies deductions for expenditure or loss that is of a private or domestic nature. 78 General rule: only new builds with a CCC issued on or after 27 March 2021 eligible 8.6 The Government proposes that whether the new build exemption applies to residential land will generally depend on when a new build is added to the land. If a new build receives its code compliance certificate (“CCC”), indicating that a new dwelling has been added to the land, on or after 27 March 2021 then the new build exemption applies to an early owner (and potentially also subsequent purchasers, depending on what the Government decides – refer to paragraphs 8.9 to 8.21) of the land. Example 23: New build with CCC issued on or after 27 March 2021 Will enters into an agreement to acquire a residential investment property off the plans in January 2021. In November 2021 the new build receives its CCC, and title for the property is registered to Will at this time. New build exemption applies from date agreement entered into Jan uar y 20 2 1 27 March 202 1 November 2021 Agreement entered into CCC issued, title registered Will may use the new build exemption to deduct interest incurred in relation to the property from the date he enters into the agreement\* (provided the interest is deductible under existing tax rules). Will qualifies for the exemption because the new build’s CCC is issued on or after 27 March 2021. \*For more information on when it is proposed the exemption would apply to allow interest deductions from, refer to paragraphs 8.11 and 8.12. 8.7 This chapter uses the term “early owner” to refer to a person who acquires a new build or has added a new build to their land in the circumstances described in paragraph 8.10. It does not matter whether the land is acquired before, on, or after 27 March 2021. Nor does it matter when construction begins, provided the new build’s CCC is issued on or after 27 March 2021. How an early owner and subsequent purchaser could be defined is considered in more detail from paragraph 8.9. Transitional rule: exception for certain new builds with a CCC issued before 27 March 2021 8.8 The Government has decided that a transitional rule will apply for certain new builds acquired on or after 27 March 2021 that received their CCCs before 27 March 2021. For these new builds, the new build exemption will apply to an early owner provided the new build is acquired on or after 27 March 2021 and no later than 12 months after it received its CCC. See paragraph 8.14 for more information on this. 79 Early owners and subsequent purchasers 8.9 The Government invites your views on whether the new build exemption should apply to early owners of new builds only, or if the exemption should also apply to subsequent purchasers. Proposed definitions for early owners and subsequent purchasers, as well as how the exemption could apply depending on the type of new build, are considered further below. Early owners 8.10 The Government proposes that the exemption would apply to early owners of new builds. For the purposes of this discussion document, an early owner is a person who: • acquires a new build off the plans (before a CCC is issued for the new build); • acquires an already constructed new build no later than 12 months after the new build’s CCC is issued; 29 • adds a new build to bare land; • adds a complex new build to land; or • completes a commercial-residential conversion. When would the exemption apply from? 8.11 As set out in chapter 7, the Government proposes that a new build would be defined to include simple new builds, complex new builds, and commercial to residential conversions. Table 3 sets out when the new build exemption would apply from for early owners, 30 depending on the type of new build. 8.12 The table also provides a high-level overview of whether, and to whom, the development exemption applies. The development exemption applies up until the date a CCC is issued for a new build. If a developer retains a new build for a period after CCC is issued, it is proposed that the new build exemption would apply to the developer up until settlement of the property. The development exemption may apply to the developer concurrently with the new build exemption applying for the purchaser of the new build. For more detailed information on how the development exemption applies, refer to chapter 6. 29 The rationale for allowing anyone who acquires a new build within 12 months of its CCC being issued to be an “early owner” is to ensure the first genuine investor is able to benefit from the new build bright-line test. A new build may change hands a number of times before it is finally acquired by a person as a long-term investment property. 30 Note that the table is only relevant for early owners. For subsequent purchasers (if the Government decides subsequent purchasers are eligible for the exemption), the new build exemption would apply from the date the subsequent purchaser acquires the land. 80 Table 3 Type of new build Development exemption applies to: New build exemption applies to: Simple new builds Sale of completed new build The person who added the new build to the land, until the date the new build’s CCC is issued. If the CCC is issued before the property is disposed of (settlement date), the developer will also be entitled to the new build exemption from the date the new build’s CCC is issued until the date of settlement. The person who acquires the completed new build, from the date of acquisition (a CCC will have been issued before acquisition for these new builds) . 31 Off the plans acquisitions The person who adds the new build to the land. Can apply at the same time as the new build exemption applies to the off the plans purchaser. Development exemption ends on the date the new build’s CCC is issued. The off the plans purchaser, from the date of acquisition. Adding new builds to bare land (excludes off the plans acquisitions), not for immediate sale The person while they are adding the new build to the land. Development exemption ends on the date the new build’s CCC is issued. The person who adds the new build to the land, from the date a CCC is issued for the new build. Complex new builds All complex new builds (where there is a new build and an existing non-new build on the same title), not for immediate sale 32 The person while they are adding the new build to the land, until the date the new build’s CCC is issued. The person who adds the new build to the land, from the date a CCC is issued for the new build. Apportionment rules may apply if interest incurred relates to both the new build and non-new build on the land. Commercial to residential conversions Commercial buildings converted into dwellings The person converting the commercial buildings into dwellings, until the date a CCC is issued for the dwellings. The person who converted the dwellings, from the date a CCC is issued for the newly converted dwellings. 31 This would allow a person who has taken out a loan in order to fund their deposit to claim interest deductions (provided there is sufficient nexus with an income earning activity, in accordance with existing tax principles regarding interest deductions). 32 This includes adding a standalone dwelling on land with an existing dwelling; attaching a dwelling to an existing dwelling; and splitting an existing dwelling into multiple dwellings. 81 Example 24: Early owner of complex new build Amber acquires residential land from Will on 1 May 2021 for $1m. The land has an existing (non-new build) dwelling on it. After acquiring the land, Amber adds a new build to the section. The new build receives its CCC on 5 June 2022. Development exemption Amber acquires land and existing dwelling Amber ad ds new build, CCC is issued New build exemption 1 May 20 2 1 5 J une 202 2 The new build exemption applies from the date the CCC for the new build is issued, and allows Amber to deduct interest on or after 5 June 2022 on loans for: • the cost of adding the new build to the land; • the portion of the $1m purchase price for the land that is attributable to the new build; and • other expenses relating to the property, to the extent they are attributable to the new build (for more information on apportionment, refer to paragraphs 8.27 to 8.29). The development exemption applies to Amber before the CCC is issued, because she is adding a new build to the land. For more information on the development exemption and how it would apply to taxpayers like Amber, please refer to chapter 6. When would the exemption expire? 8.13 How long the exemption would apply to early owners has not been decided and is considered further from paragraph 8.20. Transitional rule for new builds with CCCs issued before 27 March 2021 8.14 As mentioned above, the Government has decided that the exemption will also apply to new builds that received their CCCs before 27 March 2021 in certain circumstances. This transitional rule applies to a person who acquires land with such a new build on it, provided they acquire the land on or after 27 March 2021, and no later than 12 months after the CCC is issued. 82 Example 25: Transitional rule for early owners Xavier acquires residential land on 1 May 2021. The residential land has a new build on it, which received its CCC on 20 December 2020. CCC issued Early owner if acquired during this period New build acquired 20 December 2020 2 7 Mar ch 20 2 1 1 Ma y 2 021 19 December 2021 Since Xavier has acquired the land no later than 12 months after the new build received its CCC, Xavier is considered an early owner of the new build. The new build exemption applies to enable Xavier to deduct interest he incurs in relation to the land. It does not matter that the new build received its CCC before 27 March 2021. Subsequent purchasers 8.15 The Government is consulting on whether the exemption should be available to subsequent purchasers. 8.16 If the new build exemption were to apply to subsequent purchasers, a subsequent purchaser would generally be defined as a person who acquires a new build more than 12 months after a CCC for the new build is issued. When would the exemption apply from? 8.17 Interest would be deductible from the date a subsequent purchaser acquires residential land with a new build on it and would continue to be deductible until the new build exemption expires. When would the exemption expire? 8.18 If the exemption is available for subsequent purchasers, the Government proposes it would only be available for a fixed period, for example for ten or 20 years from the date a new build’s CCC is issued. How long the exemption would apply to subsequent purchasers for has not been decided and is considered further below. 83 Example 26: Subsequent purchaser This example assumes the new build exemption applies to subsequent purchasers of a new build for a fixed period of 20 years from the date a CCC for the new build is issued. The period the new build exemption could apply to subsequent purchasers for is discussed from paragraph 8.20. Xavier acquires residential land on 1 May 2021. The residential land has a new build on it which received its CCC on 15 April 2021. Since Xavier has acquired the land no later than 12 months after the new build received its CCC, the new build exemption applies to enable Xavier (as an early owner of the new build) to deduct interest he incurs in relation to the land. Early owner if acquired during this period 15 April 2021 1 Ma y 2 021 14 April 2022 CCC issued New build acquired Xavier sells the land on 31 October 2022 to Steph. 15 April 2021 1 May 2021 14 April 2022 31 October 2022 14 April 2041 Early owner if acquired during this period CCC issued Subsequent purchaser if acquired during this period Steph acquires new build Exemption ends Xavier acquires new build The new build exemption applies to Steph as a subsequent purchaser because Steph acquired the land more than 12 months after the new build on the land received its CCC, within 20 years of the CCC being issued, and the CCC was issued on or after 27 March 2021. The exemption applies to allow Steph to deduct interest until 14 April 2041 (which is 20 years after a CCC was issued for the new build). No transitional rule for new builds with CCCs before 27 March 2021 8.19 If the exemption were to apply to subsequent purchasers, the Government proposes the exemption for subsequent purchasers would only apply for new builds that receive their CCCs on or after 27 March 2021. This means the exemption would not apply to subsequent purchasers of new builds that received their CCCs before 27 March 2021. 84 Example 27: No transitional rule for subsequent purchasers Xavier acquires residential land on 1 May 2021. The residential land has a new build on it, which received its CCC on 20 December 2020. Since Xavier has acquired the land no later than 12 months after the new build received its CCC, the new build exemption applies to enable Xavier (as an early owner) to deduct interest he incurs in relation to the land. It does not matter that the new build received its CCC before 27 March 2021. CCC issued Early owner if acquired during this period New build acquired 20 December 2020 27 March 2021 1 Ma y 2 021 19 December 2021 Steph acquires the residential land from Xavier on 31 October 2022. 20 December 2020 1 May 2021 31 October 2022 Interest deductible for Xavier as an early owner CCC issued Xavier acquires new build No interest deductions for Steph as subsequent purchaser Steph acquires new build The new build exemption does not apply to Steph in respect of the land, because Steph acquired the land more than 12 months after the new build on the land received its CCC (she is a subsequent purchaser) and the new build received its CCC before 27 March 2021. It does not matter that the new build exemption previously applied to Xavier in respect of the land – this does not affect the application of the exemption to Steph. Who should the exemption apply to and for how long? 8.20 The Government is interested in your views on who the exemption should apply to and for how long. The Government is considering three options: • In perpetuity for early owners. The exemption would apply for the entire time an early owner retains their interest in the land. • In perpetuity for early owners and a fixed period for subsequent purchasers. The period would start from the date a new build’s CCC is issued and would not reset when the land is sold. For example, if a 20- year exemption applies and the early owner sells after seven years, the exemption would apply to the subsequent purchaser for the remainder of the 20-year period (that is, 13 years). There would be no limit on the number of subsequent purchasers a property could have within the fixed period. • For a fixed period for both early owners and subsequent purchasers. The period would start from the date a new build’s CCC is issued and would have a fixed time limit that applies to both early owners and subsequent purchasers, for example 20 years. If an early owner acquires a new build off the plans, it is proposed that the exemption would apply to them from the date they acquire the property. The fixed period the 85 exemption runs for would still be calculated from the date a CCC is issued for the new build. 8.21 The impact of the new build exemption on house prices and on the supply of new builds will depend on both the length of the exemption and whether it can be passed on to subsequent investors: Impact on house prices • Length of the exemption: A longer exemption allows for more interest deductions by investors. Therefore, a longer exemption will dampen house prices by less than a shorter exemption. • Ability to pass on the exemption: The ability to pass on the exemption to subsequent purchasers supports resale value and will dampen house prices by less than if the exemption cannot be passed on. Impact on supply of new builds • Supply response: The removal of interest deductibility could reduce the incentive to build in the short-term, by reducing house prices. Since longer exemptions have less impact on house prices, it follows that longer exemptions and allowing the exemption to be passed on to subsequent buyers could have less negative impact on housing supply than shorter exemptions. However, the extent to which interest limitation will reduce housing supply remains unclear. 86 Example 28: Different application periods The examples below assume that the residential land is rented out and that interest would have been deductible in the absence of the proposed new interest limitation rule. They also assume that if the exemption applies for a fixed period, it applies for 20 years from the date a CCC for a new build is issued. In perpetuity for early owners Amber enters into an agreement for an off the plans acquisition of a residential investment property on 1 May 2021. The new build receives its CCC on 5 June 2022, and title transfers to Amber at this time. Amber is an early owner of the new build so may deduct interest in relation to the new build (and the land that it is on) for the entire length of time Amber retains her interest in the land. For example, if Amber decides to sell the land on 2 May 2051, then she will be able to deduct interest up until this point (so for 30 years). The subsequent purchaser of the land, who acquires it from Amber in 2051, would not get any interest deductions under the new build exemption. Exemption applies to Amber (interest is deductible) Amber acquires new build off the plans New build receives a CCC No interest deductions for subsequent purchasers 1 Ma y 2 021 5 June 2022 2 Ma y 2 051 Amber sells new build Alternate facts – in perpetuity for early owner, fixed period for subsequent purchasers Same facts as the in-perpetuity example Amber sells the land on 2 May 2051 to Steph. Amber may deduct interest up until this point (so for 30 years). The new build exemption does not apply to Steph because more than 20 years have passed since the CCC for the new build was issued (the CCC was issued on 5 June 2022, which was almost 30 years ago). Exemption applies to Amber (interest is deductible) New build receives a CCC No interest deductions for Steph (fixed period has ended) 1 Ma y 2 021 5 June 2022 4 June 2042 2 Ma y 2 051 Fixed period for subsequent purchasers ends Amber acquires new build Amber sells new build Alternate facts: Amber sells land in 2030 Amber sells the land to Blair on 24 October 2030. The exemption applies to allow Amber to deduct interest for the period she has the land (so from 1 May 2021 until 24 October 2030). The exemption also applies to allow Blair to deduct interest from 24 October 2030 until 4 June 2042, because it applies for 20 years from the date the new build’s CCC was issued. 1 May 202 1 5 June 2022 24 October 2030 4 June 2042 Exemption applies to Amber (inte re st is deducti ble) Amber acquires new build Exemption applies to Blair (inte re st is deducti ble) Fixed period en ds New build receives a CCC Amber sells to Blair 87 Alternate facts – fixed period for early owner and subsequent purchasers Same facts as the in-perpetuity example Amber holds the land until 2 May 2051.

Any interest incurred by Amber in relation to the land between 5 June 2042 and 2 May 2051 is not deductible under the exemption. Alternate facts: Amber sells land in 2030 Amber sells the land to Blair on 24 October 2030. 1 May 202 1 5 June 2022 24 October 2030 4 June 2042 Exemption applies to Amber (inte re st is deducti ble) Amber acquires new build Exemption applies to Blair (inte re st is deducti ble) Fixed period en ds New build receives a CCC Amber sells to Blair The exemption applies to allow Amber to deduct interest for the period she has holds the land (so from 1 May 2021 until 24 October 2030). The exemption also applies to allow Blair to deduct interest from 24 October 2030 until 4 June 2042, because it applies for 20 years from the date the new build’s CCC was issued. Alternate facts: Blair sells the land in 2035 Instead of retaining the land until the exemption expires in 2042, Blair sells the land to Cicillia on 23 October 2035. Cicillia holds onto the land until 2 May 2051. No interest deductions Exemption applies to Amber (inte re st is deducti ble) Exemption applies to subsequent purchasers (inte re st is deducti ble) 1 Ma y 2 021 5 June 2022 24 October 2030 23 October 2035 4 June 2042 2 May 2051 New build receives a CCC Amber sells to Blair Cicillia sells Amber acquires new build Blair sells to Cicillia Fix ed per io d en ds Applying the exemption, Blair may deduct interest incurred in relation to the land until he sells the land to Cicillia (so up until 23 October 2035). Cicillia may deduct interest incurred in relation to the land from 23 October 2035 until 4 June 2042. From 5 June 2042 until she sells the land on 2 May 2051, Cicillia is unable to deduct interest incurred in relation to the land, because the exemption no longer applies. 88 Impact of use as main home on new build character 8.22 The Government invites your views on whether a property should cease to qualify for the new build exemption once it has been lived in by an owner- occupier (‘continued investment rule’). If this were the case, then where a new build is initially used as a rental property, interest would be deductible for that period. If the new build is later lived in by an owner-occupier, interest would not be deductible (in accordance with existing tax rules). If the property were to be rented out after it is lived in by an owner-occupier, interest would not be deductible. 8.23 The continued investment rule would have a greater effect in terms of directing investors to invest in new property, rather than existing property, compared with not having such a rule. The rule would mean that a new build would only qualify for the exemption if it has always been used as an investment property, which means more new builds will cease to be eligible for the new build exemption sooner. 8.24 Applying the rule means that if an early owner of a new build: • lives in the new build, the new build will never be eligible for the exemption; • uses the new build as an investment property initially for a period and then moves into it, no exemption would be available in respect of the property for subsequent purchasers; or • uses the new build as an investment property and then sells the new build to a subsequent purchaser who lives in it, the property will cease to be eligible for the exemption once the subsequent purchaser starts to live in it, even if the subsequent purchaser later sells the property to an investor. 8.25 The continued investment rule would mean that subsequent purchasers will not be able to just consider the CCC date for a new build to determine whether the exemption applies to them, if the exemption applies for a fixed period from the date a new build’s CCC is issued – they will also need to ascertain whether it has ever been owner-occupied. 8.26 However, as mentioned above, the continued investment rule would ensure that the exemption ceases to apply to more new builds sooner. It would also ensure that owner-occupied properties, no matter the build date, are treated the same way. The Government is interested in your views on how practicable it would be to have the continued investment rule, and whether you think the rule supports the objective of the new build exemption. Things to consider include: • maximising the incentive for developers to construct new builds and sell them; • discouraging the accumulation of ‘old’ new builds that qualify for the exemption, in order to best support the Government’s objective of dampening investor demand for existing housing stock; • ease of compliance and administration; and 89 • any equity issues arising both between owners of new builds who are owner-occupiers or investors, and potential subsequent purchasers who could be owner-occupiers or investors. Example 29: applying the continued investment rule This example assumes a twenty-year fixed period applies to both early owners and subsequent purchasers. Two completed townhouses in the same complex are purchased by Emma and Paul. The townhouses receive their CCCs, and title is registered for each townhouse on 25 August 2022 to Emma and Paul respectively. Emma holds onto her townhouse until 4 May 2032. She uses the new build as a long- term residential rental for this period. She may deduct interest incurred in relation to the new build until she sells it to Jared. Jared buys the house from Emma on 4 May 2032 and continues to use it as a rental property. Jared may deduct interest he incurs in relation to the property until 24 August 2042, which is when the fixed period the new build exemption applies for expires. Exemption applies to allow interest deductions Emma acquires Townhouse Jared buys Townhouse Exemption townhouse ren ted ou t townhouse ren ted ou t ceases 2 5 Au gu st 20 2 2 4 May 20 3 2 2 4 Au gu st 20 4 2 Paul rents his townhouse out until 31 December 2027. He may deduct interest incurred in relation to the townhouse from the date he acquires it until 31 December 2027. He then decides to move into the townhouse on 1 January 2028, and lives in it until 1 May 2035, at which point he sells it to Gabi. Gabi then rents the property out. Even though Gabi is using the townhouse as a rental property, she may not deduct any interest she incurs in relation to the townhouse. The continued investment rule applies to stop interest deductions for the property from the point Paul lives in the townhouse as an owner-occupier. It does not matter that the property is later used as an investment property by Gabi. Exemption applies to allow interest deductions Exemp tion does not app ly because of continued investm ent rule Paul b uys Townhouse Paul moves in - G abi b u ys townhouse ren ted ou t exemption ceases townhouse 2 5 Au gu st 20 2 2 1 January 2028 1 May 2035 Paul This example illustrates how two properties that are identical could have different tax outcomes because of the continued investment rule. Even though Jared and Gabi own properties that are virtually identical, assuming all their costs are the same and they receive the same amount of rent for their townhouses, Jared would be better off than Gabi because he is able to deduct interest until 24 August 2042, but Gabi is not able to deduct any interest she incurs in relation to her townhouse. Gabi would be aware however when she purchases the property that it has previously been occupied by Paul, and she may adjust the amount she is willing to pay for the 90 property to take the lack of interest deductions available to her in respect of the property into account. Paul’s decision to move into his townhouse may be distorted by the continued investment rule, however, because by moving into the property he is likely to negatively impact upon the house’s resale value. What apportionment rules should apply? 8.27 Where a new build and a non-new build that are on the same title are purchased, existing apportionment principles would apply. The new build exemption would only apply to interest on the portion of the purchase price borrowing that relates to the new build. 8.28 Where a taxpayer adds a new build to land that already has a non-new build on it, the taxpayer would be allowed interest deductions for all borrowings incurred to add the new build to the land. Interest deductions for borrowings used to acquire the land, and any interest costs for other borrowings that relate to both the new build and the existing dwelling, would need to be reasonably apportioned between the new build and the existing dwelling. Apportionment would be on the basis of existing principles. 8.29 The Government invites your views on whether you support apportionment applying for complex cases, or if you would prefer a different approach. If apportionment were not allowed, then separate title could be required for any new build added to land, so that any new builds are not on the same title as old builds. Alternatively, a predominant test could apply, so in cases where more land area is covered by a new build than a non-new build, the new build exemption would apply to allow deductions for any interest that relates to the land (including the non-new build on the land). 91 Questions for submitters Comments on all aspects of the proposals are welcomed. Below are several questions that the Government would specifically like to seek feedback on from submitters: • Should the new build exemption apply only to early owners, or to both early owners and subsequent purchasers? • What application period for the exemption do you think best achieves the objective of incentivising (or not disincentivising) continued investment in new housing? The options are: in perpetuity for an early owner only; in perpetuity for an early owner and for a fixed period for subsequent purchasers; or for a fixed period for both the early owner and subsequent purchasers. • Are there any issues that specifically relate to the new build exemption and: − papakāinga housing? − heritage buildings? − the purpose-built rentals sector? • How should the new build exemption from the interest limitation rule apply where interest relates to both a new build and a non-new build? Do you agree with the proposed approach (which would require apportionment rules to be applied), or do you prefer an alternative approach (such as requiring separate title or applying a predominant test)? (Refer to paragraphs 8.27 to 8.29 for more information). • Do you have any suggestions for simple ways to prove that a person qualifies for the new build exemption, or ways that Inland Revenue could use existing data to check eligibility? • What issues might result from relying on CCCs to verify that a person (and their land) is eligible for the new build exemption? Are there particular integrity issues the Government needs to consider? • What could be used to verify that a person who acquires a property off the plans is eligible for the new build exemption, if that person wants to deduct interest before a CCC is issued? • How practicable is the continued investment rule (described from paragraphs 8.22 to 8.26)? Do you think the rule is a good idea (considering the criteria mentioned in paragraph 8.26)? 92 Chapter 9 Five-year bright-line test for new builds What does this chapter cover? 9.1 This chapter considers the design of the five-year bright-line test for new builds (“new build bright-line test”). It sets out what the new build bright-line test is and who it is proposed that the test would apply to. The Government’s proposed definition of new build is covered separately in chapter 7. The Government invites your views on how the new build bright-line test should be designed. Background 9.2 The bright-line test taxes gains from residential land disposed of within a specified period (the “bright-line period”) after the transfer of the land to the person was registered on the title, subject to limited exclusions (such as for the main home). If a person disposes of land before they are registered on the title, the bright-line period runs from the date the person entered into an agreement to purchase the land (or the date they otherwise acquired an interest in the land). 9.3 The length of the bright-line period depends on when the land was acquired. If land was acquired on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021, a five-year bright-line period applies. For land acquired on or after 27 March 2021, the general bright-line period is now ten-years, unless an exclusion 33 or the new build bright-line test applies to the land. What is the new build bright-line test? 9.4 The new build bright-line test is proposed to apply to all or part of a piece of residential land that has a “new build” on it, but only if the land is acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 34 The Government’s proposed definition of new build is discussed in chapter 7. If the new build bright-line test applies, then a five- year bright-line period applies instead of the general ten-year bright-line period. Other settings for the ten-year bright-line test apply 9.5 Excluding the length of the bright-line period itself, the Government proposes that the new build bright-line test would have the same settings as the general 33 There are exclusions for main homes, inherited property, and land transferred under settlements of relationship property – refer to sections CB 16A, CB 6A(12), FC 9, and FB 3A. 34 For tax law purposes, land acquired before 27 March 2021 that is subdivided after this date will be subject to the previous rules (for example, the five-year bright-line test that applied for land acquired on or after 29 March 2018 but before 27 March 2021). The five-year new build bright-line test will not be relevant. 93 ten-year bright-line test. For example, the recent amendments to how the main home exclusion applies would also apply for the new build bright-line test. 35 When would the new build bright-line period start and end? 9.6 The bright-line period would start and end in the same way as the general bright-line test. This means the bright-line period would generally start on the date title for residential land 36 is registered to a person, and end on the date the person disposes of the land. Example 30: Bright-line period Amber acquires title to bare residential land on 1 May 2021. Amber adds a new build to the land, which receives its CCC on 5 June 2022. Amber rents the new build out, and then sells it on 1 October 2027. Amber sells new build 1 Ma y 2 021 5 June 2022 30 April 2026 1 Octo ber 20 27 Gains taxed under bright-li ne if sold New build receives a CCC Title registered to Ambe r En d of n ew bu ild bright-line period The bright-line period begins on 1 May 2021 when title was issued to Amber, not from the date the new build received its CCC. Therefore, Amber will not be taxed on the gains when she sells the land on 1 October 2027, because that is more than five years after title for the land is transferred to Amber. The new build bright-line test applies to early owners 9.7 The Government proposes that the new build bright-line test would only apply to early owners 37 of new builds (the proposed definition of new build is set out in chapter 7). “Early owner” has the same meaning for both the new build bright-line test and the new build exemption from the proposed interest limitation rule. As mentioned in paragraph 8.10, an early owner is a person who: • acquires residential land with an already constructed new build on it, no later than 12 months after a CCC is issued for the new build, 38 35 For more information, see https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/-/media/project/ir/tp/publications/2021/2021-sr-arferm- act/2021-sr-arferm-act-pdf.pdf 36 This is also the case for commercial land that is converted to residential land before sale. Refer to paragraph 7.8 for more information on commercial to residential conversions and when these would qualify as new builds. 37 It is not proposed that the new build bright-line test would apply to subsequent purchasers. 38 The rationale for allowing anyone who acquires a new build within 12 months of its CCC being issued to be an “early owner” is to ensure the first genuine investor is able to benefit from the new build bright-line test. A new build may change hands a number of times before it is finally acquired by a person as a long-term investment property. 94 • acquires a new build off the plans (it does not matter if the new build’s CCC is issued more than 12 months after acquisition); or • adds a new build to residential land, which includes simple new builds (refer to paragraph 7.5); complex new builds (refer to paragraphs 7.6 and 7.7); and commercial to residential conversions (refer to paragraph 7.8). (It does not matter if the CCC is issued more than 12 months after acquisition). 9.8 As mentioned above, the new build bright-line test only applies to new builds on land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. For the new build bright-line test to apply instead of the general ten-year bright-line test, a CCC for the new build must be issued by the time the land is sold by the early owner. This requirement is necessary so that Inland Revenue can objectively verify that the new build bright-line test applies. New build includes second homes, holiday homes and vacant homes 9.9 The new build bright-line test could potentially apply to all residential land that has a new build on it, regardless of what the land is used for, unless an exclusion applies (such as the main home exclusion). It does not matter whether a new build is rented out long-term, left vacant, used as a second home or holiday home, or is rented out as short-stay accommodation. Example 31: New build initially main home and then used as short-stay rental James purchases a completed new build. He receives title for the land on 3 October 2022. The land has a new build on it which received its CCC on 5 June 2022. James lives in the property for three years as his main home. James then rents the new build out as short-stay rental accommodation from 3 October 2025 until he sells the land on 3 April 2027. Gains taxed under bright-li ne if sold Main home exclusion James sells new build New build receives a CCC 5 June 2022 3 Oc to ber 20 22 3 October 2025 3 A pril 202 7 2 October 2027 En d of n ew bu ild bright -line period Title registered to James James starts renting new build out The bright-line test would not apply to tax any gains on sale for the period James lived in the property as his main home (from 3 October 2022 to 2 October 2025) 39 . However, the gain in respect of the period that James rented the property out (from 3 October 2025 to 3 April 2027) would be taxed under the new build bright-line test, because James sold the property within five years of t he title being registered to him. It would not make any difference if the facts were reversed, and James rented the property first and then occupied it as his main home. 39 The amount James is treated as deriving on the sale is adjusted under section CB 6A(6) and (7), to reflect his main home use. 95 Gains taxed under bright-li ne if sold Main home exclusion James sells new build New build receives a CCC En d of n ew bu ild bright-line period 5 June 2022 3 October 2022 3 October 2025 2 October 2027 20 December 2027 James starts renting new build out Title registered to James If instead James sells the land on 20 December 2027, which is after the five-year new build bright-line period, he will not be taxed under the bright-line test on any gains he makes when he sells the property. Apportionment for complex cases 9.10 The Government proposes that apportionment rules would apply for complex cases, which are when a dwelling is added to residential land that has an existing dwelling on the same title (refer to paragraphs 7.6 and 7.7 for more information on complex cases). Apportionment would be required where a new build is on a piece of residential land that has both a new build and a non- new build dwelling on it. The apportionment will ensure that only the portion of the land which has the new build on it will benefit from the new build bright- line test. The non-new build portion of the land will still be subject to the general ten-year bright-line test. 9.11 Existing tax principles for apportionment would apply to determine the amount of gains on sale that are taxed where only part of a property qualifies for the new build bright-line test. This means that the apportionment needs to be reasonable. 9.12 Under current law, apportionment would not apply when the land is predominantly used as a main home. In that case the main home exemption would apply (in section CB 16A). 9.13 The Government invites your views on whether you support apportionment for complex cases, or if you prefer a different approach. An alternate approach could involve a predominant test, under which the new build bright-line test would apply to the entire piece of land provided that more land area is covered by a new build than a non-new build. 96 Questions for submitters Comments on all aspects of the proposals are welcomed. Below are several questions that the Government would specifically like to seek feedback on from submitters: • Are there any issues that specifically relate to the new build bright- line test and heritage buildings? • How should the new build bright-line test apply to complex new builds (where a new build and non-new build are on the same title)? Do you agree with the proposed approach, which would require apportionment rules to be applied, or do you prefer an alternative approach (such as applying a predominant test)? • Are there any simple ways to prove that residential land a person owns qualifies for the new build bright-line test? • Are there issues with relying on CCCs to verify that a property is eligible for the new build bright-line test? Should special rules apply if a CCC for a new build is not issued until some years after construction finishes? 97 Chapter 10 Rollover relief Introduction 10.1 This chapter considers whether rollover relief may be provided for certain disposals that would otherwise result in interest deductions being denied or the bright-line test applying. 10.2 This chapter primarily deals with disposals where there is largely no change in the economic ownership of the land. This chapter does not seek to address all possible structures used to hold residential property; it covers the most common scenarios where integrity risk is limited. In the context of residential property, the Government considers it is sufficient to cover family trusts, look- through companies, and partnerships. 10.3 Where there is divergence from this approach, it is based on existing relief provided in the Income Tax Act 2007 (for example, as part of a relationship property agreement or inheritance). For interest limitation, rollover relief would be provided regardless of whether there is no consideration, partial consideration, or full consideration for the transfer of the land. However, for the bright-line test, rollover relief would be limited to situations where there is no consideration. 10.4 In the context of the interest limitation rules, the provision of rollover relief would be relevant for the proposed four-year phase-out period for land originally acquired before 27 March 2021, as well as for the new build exemption if it applies in perpetuity (as it would treat early owners and subsequent purchasers differently) as outlined in chapter 8. 10.5 In the context of the bright-line test, rollover relief proposed in this chapter would effectively ignore certain disposals so that a taxpayer is not inadvertently brought into the bright-line rules or taxed on a gain where there is no real change in ownership. 10.6 Submissions are sought from Māori regarding the impact of both sets of rules on the governance and administration of collectively-owned land received as commercial redress as part of a Treaty settlement, particularly where rollover relief could be provided. This could include, for example, land transferred to a post-settlement governance entity and then ultimately to hapū. Other bright-line transactions 10.7 The Government is aware of other transactions that can result in an income tax liability arising under the bright-line test, often in the context of family arrangements where the taxpayer is not aware of the potential tax consequences of their actions. 10.8 For example, parents may help their children onto the property ladder by gifting them residential land or selling it to them at cost. Under the Income 98 Tax Act 2007, section GC 1 deems these transactions to occur at market value. This is an important feature of New Zealand’s tax system to ensure integrity and fairness. However, it can create cash-flow difficulties when an income tax liability arises under the bright-line test. 10.9 These transactions are not dealt with in this discussion document due to the primary focus on the proposed interest limitation rules, and the complexity and variability of these arrangements. The Government is interested in undertaking work in this area at a later date. What is rollover relief? Bright-line test 10.10 The bright-line test provides that when a residential property is disposed of within ten years of acquisition, the net income is taxable. Under the current bright-line test, when residential land is gifted or sold below market value, the deemed gross income for the disposal is the market value of the property. This is an integrity measure, but there are some circumstances where a disposal may not be an appropriate taxing point because of overriding fairness, efficiency, or compliance cost concerns. In such cases, it may be preferable to apply rollover treatment to ignore the disposal for the purposes of the bright-line test. 10.11 Rollover relief is not an exemption from income tax. In the context of the bright-line test, rollover relief defers the taxing point until there is a subsequent disposal of the property that does not qualify for rollover relief. To achieve this, rollover relief disregards an intervening disposal by treating the transfer as a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of the transfer. For the purposes of the bright-line test, the recipient is deemed to take on the transferor’s original date of acquisition. 10.12 Limited rollover relief is currently available under the bright-line test. It was originally introduced as a two-year test and so extensive rules providing for rollover relief were not designed. 40 Rollover relief is currently only provided for residential land transferred under a relationship property agreement and for amalgamations. However, full relief is provided in relation to inherited property. Interest limitation 10.13 In the context of the interest deductibility proposals rollover relief involves disregarding transfers or disposals in defined circumstances. Rollover relief may need to be considered in relation to certain transfers of land purchased before 27 March 2021 or of land containing a dwelling covered by the new build exemption. 40 A two-year bright-line test applied for residential land acquired between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018, and a five-year test applies for residential land acquired between 29 March 2018 and 26 March 2021. The ten-year bright- line test applies to residential land acquired on or after 27 March 2021. 99 10.14 For land acquired before 27 March 2021, rollover relief would enable the new owner to continue to deduct a portion of their interest expense until 31 March 2025. 10.15 Chapter 8 on the proposed exemption from the interest limitation proposal for new builds seeks submissions on whether the exemption should apply in perpetuity to early owners (that is, persons acquiring the property before or within 12 months after the issue of the code compliance certificate under the Building Act 2004). 10.16 If the exemption from the interest limitation proposal for new builds is to apply in perpetuity to early owners, there is a question as to whether rollover relief may be required in situations such as transfers upon death or under relationship property settlements, or where property is transferred but the economic ownership of the property remains the same. For new builds, rollover relief would enable the new owner to deduct all their interest expense relating to the property. If rollover relief were not available, then they would not be entitled to any deduction for interest expense relating to the property. Policy considerations 10.17 Reasons for rollover relief include fairness, efficiency, or other public policy concerns. There may be situations where there is a disposal for legal purposes or for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 2007, but no disposal of the land in substance. People should generally be able to conduct their affairs in the structure that they consider appropriate. The tax system should not penalise restructuring where there are genuine business or personal purposes, and such restructuring is within the law. 41 Therefore, rollover relief may be appropriate to prevent an adverse tax outcome that may arise where a person disposes of land, but where that person has continuous economic ownership of that land. 10.18 For example, a sole trader landlord may decide that a limited liability structure is more appropriate for their rental business and transfer their rental property into a wholly-owned look-through company (LTC). The transfer of the property may trigger the bright-line test or make unavailable transitional rules regarding interest deductions. Arguably, there has been no disposal from an economic perspective, and therefore the landlord should not be disincentivised from transferring ownership of the land to the wholly-owned LTC. 10.19 Rollover might promote efficiency by reducing the “lock-in” effects of tax. “Lock-in” describes the incentive for taxpayers to retain assets because transferring or selling them would trigger a tax liability and/or lead to a loss of interest deductions. 10.20 If rollover relief is too extensive however, it could negate the benefits the bright-line test and the Government’s interest limitation proposal. 41 Including not being for the purpose of avoiding tax. 100 10.21 The objective is to develop rollover rules that are coherent and principled. The rules must be administratively workable and preserve the integrity of the tax system. Existing relief under the bright-line test 10.22 The bright-line test provides that an amount derived on “disposing of residential land” is income of the person. However, some disposals of residential land attract rollover relief or are accorded full relief. 10.23 Whether a person “disposes” of land is generally determined using case law (with some modification by section YA 1). Further, the definition of “land” includes an estate or interest in land. Generally, disposals of land will include transfers of legal title of land under the Land Transfer Act 2017 (which can include settling land on trust, compulsory acquisitions, and mortgagee sales) and the disposal of an equitable interest in land. The disposal of land that is subject to the bright-line test at less than market value (including gifts) is generally deemed to be disposed of at market value. 42 10.24 Of these types of land disposals, rollover relief is currently available for relationship property and residential land held by an amalgamating company. These are discussed below. Rollover relief for the purposes of the bright-line test generally deems the person disposing of the land (the transferor) to be disposing of the land at cost, and the recipient to have acquired the land on the date the land was acquired by the transferor. 10.25 Inherited properties are provided full relief from income tax under the bright- line test. The transfer of a property from a deceased person to the beneficiary of the estate (even via an executor or administrator of an estate), is not a taxing event for the purpose of the bright-line test. In addition, land that a person has inherited from a deceased estate is not subject to the bright-line test even if the beneficiary sells it within the bright-line period. This effectively means that an inherited property is exempt from income tax under the bright-line test. This is provided for in sections CB 6A(12) and FC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Proposals 10.26 The Government proposes to afford rollover relief to certain disposals of land under the bright-line test and proposed interest limitation rules. This chapter uses the terms “full rollover relief” and “partial rollover relief”. Full rollover relief means that rollover relief would be provided in relation to the whole piece of land and the whole transaction. Partial rollover relief means that rollover relief would only be provided in relation to part of the land or one or more of the relevant parties involved in the transaction. 10.27 The scope of the rollover relief proposed in this chapter is not intended to capture every type of reorganisation that produces economically consistent outcomes, but only those that are most common and not complex. 42 Income Tax Act 2007, section GC 1. 101 10.28 The rollover relief proposed would apply to effectively prevent the bright-line test from applying at a particular point in time and/or allow the continued deduction of interest expenses following a disposal, generally where the economic ownership of the land has not changed. It would not permit taxpayers to undertake activities that might otherwise constitute tax avoidance (for example, restructuring purely to obtain a lower tax rate). The general anti- avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would continue to apply, along with specific anti-avoidance rules such as those in sections GB 52 and GB 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 10.29 Rollover relief would be available for each disposal that meets the relevant criteria. Therefore, a single parcel of land could be subject to multiple instances of rollover relief within the bright-line period. Bright-line test rollover 10.30 For the purposes of the bright-line test, this rollover relief would generally of treat the disposal of the residential land as at cost to the transferor or original owner (rather than at market value as provided in section GC 1), and treating the recipient as having the same acquisition date and cost base as the transferor. 10.31 Disposals where there is non-zero consideration (either at market value or not) would not be eligible for rollover relief. This is because such a transaction would, to the extent of the consideration, be a realisation of the value of the land, and providing roll-over relief in this context may give rise to integrity concerns. Rollover relief proposed in this chapter would therefore apply where the residential land is disposed of within the bright-line period for zero consideration (that is, gratuitously). Rollover relief would also be available in some limited situations – for example, where a settlor settles land onto a trust in return for the trust providing the settlor the right to occupy the property free of charge. 10.32 For the bright-line test proposals in this chapter, the Government proposes that rollover relief be provided in relation to a disposal that occurs on or after 1 April 2022, even if the original acquisition predates the introduction of the bright-line test. This would ensure that a property that has been owned by a person for several decades would not be brought within the ten-year bright- line test simply because the owner settles the property on trust in 2022, for example. Interest limitation rollover 10.33 For the purposes of the proposed interest limitation rules, rollover relief would consist of treating the recipient as having the same acquisition date as the person who disposed of the land. 10.34 The rollover relief proposed in relation to the interest limitation would only apply to allow the continued deduction of interest expenses following a disposal, generally where the economic ownership of the land has not changed. It would not permit taxpayers to undertake activities that might otherwise constitute tax avoidance (for example, restructuring purely to obtain a lower 102 tax rate). The general anti-avoidance rule in section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 would continue to apply, along with any specific anti-avoidance rules that would apply in the context of the interest limitation rules. 10.35 The rollover relief proposed in this chapter for the interest limitation rule would apply to land transfers on or after 27 March 2021 where the land was first acquired by the person disposing of it before 27 March 2021. If the new build exemption is to apply to initial or early purchasers of new builds in perpetuity, the Government considers that it would generally be appropriate for rollover relief for interest limitation to also apply to transfers of residential land occurring on or after 27 March 2021 in situations where the person disposing of the land was exempt from the interest limitation rules, owing to the property being a qualifying new build. Relationship property settlements Bright-line test 10.36 An existing rule provides rollover relief from the bright-line test for transfers of residential land from a settlement of relationship property. Section FB 3A of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that when residential land is transferred on a settlement of relationship property, the transfer is treated as both a disposal and acquisition for an amount that equals the total cost of the residential land to the transferor at the date of transfer. This has the effect of no tax liability arising under the bright-line test for such property transfers. 10.37 However, the person to whom the property has been transferred may be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. The recipient takes on the transferor’s date of acquisition for the purposes of the bright-line test under section FB 3A(3), meaning they obtain the benefit of the previous owner’s years of ownership to determine whether they are within or outside the bright-line period. If the recipient disposes of the residential land within the bright-line period, they receive a deduction for the original owner’s acquisition cost when calculating their net income. 10.38 The Government is not proposing any changes to the treatment of relationship property settlements under the bright-line test. Interest limitation 10.39 The Government proposes that rollover relief be provided for pre-27 March land transferred under a relationship property settlement. If the new build exemption from interest limitation is to apply to initial or early purchasers in perpetuity, the Government proposes that rollover relief also apply to transfers of land covered by the new build exemption under relationship property settlements. 103 10.40 There may be justification for rollover relief on the basis that “relationship property” 43 was always jointly owned. In effect, the argument is that any transfer in the course of a relationship property settlement is just giving effect to what had always been the case in an economic sense. However, this will not always be precise, especially given the rather uncertain nature of ownership rights in many relationships. For example, people may sometimes transfer some “separate property” 44 in the course of a settlement because the separate property was more liquid or divisible than the relationship property. 10.41 The objective is to ensure that tax is as little of a factor in people’s personal relationship choices as possible. The Government would like the rules to be simple enough so that people can easily self-assess if rollover relief applies and understand what they need to do (keeping in mind that people should seek legal advice, particularly in separations involving significant assets). Example 32: relationship property agreement Tom and Tory, a married couple, decide to separate in 2023. In the relationship property agreement, Tory transfers a second home to Tom - a new build that she acquired in April 2021 as an investment property when she was still single— and they arrange for the mortgage to be solely in Tom’s name. Rather than move into the property himself, Tom keeps it as a rental investment property, opting to instead move into an apartment that is closer to his workplace. Since the property is a new build that was acquired by Tory after 27 March 2021, (meaning that Tory was entitled to continue deducting all her interest in relation to the property after 1 October 2021), rollover relief applies to the transfer of the property to Tom. This means that Tom is entitled to deduct interest on the mortgage for the property, as the transfer of the property from Tory to Tom is effectively ignored when determining whether interest deductions are available in relation to the property. Example 33: relationship property agreement Dale and Dawn, a married couple, decide to separate in April 2022. As part of the relationship property settlement, they agree that Dale will keep the family home and Dawn will keep the investment property they acquired back in 2003 shortly after they got married. Dawn decides to retain the property as an investment rather than move into it herself. Since the property was acquired before 27 March 2021 the limitation of interest deductions is phased in over four years, and so Dale and Dawn (who both have standard balance dates) are entitled to deduct 75% of the amount of mortgage interest they each incurred in relation to the property over the period 1 October 2021 to 31 March 2022. Rollover relief applies to the transfer of Dale’s share of the property to Dawn in April 2022, so Dawn will be entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest over the remaining phase-out period. 43 Unless agreed otherwise by the spouses or partners, this generally includes things like the family home and chattels (regardless of when they were acquired); property owned jointly or in common in equal shares by the married couple or partners; property owned by either spouse or partner immediately before the marriage, civil union or de facto relationship began if it was acquired in contemplation of the relationship or it was intended for the common use or common benefit of both spouses or partners; and property acquired by either spouse or partner or by both of them after their marriage, civil union or de facto relationship began. For a full definition, see Property (Relationships) Act 1976, s 8. 44 “Separate property” refers to all property of either spouse or partner that is not relationship property. 104 Transfers on death Bright-line test 10.42 An exemption is provided from the bright-line test for transfers of residential land upon the death of the owner (including intervening transfers via an executor or administrator of the estate) as well as subsequent disposals by beneficiaries of the estate. Sections CB 6A(12) and FC 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007 effectively provide that inherited residential land is not taxed under the bright-line test. The Government is not proposing to change this treatment. Interest limitation 10.43 When a person dies, all of their property (their “estate”) is transferred to the executor appointed under the deceased’s will or, if there is no will, the administrator of the estate appointed by the court. The executor or administrator is then responsible for dealing with any taxes and debts due out of the estate, and then distributing any remaining property to the people entitled to receive it under the will or the rules governing intestacy (the beneficiaries of the estate). 10.44 Generally, all of the deceased’s debt will be repaid by their estate when they die, provided there are sufficient assets to cover the debt. Even if the debt is not repaid in full, any remaining debts (such as mortgages) are not required to be repaid by the beneficiaries of the estate. However, there may be some situations where a property (over which a mortgage is registered) is transferred to a beneficiary of the estate and the beneficiary voluntarily continues to make the mortgage repayments so that they may keep the property. 10.45 Submissions are invited on whether rollover relief from interest limitation should be provided for transfers on death. If rollover relief is provided for transfers on death of land subject to the new build exemption, the Government considers that it would be appropriate to limit the availability of rollover relief - for example, by ensuring that the rollover relief only applies over the lifetime of the beneficiary receiving the property (that is, rollover relief for transfers on death can only occur once). Otherwise, if a house was to stay within a family over multiple generations, theoretically the beneficiaries could get full interest deductibility for many years, potentially well past the average person’s lifespan. Example 34: inheritance of a property subject to the new build exemption Lionel owns a rental property that he acquired as a new build (that is, within 12 months after the certificate of code compliance was issued) in December 2021. At the time of Lionel’s death, he owes $125,000 on his mortgage. Lionel’s will provides for the property to be inherited by his adult son, Jake. The executors of Lionel’s will ascertain that Lionel’s estate does not have sufficient cash assets to repay the loan in full. Instead of selling the property to cover the shortfall, Jake agrees to take out a mortgage to repay the loan. Assuming that the new build exemption for interest limitation applies in perpetuity to original or early purchasers of new builds, Lionel was entitled to deduct all his interest expense paid on the mortgage indefinitely. If rollover relief is provided for transfers on 105 death, Jake is allowed to deduct all the interest expense he pays on the mortgage as he is treated as having acquired the property in December 2021, meaning that he effectively qualifies for the new build exemption. Questions for submitters • Should rollover relief from interest limitation be provided for transfers on death? • If rollover relief is provided for properties subject to the new build exemption on death of an owner, does there need to be a time limit on the availability of relief? Company amalgamations Bright-line test 10.46 Under the bright-line test, rollover relief is provided in relation to company amalgamations, provided that the amalgamation qualifies as a resident’s restricted amalgamation under section FO 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Effectively, relief is only provided if the amalgamating companies and the amalgamated companies are New Zealand resident and are not treated as non- resident under a tax treaty. This ensures that rollover relief is only provided where the asset remains in the New Zealand tax base. 10.47 The Government is not proposing any changes to how rollover relief is provided under the resident’s restricted amalgamation rules for residential land subject to the bright-line test. Interest limitation 10.48 The Government proposes that rollover relief for interest limitation would apply to a company amalgamation if the amalgamation qualifies as a resident’s restricted amalgamation under section FO 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This would be consistent with the existing rollover relief provided under the bright- line test for company amalgamations. Example 35: company amalgamation In March 2015, A Co., a close company, purchases a number of residential apartments. On 1 October 2021 the properties are transferred from A Co. to another close company, B Co. as part of an amalgamation. The amalgamation qualifies as a resident’s restricted amalgamation under section FO 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Rollover relief applies to the transfer, meaning that B Co. is treated as having acquired the property in March 2015 and is therefore entitled to deduct a reducing amount of interest over the four-year phase-out period, starting at 75 percent of the total interest expense and reducing by 25 percent each year. 106 Natural persons who dispose of land to themselves Bright-line test 10.49 Under New Zealand law it is possible for a person to transfer land to themselves. 45 The Government considers that natural persons transferring land to themselves should not be caught by the bright-line test to the extent that there is no ownership change in economic substance. Examples are: • A person who owns land transfers it to joint ownership with another person – there is no ownership change as to 50% of the land • One of three equal tenants in common transfers their interest in land to the other two – there is no ownership change as to 2/3rds of the land. 10.50 It is not currently certain whether a change to the Income Tax Act 2007 is required to achieve these outcomes. Should a law change be required, the Government will introduce a legislative amendment alongside the legislation for the interest limitation rules. If no law change is required, appropriate guidance will be issued. Example 36: sole owner to joint tenancy with partial disposal Alexei acquires residential land as sole owner. Three years later, Alexei disposes of the title to himself and his business associate Brandon as joint tenants. If required, partial rollover relief would be explicitly provided in relation to Alexei’s deemed ½ share of the land, such that Alexei would only be subject to the bright-line test at the time of the transfer in respect of the ½ share disposed to Brandon. Example 37: joint tenancy to sole ownership with partial disposal Friends Georgie and Bruce purchase residential land together as joint tenants on 18 March 2022. On 20 July 2024, Bruce disposes of his interest to Georgie, upon which Georgie has sole ownership. Georgie disposes of the residential land on 31 January 2033. Bruce For the disposal of Bruce’s interest in the land as a joint tenant (deemed to be 50% of the land), Bruce is subject to the bright-line test. The bright-line period for Bruce’s interest runs from 18 March 2022 until 20 July 2024. Georgie If necessary, rollover relief would be provided for the disposal of Georgie’s interest in the land on 20 July 2024 as a joint tenant (deemed to be a ½ share of the land) to themselves in moving from joint tenancy to sole ownership. When Georgie disposes of this part of the residential land on 31 January 2033 (the deemed ½ share they have held since 18 March 2022) rollover relief would deem it to have been acquired on 18 March 2022. Therefore, the bright-line period for the land would begin on 18 March 2022 and would end on 31 January 2033 – the disposal is not subject to the bright-line test as Georgie is deemed to have held the ½ share for longer than ten years. 45 See the Property Law Act 2007, section 56(1). 107 However, Georgie’s disposal of the part they acquired from Bruce (the remaining deemed ½ share of the land) on 20 July 2024 would not attract rollover relief. Georgie would be subject to the bright-line test in respect of this portion given that Georgie has held the interest in land for less than ten years. (The bright-line period would begin on 20 July 2024 and end on 31 January 2033.) Interest limitation 10.51 Similar to the proposals outlined above for the bright-line test, explicit rollover relief for the purposes of the interest limitation rules may be required for land acquired prior to 27 March 2021. Example 38: sole ownership to joint tenancy (land acquired before 27 March 2021) Consider Alexei and Brandon in example 36 above. Assume that Alexei had purchased the land in October 2018. When Alexei disposes of the title to Brandon and himself as joint tenants, partial rollover relief would be provided, if necessary, in relation to Alexei’s deemed 50% interest in the land (as was the case for the purposes of the bright-line test). This means that, for the purposes of the interest limitation rules, Alexei is treated as having acquired his nominal interest in October 2018 (as opposed to on 1 October 2021 when the disposal occurs). However, Brandon’s share does not attract rollover relief because there has been a change in the economic ownership of that share. At the time of purchasing the land, Alexei took out a loan to finance the purchase which has not yet been repaid in full. Alexei and Brandon have agreed that Brandon will contribute half of the remaining repayments of the loan. Alexei is entitled to a 75 percent deduction for the interest he pays on the loan between 1 October 2021 and the 31 March 2022, with the amount of the deduction for his share of the interest expense reducing to 50 percent and 25 percent over the next two years and to zero in the following year and thereafter. 10.52 If the new build exemption from interest limitation is to apply in perpetuity and only for early or initial purchasers of new builds, the Government considers that it would also be appropriate to provide rollover relief where residential property that is subject to the new build exemption may potentially be viewed as being disposed of under the scenarios outlined at paragraph 10.49. Trusts Bright-line test 10.53 Settling land on trust: Under the current bright-line test, a settlement of residential land on trust constitutes a disposal by the settlor and an acquisition by the trustee of the trust. Depending on the circumstances this can create an income tax liability under the bright-line test or restart the bright-line clock even if the settlor originally acquired the land prior to 1 October 2015. 10.54 Given the use of family trusts in New Zealand for ownership of residential property, many families could become subject to the bright-line test for a property they have owned for several years, simply because they decide to settle a property on trust which then sells the property within ten years of that settlement. This was also a possibility under the previous bright-line tests but 108 was less likely to occur given the shorter periods of two and five years. With a longer bright-line horizon, property owners may not be able to foresee the possibility of selling the property when planning their family trust affairs. 10.55 The Government therefore proposes full rollover relief for family trusts in relation to settlements of residential land on trust. A subsequent disposal by the trustee (such as a distribution to a beneficiary) would, be a disposal and may be taxable if disposed of within the bright-line period. The main home exclusion as it applies to trusts would continue to be available. 10.56 Specifically, the Government proposes that a disposal of residential land by a settlor or settlors to the trustees of a trust should be subject to rollover relief for the purposes of the bright-line test where the trust is a standard family trust. 10.57 To ensure that any proposed relief is appropriately targeted at common family trust situations, the Government seeks submissions on the use of trusts by New Zealand families to help set the conditions that should be imposed on this relief. At present, the Government proposes that three conditions would need to be met: • every settlor of the land is also a beneficiary; • at least one of settlors of the land is a principal settlor of the trust; 46 and • every beneficiary (excluding the beneficiaries who are also principal settlors) is associated with a principal settlor. 10.58 The Government is primarily concerned with providing relief for disposals to family trusts. Therefore, the rules are designed to limit relief to trusts set up for the benefit of the family of the principal settlor. 10.59 The Government proposes that the settlors of the trust who settle the residential land would not need to be the only beneficiaries or have specific beneficial interests in the land under the trust. Otherwise, this would prevent many families from accessing the rollover relief proposal as children are likely to be beneficiaries of a trust but are unlikely to be the settlors settling the relevant residential land. 10.60 The Government therefore proposes that a modified set of association tests could be applied to determine whether a beneficiary is associated with a settlor. The modified association rules would be based off the broader association rules (that is, the rules that are not applicable to the land provisions) 47 . 10.61 The association test for two relatives is expected to be broader than the current test (being two degrees of blood relationship) given the range of family members included in beneficiary definitions. The Government therefore seeks submissions on the most commonly included range of beneficiaries listed in family trust deeds in order to determine a reasonable number of degrees of 46 Section CB 16A(7) provides that a principal settlor is a settlor “whose settlements for the trust are the greatest or greatest equal, by market value”. Therefore, multiple settlors can each be a principal settlor (eg a couple who jointly settle residential land on a trust for their family). 47 To note, the bright-line test (section CB 6A) is not a “land provision” for the purposes of the Act. 109 blood relationship that should be permissible to determine whether a beneficiary is associated with the principal settlor. Some classes of beneficiaries beyond the determined number of degrees of blood relationship could also be permissible – for example, all descendants of the settlor. 10.62 Further modifications to the association rules may be required. For example, as a starting point, the Government envisages that a beneficiary should not be automatically associated with a settlor under section YB 9 of the Income Tax Act 2007, nor associated with the settlor through the combination of the tripartite test and sections YB 6 and YB 8. Further, a beneficiary or settlor would only be associated with a company where the beneficiary owns greater than 50% of the shares of the company. 10.63 While the requirements above may not be able to be satisfied by every family trust currently in existence in New Zealand, rollover relief could be obtained by amending the trust deed as necessary prior to the acquisition of the property, or a new (second) trust could be set up for the purposes of the disposal of residential property (provided the second trust is not set up for any tax avoidance purpose). Example 39: settlement on family trust Married couple Sunita and Ronald purchase residential land in their own names. Six months later Sunita and Ronald decide to settle the land on a trust with Sunita’s sister and spouse as the trustees, and with themselves and their children as beneficiaries of the trust. The only property settled on the trust is the residential land. Full rollover relief is proposed for the disposal of legal title to Sunita’s sister and spouse as trustees on settlement of the trust. Sunita and Ronald are both beneficiaries of the trust. Sunita and Ronald are both principal settlors, given that the trust has no other property, and Sunita and Ronald have each made the greatest equal settlements. Sunita and Ronald are associated through marriage, and both non-settlor beneficiari es (the two children) are associated with a principal settlor (in this case, both settlors). 10.64 This relief would include a disposal of the land to oneself as trustee of the trust. Example 40: disposal to oneself as trustee of a trust Neo acquired residential land on 3 March 2017. On 29 October 2022, Neo settles the residential land on trust with himself and his son Archie as beneficiaries of the trust. Current law Neo is subject to the two-year bright-line test in relation to the property. 48 The settlement on trust is a disposal, but there is no tax liability under the bright-line test because Neo held the property for more than two years. However, the settlement on 29 October 2022 restarts the bright-line clock and the trustee of the trust would be subject to a ten-year bright-line test. 48 The two-year test applied in relation to residential land acquired between 1 October 2015 and 28 March 2018. 110 Proposal Full rollover relief would be provided and the settlement on trust on 29 October 2022 is effectively ignored. The trustee would take on Neo’s acquisition date of 3 March 2017 and Neo’s acquisition cost. A subsequent disposal in 2025, for example, would not be subject to tax under the bright-line test, because the two-year test applied when Neo first acquired the property. 10.65 The Government is also considering rollover relief where land is disposed of from one trust to a different trust. In such circumstances, relief could be made available where the beneficiaries of the two trusts are identical. The Government is interested in understanding how such a rule could be designed. 10.66 The land-rich trust avoidance rule will continue to apply and address some trust arrangements intended to avoid the operation of the bright-line test. 49 If beneficiaries were to be added after the disposal occurs, the Government expects that the land-rich trust avoidance rule would apply and deem a trustee to have disposed of residential land at market value. 10.67 Change of trustees: The bright-line test is not intended to capture a disposal of an interest in land when a person ceases to be trustee of a land-owning trust (provided beneficial ownership remains unchanged). Section CB 6A(5) of the Income 2007 was enacted to address this situation, but there are concerns that the provision does not achieve this intent. The Government proposes to clarify this provision and provide rollover relief to the trustee who is disposing of the interest in land to another trustee of the same trust. This would not, however, prevent the application of the land-rich trust rule where changes to decision- makers are made with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. The land-rich trust rule can apply to override section CB 6A(5) to disallow the rollover relief in this case, to ensure that the disposal is appropriately taxed under the bright-line test. Interest limitation 10.68 The Government proposes that rollover relief should also apply for the purposes of the proposed interest limitation rules where a settlor (or multiple settlors) disposes of land to the trustees of a trust, and: • every settlor of the land is also a beneficiary; • at least one of the settlors of the land is a principal settlor; and • every beneficiary who is not the principal settlor is associated with the principal settlor. 10.69 Similar to the proposal outlined above relating to disposals to trusts and rollover relief for the purposes of the bright-line test, it is proposed that the modified association test outlined at paragraphs 10.60 to 10.62 could apply to determine whether a beneficiary is associated with a settlor. 49 Section GB 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 111 10.70 The Government is also considering rollover relief for interest limitation purposes where a trust disposes of land to a different trust. As outlined above in the context of rollover relief for bright-line purposes, relief may be available where the beneficiaries between the two trusts are identical. 10.71 The Government considers that it would be appropriate to extend the land-rich trust avoidance rule in section GB 53 of the Income Tax Act 2007 so that it also applies for the purposes of the interest limitation rules, thus ensuring that trust arrangements cannot be used to avoid interest limitation. Questions for submitters • In your view, are the conditions proposed at paragraph 10.57 appropriately targeted at the most common family trust situations? Are there any alternative criteria that you would suggest? • What number of degrees of blood relationship should be permissible to determine whether a beneficiary is associated with the principal settlor? Look through companies (LTCs) and partnerships 10.72 The Government proposes that rollover relief would also apply where property is transferred between an LTC or partnership and its owners, so long as the property continues to be owned in the same proportions. 10.73 LTC shareholders are treated as directly holding the LTC’s assets, deriving income, and incurring expenses in accordance with their shareholding percentage. This is the same for partners in a partnership. In effect, LTCs and partnerships are transparent for tax purposes, which means that the income tax consequences for someone who holds residential property directly are generally the same as for someone who instead holds residential property through an LTC or partnership. Bright-line test 10.74 The process of transferring residential land from an individual into the LTC or partnership currently constitutes a bright-line disposal and acquisition. 10.75 The Government proposes that a disposal by a person to an LTC, where they are the sole shareholder should be subject to full rollover relief for the purposes of the bright-line test. Similarly, this should also apply to a group of persons, where the group are all shareholders in proportion to their interest in the land prior to the disposal, and in proportion to their cost base relative to the total cost base in the property (i.e. most commonly where the group of persons purchase the land at the same time). The relief would also be available in the 112 reverse where an LTC disposes of land to its shareholder(s) in proportion to their shareholding(s). 50 10.76 For partnerships, the Government proposes similar relief. A disposal of land by a group of persons should attract rollover relief, where the group hold partnership shares in proportion to their interest in the land prior to the disposal and in proportion to their cost base relative to the total cost base in the property. The relief would also be available in the reverse where a partnership disposes of land to the partners in proportion to their partnership interest. Interest limitation 10.77 Similar to the proposal outlined above, the Government proposes that rollover relief should apply if land is transferred from a person to an LTC and the person is the sole shareholder in the LTC, or it is transferred from a group of persons to an LTC and the group are all shareholders in the LTC in proportion to their respective interests in the land prior to the disposal and in proportion to their relative cost bases. 10.78 The Government proposes that rollover relief should be provided for a disposal of land to a partnership when the partners’ respective interests in the partnership are in proportion to their interests in the land prior to the disposal and are in proportion to their relative cost bases. Where a partnership disposes of land to the partners, rollover relief should be provided to the extent that the partners’ respective interests in the partnership are in proportion to their interests in the land after the disposal. Māori collectively-owned land 10.79 The Government is interested in receiving submissions on the impact of the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rules on the administration and governance of Māori collectively owned land and whether the relief proposed under this chapter could be extended to Māori authorities or other entities used to hold such land.51 This could include, for example, issues faced when transferring Māori collectively-owned land from one organisation to another, or when land is transferred from a post-settlement governance entity to hapū. Māori authorities 10.80 While Māori authorities can be either a company or the trustees of a trust, the rollover proposals set out in this chapter only provide relief for transfers to trustees of a trust, and not to companies. At this stage therefore, those proposals would only apply to Māori authorities that are trustees. The proposals in this chapter have not included companies (excluding LTCs) given the greater complexity in ensuring that a transfer to a company maintains continuous effective economic ownership. However, the Government is 50 The rollover relief would only apply to address section CB 6A – all other provisions may still apply (such as the dividend rules). 51 Note that charities registered under the Charities Act 2005 are exempt from income tax and therefore should not be impacted by the proposal. 113 interested in receiving submissions from companies who are Māori authorities on how the bright-line test and the proposed interest limitation rules may affect them. 10.81 The trust proposals may be too narrow considering the way Māori authorities are typically set up and used. For example, the trust proposal is limited to situations where every beneficiary is associated with the settlor. A different test (modification) may be appropriate for Māori authorities to account for how they are used to look after and grow assets for future generations, possibly by using a different connection test that considers blood-ties or whakapapa. The purpose of such a test is to ensure that beneficial ownership is maintained before and after a transfer of land to the Māori authority and if necessary, could be designed to take into account the fact that member interests in the communal assets held by the Māori authority can be diluted over time. This modification would need to be accompanied with a suitable limitation so that the relief provided by rollover cannot be arbitrarily expanded (for example, the beneficiaries both before and after transfer are all members of a particular hapū or iwi). 10.82 To the extent that an election to become or cease to be a Māori authority results in a deemed disposal and reacquisition at market value, the Government is considering whether specific rollover relief would be required under the interest limitation rules or bright-line test. Questions for submitters • Would the trust proposal in this chapter be appropriate for Māori authorities that are trustees? − Would a connection other than association to a settlor be more appropriate? (For example, being a member of a particular hapū or iwi) − How could this work for Treaty settlement land? − Are there issues with dilution that need to be considered? • Are transfers of residential land from one Māori authority to another Māori authority common? − To what extent are the Māori authorities involved in such transfers companies? − For what reasons are these transfers occurring (for example, simple restructuring)? • Are there any issues that arise under the bright-line test or interest limitation rules where rollover relief may be appropriate? Some potential examples include: − Other situations where residential land is transferred to a Māori authority. − An election to become or cease to be a Māori authority. 114 − A transfer of treaty settlement land from a post-settlement governance entity or iwi to hapū. 115 Chapter 11 Interposed entities Introduction 11.1 Interposed entity rules are required to support the integrity of the interest limitation rule. The rules need to address situations where a taxpayer borrows money to acquire an ownership interest 52 in an entity that owns residential investment property subject to the interest limitation rules. This chapter proposes an approach informed by the existing interposed entity rules for residential loss ring-fencing, 53 with some important modifications. Why interposed entity rules are required 11.2 A taxpayer is generally allowed a deduction for interest expenditure on a loan that is used to acquire an ownership interest in an entity if the taxpayer derives assessable income from holding that interest. For example, if a taxpayer borrows to buy a share in a company that pays dividends, interest expenditure on that loan will be deductible. 11.3 In the absence of interposed entity rules, a taxpayer who borrows money to acquire an interest in an entity that owns residential investment property would be able to claim a deduction for interest expenditure on a loan that indirectly funds residential investment property. This is not consistent with the Government’s desire to limit interest deductions for all borrowings that fund, directly or indirectly, residential investment property. 52 For example, shares in a company. 53 See Income Tax Act 2007, ss EL 16 to EL 19. 116 Example 41: Interposed entity Lo an $1 m Bank Borrowing money to acquire residential rental property Borrowing money to acquire shares in a residential interposed entity Purchase house with $1m Buys shares for $1m Lo an $1 m Bank NewCo Purchase house with $1m Figure 1 Interest Interest • Wilfred borrows $1m from Bank. • He buys a residential rental property for $1m using the borrowed money. • Interest paid to Bank is directly traced to the residential rental property and is subject to interest limitation. • Wilfred borrows $1m from Bank. • He sets up a company, NewCo, and uses the $1m borrowings to buy shares issued by NewCo. • NewCo buys a residential rental property for $1m using the share issuance proceeds from Wilfred. • Interest Wilfred pays to Bank is traced to acquiring shares rather than residential rental property. Therefore it is not subject to interest limitation without an interposed entity rule. Proposed interposed entity rules 11.4 The Government proposes to adopt two different interposed entity rules, depending on the type of interposed entity and its “affected assets percentage”: • close companies and trusts with an affected assets percentage over ten percent will be subject to the proposed approach outlined in paragraphs 11.10 to 11.18; and • all other interposed entities with an affected assets percentage over 50 percent will be subject to the proposed approach outlined in paragraphs 11.19 to 11.21. 11.5 Where an entity exceeds the relevant affected assets percentage, it will be considered a “residential interposed entity”. Interest expenditure incurred by a taxpayer on a loan to acquire an ownership interest in a residential interposed 117 entity will be limited. If the relevant affected assets percentage is not exceeded, the taxpayer’s interest expenditure will not be limited. Affected assets percentage 11.6 An entity’s affected assets percentage will be calculated using the following formula: value of affected assets × 100 value of total assets 11.7 “Affected assets” would include any residential investment property subject to interest limitation, whether those assets are held directly or indirectly (for example, by a subsidiary company). 54 It would not include new builds or properties that qualify for the development exemption. This is because the affected assets percentage will determine whether interest is subject to limitation (and, if so, how much of it is), and interest incurred to indirectly acquire new builds and development property should not be subject to limitation. Mixed-use assets, which are dealt with under a separate regime, would be excluded from both “affected assets” and “total assets” in the above formula. 11.8 The Government considers that a test based on the value of assets held by the entity is preferable to a test based on another metric, such as turnover. An assets test aligns more closely with the purpose of limiting interest deductions for loans used for residential rental purposes. The residential loss ring-fencing rules also use an assets test to work out if an entity is “residential land-rich”, 55 so taxpayers with residential investment properties may already be familiar with such an approach. 11.9 To work out an entity’s affected assets percentage, the Government proposes to use the same valuation rules as those suggested for the “residential land- rich” threshold in chapter 3 (see paragraphs 3.15 to 3.16). For land, including any improvements, the value would be the later of its most recent capital or annual value, as set by a local authority, or its acquisition cost (or its market value if acquired from an associate). For depreciable property, the value would be the property’s adjusted tax value. As proposed in chapter 3, for all other property, there may be merit in allowing taxpayers to use accounting or tax book values where market value cannot be easily ascertained. Submissions are invited on this proposal. Close companies and trusts 11.10 The Government considers that the 50 percent threshold in the existing interposed entity rules for residential loss ring-fencing would be too high for close companies and trusts. The purpose of the interest limitation proposal is to limit interest deductions where borrowings have directly or indirectly 54 In working out the value of affected assets held indirectly, the value of affected assets held by a subsidiary is multiplied by the ownership interest in the subsidiary. For example, if a parent company has a 50% shareholding in a subsidiary that owns a residential rental property worth $500,000, the parent company will be treated as holding residential rental property of $250,000. 55 Section EL 3. 118 funded residential investment properties. In principle, this would justify having no threshold at all. However, as the interposed entity rule creates compliance costs, a de minimis threshold of ten percent is proposed. If a close company or trust’s affected assets percentage exceeds ten percent at any time during an income year, it will be a subject to the interposed entity rules for that income year. 11.11 The existing interposed entity rules for residential loss ring-fencing attribute a portion of the entity’s net residential income to the taxpayer 56 and subject a portion of the taxpayer’s interest expenditure to ring-fencing. 57 The Government proposes to adopt the general apportionment approach used in those rules, with some modifications, for close companies and trusts. 11.12 The proposed approach where a taxpayer borrows to acquire an ownership interest in a close company or trust is to deny the taxpayer a deduction for a portion of their interest expenditure. The amount denied would be calculated by the following formula: interest on amount borrowed to acquire ownership interest × entity’s affected assets percentage Example 42: Interposed close company rule On 1 April 2023, Satoshi borrows $800,000 from his bank at a 5% interest rate. He incorporates a company, NewCo, and uses the borrowed money to subscribe for 100 shares in NewCo. NewCo uses the share issue proceeds to purchase a non-new build residential rental property for $300,000 and a commercial property for $500,000. NewCo’s affected assets percentage is 37.5%. NewCo is above the 10% de minimis threshold for close companies. Satoshi’s interest expense for the 2023–24 income year is $40,000. The amount of interest denied is $15,000 (being 37.5% x $40,000). The remaining $25,000 of interest expenditure remains deductible. 11.13 This proposed approach is a departure from the full “tracing” approach adopted for interest limitation more generally. Under this proposed approach, tracing is applied as an initial step, as borrowed funds are traced to the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns affected assets. However, it is not a full tracing approach as it does not require a taxpayer to trace borrowed funds “through” an entity to a particular use or asset. The reason for this is, if the taxpayer does not control the entity, they may find it difficult to obtain the information required to undertake tracing. At the same time, the Government does not propose to limit these rules to taxpayers who control the entity. Economically, a taxpayer who has borrowed to acquire an interest in an entity that owns affected assets has still borrowed to acquire an indirect interest in affected assets, even if they do not control the entity. 56 Sections EL 16(2) and EL 17(3). 57 Sections EL 16(2) and EL 17(1). 119 Apportionment calculation 11.14 The interposed entity rule applies an apportionment calculation based on the entity’s affected assets percentage to work out how much of a taxpayer’s interest expenditure is subject to limitation. A key issue is whether the apportionment calculation is done on a daily basis, or less frequently (for example, monthly, quarterly or annually). 11.15 If the apportionment calculation is done on an infrequent basis, the interposed entity rules could potentially be circumvented by transactions made shortly before and after the calculations are done. For example, if the calculation is done on a yearly basis, an entity may enter into an arrangement to acquire a non-residential asset with a value greater than the value of the entity’s affected assets shortly before the end of the income year (when the calculation is done), and then dispose of that non-residential asset at the start of the next income year. 11.16 A daily calculation is more accurate and much harder to manipulate, as shown in Example 43. However, it is potentially more complex than a quarterly or annual calculation. Many closely held entities only own a few residential investment properties, which they hold for long periods. In such cases, the entity’s assets will not change in most years, so in most years a more frequent calculation would not be much more complex than an annual calculation. Note that a “daily calculation” does not mean that taxpayers would have to do calculations daily, but merely that the calculation done is daily. Example 43: Interposed entity rule – apportionment calculation Assume Tiana has a 31 March balance date. On 1 April 2023, Tiana borrows $800,000 from the bank at a 5% interest rate (Loan 1). She incorporates a company, NewCo, and uses the borrowed money to subscribe for 100 shares in NewCo. NewCo uses the share issue proceeds to purchase a non-new build residential rental property for $800,000. On 1 October 2023, NewCo purchases business premises for $400,000. It funds the purchase by issuing 80 shares to Tiana for $400,000. She borrows the $400,000 from the bank at an interest rate of 5% (Loan 2). Figures shown in this example have been rounded to two decimal places where applicable, but unrounded figures were used in the actual calculations. Annual apportionment calculation at end of year NewCo’s affected assets percentage is 66.67% at the end of the income year. Tiana incurred total interest expenditure of $50,000 on Loan 1 and Loan 2 during the income year. With an annual calculation, $33,333 (66.67%) of Tiana’s total interest expenditure would be subject to limitation. Daily apportionment calculation A daily apportionment calculation takes into account the fact that Tiana’s $800,000 loan indirectly funded the residential rental property for the entire income year, whereas her $400,000 loan indirectly funded the business premises for only six months. Tiana incurs interest of $40,000 on Loan 1 during the income year or $109.29 per day from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024. She incurs interest of $10,000 on Loan 2 or $54.64 per day from 1 October 2023 to 31 March 2024. 120 On each day from 1 April 2023 to 30 September 2023, NewCo’s affected assets percentage is 100%. For all of this period, Tiana’s daily interest expenditure (of $109.29) will be subject to limitation. On each day from 1 October 2023 to 31 March 2024, NewCo’s affected assets percentage is 66.67% and Tiana’s total daily interest expenditure is $109.29 + $54.64 = $163.93. For all of this period, 66.67% of Tama’s daily interest expenditure ($109.29) will be subject to limitation. The net result is equivalent to fully limiting the interest on Loan 1 which was used to acquire the residential rental, but not on Loan 2, which was used to acquire business premises. (We note that in other, more complex, cases the amounts of interest limited will not directly match up with how funds were used.) 11.17 As Example 43 shows, an annual calculation may over-limit or under-limit interest deductions. In Example 43, Tiana incurred $40,000 of interest on a loan that indirectly funded a residential investment property and incurred $10,000 of interest on a loan that indirectly funded business premises. Limiting interest deductions of $33,333 in effect under-limits interest on Loan 1, which indirectly funded the purchase of residential investment property. 11.18 Submissions are invited on what frequency would be workable for the apportionment calculation, bearing in mind that infrequent calculations would be more likely to require a specific anti-avoidance rule. A similar anti- avoidance rule applies to increases or decreases in value that have the purpose or effect of defeating the thin capitalisation rules. 58 Other residential interposed entities 11.19 The interposed entity rules for residential loss ring-fencing apply only to close companies and other closely held entities such as trusts, because the loss ring- fencing rules mostly affect individuals, trusts and close companies. The interest limitation proposal, however, is more far-reaching and also affects widely-held companies that are residential investment property-rich: see chapter 3. The interposed entity rules for interest limitation should therefore also apply to widely-held entities that have a high affected assets percentage. 11.20 The Government proposes that an entity whose affected assets percentage exceeds 50 percent at any point in an income year be treated as a “residential interposed entity” if it is not a close company or trust. The affected assets percentage would be calculated using the same rules described in paragraphs 11.6 to 11.9. 11.21 Where a taxpayer borrows to acquire an interest in a residential interposed entity that is not a close company or trust, they should be treated as borrowing to acquire affected assets and all of their interest deductions should be subject to limitation. This is simpler than the apportionment approach proposed above for close companies and trusts, as the complexities involved in apportioning are much greater for widely-held companies. At the same time, a higher affected asset percentage (50 percent) than the one for close companies and 58 Section GB 51B. 121 trusts (ten percent) is proposed to ensure that taxpayers borrowing to acquire shares in entities with modest amounts of affected assets are not subject to full interest limitation. Example 44: Widely-held residential interposed entity Tama borrows $10,000 from his bank at a 5% interest rate. He buys shares in a widely-held company, PropertyCo. PropertyCo’s assets by value consist of 35% new builds, 60% other residential investment properties (old builds), and 5% cash and bonds. PropertyCo’s affected assets percentage is 60%. As this exceeds 50%, Tama will not be allowed deductions for any of his interest expenditure. Look-through companies and partnerships 11.22 There is a question about whether interposed entity rules need to apply to look- through companies (LTCs) and partnerships, since these are already transparent for tax purposes. Look-through companies were included in the interposed entity rule for residential loss ring-fencing because of the following concern: a taxpayer may borrow to acquire shares in an LTC, and the LTC may then acquire a residential investment property. While the taxpayer would be treated for tax purposes as holding the residential investment property in proportion to their effective look-through interest, there was a concern that the interest on the taxpayer’s loan could arguably not be treated as incurred in acquiring the residential property, but as incurred in acquiring the LTC shares. A similar argument may be employed for partnerships. Look-through companies and partnerships were included under the interposed entity rule to avoid such arguments. 11.23 It is not appropriate to extend the interposed entity rule for interest limitation to LTCs and partnerships, as this could give rise to inconsistent tax outcomes. The transparent nature of LTCs and partnerships in effect require a full tracing approach, whereas the proposed interposed entity rule would not. 11.24 To address the concern outlined at paragraph 11.22, a specific provision is proposed to clarify that, if a taxpayer borrows to acquire a look-through interest or a partnership share, the borrowing is treated as having been used to acquire the assets of the LTC or partnership, rather than the look-through interest or partnership share. This approach would be more consistent with the transparent nature of LTCs and partnerships. Existing interposed entities 11.25 For simplicity, the Government considers that interest limitation should apply, with effect from 1 October 2021, to taxpayers with existing loans used to acquire an ownership interest in an interposed entity subject to the rules proposed above. In other words, phasing will not apply to any interest deductions limited under either of the interposed entity approaches proposed above. 122 Tax treatment when taxpayer no longer holds interest in interposed entity 11.26 A taxpayer may cease to hold an interest in an entity that owns affected assets in one of two ways. The taxpayer may dispose of their interest in the entity or the entity may dispose of its affected assets. 11.27 For simplicity, it is proposed that neither of these events will result in a taxpayer’s previously denied interest deductions being “allowed back”, regardless of whether the disposal is taxed and regardless of the decisions reached in relation to chapter 5. The interposed entity rules are primarily aimed at maintaining integrity and taxpayers will not have to apply the rules if the borrowing is done by the same entity that holds the affected assets. On-lending by taxpayer to interposed entity 11.28 Instead of borrowing to acquire an interest in an entity that owns affected assets, a taxpayer may borrow money to on-lend to an entity that owns affected assets. In this case, the entity will be subject to interest limitation if it used the funds to acquire affected assets, and the taxpayer’s interest deduction may not need to be limited. Example 45: On-lending to an interposed entity Zeean is the sole shareholder of LandCo. She borrows $800,000 from her bank at a 5% interest rate and on-lends the money to LandCo, also at a 5% interest rate. LandCo uses the money to acquire a residential investment property. Zeean does not directly own any affected assets. LandCo’s interest expenditure on the loan from Zeean would be subject to limitation because LandCo used the borrowed funds to acquire a residential investment property. The interest expenditure incurred by Zeean on her loan from the bank would not be subject to limitation under the proposed interposed entity rules. This is because she used the borrowed funds to derive interest income from LandCo, rather than to acquire an ownership interest in LandCo. We note that if Zeean on-lent the borrowed money to LandCo at an interest rate less than the rate she borrowed at, the amount of interest limited (for LandCo) will be less than the amount of interest incurred by Zeean. Such an arrangement would undermine the integrity of the interest limitation rules. 11.29 The Government is considering a specific anti-avoidance rule to capture situations where a taxpayer borrows money at a given interest rate (for example, 5%) and on-lends the money to an entity at a lower interest rate (for example, 2%). The rule would apply if: • the taxpayer has an ownership interest in the entity; and • the entity’s affected assets percentage exceeds the de minimis threshold. 11.30 If the specific anti-avoidance rule applied, an amount of the taxpayer’s interest expenditure would be subject to limitation, based on the difference between the taxpayer’s borrowing interest rate and on-lending interest rate. 123 Feedback on interposed entities Questions for submitters • What do you think of the interposed entity rules proposed above? • In your experience, how common are interposed entities in the residential investment property context? • What are some of the commercial reasons why, for close companies, taxpayers may prefer to have their borrowing at the shareholder level instead of the entity level? • Do you prefer to use accounting or tax book values for calculating the affected assets percentage for assets other than land, improvements and depreciable property? Why? • What is your preferred frequency for the apportionment calculation for interposed entities that are close companies or trusts - daily, monthly, quarterly, annually? • Do you agree that the proposed interposed entity rules should not be applied to LTCs or partnerships? • Are there any commercial reasons why a taxpayer might borrow funds and on-lend them to an interposed company at a lower interest rate? 124 Chapter 12 Implications for the rental loss ring-fencing rules Introduction 12.1 The rules governing the ring-fencing of residential losses were introduced in 2018 to reduce the tax benefits for property investors compared to owner- occupiers. 12.2 The rental loss ring-fencing (RLR) rules were introduced to prevent investors from deducting expenditure relating to their loss-making residential investment properties from their other income (for example, salary or wages, or business income), to reduce their tax liability. This is done by allocating deductions for residential land to the next income year, to the extent those deductions exceed income from residential land and meet general continuity requirements. The introduction of these rules was aimed at making the tax system fairer and improving housing affordability for owner-occupiers by levelling the playing field between property investors and home buyers. 12.3 The existing RLR rules already restrict the ability of rental property investors to derive tax benefits from investing in rental properties. The interest limitation rules will further reduce tax benefits from investing in rental property. There is likely to be significant interplay between the proposed interest limitation rules and the existing RLR rules. 12.4 This chapter explores how the RLR rules overlap with the proposed interest limitation rules and proposed exemptions, and the technical issues that are likely to arise. The Government would like to receive submissions on the issues highlighted in this chapter and any other issues that should be addressed. How rental loss ring-fencing rules apply to residential property generally 12.5 The default position is that the RLR rules apply on a portfolio basis, meaning investors calculate their overall profit or loss across their portfolio of residential properties. The income from all properties in the portfolio is offset by deductions from all those properties 12.6 However, investors can elect to apply the rules on a property-by-property basis if they wish. When using a property-by-property approach, each property is looked at separately and deductions for one are not able to offset income from another. If a property-by-property approach is taken, and it transpires that the sale of the property is taxed, any remaining excess deductions are released from the RLR rules and used against the taxpayer’s income from other sources. 12.7 The rental loss ring-fencing rules do not apply where the property will be taxable on sale; for example, if the land was acquired for the purposes of a business relating to land under section CB 7. Where the property is taxable on sale under section CB 7, the exemption will automatically apply. Where the 125 land is taxable on sale for any other reason, Inland Revenue must be notified that it is held on revenue account for the exemption to be applied. 12.8 Only land that will definitely be taxed on sale will be excluded, not land that may be taxed on sale if certain contingencies occur (for example, being sold within a particular time period – such as under the bright-line test). Where land will be taxed on sale, there is not the same concern about some of the deductible expenses relating to untaxed gains, as all the economic income from the investment will be taxed. 12.9 Ring-fenced deductions are released if a property ends up being taxed on sale and the taxpayer has: • applied the rules on a property-by-property basis; or • applied the rules on a portfolio basis and all of the properties within the portfolio were sold and were subject to tax on sale. 12.10 If the ring-fenced deductions exceed what is necessary to reduce the taxable gain on the sale to nil, the remainder of the deductions would be released and able to be offset against other income. This represents a deferral of interest deductibility, as well as other deductible expenses that made up the ring-fenced deductions. 12.11 Excess deductions would remain ring-fenced after a non-taxable sale of property, or after divestment of a portfolio where not all the properties that were in the portfolio were taxed on sale. A taxpayer can choose to treat those ring-fenced deductions as relating to another property. However, if this is done, the deductions would “taint” the property (and any portfolio it is part of), such that any excess deductions on a taxable sale of that property or taxable divestment of the portfolio would not be released. The excess deductions would still be able to be used to reduce the taxable gain to nil, but if there are excess deductions beyond that they would remain ring-fenced. 12.12 Ring-fenced deductions can be transferred between companies in a wholly- owned group. Transferred deductions remain ring-fenced in this instance. Any remaining deductions would be carried forward and would remain ring-fenced. General interface issues 12.13 There are aspects of the proposed interest deductibility settings that diverge from the rental loss ringfencing rules. This section will highlight these differences and explore the extent to which these two regimes should be aligned. Aligning both regimes ensures that the RLR rules are not undermined by any potential exemptions from interest deductibility. 12.14 The starting approach to address the interplay between the interest limitation rules and the RLR rules is to determine the order the rules will apply. We consider that the interest limitation rules should apply first to determine whether interest is potentially deductible in an income year. 126 12.15 If the interest is deductible under the interest rules, it will be viewed as expenditure incurred to derive income from the residential investment property and will be subject to the RLR rules. The timing of the deduction may be deferred under those rules (that is, if the taxpayer has an overall rental loss for the year). Portfolio approach versus a property-by-property approach 12.16 The RLR rules can be applied either on a portfolio basis or on a property-by- property basis. This raises the question of whether the interest limitation rules may apply on a portfolio approach or a property-by-property approach. 12.17 We consider that it is not practical to operate interest limitation rules on a portfolio approach. Each property may have different characteristics for interest limitation rules. For example, some may qualify for the new build or development exemption, and so be entitled to interest deductions on a current basis. Others may not enjoy such an exemption, and so interest deductions are not allowed on an ongoing basis. Depending on decisions regarding treatment of interest in the year of sale, some amount of interest may become available to deduct in the year of sale. When this occurs, the interest will be subject to the RLR rules in determining if and when the interest is deductible. 12.18 The Government considers that, although the interest limitation rules must apply on a property-by-property approach, they may work with the RLR rules regardless of whether the taxpayer is using a portfolio or property-by-property approach. However, how the rules interact may lead to different outcomes in different circumstances. Exemptions 12.19 The RLR rules may not align with some of the exemptions being proposed for the interest limitation provisions. For example, the RLR rules have no equivalent to a new build exemption. If interest is deductible under the interest limitation proposal, it could potentially be denied or deferred under the RLR rules (if the interest deduction results in a net loss for the year). 12.20 A way of addressing this is to say the RLR rules do not apply if one of the exemptions for interest limitation (new build or development exemption) applies. However, this may liberalise the taxation of rental property investment in some cases. Development exemption 12.21 The RLR rules have an exemption for property developers, property dealers and builders who fall under section CB 7. They also allow property otherwise held on revenue account to be exempt from the RLR rules if the taxpayer makes a statement on their tax return to Inland Revenue. In practice, this is likely to cover most of the taxpayers covered under the development exemption proposed for the interest limitation rules. However, there may be some differences. 127 12.22 Officials seek submissions on the issues that are raised and whether the regimes should be aligned. New build exemption 12.23 The RLR rules do not provide a specific exemption for a new build. This has the potential to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, the benefit of the new build exemption. 12.24 For example, assume a residential rental property that is a new build earns $20,000 of net rental income before interest each year, and the interest expense is $21,000 per year. The new build exemption would allow the $21,000 of interest expense to potentially be deductible each year. However, the rental loss ring-fencing rule would not allow the net rental income to fall below nil each year. This would reduce the benefit of the new build exemption from a deduction of $21,000 per year to a deduction of $20,000 per year. 12.25 One option would be to extend the RLR exemption (as with section CB 7) to new builds, in line with the treatment of developers. For example, a taxpayer who qualifies for a new build exemption could indicate on their tax return that they have a qualifying new build, enabling them to be exempt from the RLR rules. 12.26 If the new build exemption were to extend to the RLR rules, we consider it should be added to the exclusion in section EL 10, so the income from new builds cannot be additional residential income of a residential portfolio to which they belong. Sale of property: arbitrage issues 12.27 Currently, properties that are taxed on sale due to being purchased for the purpose of a business dealing in land are not subject to the rental loss ring- fencing rules and so losses can be deducted in the years incurred. Other property that is not taxed on sale under another of the land sales rules must be notified to the Commissioner as land held on revenue account for this exemption to apply. Should such property not be notified to the Commissioner, deductions are allowed in the year of sale. Under the interest limitation proposal, deductions are not allowed on a current basis. This may create some mismatch in timing of the rules. 12.28 The bright-line sale rule has an anti-arbitrage provision that says a bright-line loss may not be able to be deducted immediately, but it may be grouped against other real property gains in the same or later income years. The RLR rules provide that all rental losses for the property are immediately deductible when the property is sold on revenue account. However, losses remain restricted if it is sold on capital account. 12.29 No special rule is provided for bright-line revenue account sales, so it appears that there is an arbitrage possibility to sell bright-line property on revenue account under the current law. This will be increased if we also allow deferred interest to be deducted when the property is sold on revenue account. 128 Example 46 – effect of residential loss ring-fencing on deferred interest deduction Property B has $20,000 in deductible interest expense each year. Assume net rental income before interest is also $20,000 per year. After nine years, $180,000 of interest has been ring- fenced and carried forward. Before the interest limitation rules this would all have been deductible over the nine-year period since the property did not have a net loss. Under interest limitation, at the time of sale, a $180,000 interest deduction becomes available. The rental loss ring-fencing rules would deny a deduction for $160,000 of this. This increases the incentive for a taxpayer to sell a property on revenue account (even including some cases where the property is sold for a net gain if the released interest deduction exceeds the amount of the gain), resulting in more than would be deductible in the year of sale than in the current rules. 12.30 Given the example, it may be worth implementing an anti-arbitrage rule for the deferred interest on bright-line revenue account sales, in a similar way to what is done with bright-line losses. It is also worth considering whether to include other RLR losses in an anti-arbitrage rule. As discussed in the chapter on revenue account property sales, if the bright-line anti-arbitrage rule is extended to section CB 6 property, a rental loss ring-fencing anti-arbitrage rule could apply to those sales as well as bright-line sales. 12.31 Numerous combinations of rules are possible here. Issues that arise include: • when and if deferred interest is deductible; • whether accumulated losses are released on sale of a property; • whether the bright-line arbitrage rule or the loss ring-fencing rule is applied, or both; and • how deferred interest enters into the loss ring-fencing calculation. 12.32 The treatment may depend upon whether the property is on revenue or capital account. Some of this was discussed in chapter 5. 12.33 The table at the end of the chapter illustrates how anti-arbitrage rules (including the current bright-line anti-arbitrage rule) may be incorporated into loss ring-fencing under the property disposal scenarios discussed in chapter 5. It would also be possible to prevent arbitrage by keeping the RLR rules as they are and providing that the deferred interest amount in the year of sale is treated as an additional cost for purpose of the section EL 20 bright-line anti-arbitrage rule. 12.34 The Government seeks submissions on the issues raised with the interaction of the interest limitation rules and the residential loss ring-fencing rules. 129 Questions for submitters Below are several questions the Government would specifically like feedback on from submitters: • How should the interest limitation rules be aligned with the loss ring- fencing rules? • Is the proposed approach of applying the interest limitation rules to establish deductible expenditure and then applying the RLR rules to this deductible expenditure an effective means of addressing this? • Are there other interface issues between the rules that we have not addressed? • How should we integrate interest limitation, ring-fencing, and bright-line anti-arbitrage rules? 130 Table 4: Current and proposed treatment of interest expenses under residential loss ring-fencing if some anti-arbitrage is incorporated into residential loss ring- fencing Revenue account Capital account Current law As interest is incurred Interest deductible subject to RLR Interest deductible subject to RLR In year of sale • Gain is taxable and adds to residential income to use against current and carryforward rental loss. • Loss is subject to bright-line ( BL) anti-avoidance rule, deductible only against other real property gains in the current or future years; • Loss is not taken into account as loss against residential income; • Whether a gain or loss, all suspended or carried forward deductions are unfenced and deductible against other income (unless the property sold was in a portfolio and it was not the last property in the portfolio, in which case excess deductions remain in the portfolio). • Gain or loss is not taxable or deductible; • Excess rental losses carried forward are not unfenced and remain in the portfolio or may be transferred to another property or portfolio if the property sold was the last property in the portfolio. Proposed law As interest is incurred Interest is not deductible Interest is not deductible 131 Revenue account Capital account In year of sale Option A 59 • If gain, gain is taxable and adds to residential income to use against current and carryforward rental loss. • If loss, loss is subject to BL anti- avoidance rule, deductible only against other real property gains in the current or future years; • Loss is not taken into account as loss against residential income; • Whether a gain or loss, interest associated with the property is not deductible; • All suspended or carried forward deductions are unfenced and deductible against other income (unless the property sold was in a portfolio and it was not the last property in the portfolio, in which case excess deductions remain in the portfolio). Option E • Gain or loss is not taxable or deductible; • Interest associated with the property is not deductible; • Excess rental deductions carried forward are not unfenced and remain in the portfolio or may be transferred to another property or portfolio if the property sold was the last property in the portfolio. Option B • If gain, gain is taxable and adds to residential income to use against current and carryforward rental loss. • If loss, loss is subject to BL anti- avoidance rule, deductible only against other real property gains in the current or future years; • Loss is not taken into account as loss against residential income; • All current and deferred interest is deductible in the year of sale; • All suspended or carried forward deductions are unfenced and deductible against other income (unless the property sold was in a portfolio and it was not the last property in the portfolio, in which case excess deductions remain in the portfolio). Option F 60 • Gain or loss is not taxable or deductible; • Interest, to the extent of an untaxed gain (if any), is not deductible; • Interest in excess of the non-deductible amount associated with the property is deductible and treated as an expense incurred in earning residential income for RLR purposes; • Excess rental deductions carried forward are not unfenced and remain in the portfolio, or may be transferred to another property or portfolio if the property sold was the last property in the portfolio. 59 Options refer to options on taxation of disposals discussed in chapter 4. 60 The discussion assumes Option F incorporates anti-arbitrage restrictions as discussed in chapter 4. 132 Revenue account Capital account Option C • If gain, gain is taxable and adds to residential income to use against current and carryforward rental loss. • If loss, loss is subject to BL anti- avoidance rule, deductible only against other real property gains in the current or future years; • Loss is not taken into account as loss against residential income; • Current and deferred interest is deductible in the year of sale to the extent of gain on sale; additional interest is not deductible; • All suspended or carried forward deductions are unfenced and deductible against other income (unless the property sold was in a portfolio and it was not the last property in the portfolio, in which case excess deductions remain in the portfolio). 133 Revenue account Capital account Option D • If gain, gain is taxable and adds to residential income to use against current and carryforward rental loss. • If loss, loss is not subject to BL anti-avoidance rule; • Instead, loss is taken into account as loss against residential income and becomes subject to RLR restriction; • Interest associated with the property is deductible and treated as an expense incurred in earning residential income for RLR purposes; • Unlike current law, excess rental deductions associated with property (after including the freed-up interest expense) are not unfenced and remain part of RLR carry-forward for the portfolio (or transferred to another property or portfolio if it was the last property in the portfolio). 134 Chapter 13 Interest limitation and mixed-use residential property Introduction 13.1 This chapter considers the application of the interest limitation proposal to residential property that is partly used to earn assessable income and partly used for private purposes. Common examples are baches or second homes that are rented out on a short-term basis if possible when not used by their owners. This chapter refers to these as mixed-use properties and the term includes properties that are subject to the existing mixed-use asset (MUA) rules. Current law on interest deductions for mixed use properties 13.2 The determination of what interest relates to a mixed-use property, and of how much of that interest is deductible, is generally made under the MUA rules in subpart DG of the Act. However, not all mixed-use properties are subject to the MUA rules. 13.3 The MUA rules apply where a property is sometimes used privately and sometimes used to derive income but is also unused for at least 62 days in an income year. The rules ensure that an appropriate proportion of the expenses that relate to the “unused” period is deductible. 13.4 The MUA rules do not apply to property that is: • not used privately at all (instead being either rented on a short-term basis or left vacant) (section DG 3(1)(a)). In this case, interest is generally treated as related to the property under tracing principles, and interest allocated on a per diem basis such that: − rental days will generally be deductible − vacant days will depend on the context; for example, whether the property was acquired for eventual private use, or for the purpose of resale; • vacant for less than 62 days in an income year (section DG 3(1)(b)). Tax treatment will generally be determined by a per diem allocation; • held by a company that is not a close company (section DG 3(3)). Companies have an automatic interest deduction. It would seem unlikely for a company that is not a close company to own residential property that is not used for the exclusive purpose of the company’s business; for example, as a development property, or for the purpose of providing accommodation to employees. Such property would not be mixed-use property. 13.5 Under subpart DG, interest is generally related to MUAs under tracing principles. However, there is a special rule for interest incurred by a close company that owns a MUA. Section DG 11 allocates any debt of the company 135 to the MUA up to the amount of the value of the MUA and treats interest on that debt as related to the asset. This is often referred to as a stacking rule, since it stacks the debt first against the MUA. 13.6 The MUA rules can also treat interest incurred by: • a company in the same group as a close company that owns a MUA (section DG 12); and • a direct or indirect shareholder in a close company that owns a MUA (sections DG 13 and DG 14) as related to the MUA (and thus only partially deductible), if the debt allocated to the MUA by the close company owner is less than the value of the MUA. This is a form of “interposed entity” rule. 13.7 Under subpart DG, interest expenditure related to a MUA is deductible in the year it is incurred to the extent of the ratio of income-earning days 61 /all days of actual use (that is, excluding vacant days) (sections DG 5 and DG 9). 13.8 MUAs are not subject to the residential loss ring-fencing rules (section EL 12). Instead, if income derived by the owner from non-associates is less than 2% of the value of the property, expenses in excess of that income are not deductible in the year incurred (section DG 16). These non-deductible expenses may be deductible in a later year in which income exceeds expenses (section DG 17). This is known as quarantining. If the quarantined asset in question is owned by a close company, interest expenditure incurred by group companies and shareholders can also be quarantined (sections DG 18 and DG 19). Proposals Determining what interest relates to mixed-use residential property Property not owned by a close company 13.9 For mixed-use residential property owned by a person who is not a close company, the tracing rules considered in chapter 4 will apply to determine what interest relates to that property. If the interest is not eligible for phasing, and the property is not a new build, the interest will not be deductible. Otherwise, the deductible portion of the interest must be calculated using the appropriate per diem formula under existing law, and a deduction will then be allowed for either all of that interest (if the property is a new build) or part of it under phasing. This is all very similar to the rules applying to property that is rented out all the time. 61 For completeness, we note that section CW 8B treats as exempt income some income earned from the use of a MUA that would normally be taxable. This in turn means expenses incurred to earn that exempt income are non- deductible. 136 13.10 The current quarantining rule would continue to apply to limit current year deductions on mixed-use residential property subject to the MUA rules, though it would not apply to non-deductible interest. 13.11 Any allowance of interest deductions when the relevant property is sold (as discussed in chapter 5) should also be able to be applied to a sale of mixed-use residential property. MUA property owned by a close company 13.12 It would not make sense to apply the tracing rules to residential property that is a MUA held by a close company, when section DG 11 already has its own regime for relating interest expense to MUAs. Section DG 11 should continue to apply in this case. This will have implications for the amount of interest deductions denied. It also creates a distinction between residential rental property and other MUAs, which in turn creates a need for a rule to determine how interest expense is allocated. We propose that it is allocated to MUAs pro rata. Example 47 – Close company with two MUAs, one of which is residential property – allocation of debt HB Ltd is a close company that owns a holiday home and a boat, both of which are subject to the MUA rules. The holiday home has a rateable value of $180,000 and the boat has a depreciated value of $60,000. The company has debt of $150,000 with associated interest expenditure of $8,000. Under the MUA allocation rule, all of this debt and interest will be allocated to the holiday home and the boat. The rule does not currently contain an ordering rule, but we suggest that the debt be allocated on a pro rata basis, that is,18/24ths (or $112,500) and 6/24ths (or $37,500), respectively. A deduction will then be denied for the $6,000 allocated to holiday home, and allowed in part for the portion allocated to the boat ($2,000) in accordance with the formula in section DG 11(3B). 13.13 If a close company with a MUA has both loans that existed before 27 March 2021 and loans taken out afterwards some approach will be needed to relate those loans to the different assets. It would not seem to make sense to take a tracing approach. Possibly the loans could be allocated pro rata, or some order could be provided for. For example, the debt allocated to the MUAs could be treated as the oldest debt. This could be left to be dealt with as an administrative matter, or a rule could be legislated. Submissions are sought on which option is preferable, and what a good rule would be. Close company holding MUA and non-MUA residential property 13.14 A close company could own residential property (or other property) that is a MUA and some residential property that is not a MUA (for example, property held for full-time rental) but is subject to denial of interest deductions. 13.15 In this case, it will not make sense to apply: • the MUA stacking rule to relate interest to MUAs; and • the general tracing rule to relate interest to non-MUA residential property. 137 13.16 Such an approach could result in the same interest being allocated to two different items of residential property. This is already an issue where a close company holds a MUA and a property subject to the residential loss ring- fencing rule. On the basis that it is not currently addressed legislatively, it may be that no response is required in this case also. Submissions are sought on how likely it would be for a company to hold both MUAs and non-MUA residential property. 13.17 There is a way to address this issue of a close company holding a MUA and non-MUA residential rental property subject to some form of interest deduction limitation. Section DG 11 could not apply to relate to the MUA any debt allocated on a tracing basis to non-MUA, non-new build residential property. Another possibility could be that interest expense is allocated to the non-MUA residential property as well as the MUA on a pro rata basis, as in Example 47. 13.18 When a close company with a MUA holds non-MUA residential property that is not subject to any form of interest deduction limitation, no allocation issue arises. Example 48 – close company with non-MUA residential property and a MUA – allocation of debt RB Ltd is a close company that owns a long-term rental property not eligible for the NBE and a boat. The boat is subject to the MUA rules. The rental property has a rateable value of $180,000 and the boat has a depreciated value of $60,000. The company has debt of $150,000 with associated interest expenditure of $8,000. $50,000 of this debt was incurred to acquire the property and meet expenses related to it, and the remaining $100,000 has funded the boat and miscellaneous expenses relating to the boat. Under the first approach referred to above, interest on $50,000 (assume $2,667) is related to the rental property on tracing principles and is non- deductible, and $60,000 of the remaining $100,000 of debt is related to the boat under the stacking rule in section DG 11. Interest on this debt (assume $3,200) is partially deductible under the formula in section DG 11(3B). Interest on the remaining $40,000 of debt (assume $2,133) is fully deductible. Under the second approach, the $8,000 of interest is treated the same way as in Example 47, that is, it is allocated to the rental property and the boat on the basis of their relative values. This will result in more interest being allocated to the rental property, and so being non-deductible. MUA property owned by a close company: interposed entity and group company rules 13.19 Where residential property is a MUA owned by a close company, we propose that the interposed entity rules considered in chapter 11 should not apply. Instead the rules that already apply to relate group company or shareholder level debt to the MUA in some cases (sections DG 12 to DG 14) should continue to apply. 138 Example 49 – MUA interposed entity rule applied by a corporate shareholder in a close company with a residential property MUA HB Holdings Ltd owns shares in a number of subsidiaries, including 100% of HB Ltd in Example 47. HB Holdings Ltd has debt of $1 million, and associated interest expense of $50,000. HB Holdings chooses to take into its own tax return the full amount of the adjustment required by section DG 12, as a consequence of HB Ltd having a net asset balance of $90,000 ($240,000 – $150,000 - see section DG 11(7)). Under current law, HB Holdings would split its interest expenditure into two amounts. First it would determine the “reduced amount”, which would be its interest expense x the net asset balance/its total debt, or $50,000 x $90,000/$1,000,000, which is $4,500. If the holiday home is not eligible for the NBE, a deduction would be denied for $3,375 of this interest (because it is attributable to the holiday home owned by HB Ltd), and allowed in part for the $1,625 attributable to the boat. If the holiday home is eligible for the NBE, a portion of the amount allocated to the holiday home will be deductible. HB Holdings will be allowed a deduction for the remaining $44,000 of its interest, under section DG 12(7C). Example 50 – MUA interposed entity rule applied by a trust shareholder in a MUA with a residential property MUA Suppose that instead of being owned by HB Holdings, HB Ltd in Example 47 is owned by the trustees of a family trust called The Hinemoa Trust. The Hinemoa Trust also has debt of $1 million and interest expense of $50,000, but only $20,000 of its debt was incurred to acquire the shares in HB Ltd. Under section DG 14, the Trust must allocate the $1,000 of interest attributable to the debt to the MUAs. A deduction would be denied for $750 of the interest allocated to the property, and allowed in part for $250 of the interest allocated to the boat. Concurrent application of different interposed entity rules 13.20 If a company that is not a close company holds a residential property, or a close company holds a residential property that is not a MUA, the interposed entity rules in chapter 11, rather than sections DG 12 to DG 14, will prima facie determine the extent to which any interest incurred by a shareholder in that company is treated as related to the property. 13.21 Again, the co-existence of different rules for allocating debt to residential property (in this case, property held by an interposed entity) is at least potentially problematic. 13.22 Firstly, if the non-MUA property is held by a close company that also owns a MUA, it may not be possible for a shareholder of that company (whether a natural person or a company) to apply sensibly both the proposed interposed entity rule and sections DG 12 to DG 14. This may already be an issue in terms of the interaction of sections DG 12 to DG 14 and EL 16 and EL 17 (the interposed entity rule for purposes of the rental loss ring-fencing rule). 13.23 Secondly, it may be that the group company or shareholder is required to or chooses to apply both sections DG 12 to DG 14 and the interposed entity rules in chapter 11 with respect to different companies. This would not be problematic for a shareholder who is a natural person, since that person will apply tracing to both interests. For a shareholder who is a company, the 139 application of stacking to determine the amount of interest allocated to the interest in the company holding the MUA, and tracing to determine the amount of interest allocated to the company holding the non-MUA residential property, may be problematic. Quarantining 13.24 Quarantining would continue to apply to residential property that is a MUA, though, given the reduced amount of deductible interest, the amount of expenditure for which a current year deduction is not allowed under quarantining will be reduced. Questions for submitters Below are several questions the Government would specifically like feedback on from submitters: • How commonly are residential property MUAs held in close companies? • How commonly are residential property and other MUAs held in the same close company? • How do companies currently deal with the conflict between the MUA interposed entity rule and the RLR interposed entity rule, where they own both an interest in a close company with a MUA and a close company with a residential property subject to the RLR rule? 140 Chapter 14 Administration Introduction 14.1 This chapter considers the administrative aspects of the Government’s proposal to limit interest deductions for residential investment properties and aspects of the recent extension of the bright-line test from five to ten years. It outlines the proposed approach to administering these changes in terms of making the rules work, ensuring compliance and informing Government about the effectiveness of the changes and whether they are appropriately targeted. Information currently available to Inland Revenue 14.2 Inland Revenue receives data in relation to residential rental properties through different channels. Taxpayers provide information to Inland Revenue directly (in some returns or forms) or through Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) in the Land Transfer Tax Statement as part of a property transfer. Inland Revenue receives additional property data from third parties such as LINZ and commercial providers. However, there are currently limited reporting requirements concerning interest expenses incurred in relation to residential rental properties. 14.3 Taxpayers earning income that is not taxed at source (such as rental income) are required to include this income in their income tax return. However, income tax returns do not currently require taxpayers to specify information relating to interest expense incurred on loans relating to residential rental properties. 14.4 Individuals with rental income are prompted to complete a rental income schedule (IR3R), which is provided alongside the IR3 income tax return form. This form is not compulsory but records relevant information for working out profit from rental activity, including the amount of interest expense incurred by the taxpayer in relation to the rental activity. 14.5 Additionally, taxpayers who are in business are encouraged to complete and file the IR10 form, which collects financial data for primarily statistical purposes. Similar to the IR3R, the IR10 records information about income and expenses that could be related to a rental activity, although (unlike the IR3R) it does not ask for expenses that are specifically related to this type of business - instead, the form simply asks for the business’ expenses as per its financial statements. 14.6 The current level of information reporting on residential land sales and on income and expenses from residential rental activities poses a number of challenges for the administration of the proposed interest limitation rules and the extended bright-line test: 141 • It would be difficult to understand whether owners of residential land understand and are complying with their tax obligations, in particular in relation to situations where an exemption from the application of the new rules would apply. • It is important for the Government to know how effective the policies are, their revenue impacts and whether they are appropriately targeted. There is currently no comprehensive data available to allow for this. 14.7 There are a number of administrative changes that could be considered to address these issues. Inland Revenue could extend or introduce additional (compulsory) reporting requirements for residential rental property owners. This involves a trade-off between better compliance on one hand, and increased compliance and administrative costs on the other. It is also important to consider who the compliance costs will fall on. 14.8 Residential rental property owners will need to be able to work out their allowable interest deductions. This means for existing properties they will have to know whether the interest phase-out rules apply (in respect of residential land purchased before 27 March 2021). In relation to residential property purchased on or after 27 March 2021, or for land where a code compliance certificate (CCC) for a new build is issued on or after this date, they will need to determine whether any of the exemptions from the application of the new rules apply (for example, the development and new build exemptions). Accordingly, it may make the most sense for taxpayers to provide the required additional information about whether these exemptions apply. 14.9 Consideration is being given to whether it may be necessary to require taxpayers to provide additional information may be necessary to support the administration of the Government’s interest limitation proposal and the changes to the bright-line test - for example, the amount of total relevant interest expenses incurred and the amount of interest deducted for tax purposes, or providing evidence that an exemption from interest limitation applies. 14.10 Another option would be to simply rely on the existing record keeping rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994, under which taxpayers are required to keep records that are relevant to determining their tax position. These can be requested by Inland Revenue as part of compliance activity, including an audit. 14.11 However, having the right data at the right time would enable Inland Revenue to improve its interventions to better assist owners of residential investment properties to get it right from the start. Also, ensuring that Inland Revenue has information that is timely and sufficient for risk-assessing tax positions taken by investment property owners would enable Inland Revenue’s compliance actions to be more timely and accurately targeted at the higher-risk taxpayers. 142 Proposals Interest limitation: verifying deductible interest amounts 14.12 On balance, the Government considers that it would be appropriate to ensure that Inland Revenue has more comprehensive data on interest expenses incurred and deducted by taxpayers with investments in residential land. To this end, consideration is being given to adding new fields to income tax return forms for total interest incurred in relation to land used for income-earning purposes and the amount of this interest that has been deducted. 14.13 Submissions are invited on this proposal. New build issues 14.14 Chapters 7, 8 and 9 consider the proposed design of the exemption for new builds from interest limitation and the five-year bright-line test for new builds (“new build rules”). Since the design of these rules is a subject of this discussion document, whether any additional information will be required from taxpayers using the new build rules is still being worked through. 14.15 As mentioned in the earlier chapters on new builds, the Government proposes to use CCCs to verify that a property is a new build. To ensure Inland Revenue has sufficient information, existing forms could be altered so that additional information on new builds is requested, or taxpayers could be required to provide information by some other means. Questions for submitters The Government is seeking feedback on the following: • Are there issues with adding new fields to income tax return forms for total interest incurred in relation to land used for income-earning purposes and the amount of this interest that has been deducted? • What data points might Inland Revenue be able to use to verify that a person qualifies for the new build rules? • What records should taxpayers have to provide or keep in order to show that they are eligible for the new build rules? • Are there issues with relying on CCCs to determine whether a property is a new build? Are there integrity issues the Government needs to consider? • If there are problems with relying on CCCs, what else could be used to verify that a property is a new build? • What information could subsequent purchasers use to determine that a property they have acquired is eligible for the exemption for new builds from the proposed interest limitation rules? 143 Record keeping 14.16 Under section 22 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, taxpayers are required to keep and retain records for a period of at least seven years so their tax position can be readily ascertained by Inland Revenue in the event of an audit. This includes information or documents about sales, income and expenses, and assets and liabilities. Taxpayers use those records to fill in tax returns and finalise their tax position. Inland Revenue may review these records in case of an audit to ensure the correctness of assessments. 14.17 No specific record-keeping rules regarding the new interest limitation rules are proposed. Taxpayers would be required to retain records supporting their decisions on interest deductions under the new rules for seven years, in line with the current requirement for all records relating to determining tax liabilities. 14.18 However, should deductions denied become allowable if the disposal of the property is subject to income tax (see chapter 5) , this may mean that in some cases residential rental property owners need to have records older than seven years if they want to claim the deductions that were denied in years prior to the disposal. This is consistent with the existing seven-year business record retention rule which starts in the income year immediately following the income year in which a deduction is claimed by a taxpayer.

Such information allows Inland Revenue to see whether the correct amount of tax has been paid and provide quicker, simpler, and more accurate services to taxpayers such as automatic refunds without the need for a tax return. 1.2 Information (or data) is also crucial for ensuring that the correct amount of income has been declared by a business. One way that Inland Revenue can check on business income is to receive information about sales. This consultation document therefore asks for public views on Inland Revenue being able to collect bulk lots of data from payment service providers. This information will only be used to verify business income. The customer’s details will not be collected or identifiable. 1.3 Inland Revenue has been collecting datasets (a package of data relating to a particular business) from payment service providers since 2005 enabled under section 17B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). 1.4 Electronic payment has grown exponentially in New Zealand and is now the main way that most businesses make sales. These electronic transactions are facilitated by payment service providers. The legislative provision for data collection is now out-dated in this context and does not allow for regular information collection from a third-party. Currently, Inland Revenue is required to issue a notice each time such data is required. 1.5 The proposals in this discussion document represent the second stage of improvements to the rules about dataset collection. In 2019 amendments were introduced to allow repeat requests for data via Order in Council, creating a more transparent, accountable, and fair application of this data collection power (section 17L of the TAA). The amendment followed extensive consultation with a variety of stakeholders to ensure that an appropriate mechanism for the repeat collection of datasets from third parties had been identified and the rules were fit for purpose, minimising compliance costs. The submissions received in response to this were largely favourable and emphasised that the proposed amendment would provide transparency around collection. 1.6 This current round of consultation considers the detail of that Order in Council to understand potential impacts on payment service providers and ensure that changes remain effective, comprehensive, and sustainable. Legislation requires that this consultation document, along with the draft Order in Council (see appendix 2), is part of the consultation process with interested parties on implementing the collection of bulk datasets from payment service providers. This document therefore seeks your feedback and welcomes all comments. 6 Summary of proposal 1.7 The Government is proposing for Inland Revenue to collect datasets on a regular basis from payment service providers to enable initiatives that improve income reporting for tax purposes and service provision. This would be a shift from current ad hoc dataset collection. Information collection would be enabled by Order in Council and would allow for the collection of bulk data on a regular and repeating basis. 1.8 In discharging its duties to administer the tax system, Inland Revenue must correctly determine the amount of tax payable by taxpayers. Regular dataset collection from payment service providers is considered necessary to enable the Commissioner to fulfil these duties. Regular dataset collection would also enable Inland Revenue to improve compliance by providing insights that enable the better targeting of education initiatives. How to make a submission 1.9 Submissions are invited on the proposals in this discussion document. 1.10 The closing date for submissions is 20 August 2021. 1.11 Submissions can be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Regular dataset collection from payment service providers” in the subject line; or • by post to: Regular dataset collection from payment service providers C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.12 Submissions should include a brief summary of the major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it is acceptable for officials from Inland Revenue to contact submitters to discuss the points raised, if required. 1.13 Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of a submission, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Those making a submission should clearly indicate if they consider any part of their submission should be withheld under the Act. Answers to question 11 will be withheld in full. 7 CHAPTER 2 Detailed proposal 2.1 The proposal is for the Government to make an Order in Council authorising information collection on a regular basis from payment service providers. This information will consist of merchants’ aggregated transactions – not individual customer transactions – and account information. Individuals’ payment data will not be collected or identifiable in the data collected. 2.2 This information is considered necessary for the purpose of administering the Revenue Acts, as it will enable Inland Revenue to ensure that business taxpayers comply with their tax obligations by paying the correct amount of tax. This will protect and uphold the integrity of the tax system. Collecting this information will also allow Inland Revenue to offer improved services and support such as more focussed education and marketing initiatives if the information collected allows the department to better target its resources. Persons to whom the regulation applies 2.3 The proposals are aimed at payment service providers. A payment service provider is defined as a third-party business who facilitates payment for goods and services between customers and merchants. It includes, but is not limited to: • merchant acquirers • entities who provide switch services • entities who provide settlement services • entities who provide online payment gateways, and • entities who provide alternative payment methods. 2.4 This definition does not include bank-to-bank payments (such as direct debits, standing orders or transfers between accounts) or the provision of payment hardware. The Government is exploring the potential to request data that is currently excluded from this definition (such as direct debits). This will be subject to a separate round of public consultation and a separate Order in Council. 2.5 New Zealanders are high users of electronic payment types and the payment service provider market continues to change, with several smaller players rapidly emerging. Given this shift, it is timely to broaden the number of payment service providers information is received from. 2.6 The regulation will require payment service providers to provide Inland Revenue with information on merchants. A merchant is defined as a person or entity that is engaged in a business activity. However, information will not be gathered on large merchants, who are defined as those whose value through the payment service 8 provider is greater than $30 million. 1 The Commissioner may seek to vary this threshold amount and will provide appropriate notice in this case. 2.7 An exemption will be granted to a payment service provider who has subcontracted another payment service provider to undertake the processing of the payments where the required information is held by the contracted provider. This is intended to avoid the double collection of data. Where entities feel they fall within this category, they will be required to articulate that they are exempt. As part of this, they must be specific on the types of transactions this involves and who these have been subcontracted to. The decision on who is exempted is at the discretion of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Initiative benefits 2.8 The benefits of regularly obtaining this information under the new provision centres on designing better policies and ensuring Inland Revenue can take a more informed approach to compliance. More timely, accurate and comprehensive insights would be made possible by the pool of data gathered. Such an approach includes everything from supporting taxpayers to get it right from the start through to taking action on those who deliberately do not comply. Benefits for payment service providers 2.9 Under the proposal, regular dataset collection will apply to all parties in an industry. Broadening the number of payment service providers that Inland Revenue receives information from will introduce equality amongst providers. This is both with regards to ensuring that compliance costs apply to all players – eliminating any competitive advantage – but also ensuring that there is no commercial disadvantage through customer perception of payment service providers who provide information to Inland Revenue vs those that do not. 2.10 The proposal would provide a more efficient and transparent process for Inland Revenue to collect the same type of information as it does currently, but more regularly and from more providers. Currently, the payment service providers from whom data is collected under the current provision are not publicly known, and there is limited public awareness that this data is being collected by Inland Revenue. Under this proposal, the information collected is authorised by a regulation and details on what types of data it collects and from whom will be public. The purpose of publishing these details on the Inland Revenue website is to improve transparency for individuals as well as ensure that all payment service providers are equally reflected in these transparent practices. 2.11 This increased transparency also means the legal provision for what information can be shared with Inland Revenue, and the legal mechanism authorising this sharing, is understood and visible. Section 17L provides greater certainty of authority for disclosure of information so there is no sense of a legal ‘grey area’ in the gathering of this information or risk to reputation through the perception of dubious information sharing practices. 1 The $30 million figure is in line with the requirements for International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). 9 Benefits for the tax system 2.12 The data currently obtained from payment service providers is not received regularly, as the process is very time and resource consuming. This has resulted in irregular collection that does not encompass all payment service providers in the market, reducing effectiveness. This ad hoc collection has been because the legislation enabling the gathering of this information was for one-off requests for information, not ongoing requests, requiring that the full process be repeated every time information is required. Irregular collection makes it difficult to achieve outcomes such as accurately assessing compliance over several years and providing timely support when needed. 2.13 This analysis is supported using benchmarking. Benchmarks are established by reviewing data from merchants who are known to be compliant or who have good controls in place to ensure accuracy of reporting. The compliant merchants benchmark is essential in order to establish expected cash ratios for an industry and area. Once established, it is simple and efficient to identify merchants who fall outside of expected cash ratios and as an indicator that further discussion with the business concerned may be appropriate. Collecting this data on a regular basis would therefore improve efficiency and so help promote compliance and maintain the integrity of the tax system. 2.14 Previously collected datasets on merchants have improved Inland Revenue's ability to address the complex compliance issues posed by the hidden economy. It has achieved this by identifying parties who sit outside, or partially outside, the tax system and those not fully complying with their obligations (for example, by not declaring cash sales). This information enables Inland Revenue to develop targeted compliance interventions, which range from education and assistance (for example, supporting businesses that have ceased trading to finalise their tax affairs), to audit and enforcement activity for identified non-compliant businesses. Inland Revenue is also able to rethink its compliance approach as it allows for a greater focussing of engagement and more ways to influence behaviour. This targeted approach ensures efficient use of resources and supports greater voluntary compliance with tax obligations. Type of information collected 2.15 The information collected from payment service providers will relate to merchants and will be the aggregate monthly income data of a merchant. The aggregated information for a merchant’s transactions would include debit, credit, cash out and refunds (both volume and value) for the previous three-month period as well as their identity and contact information. These datasets would not go to the level of individual transactions ensuring that it is not possible to identify customers’ payment data in what is collected. Some account-specific information will be collected to enable accurate matching. Any further follow-up activities will be undertaken with the merchant directly. 2.16 As payment service providers vary in size, market capture and technological architecture, the level of information they hold will vary as well as how they hold it. To address this, Inland Revenue would be seeking the minimum information set out in table 1, with the intention of having it supplemented by additional fields that individual payment service providers may hold where possible. 10 Table 1: Minimum information sought Data collected Details Reason for collection Merchant unique identifier The unique identifier given by the payment service provider’s system to identify each merchant account in their records. This enables the unique identification of merchants and provides a link back to the source provider. Merchant’s identity and contact information Any data that identifies a merchant or trading entity, including: • the IRD/GST number • the NZBN number • the Companies Office number (or the date of birth of an individual if the merchant is not an entity) • all account address information, including physical and postal, phone numbers, and • all terminal address information (site information including name, contact name, addresses). This data is key to correctly identifying a merchant. Date of birth is a key identifying attribute for individuals who are merchants. Inland Revenue can validate if the correct IRD number has been provided to the payment service providers. Legal name, trade name, merchant name, or other names All the names under which the business operates and/or is known by in the payment service provider systems, including an individual’s names where the merchant is not an entity. Assists with uniquely identifying a merchant. Merchant contact person and details, including locations Contact person or person who set up the contract with the payment service providers. Must be a natural person. This includes the full name, registered business address, phone number which is provided for business purposes of the person. Provides a better understanding of who is behind the business. If the business is not registered for tax purposes, then it provides a contact for who might be running the business. 11 Data collected Details Reason for collection Aggregated monthly data on payments Debit, credit, cash out, refunds – both volume and value, per merchant, per month/year. Identify compliant and non- compliant merchants (including unregistered merchants). Assists in identifying under-reporting of income. Compliant merchant information provides a benchmark for industry performance to identify where things do not look quite right. Information can also be used to target Inland Revenue services to compliant merchants (for example, assistance in commencing or ceasing a business). Merchant bank account(s) Bank account or settlement account to which the transaction is paid. Aids with the data matching. Also allows us to calculate total transaction values. Access to records. 2.17 Most of the information collected relates to merchants and the individuals who run those businesses. Only the minimum personal information necessary will be included in the data request. The personal information relates to merchants who are undertaking business in their own name, as well as individuals who are the contact point for the merchant. 2.18 The information collected relates to all merchants who engage a payment service provider and whose activity through the payment service provider is up to $30 million. In order to prevent data for entities that exceed $30 million per year being collected, we are proposing that payment service providers not provide data on entities they reasonably believe will exceed this amount of revenue at the start of the year. Where a merchant is approaching this threshold, payment service providers can cease to provide data on that entity in the quarter they exceed the threshold for the remainder of the year. 2.19 Information on merchants will be used to determine industry benchmarks, such as cash ratio percentages, and identify other potential indicators that merchants might need help in meeting their tax obligations. 2.20 There are potential compliance costs that come with meeting prescribed data standards for sharing, and so a goal of this consultation exercise is to work with payment service providers to keep these as low as practicable. Frequency of collection 2.21 The data itself will be provided by the payment service providers every three months covering each financial quarter. The provider will be given a period of a month to provide the requested data following the given three-month period. 12 Compliance costs 2.22 The proposed increase in the frequency of information sharing with Inland Revenue would be expected to give rise to some additional compliance costs for payment service providers. Feedback on expected compliance costs and potential mitigations is requested later in this document. 2.23 The potential for compliance cost increases are mostly due to the increased frequency of data collection. Efficiency improvements can be realised to mitigate these expected cost increases. Most notably, increased frequency means that payment service providers can establish ongoing processes to provide the requested information, instead of responding ad hoc each time they receive a request. Such practices would mean that payment service providers can undertake their obligations more efficiently. Where adjustments are required to any reports that are produced by the payment service providers’ systems, these represent a one-off cost with ongoing savings realised once this is in place. 2.24 Timeframes for making needed system changes will factor in the need to make changes to multiple computer systems as well as fit these changes alongside other system change priorities. These will also take into account that payment service providers may not be able to make the system changes until the requirements have been fully determined. Inland Revenue will work with payment service providers to establish the time needed to make necessary system changes to ensure adequate time to comply. Penalties for failing to supply requested information 2.25 Collecting information under the new provision would be a power lawfully conferred on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. If a payment service provider fails to provide the information requested in the time allowed by the Commissioner, they will have committed an offence under the TAA. 2.26 Failing to provide information is an offence with criminal penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment. Such penalties would apply for each failure to provide requested information. Information flows 2.27 The proposed information flow between payment service providers and Inland Revenue would follow the same model as is currently in place for requests for bulk data (made under section 17B). Under the new provision (section 17L), information would be provided by all payment service providers quarterly, without requiring ad hoc notices from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to each payment service provider every time information is required. 2.28 Figure 1 illustrates the proposed regular mechanism of bulk data collection under section 17L compared with under the ad hoc collection provision. 13 Figure 1: Comparative overview of the mechanism for bulk data collection under sections 17L and 17B Specifications for the reporting method 2.29 As technologies change, so too may the reporting methods in the future. The intention therefore is for flexibility so that reporting methods will be dependent on the technological capability of the payment service providers but may include web services and email. 2.30 The information will be required to be supplied in a format that Inland Revenue can upload into its systems and that meets certain security standards. Separate operating protocols will be developed for and entered into with each of the payment service providers, reflecting the information they hold and their technology architecture. This will be agreed with payment service providers. Examples 2.31 Examples 1–3 illustrate scenarios where regular sharing of bulk data from payment service providers with Inland Revenue would be of value. Example 1 A new business has recently started trading and, due to a predicted annual turnover of $40,000, is not GST registered. After a successful start-up period, they receive $75,000 of income in their first six months. Inland Revenue can verify the business’ income through the information provided by the relevant payment service provider and takes proactive steps to remind the business owner that they are now required to register for GST, providing education and support earlier and enabling them to fulfil their tax obligations. The business is able to meet their tax obligations and embed best practices, rather than receiving an unexpected tax bill for the oversight. 14 Example 2 By collecting bulk payment data, Inland Revenue can establish that most bakeries in a given area receive on average X% of their income through electronic payments, with the remaining percentage accounted for through cash transactions. This establishes a benchmark for the proportion of income legitimate bakeries receive as cash, which can then be used to identify unusual ratios of cash vs electronic payment for other bakeries, which could reveal underreporting of income. Applying the verified benchmark to the data means Inland Revenue can quickly identify statistical outliers and focus resources on understanding these differences. If avoidance is detected, this could lead to further investigation. By improving the compliance of non-compliant businesses, the tax competitive advantage they had over their compliant competitors is removed, ensuring a fairer and more competitive market for all players. Example 3 There are two companies, each operated by a sole director, that offer gardening and landscape services in nearby districts. Their declarations of income are accurate and verifiable. In checking their declarations against the information provided by the appropriate payment service provider, it is flagged that both businesses are registered to the same address. This prompts Inland Revenue to investigate further, which reveals that both businesses are owned by the same person. Each company had been paying deductions to Inland Revenue monthly as their gross annual PAYE (including ESCT) was less than $500,000. However, group companies should be counted as a single company for PAYE purposes, and all amounts of tax withheld by the two companies are aggregated. This puts the total gross annual PAYE over $500,000 and means that the companies now have an obligation to pay their deductions to Inland Revenue at least twice a month. By identifying that apparently distinct business are subject to aggregation rules, Inland Revenue is able to provide specific and targeted educational interventions to support these businesses to understand why these rules apply to them. 15 Questions for submitters 1. Is the definition(s) of a payment service provider, as set out in the draft Order in Council, fit for purpose and able to capture all the players in this space? Is there room for misunderstandings or diverse interpretations of these terms? 2. Is the proposed information required from payment service providers adequate? a) Can all payment service providers provide this information? b) Are there other fields of information that would add value or that Inland Revenue might require? 3. Is the proposed method for bulk data collection fit for purpose? Comments are especially welcome about the: a) proposed format for providing information b) mode of reporting c) frequency of data collection, and d) proposed definition of ‘large merchants’ (those whose annual value through the payment service provider is greater than $30 million – see paragraph 2.18). 4. What security specifications do you feel are needed for transferring and handling this information? Are the safeguards outlined below adequate to protect the privacy of individuals? 5. What compliance costs do you see for payment service providers and wider costs for merchants and consumers? Can these be mitigated? 6. Do you consider that the proposal in paragraph 2.18 about the non-provision of data for merchants that exceed $30 million in revenue in a year is workable? 7. Do you have any concerns around the degree of transparency Inland Revenue intends to provide around collecting this data? 8. What future technology changes do you foresee that will disrupt and change the landscape for payment service providers? Will this impact what data is held and by whom? 9. Are there any other things that should be considered as part of the proposed regular bulk collection of information held by payment service providers, or wider comments you wish to make? 10. What are your thoughts on reporting e-commerce data, such as bank-to-bank, bill payments and direct debits? (This is not within the scope of this proposal but is being explored for the future). 11. For payment service providers: The Government would also be grateful if you could provide detail regarding how your processes work, with regards to what information is collected, processed and how. This will help inform initial conversations between Inland Revenue’s data scientists and each payment service provider around what data is requested. This information will be kept confidential. 16 CHAPTER 3 Information handling Retention and disposal of information 3.1 The information collected will not be retained longer than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. The original datasets will be held for three years, before being reviewed as to whether they are obsolete and therefore need to be disposed of or, in the cases of significant evasion, require longer retention. In this instance, only information relating to suspected merchants would be retained, not the entire dataset. This is in accordance with the Retention and Disposal Authority as approved by Archives New Zealand. 3.2 If the decision is made to dispose of the information, Inland Revenue follows the process set out in its Retention and Disposal Authority, which is approved by Archives New Zealand. Safeguards 3.3 The Government takes the protection of personal information seriously. The proposed collection would include controls and processes to minimise any risk of a privacy or secrecy breach occurring. In addition, Inland Revenue has an excellent track record in managing datasets from external entities and other government departments. Well-defined processes described in this section are therefore already in place around data receipt and handling practices. 3.4 Inland Revenue has been working closely with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner throughout this project and will continue to do so through the creation of the Order in Council. 3.5 Operational protocols between Inland Revenue and each payment service provider would be in place following the Order in Council being made and before information collection begins. This agreement would set out the collection process and the safeguards to ensure the confidentiality of information. 3.6 Information would be available only to authorised Inland Revenue staff, to ensure that information is treated appropriately. Under current legislation, staff who knowingly disclose information outside what is legally permitted face employment action and potential criminal liability for breaching taxpayer confidentiality. Where convicted, individuals would face a monetary penalty and/or a term of imprisonment. 3.7 If, despite the safeguards, a breach occurs, measures will be put in place to identify any affected merchants or individuals as quickly as possible and the necessary steps taken to minimise and mitigate any risk to them. Also, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner would be notified and involved where appropriate. 2 2 If the breach is for a legal entity (company) then the Office of the Privacy Commissioner is not notified. 17 3.8 Under the proposal, several pieces of information would be required to be collected to effectively confirm the identity of a merchant and associated individuals. This amount of information is needed to minimise any potential for, and impact of, errors in data or data matching. It is important to minimise these types of errors as they could negatively impact on legitimate merchants, or risk revealing the personal information of merchants unconnected to each other. 3.9 The data collected from payment service providers will be held within Inland Revenue’s new data intelligence platform. This platform can restrict access to certain types of data. In addition, there are strong safeguards for storage, and audit trails to monitor unauthorised use. Access is controlled by the platform’s administrators which, together with Inland Revenue’s data governance policies, ensures that the data is only used for the purpose it was collected for, is held securely and is disposed of appropriately. 3.10 The new provision contains a statutory review requirement (section 17L (4)) that requires the Commissioner to conduct a review of the operation of the provision, in consultation with the Privacy Commissioner. This review would be required to be carried out within five years of section 17L coming into force. The review acts as an effective safeguard against potential risks, should the operating of section 17L not be fit for purpose. 18 APPENDIX 1 Tax Administration Act 1994: Section 17L Regulations providing for regular collection of bulk data What this section does (1) This section provides a regulation-making power in relation to the administration of this Act and the other Inland Revenue Acts to authorise the Commissioner to collect bulk information in the form of datasets from a person who is the holder of the information if the collection of the information is considered necessary or relevant for a purpose relating to the administration or enforcement of a matter arising from or connected with a function lawfully conferred on the Commissioner.

As New Zealand is a small economy, to advance these objectives it is likely there will be increased demand from businesses based in New Zealand to obtain workers with specialist skills from abroad. Conversely, many New Zealanders will seek opportunities to live and work overseas. The tax arrangements for internationally mobile workers can be complex and impose compliance costs on businesses and/or the individual worker. 1.2 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted work and travel patterns. It has also highlighted the role of technology in enabling cross-border work arrangements. The pandemic has accelerated existing trends affecting how, when and where people work. Technology, such as artificial intelligence, and the greater use of contracts for the supply of personal services will be increasingly important drivers in the future. 1.3 Against that background, and in light of concerns raised with officials, it is timely to review the tax obligations that apply to the payers of cross-border workers to ensure they remain fit for purpose. 1.4 The purpose of this officials’ issues paper is to outline domestic technical tax and policy issues that arise for businesses bringing workers to New Zealand where those workers are either employees or non-resident contractors (in this paper collectively referred to as “workers”). The focus of this paper is on the payer’s employment- related tax obligations. • Employers are obliged to withhold tax under the Pay as You Earn (PAYE) system and pay fringe benefit tax (FBT) and employer’s superannuation contribution tax (ESCT), where applicable. • Payers of non-resident contractors are obliged to withhold non-resident contractor’s tax (NRCT) from contract payments. These tax obligations were introduced in the latter half of the 20th century. Although the obligations serve different purposes, it is useful to review them together in light of the changing world of work. 1.5 The system of collecting tax from the payer via withholding is long-established. This system reduces the compliance burden overall by removing from each payee the obligations to pay and report tax and placing those obligations on the payer. The withholding tax system minimises the risk of non-compliance, smooths the payment of tax for both the payee and the government, and supports other aims, such as the accuracy of the transfer system – for example, Working for Families payments. 1.6 Arguably, employees working in New Zealand for a non-resident employer (whether as a remote worker, a business traveller or on assignment to a New Zealand employer) and non-resident contractors who are working in New Zealand 6 are in different circumstances to local employees and contractors. These different circumstances may mean a different policy approach is justified. 1.7 From a policy perspective, one consideration is whether an ultimate tax liability exists for the payee in New Zealand. Another consideration is whether withholding taxes enable the risk of non-compliance to be managed. The final consideration is whether better provision, and use, of information can play a role in promoting tax compliance. 1.8 This paper outlines potential policy options for addressing issues faced by payers with a view to improving certainty, efficiency and fairness in the tax system. Some potential solutions are proposed for consideration, and suggestions for other potential solutions are invited. 1.9 Many of the issues that have been brought to our attention are a mixture of policy and operational matters. Purely operational issues have been excluded from this paper. 1.10 For the avoidance of doubt, this paper does not consider the tax treatment of people working in New Zealand under the Recognised Seasonal Employer scheme. Nor does it include situations in which an employee working in New Zealand constitutes a permanent establishment of a non-resident employer. In addition, issues affecting New Zealanders working abroad are not considered. 1.11 It is also important to note that the pandemic has challenged the fitness of the current double tax agreement tests for employees and others who work across borders. It is not yet clear when, or even whether, a new international consensus will emerge. Although we understand that other countries also see some merit in looking at these rules, officials do not consider it necessary to wait for any international processes before reviewing New Zealand’s domestic settings. Glossary of helpful terms Assignment An assignment is an arrangement between the legal employer (the home country employer) and another employer (the host country employer) that the employee works for the host country employer while remaining an employee of the home country employer. This arrangement is particularly common within corporate groups. Also called a secondment. Home/host country The home country is the country the employee was sent from. Typically, they will have been a tax resident in the home country before the assignment, but this is not always the case. The country they are assigned to work in is the host country. Remote worker The employee’s workplace is not their employer’s main workplace; for example, they may normally work from home rather than the employer’s office. Shadow payroll A payroll that records details of the employee’s remuneration for the purposes of the host country revenue authority. Short-term business traveller A worker whose activities in the host country will typically be of limited duration – fewer than 183 days in any 12-month period. Also called a short-term business visitor. 7 Split-pay/split-paid A person who receives elements of their remuneration package from the home country employer and elements from the host country employer. Tax equalisation As tax rates differ between countries, tax equalisation is an approach that ensures a worker is neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by accepting an assignment to a particular country. The employee and home country employer agree net pay on a “neither better nor worse off” or “stay at home” basis. The home country employer deducts a hypothetical home country tax from the employee’s remuneration, excluding any components that are paid purely because of the assignment. The home country and host country employers are responsible for the payment of tax due to the respective revenue authorities, as per the terms of the assignment. Trailing payments A payment received after the end of an assignment but relating to the assignment period; for example, a bonus. Summary of issues, options and proposals 1.12 Officials are seeking public feedback on the issues set out in this paper. Table 1 summarises the issues, options and proposals. Table 1: Summary of issues, options and proposals Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal 2 – PAYE issues 1. The current PAYE, FBT and ESCT system is inflexible. 2. It is not always clear when PAYE, FBT or ESCT obligations arise. Five proposals are discussed: 1. Enable more flexible PAYE arrangements for employees included on a shadow payroll. 2. Repeal of the PAYE employer bond provision. 3. Introduce a threshold or other measures clarifying when PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations are deemed to arise. 4. Clarify employee responsibilities for discharging PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations. 5. Expressly permit the transfer of PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations to a related New Zealand entity. 8 Chapter and topic Issue Option/proposal 3 – NRCT issues 1. The NRCT withholding threshold tests require consideration of facts unconnected to the contract. 2. The current NRCT system is inflexible. 3. The exemption process requires modernisation. Five proposals are discussed: 1. Change the day-count and monetary NRCT withholding thresholds to a “single payer” requirement. 2. Introduce a non-resident contractor reporting requirement. 3. Improve the flexibility of NRCT in some circumstances by expressly permitting: (i) retroactive exemption status (ii) broad exemption status, and (iii) catch-up payments. 4. Enable a “nominated taxpayer” to establish a good compliance history basis for NRCT exemption and to discharge tax obligations. 5. Repeal the non-resident contractor’s bond provision. 4 – Technical and remedial issues. Other technical or remedial changes are required to various rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Four proposals are discussed: 1. Tax contributions to foreign superannuation schemes and sickness, accident and death benefit funds under PAYE. 2. Amend the FBT rules to clarify that trailing benefits are only taxed where they relate to time spent working in New Zealand. 3. Amend the shadow payroll rule so that income is recognised when paid. 4. Clarify that the day-count and monetary threshold tests for non-resident contractors do not apply to non-resident entertainers. 1.13 Subject to submissions on the issues paper and other government priorities, any proposals to be taken forward will be included in a future tax bill.

Withholding from employment income ensures efficient tax collection at source, and the provision of timely and accurate information enables better administration of the tax and transfers system as a whole. 2.2 PAYE withholding tax was introduced in New Zealand with effect from 1 April 1958. The PAYE system streamlined the collection of taxes from individuals’ salaries or wages and ensured that the amount collected is broadly accurate. As a result, individual taxpayers who only earn employment income do not normally need to pay a substantial amount of tax on their gross income after the end of the tax year. Further taxes have since been applied to other components of employee remuneration: • Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) applies to specified benefits provided by an employer to an employee, such as private use of a vehicle, contributions to a superannuation scheme or private medical insurance, or a loan. • Employer’s Superannuation Contribution Tax (ESCT) applies where the employer makes cash contributions to a superannuation fund or KiwiSaver scheme for the benefit of its employee(s). • Non-Resident Contractors Tax (NRCT), which is included in the PAYE system, is discussed in chapter 3. 2.3 Two other important payments are collected via the PAYE system: Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) earners’ levy and KiwiSaver contributions. Both serve distinct policy purposes and are governed by their respective Acts. 1 These payment obligations do not necessarily follow the general tax treatment of an individual’s remuneration. For example, income that is not liable to, or is exempt from, New Zealand tax (for example, where a double tax agreement applies) may still be liable for ACC earners’ levy. KiwiSaver similarly provides its own code defining the circumstances in which contributions are due and the person liable to contribute. Queries raised with officials about the treatment of these payments are not within the scope of this paper. 2.4 Since the introduction of PAYE, changes in the ability of individuals to travel and businesses’ needs for specialised skills have driven growth in the numbers of persons who work outside their home country. Employees who work in New Zealand, whether for a New Zealand or a non-resident employer, are subject to New Zealand income tax unless they qualify for an exemption. The tax due on their income is collected by the PAYE system. 2.5 Feedback gathered by Inland Revenue indicates that the application of the PAYE system to employees whose employer is not resident in New Zealand requires 1 These are the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 12 clarification and greater flexibility. Non-resident employees are not always comparable to local employees, which may justify a different policy approach. 2.6 New Zealand’s PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules are strictly applied. Where an employee does not meet the conditions for an exemption and the employer has not deducted or paid the relevant amounts, the employer is deemed to have breached their employment-related tax obligations from the first day of the employee’s presence in New Zealand (sometimes called “day one”). The employer must then take steps to correct the tax payment and the tax reporting requirements that support the PAYE system. Summary This chapter: • reviews the existing day-count tests for exemption • suggests introducing a more flexible PAYE, FBT and ESCT system for employees on a shadow payroll • suggests the PAYE employer bond provision be repealed • considers the introduction of a threshold to clarify when a non-resident employer is subject to the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules • proposes that an employee of an employer with no New Zealand presence be liable to account for FBT and ESCT • proposes clarification of the circumstances in which an employee should account for their own PAYE, FBT and ESCT, and • considers providing an explicit ability for non-resident employers to transfer their PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations to a related New Zealand entity. Day-count tests for exemption 2.7 A person who comes to work in New Zealand for a short period of time may be exempt from New Zealand income tax either under domestic law or under a double taxation agreement. Under the Income Tax Act 2007, the exemption is available where the employee spends 92 or fewer days in New Zealand in a 12-month period. 2 Under a double taxation agreement, the threshold is 183 or fewer days in a 12- month period. 3 Both exemptions are subject to specified conditions being met in addition to the day-count test. Concerns have been raised that these tests are not fit for purpose. 2.8 Examples provided to us by tax advisors and New Zealand businesses that demonstrate the problem include: 2 Section CW 19 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 See Article 15 of the OECD Model Tax Convention. The test varies depending on the relevant double taxation agreement. 13 • an unforeseen delay to a project, perhaps caused by equipment failure or weather, resulting in the employee spending additional time in New Zealand, and • employees spending extra days in New Zealand unbeknown to the employer, for example, a holiday spent in New Zealand. 2.9 Officials are also aware that a breach may occur where communication failures mean the necessary tax arrangements were not put in place in time. Where the day count has been breached, the employer is required to correct the tax position from the first day the employee was present in New Zealand. This means the employer incurs additional compliance costs. The employer is also potentially subject to shortfall penalties and use of money interest. Whether a shortfall penalty is imposed will depend on the facts and circumstances of the particular case and whether the employer has taken reasonable care. 4 2.10 Officials are of the view that the day-count tests remain appropriate. • The domestic exemption aims to relieve very short-term business visitors from disproportionate compliance costs. This aim is balanced against ensuring that New Zealand-sourced income is taxed where business trips are longer or more frequent. • Double taxation agreements are bilateral arrangements that grant favourable treatment on a reciprocal basis. There is no compelling reason to expand this 183-day exemption to non-treaty partners. 2.11 It should also be noted that the exemptions are not simply day-count tests. In both cases, the exemptions are only granted subject to meeting additional conditions – in particular, that the person is chargeable with tax in their country of residence. 2.12 However, officials agree that the correction process can be complex and time- consuming. We understand that the compliance costs incurred can be disproportionate to the amount of tax involved. In light of these concerns, officials are interested in exploring options for greater PAYE flexibility. Flexible PAYE arrangements 2.13 The PAYE system seeks to capture the income tax due while imposing the lowest practicable compliance and administration costs. In New Zealand, the PAYE rules apply to every payment of PAYE income. “PAYE income payment” is a defined term encompassing salary, wages and other specified payments. 5 Officials recognise that it is not always practical to collect PAYE from the income of cross- border employees under normal arrangements and, therefore, enabling greater PAYE flexibility for such employees is desirable. This is despite no change in the underlying policy that PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations arise from the first day of the employee’s presence in New Zealand. 4 Section 141A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 5 Section RD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 14 2.14 Officials favour permitting employers who have employees subject to shadow payroll arrangements to operate PAYE, FBT and ESCT on a more flexible basis during the tax year. Flexibility recognises: • the additional complexity of payment and reporting arrangements where remuneration is delivered abroad • the role of tax equalisation and similar arrangements that provide the employee with a guaranteed net income, and • the desirability of simplifying the process for “catch-up” and other one-off payments. 2.15 Officials intend to restrict the availability of flexible PAYE arrangements to employees on a shadow payroll. Without making a distinction between local and shadow payrolls, the PAYE system could not be appropriately administered. Employers would be asked to identify shadow payrolls on their employment income information form to trigger identification of shadow payrolls in Inland Revenue’s systems. Where cross-border employees are paid from an ordinary New Zealand payroll, the normal rules should apply. 2.16 Officials are interested in any practical concerns that could arise, whether PAYE flexibility should be extended to a wider class of cross-border employees and, if so, who and in what circumstances. “Catch-up” and trailing payments 2.17 A flexible PAYE arrangement should permit catch-up payments if an employee has breached the day-count threshold in circumstances where the employer reasonably believed an exemption would be available. The introduction of a catch-up facility would not result in income arising in the period before the breach being exempt from New Zealand tax (see example 1). Once the threshold was breached, the exemption could not apply. PAYE, FBT and ESCT would be due and should be calculated from the first day of presence in New Zealand. 2.18 Where a breach of the day-count tests was remedied under flexible PAYE arrangements, penalties and interest would not apply provided the breach was remedied in a specified timeframe and the employer had taken reasonable measures to manage their employment-related tax obligations. Reasonable measures would be demonstrated where the employer has robust processes in place to manage their tax obligations. This could include the employer: • taking tax advice relating to the assignment • asking questions about the employee’s New Zealand connections before the assignment – for example, prior presence in New Zealand • keeping records of the assignment, including any review, business travel or other arrangements for working in New Zealand • monitoring employee time in New Zealand by timesheets or other method, and • taking prompt action to discharge tax obligations when the employee’s circumstances change. 15 2.19 Officials propose that the period for correcting the situation should be 28 days from the employer first becoming aware the day-count threshold has been breached. Officials propose that the time when an employer “first becomes aware” the threshold has been breached would be the earlier of the time when the employer knows the threshold has been breached and the time when the employer expects the threshold to be breached. Example 1 Estella, a Brazilian tax resident, comes to NZ on a ten-week assignment (70 days) to work on a construction project. A New Zealand company manages the project and takes responsibility for the employees. At the outset of Estella’s assignment, it is anticipated that the 92-day exemption under New Zealand domestic law will apply. New Zealand does not have a double taxation agreement with Brazil. Unfortunately, two weeks after Estella’s arrival, the project managers are told that equipment necessary to complete the work Estella is undertaking will be delayed arriving in New Zealand. This delay means that Estella’s time in New Zealand will extend to 14 weeks (98 days). At this point, the New Zealand company expects the threshold to be breached so it puts Estella on the shadow payroll. A catch-up PAYE payment for the first two weeks is made, and PAYE is applied thereafter. 2.20 Officials also anticipate that PAYE flexibility should enable the capture of trailing payments on shadow payrolls, such as bonuses. PAYE flexibility: options 2.21 Flexible PAYE arrangements would make a beneficial treatment available to employers of cross-border employees. This treatment would need to be balanced against integrity concerns. Officials have therefore considered options that meet those concerns. Option 1: PAYE arrangement 2.22 Historically, some tax advisors have favoured the model adopted in the United Kingdom. Under “modified PAYE arrangements”, 6 employers enter into an agreement with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) to operate payroll on an estimated basis for eligible employees. The agreement is subject to a number of conditions. These include that: • the employer must tax equalise the employee’s general earnings (for example, salary, bonus and the cash equivalent of any non-cash benefits in kind) • tax will be calculated on a grossed-up basis, and • the employer must undertake an in-year review 7 of the reported compensation to capture any material changes. 6 HM Revenue & Customs. (2021). HMRC internal manual - PAYE Manual. PAYE82002 - PAYE operation: international employments: EP appendix 6: modified PAYE in tax equalisation cases. https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/paye-manual/paye82002 7 The initial calculation and in-year review must include a “best estimate” of the earnings for each eligible employee: including salary, cash bonus and non-cash benefits. Typically, changes in values (such as pay increases), changes in benefit values, or actual bonus amounts are captured in the in-year review. 16 Under a modified PAYE arrangement, final adjustments to the compensation items and values, and the associated gross-up, can be made in each employee’s self- assessment tax return. 2.23 Making PAYE flexibility subject to conditions may promote the integrity of the arrangement and deter potential abuse. In the UK, a breach of the conditions may result in an agreement’s termination. Notably, HMRC reserves the right to cancel an agreement where: “... significant and/or regular underpayments of income tax on employment income have arisen in respect of employees’ self- assessment returns and in the opinion of HMRC that tax ought to have been accounted for in the calculation of estimated PAYE ...” 2.24 The creation of a stand-alone PAYE arrangement for cross-border employees has merit, but on balance, officials do not prefer the creation of a New Zealand equivalent to modified PAYE arrangements. We note that this approach potentially entails greater costs for set-up, ongoing compliance and administration. We are interested in whether submitters agree with our conclusion, and if not, we invite suggestions as to the conditions that should apply to an equivalent New Zealand scheme. Option 2: In-year square-ups 2.25 The second option officials have considered is allowing in-year square-ups via the PAYE system. This would allow employers additional time to accurately capture all compensation items for each employee on the shadow payroll. The employer would then report these items and make a “catch-up” tax payment. This is similar to the PAYE flexibility for breaches of the day-count test discussed above, but in addition to day-count breaches, it would apply to all compensation adjustments (for example, salary increases or changes in the remuneration package). 2.26 Officials consider each catch-up payment should occur no later than 28 days from the employer first becoming aware of the need to adjust or report the employee’s remuneration. Final adjustments would be made via the employee’s self-assessment tax return. Views sought 2.27 Officials seek views on the advantages or disadvantages of the above two options and any conditions that should apply if PAYE flexibility were adopted. In particular, we are interested in the implications for reporting and paying FBT and ESCT. 2.28 Some businesses have expressed an interest in year-end/“Month 12” calculations. Officials are concerned that this option could result in integrity risks, including less accurate calculation of tax during the income year. We are interested in understanding whether, if one of the above two options is adopted, there is still interest in a year-end process. 17 Bonds given by employers of certain non-resident employees 2.29 The PAYE employer bond provision 8 applies if, at the time of PAYE withholding: • it cannot be determined if the payment will be exempt income for the employee under either domestic law or a double taxation agreement, and • the employer or PAYE intermediary applies to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue and provides a bond or other security for the amount that would otherwise be withheld. If the Commissioner accepts the bond or security, the employer or PAYE intermediary is released from the obligation to withhold. 2.30 A review of existing arrangements shows the PAYE bond mechanism is rarely used. With a greater availability of flexible PAYE arrangements, officials anticipate the bond would no longer be required and propose its removal. Questions for submitters • Should PAYE flexibility be available to a wider group of employees than those on shadow payrolls? If so, which other groups of employees should be included? • Do you see any practical issues or concerns in permitting PAYE flexibility? For example, what would be the impact on split-paid employees? • Which option to increase PAYE flexibility do you prefer and why? • Do you support removal of the PAYE employer bond requirement? • Do you have any other comments? The territorial approach to employer obligations 2.31 Draft operational statement ED0223 – Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations 9 (the draft OS) clarifies that a non-resident employer that is subject to New Zealand’s laws is obliged to comply with New Zealand’s PAYE requirements. 10 This is commonly described as a territorial approach. Whether the employer is “subject to New Zealand’s laws” is determined by assessing whether the employer has a “sufficient presence” in New Zealand. 2.32 Whether an employer has a sufficient presence in New Zealand will turn on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The factors to be considered are outlined in the draft OS at paragraphs 7–13. Guidance is also given by way of 8 Section RD 23 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 9 Available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/en/consultations/draft-items/expired-items/ed0223 10 The draft OS is reproduced in the appendix to this issues paper. 18 examples in the draft OS. The draft OS will be finalised following receipt of submissions on this issues paper. 2.33 Consultation undertaken in relation to the draft OS revealed that some submitters viewed the sufficient presence test as vague and uncertain. They seek a threshold test to help identify when an employer’s presence would be deemed sufficient. 2.34 Officials accept that a threshold that deems the employer to be liable to discharge employment-related tax obligations could provide additional clarity. However, we do not intend that a threshold should replace analysis of a sufficient presence. Instead, we propose the threshold support the analysis: that is, where the threshold was met, regardless of whether the employer had a sufficient presence, the employer would always have an obligation to apply the PAYE, FBT and ESCT rules. 2.35 Where an employer did not have a sufficient presence and did not meet the threshold, they would not have an obligation to apply those rules. However, an employer that established they had no obligation would still be able to choose to assume responsibility for discharging employment-related tax obligations. 2.36 Officials are interested in submitters’ views on whether a clear threshold that demonstrates a “sufficient presence” is desirable. If yes, then officials propose the threshold should be the lower of: • $500,000 of gross employment-related taxes per current tax year, 11 or • five employees present in New Zealand (including full- and part-time employees, whether they are tax resident in New Zealand or not). We are also interested in whether other measures would provide greater certainty. 2.37 Officials note that a threshold could cause employers to drop in and out of the obligation to apply the rules as circumstances changed. We therefore suggest that once an employer was in the PAYE system, they would remain in the system until they: • made alternative arrangements, such as using a local payroll provider • arranged with a related New Zealand entity to discharge the obligation, or • no longer needed to make employment-related tax payments. 2.38 If a threshold were introduced, a supplementary rule would be included to support the integrity of the threshold and apply it across employees of non-resident associated persons. 2.39 Where the threshold was not met and no New Zealand entity was willing to accept the PAYE and other tax obligations (as described below), the obligations would be imposed on the employee, who would need to register as an employer and report and pay taxes to Inland Revenue under an IR56 arrangement (see paragraphs 2.45 to 2.48). 11 This aligns with the monthly payment amount stated in section RD 4(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 19 FBT and ESCT obligations 2.40 FBT is imposed on an employer who provides certain categories of benefits to its employees. These benefits are excluded income for the employee, meaning that they are not included as assessable income in the employee’s annual gross income. FBT is a tax borne and paid by the employer and not the employee. 2.41 ESCT is imposed on an employer who makes cash contributions to an employee’s superannuation or KiwiSaver scheme. The cash contributions are excluded income for the employee; that is, the contributions are not taxable to the employee. 2.42 A consequence of the territorial approach to PAYE is that a non-resident employer who does not meet the sufficient presence test has no liability for either FBT or ESCT. It follows that there is a discrepancy between the treatment of employers who are resident in New Zealand, or have a presence in New Zealand, and those who are neither present nor resident. 2.43 We assume that FBT is being paid by non-resident employers, consistent with the view expressed in the 1995 Tax Information Bulletin. 12 However, the draft OS has highlighted that the law concerning the application of FBT and ESCT in cross- border employment scenarios is not as clear as it could be. We are proposing to clarify that treatment. 2.44 Officials propose equalising the tax treatment of resident and non-resident employers, and their employees, so that FBT and ESCT is paid regardless of the employer’s presence in New Zealand. This would align these taxes with PAYE and mean that the obligation would transfer either to a New Zealand entity or to the employee. The transfer of employment-related tax obligations is discussed below. Remote workers: employee obligations 2.45 Improvements in technology have enabled more employees to take advantage of working in a place distant from the workplace provided by their employer. Depending on the work performed, an employee who works remotely may not undertake activities that give rise to a presence for the employer in New Zealand. 2.46 Officials seek to clarify that where an employer does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand to give rise to New Zealand employment-related tax obligations, the employee working in New Zealand is required to discharge the PAYE obligation. As discussed above, officials intend to extend the tax obligation to include FBT and ESCT. This extension would apply to remote workers who are required to account for and pay PAYE. 2.47 Officials note that the law requiring an employee to assume responsibility for the obligations is not clearly expressed, and it makes no direct reference to employees of a non-resident employer. It also does not connect clearly to the mechanism under which PAYE payments are collected directly from employees. This mechanism is 12 Inland Revenue. (December 1995).

Tax Information Bulletin, volume 7 (no 6), (p. 8). https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-07---1995- 1996/tib-vol7-no6 20 for an employee to register and arrange to pay taxes on their own account as an IR 56 taxpayer. 2.48 The term “IR56 taxpayer” is an administrative tool that is described as being “used to identify workers who are required to pay their own taxes (PAYE) on their wage or salary but are not self-employed.” 13 Officials propose clarifying that employment-related tax payments (PAYE, FBT and ESCT, as applicable) must be made under IR 56 arrangements where a non-resident employer does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand. As outlined above, in these circumstances the employer would be able to choose to assume these tax obligations. Example 2 Pip is an employee of Magwitch Ltd, a Singapore-based company. Pip is the head of Magwitch Ltd’s research and development division. Pip lives in New Zealand and is a New Zealand tax resident. His role is based in the Singapore office, and Pip is frequently required to visit countries in the Asia-Pacific region. To reduce his time away from his family, Pip works 95 days a year from his New Zealand home. Magwitch Ltd has a New Zealand subsidiary, Gargery (NZ) Ltd. Assume Magwitch Ltd has a sufficient presence in New Zealand Assume that Pip’s activities in New Zealand give rise to a sufficient presence in New Zealand for Magwitch Ltd to be subject to employment-related tax obligations under the draft OS. A sufficient presence could arise where, for example, Pip is undertaking activities that further Magwitch Ltd’s business, separate to Gargery (NZ) Ltd’s business activities. This could include entering contracts with suppliers for other group companies or establishing a branch of Magwitch Ltd in New Zealand. In this scenario, Magwitch Ltd would have a liability to pay New Zealand employment-related taxes. Magwitch Ltd would have to register as an employer in New Zealand and pay the employment-related taxes due in respect of Pip’s activities. Assume Magwitch Ltd does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand Assume that Pip’s activities do not give rise to a sufficient presence in New Zealand for Magwitch Ltd. This could be the case, for example, where Pip’s New Zealand business days consist of meeting with local managers at Gargery (NZ) Ltd in performance of his role as division head or are days spent working from home on activities for the benefit of Magwitch Ltd’s wider group. In this scenario, Pip would be responsible for the payment of the employment-related taxes as an IR56 taxpayer. 2.49 Officials do not think it is appropriate to extend the proposals to increase PAYE flexibility (see paragraphs 2.13 to 2.28) to IR56 arrangements. This is because the administrative flexibility would not be available to other New Zealand taxpayers who make payments under IR56 arrangements. Once the arrangement has been established, both local and cross-border employees assume a similar compliance burden. 2.50 Officials considered whether a cross-border employee should pay New Zealand income taxes under self-assessment, rather than via the PAYE system. However, adopting this approach would mean it should be made available to IR56 taxpayers generally. This is a wider proposition than the changes affecting cross-border 13 Inland Revenue. (March 2021). IR56 taxpayer’s handbook - IR356 (p. 5). https://www.ird.govt.nz/- /media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir300---ir399/ir356/ir356-2021.pdf 21 workers discussed in this paper. Self-assessment also does not adequately cater for the discharge of FBT and ESCT obligations. As such, officials do not believe self- assessment is appropriate. Ability to transfer employment-related tax obligations to a New Zealand entity 2.51 Many different arrangements can be made for employees working in cross-border situations. Often employees come to work for New Zealand entities on an assignment, and the local entity is responsible for the discharge of the employment- related tax obligations. In other cases, there may not be a formal arrangement for the employee even though they are, in practice, working for the New Zealand entity. Officials think that, regardless of the formal arrangement, where the employee is working for the New Zealand entity, it is appropriate for the New Zealand entity to discharge the non-resident employer’s employment-related tax obligations. 2.52 In other circumstances, an employee may be present in New Zealand in circumstances where their work is only for the benefit of their home country employer. This is common in short-term or remote-working scenarios. If that work does not constitute a sufficient presence in New Zealand for that non-resident employer, the employer does not have PAYE, FBT or ESCT obligations. 2.53 In practice, the New Zealand entity may agree to assume responsibility for the non- resident employer’s tax obligations. This is a practical solution that minimises compliance costs, as there is no need for the non-resident employer to establish and run its own New Zealand payroll. Officials are of the view that where the New Zealand entity is related to the non-resident employer, such as by being a group company, it is appropriate for the related entity to discharge the employment-related tax obligations. 2.54 An alternative model could be to provide for an automatic transfer of the obligations to a New Zealand entity. Automatic transfer would ensure that, in any case where a related entity existed in New Zealand, the obligation was enforceable against the New Zealand entity. However, officials are aware of examples where failures in corporate communications have meant a New Zealand entity was not able to make timely tax arrangements. This is particularly the case where the employee is in New Zealand either solely performing the business of the home country employer or on a short-term basis. In these circumstances, an automatic transfer could be unfair. 2.55 Officials think the practice of transferring employment-related tax obligations should not be compulsory. However, to aid transparency, we propose that a New Zealand entity that accepts the obligations should notify Inland Revenue that the obligation has been transferred and that the entity is acting as agent for the non- resident employer. Where the obligations have been transferred, the home country employer and the New Zealand entity would have joint and several liability for tax compliance. 2.56 Officials are interested in submitters’ views on the desirability of optional transfers of the employment-related tax obligations to a New Zealand entity and issues that might arise. 22 Example 3 All facts are as stated in Example 2. Assume Magwitch Ltd has a sufficient presence in New Zealand In this scenario, although Magwitch Ltd has a liability to pay New Zealand employment-related taxes, responsibility can be transferred to Gargery (NZ) Ltd to make the tax payments and comply with reporting requirements. Assume Magwitch Ltd does not have a sufficient presence in New Zealand In this scenario, Magwitch Ltd does not have a liability to pay New Zealand employment- related taxes. If there was no related New Zealand entity, Pip would need to register and make employment-related tax payments under an IR 56 arrangement. However, as a related entity exists, the obligations can be transferred to Gargery (NZ) Ltd. In both scenarios, if Gargery (NZ) Ltd agrees to accept the obligations, it would have to notify Inland Revenue that it was acting as agent for Magwitch Ltd. Gargery (NZ) Ltd would then include Pip on either the local payroll or a shadow payroll, as appropriate. Questions for submitters • Should the PAYE obligation for non-resident employers have a threshold test? If so, is a threshold of the lower of: – $500,000 of gross employment-related taxes per current tax year, or – five employees present in New Zealand a ppropriate? • Do you consider it appropriate to transfer PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations to a New Zealand entity? • What problems or issues do you see, if any, with the transfer of the obligations? • Do you have any other comments or suggestions? 23 CHAPTER 3 NRCT 3.1 The obligation to comply with PAYE requirements falls on the payer of the income. Where the payee is a non-resident contractor, the person who pays the income is required to withhold non-resident contractors’ tax (NRCT), a schedular tax, from the contract payment. NRCT (formerly non-resident contractors’ withholding tax) is collected via the PAYE system. 3.2 Payers of non-resident contractors face similar issues to those faced by employers of cross-border employees (outlined in chapter 2). These include lack of communication between the parties concerning the non-resident contractor’s presence and/or activities in New Zealand and unforeseen delays to projects. In addition, specific issues exist for NRCT. 3.3 NRCT was introduced in 1982 for “contract projects” (typically large-scale construction projects). From 1990, NRCT was widened to include all contracts for service. The underlying purpose of this regime was to manage “flight risk” – contractors who departed New Zealand having completed their work and collected payment but having not paid the New Zealand tax due. 3.4 NRCT, by its nature, is more complex than employment-related PAYE. NRCT encompasses the performance of services by the non-resident contractor and the supply of personal property or services by other persons. Further, NRCT was introduced and expanded in response to specific concerns about the integrity of the New Zealand tax base, whereas employment-related PAYE obligations serve a range of purposes. NRCT is intended to be a robust withholding obligation. 3.5 Unless a contract payment is exempt, the payer is required to withhold NRCT, generally at 15%, from each contract payment. While NRCT is included in the PAYE system, it can apply to contracts in which both payer and contractor are non- resident and only the activity takes place in New Zealand. There is no intention to extend the territorial approach to NRCT, as this would exclude the payer from the withholding obligation. Further, NRCT is an interim, not minimum or final, tax — the non-resident contractor has its own tax filing requirement that gives effect to the final tax position. Summary This chapter: • seeks views on potential modifications to the existing thresholds • suggests introducing a more flexible NRCT system • proposes improvement to the exemption certificate system, and • proposes the non-resident contractor’s bond provision be repealed. 24 NRCT withholding thresholds 3.6 Contract payments are “schedular payments”, as defined by law. However, contract payments are carved out of that definition – and therefore exempt from withholding – in two circumstances: • Where the non-resident contractor is present in New Zealand for 92 days or fewer in a 12-month period and is entitled to full relief under a double taxation agreement. • Where total payments to the non-resident contractor are $15,000 or less in a 12-month period. “All circumstances” view vs “single payer” view 3.7 When determining if the exemption from withholding is available under either of the above thresholds, the payer must consider (as applicable) all the days of presence of, or all the contract payments made to, the non-resident contractor in a 12-month period. This means the payer must consider matters unrelated to the contract payment in question (for example, work performed for another payer or holidays). In effect, this is an “all circumstances” view. 3.8 New Zealand businesses have raised concerns that the “all circumstances” view is difficult to comply with in practice, as they must rely on the non-resident contractor to disclose full information. In addition, the payer bears the costs of non-compliance if the conditions of the exemption are breached. 3.9 Given the underlying policy seeks to manage flight risk, it is appropriate for the payer to be required to withhold where they are not certain an exemption is available. However, it is possible to simplify and clarify the withholding obligation. 3.10 Officials consider that the “all circumstances” view of the thresholds imposes an excessive compliance burden on the payer. It is more appropriate to apply a “single payer” view to the thresholds. This would mean the payer would only need to consider the thresholds relating to their contract with the non-resident contractor. The “single payer” view should include related payers, such as members of a consolidated group. 3.11 To manage the integrity risk, officials favour improved reporting by payers of their non-resident contractors to Inland Revenue. This would mitigate the information imbalance that currently exists between payers, non-resident contractors and Inland Revenue. In our view, the report would include sufficient payee details to identify the payee should enforcement be required. At a minimum, this would be the payee’s name, New Zealand or home country address, and New Zealand IRD number or foreign tax identification number (as applicable). The reports would be required on the 15th of each month, with the first due 15 days after the end of the month in which the first payment was made to a non-resident contractor. 3.12 Officials are interested in whether payers would have difficulties in reporting this type of information to Inland Revenue. If so, what issues arise and what could be made easier? 25 Simplification of threshold tests 3.13 The existing thresholds have not changed since 2003, and officials understand interest in simplifying these tests exists. However, there are challenges to reform of both thresholds. • The basis on which the day-count exemption is available may vary between double taxation agreements, according to the particular terms of the agreement. This is a potential obstacle to simplification and consistency. • At its current level, the monetary threshold represents a low risk of tax loss and operates as a tax integrity measure. Any increase in this threshold would represent additional potential revenue loss in cases of non-compliance. 3.14 Officials have considered whether simplifying the threshold tests is desirable. The most straightforward change would be to remove the thresholds, with the result that the payer would not have a withholding obligation only where the non-resident contractor has exempt status. Removal of the thresholds would make NRCT obligations simpler, clearer, and more certain, but would, in effect, reinstate the legislative position that applied before the introduction of the thresholds in 2002 and 2003. 3.15 Officials think that, by moving to a “single payer” view and enabling greater flexibility for corrections (see below), reform of these tests is unnecessary. We are interested in whether submitters agree with this view, particularly in light of other possible changes to the NRCT regime. NRCT flexibility 3.16 Unless an exemption (see below) is in place, or the thresholds discussed above remove the obligation to withhold, NRCT withholding is required from each payment for the activity or service. In most cases, the contract for that activity or service precedes the first payment to the non-resident contractor. This allows time to ensure that the payer’s tax obligations will be met. 3.17 Although the strict requirements of NRCT are clear, we are aware that in practice unforeseen factors may impact the performance of the contract. For example, we are aware of cases where a non-resident contractor has been called in at short notice to handle an emergency. In other cases, weather, or other factors outside the payer or contractor’s control, cause project times to overrun. In these circumstances, correction is required. Under current law, the correction is made by a voluntary disclosure. We note that the private sector’s experience of the corrections process is that it can be complex and time-consuming. Further, the costs incurred can be disproportionate to the amount of tax involved. 3.18 Officials think the flexibility of NRCT can be improved. To achieve this, it would be necessary to distinguish NRCT withholding from other payroll withholding taxes. Officials favour a separate NRCT code to trigger this distinction in Inland Revenue’s systems. 3.19 We propose that where the payer can demonstrate they made reasonable enquiries or took reasonable steps to confirm the thresholds referred to in paragraph 3.6 would not be exceeded, it should be possible to make a catch-up payment and account for 26 the NRCT due for the prior period via ordinary NRCT filing. The demonstration of reasonable measures would be aligned to those explained at paragraph 2.18; that is, the payer should be able to show that they have robust processes for managing the NRCT obligation. 3.20 Provided the correction was made within a reasonable time from the date when it became apparent a threshold would be breached, the correction would be able to be made without exposure to penalties and use of money interest. We believe that 28 days from knowledge of the breach constitutes a reasonable period for correction. Questions for submitters • Do you support changing the withholding exemptions from an “all circumstances” requirement to a “single payer” requirement? Do you see any issues with this change? • Do you support the introduction of a reporting obligation for payers of payments to non-resident contractors? Would you have difficulties in reporting information to Inland Revenue? If so, what issues arise and what could be made easier? • Is further reform of the NRCT thresholds desirable? If so, what reforms would you suggest and how would any resulting integrity risks be managed? • Do you support the proposal to enable greater NRCT flexibility by permitting corrections to be made via catch-up payments? What issues could arise from this approach? • Do you have any other comments? Exemption certificates 3.21 The threshold tests exclude payments from the definition of a “schedular payment” and, therefore, remove the withholding obligation. Where the thresholds do not provide relief, non-resident contractors are still able to ensure NRCT is not withheld on a payment made to them by obtaining an exemption for the contract payment. 14 The exemption is evidenced by a certificate issued by Inland Revenue. Certificates are available where the non-resident contractor meets one or more of the following conditions: • the amount of the payment is not assessable income • the contractor provides a bond or other security for the income tax payable on the amount (see below), or • the contractor has a “good compliance history” in the previous 24 months that is expected to continue. 14 Section RD 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 27 3.22 The exemption certificate process is long-standing, and when full information is provided, the application is ordinarily processed in approximately ten days. Nevertheless, comments made by the private sector to Inland Revenue indicate that New Zealand businesses find the process can be slow and cumbersome. They have expressed an interest in a review and, where possible, modernisation of the process. Retroactive certificates of exemption 3.23 Officials favour improving the flexibility of the current exemption certificate system by providing for certificates with retroactive effect. Where an exemption certificate was issued after the date of the first contract payment, the certificate would also cover payments made before its issue date. To align with the day-count threshold test, we suggest the retroactive period be set at 92 days. Broader certificates of exemption 3.24 Currently, certificates are granted for varying lengths of time. In cases where the ground for exemption is that the amount is not assessable income, it remains appropriate to consider the issue of an exemption certificate on a case-by-case basis. However, officials favour providing that, where the certificate is granted based on a good compliance history, the exemption certificate should have a broad application – that is, it should cover all activities by that contractor and should be issued for a two-year period. This would balance flexibility with regular compliance checks. Role of New Zealand entities 3.25 Officials are interested in whether New Zealand resident entities can play a more significant role in the NRCT regime. We are aware that various business models exist in practice. For example, separate project vehicles may be created for each contract undertaken, meaning a non-resident contractor cannot show they have a good compliance history for the particular entity, despite having prior (or concurrent) presences in New Zealand in other guises. 3.26 Officials understand that some entities may benefit from a “nominated taxpayer” approach to meeting their tax obligations. The advantage of this approach would be that the nominated taxpayer could establish a good compliance history for the purpose of obtaining exemption certificates for related non-resident contractors. This approach could extend from NRCT matters to income tax, GST, and other tax obligations. The nominated taxpayer would need to inform Inland Revenue that it was acting as agent for the non-resident contractor(s) and would have joint and several liability for the performance of the tax obligations. Example 4 Jaggers Inc is a US-headquartered multinational. It has a wholly owned subsidiary in New Zealand (Clarriker Ltd). Jaggers Inc, in conjunction with unrelated companies, wins a contract to undertake work in New Zealand. Jaggers Inc decides that Clarriker Ltd should be its nominated taxpayer. As Clarriker Ltd has a good compliance history, an exemption certificate is granted. Clarriker Ltd would be joint and severally liable for any New Zealand income tax obligations that arise for Jaggers Inc. 28 3.27 We are interested in submitters’ views on the practical issues that may arise in connection with this proposal. Alternatives to exemption certificates 3.28 Several members of the private sector have suggested to Inland Revenue that they favour alternatives to NRCT exemption certificates. Two alternatives to the current certificate process have been considered by officials. Self-certification 3.29 Some New Zealand businesses have suggested self-certification of the non-resident contractor’s tax status could replace the current application process. 3.30 Self-certification is used in the USA, and officials understand it requires the payer to: • obtain documentation establishing the payee’s entitlement to a particular rate of US tax, and • subject to exceptions, report to the Internal Revenue Service on each contract payment over US$600. 3.31 Officials are not attracted to this option as it does not convincingly simplify administration or compliance, nor does it adequately address flight risk concerns. Register of exempt non-resident contractors 3.32 Another suggestion raised is to capture details of non-resident contractors who hold exemption certificates in a searchable register. The register would be hosted on Inland Revenue’s website and would identify active exemption certificates and their exemption periods. 3.33 Officials consider the creation of a register of entities with exempt status is a better option than self-certification, even though it may increase the compliance and administration burden. A register would enable a payer to have greater certainty that a particular non-resident contractor was entitled to be exempt from New Zealand withholding tax. A register would also: • address the tax integrity concern – the contractor would have to interact with the tax system to establish their entitlement to this treatment, and • mitigate the payer’s risk – whether withholding was required could be easily checked. 3.34 Officials consider the register should be restricted to non-resident contractors who are exempt based on a good compliance history, as this status does not rest on the assessment of any other factors. However, most exemption applications have been on other grounds – chiefly, that a double taxation agreement has relieved the income from New Zealand tax. We do not consider the double tax agreement ground as appropriate for a register. By its nature, an exemption granted on this ground is fact specific and typically for short-term, finite arrangements. There is no guarantee that an exemption granted based on a double taxation agreement would be available to any future payers (who would be the chief beneficiaries of any register). 29 3.35 The double tax agreement ground accounts for 82 percent of exemption certificates issued in the ten-year period ending 30 April 2021. As such, the proposed restriction may reduce the usefulness of a register. 3.36 Although records demonstrate that corporates and other commercial entities are key users of the exemption system, it should be noted that, where individual non- resident contractors are concerned, the privacy rules of New Zealand and the home country would have to be considered. Individuals might not wish to be registered due to privacy concerns, and further, the need to take another country’s rules into account would increase the cost of including individual persons on the register. The alternative – a system split between a register for entities and the retention of the exemption certificate process for individuals – is not attractive in officials’ view. 3.37 A further potential issue would be that exempt status might not have been obtained by the non-resident contractor before the first payment. This would be particularly likely for new/first-time non-resident contractors, or where the work was performed on short notice. Where this was the case, withholding would be expected, and any repayment would be via the normal process. 3.38 Officials seek views on the desirability of establishing a searchable register and whether it should be restricted to the good compliance history ground or if another approach to the register would make it useful. We are also interested in how a register might interact with practical business constraints. Examples of scenarios in which a register would, or would not, improve the current process are particularly welcome. Bonds given by a non-resident contractor 3.39 As noted above, a non-resident contractor may apply for an exemption certificate on the basis that they have provided a bond or other security for the income tax payable for a contract payment. 3.40 Like the bond provision for non-resident employees, officials note that this bond provision is rarely used, and therefore, they intend to repeal it. Officials anticipate that, if adopted, the proposals in this paper are likely to provide better solutions for the problems with NRCT obligations faced in practice. Questions for submitters • Do you support the proposals to improve NRCT flexibility by permitting retroactive and/or broader exemption certificates? • Do you think a “nominated entity” approach would simplify NRCT and other tax obligations? What advantages and disadvantages do you see in connection with this proposal? • Do you support the proposal to create a register of NRCT exempt entities? What issues, if any, do you see arising in connection with this proposal? • Do you support removal of the non-resident contractor’s bond? 31 CHAPTER 4 Technical and remedial measures 4.1 A variety of other issues that affect cross-border workers have been raised with officials. We have considered these to determine whether they are technical or remedial in nature and to identify their relative priority. We intend to address the issues in this chapter and seek feedback on these proposals. Superannuation contributions: FBT liability 4.2 Under current rules, an employer contribution to employee superannuation is taxed in one of two ways: • ESCT applies where the contribution is made in money to a superannuation fund or under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, 15 or • FBT applies where an employer makes a contribution to a superannuation scheme. 16 4.3 The application of FBT extends to employer contributions to foreign superannuation schemes that resemble New Zealand superannuation schemes. However, many of our major trading partners tax superannuation contributions under PAYE-equivalent systems, with the result that unrelievable double taxation may arise. 4.4 In addition, comments made to Inland Revenue indicate that, although the New Zealand-Australia double taxation agreement specifically provides for the taxation of fringe benefits, compliance issues still arise. Australian superannuation contributions may be the sole reason an Australian employer files a New Zealand FBT return for Australian employees working in New Zealand who are otherwise relieved from New Zealand tax. 4.5 Given these concerns, officials consider that a different policy approach, applying to cross-border workers only, could be justified in this area. We propose that the obligation to pay tax for contributions to foreign superannuation schemes be made subject to PAYE rather than FBT. This change would make it clear that superannuation contributions follow the same tax treatment as salaries, wages, and other items of remuneration. We also propose that contributions to a sickness, accident, or death benefit fund should be subject to PAYE. Trailing payments and FBT 4.6 FBT is charged on benefits provided to an employee in any quarter or income year in which the employee receives a PAYE income payment liable to income tax. 17 This rule poses a problem for employees receiving payments, such as bonuses or 15 Section RD 65 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 16 Section CX 13 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 17 Section CX 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 32 employee share scheme income, after they have left New Zealand and ceased to be a New Zealand tax resident. These trailing payments are taxable PAYE income payments, and the rule can be interpreted as subjecting benefits provided abroad, which do not relate to the period spent working in New Zealand, to FBT. Example 5 Georgiana (a US national) was seconded by her employer, Skiffins Inc, to its New Zealand subsidiary from 1 January 2019 until 30 June 2021. Georgiana left New Zealand to return to the USA on 30 June 2021 and broke New Zealand tax residence on that date. Georgiana receives a company car and private medical insurance from Skiffins Inc as part of her new US remuneration package. On 28 February 2022, Skiffins Inc paid annual bonuses for the 2021 calendar year to a number of staff, including Georgiana. The portion of the bonus paid for Georgiana’s time spent working in New Zealand in 2021 (6/12ths) is subject to New Zealand tax as a PAYE income payment. This means that the US employment-related benefits (that is, the car and medical insurance) are also subject to New Zealand FBT. 4.7 Officials propose clarifying that, while the trailing payment itself is subject to PAYE, the receipt of a trailing payment should not trigger a liability to FBT except to the extent the benefits relate to the time spent working in New Zealand. Shadow payrolls: recognition of income 4.8 The payday filing rules, introduced with effect from 1 April 2019, include a specific rule to cater for persons whose income is reported for New Zealand tax purposes on shadow payrolls. 18 The rule provides that the employee’s PAYE income payment is treated as derived by the person on the 20th day following payment (the pay date). This rule was intended to allow employers additional time to collate details of the employee’s income for employment income reporting purposes. 4.9 As currently drafted, the rule deems the pay date to be recognised for tax purposes as well as for reporting purposes. This means that the date when the income is recognised for New Zealand tax purposes has moved from the date of payment to the date of reporting. 4.10 Officials propose that the shadow payroll rule be amended so that the income would be recognised when paid. This would align the rule with the ordinary rules for taxing PAYE income payments. Employment income information reporting requirements and withholding tax payment dates would not change. Non-resident contractors’ threshold tests do not apply to non-resident entertainers 4.11 Interpretation Statement IS 10/04 Non-resident contractor schedular payments outlines that, while the term “non-resident contractor” is broad enough to include a “non-resident entertainer”, these two categories should be considered separately. A referral to officials indicates that non-resident entertainers are sometimes viewed as a subset of non-resident contractors, and that the separation is not clear in the legislation. 18 Section CE 1(3B) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 23J(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 33 4.12 Officials propose clarifying the legislation to confirm that the day-count and monetary threshold tests 19 do not apply to non-resident entertainers. Questions for submitters • Do you support the above proposals? • Do you have any comments on the suggested changes? 19 Section RD 8(1)(b)(v) and (vi) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 35 APPENDIX Draft Operational Statement: Non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in cross-border employment situations Introduction Operational statements set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in respect of the matter discussed and deal with the practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. This Statement clarifies the approach to take with regards to a non-resident employers’ obligations to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT in certain cross-border employment situations. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 2007 (the Act) unless specified otherwise. Application This statement provides general guidance to assist non-resident employers’ in meeting their tax obligations regarding when to deduct PAYE, FBT and ESCT on cross-border situations. The Statement will apply from the date it is issued. However, the Commissioner will not be applying resources to examine positions taken by taxpayers prior to that date. If you have any concerns about compliance with the tax obligations discussed in this statement, you should discuss the matter with a tax professional or Inland Revenue. Summary 1. A non-resident employer has an obligation to withhold PAYE from a PAYE income payment made to an employee if: • The employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand tax law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and • The services performed by the employee are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 2. A non-resident employer may have a Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT) or Employer Contribution Superannuation Tax (ESCT) liability for a benefit provided to, or a contribution made for an employee if: • The employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand tax law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and • The services performed by the employee are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 3. There is no PAYE withholding obligation if a PAYE income payment is “non- residents’ foreign sourced income” for the employee. 36 4. There is also no PAYE withholding obligation for a PAYE income payment made to a non-resident employee working in New Zealand if the domestic exemption in section CW 19 applies, or a Double Taxation Agreement (DTA) gives relief from source taxation such as where the employee is in New Zealand 183 days or less in a twelve- month period. Discussion 5. This Statement provides guidance on whether employers have PAYE, FBT and ESCT obligations in various cross-border employment situations. 6. The different situations involve different combinations of; the residence of the employer, the residence of the employee, and the country in which the employment services are performed. Non-resident employers Territorial limitation - Presence 7. The PAYE rules 20 are intended to apply to New Zealand residents or matters over which New Zealand has jurisdiction. A non-resident may make themselves subject to New Zealand law (including the PAYE rules) by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand (Alcan 21 and Clark 22 ). The nature and extent of the required presence may vary depending on the facts in each case. 8. If a non-resident employer has a trading presence in New Zealand, such as carrying on operations and employing a workforce for the purpose of trade, this would normally be sufficient for the employer to have a PAYE withholding obligation for employees they pay PAYE income payments to. 9. A sufficient presence for a non-resident employer would also include having a permanent establishment, a branch, contracts that are entered into in New Zealand and performing contracts in New Zealand with employees based here. 10. An address for service (in New Zealand) is also another indication that the non-resident employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand law. 11. A sufficient presence would not include a situation where an employee chooses (as a matter of personal preference) to undertake their employment activities in New Zealand where those activities had no necessary connection to New Zealand, and where this was the non-resident employers’ only connection with New Zealand. 12. It is considered that merely having employees in New Zealand would not, of itself, constitute a presence of the employer sufficient to subject the employer to New Zealand’s jurisdiction. Therefore, the degree to which an employee “represents” the employer in activities in New Zealand will be one of the things to take into account to decide whether the presence is sufficient to mean that the employer has submitted themselves to New Zealand’s jurisdiction. 20 Section RD 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 21 Alcan New Zealand Ltd v CIR (1993) 15 NZTC 10,125 (HC). 22 Clark (Inspector of Taxes) v Oceanic Contractors Inc \[1983\] 1 All ER 133 (HL). 37 13. It is also considered that having a parent, subsidiary or associate would not be enough in itself to have a presence in New Zealand without something more, such as any of the factors mentioned in paragraphs \[8\], \[9\] and \[10\]. Example one Boston Architects (BA) is an architect firm bases in the USA. BA employs George who lives in Wellington. George participates in virtual meetings and completes all of his work in Wellington but as BA does not have any New Zealand clients, all the work is sent back to the US electronically. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? No. There would be no obligation to deduct PAYE as George’s employment activities have no necessary connection to New Zealand, and the only connection to New Zealand is that George lives there. Example two George’s work is highly respected and quite specialised, as he only designs schools. When there is a project to build a new school in Wellington, George is engaged (through BA) to provide his expertise and advice. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? No. George’s expertise and advice does not require him to be in New Zealand to give it. He is not carrying on operations or employing a workforce (on behalf on BA) in New Zealand to give this advice. Although there is a connection to New Zealand while undertaking his employment activities for this project, this is not enough to impose a PAYE obligation on BA. Example three George’s work on the school went well. When a new school project comes up, George is engaged (through BA) and is put in charge of dealing with the client and running the project. While some work is also done in the US, 3 more staff are hired in Wellington to help George out. It is hoped that this might be the start of more New Zealand work for BA. Would BA have an obligation to deduct PAYE? Yes. In this situation there is a sufficient presence in New Zealand for BA to have an obligation to deduct PAYE. George (on behalf of BA) is carrying on operations for the purpose of its business, he is entering into and performing contracts in New Zealand (on behalf of BA), and additional staff have been employed in connection with the project being undertaken in Wellington. Services performed 14. Where a non-resident employer has made themselves subject to New Zealand law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, the extent of the non-resident employer’s obligations will be limited to matters that are properly attributable to their New Zealand presence. 15. This means that if, for example, a non-resident employer carries on a business in New Zealand and pays wages to an employee who performs services that are properly attributable to the New Zealand business, the employer will have an obligation to withhold PAYE from those wages. 16. Most of the time the PAYE withholding obligations will arise where the employee is based in New Zealand. 38 17. However, it is possible that a New Zealand resident employee could perform services overseas that are properly attributable to the non-resident employers’ New Zealand presence. 18. For example, a New Zealand resident employee may be temporarily based overseas investigating the purchase of new equipment to be used in the employers’ New Zealand operations. The services of the employee would be properly attributable to the New Zealand operations and, therefore, the non-resident employer would be required to withhold PAYE from PAYE income payments made to the employee. Section CW 19 - Amounts derived during short-term visits 19. Under section CW 19, income that a non-resident person derives in a tax year from performing personal or professional services in New Zealand during a visit is exempt income if: • The visit is for 92 or fewer days (counting the day of arrival and departure as whole days). • The person is present in New Zealand for 92 days or fewer in total in each 12- month period that includes the period of the visit. • The services are performed for or on behalf of a person (which could include an employer) who is not resident in New Zealand. • The income is chargeable with income tax in the country in which the person is resident. 20. Exempt income is excluded from the definition of “salary or wages” and, therefore a “PAYE income payment 23 ” is also exempt under this provision. No PAYE withholding obligation will arise for any payments described in section CW 19. Relief given by a DTA 21. No PAYE withholding obligation will arise for PAYE income payments where a DTA provides the employee with relief from New Zealand taxation. 22. A DTA may have the effect of denying New Zealand any taxing rights for an amount of employment income derived by a non-resident employee for employment services performed in New Zealand. This may occur if the non-resident employee is in New Zealand for in total, 183 days or less in a twelve-month period, the remuneration is paid by a non-resident employer, and the remuneration is neither borne by nor deductible in determining the profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the employer has in New Zealand. 23. Please note, the example above assumes the wording of the DTA as described, although this wording may vary slightly within different DTA’s with regards to the taxing rights for employment income. 23 “PAYE income payment” is principally defined by reference to “salary or wages” which excludes an amount of exempt income (s RD 5(1)(c)(i)). 39 New Zealand resident employers 24. An issue with regards to payments by a New Zealand resident employer is whether there is an obligation to withhold PAYE where the PAYE income payment is paid to a non-resident employee for work performed overseas. 25. It is considered that a New Zealand resident employer does not have any obligation to withhold PAYE from a PAYE income payment that is “non-residents’ foreign-sourced income” 24 for the employee. This is because: • The Core Provisions indicate that the purpose of the Act is to tax assessable income. Income tax is generally not intended to apply to non-residents’ foreign- sourced income; certainly not in the case of employment income. • It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the Act to impose a PAYE withholding obligation on the employer in relation to such income. Employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) 26. A non-resident employer who has made themselves subject to New Zealand’s law by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and who pays PAYE income payments, may have a liability for ESCT. Like the situation for PAYE on a PAYE income payment, the employer’s superannuation contribution would have to relate to employment services that are properly attributable to the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 27. This means that, for a non-resident employer, an ESCT liability will normally only arise when the employee is performing services in New Zealand. However, a non- resident employer could have an ESCT liability for a contribution made for the benefit of an employee working overseas, if the services provided by the employee overseas are properly attributable to the employer’s New Zealand presence. 28. A non-resident employer who has not made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction has no liability for ESCT. This is so whether or not the employee is a New Zealand resident and whether or not the employment services are performed in New Zealand or overseas. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) 28. A non-resident employer who has made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction by having a sufficient presence in New Zealand, and who pays PAYE income payments, will have a liability for FBT (subject to the discussion below). Like the situation for PAYE on a PAYE income payment, for an FBT liability to arise the provision of a fringe benefit to an employee would have to be a benefit provided to an employee in connection with the employer’s presence in New Zealand. 29. This means that, for a non-resident employer, an FBT liability will normally only arise where the employee is performing services in New Zealand. However, a non-resident employer could have an FBT liability for a benefit provided to an employee working overseas, if the services provided by the employee overseas are properly attributable to the employer’s New Zealand operations. 24 “PAYE income payment” is principally defined by reference to “salary or wages” which excludes an amount of exempt income (section RD 5(1)(c)(i)). 40 30. An FBT liability will also depend on other factors, including whether the employee has received a PAYE income payment in the period. Additionally, section CX 26 provides that a benefit is not a fringe benefit to the extent to which it is received in a quarter or an income year in which they derive one or more PAYE income payments, all of which are not liable for income tax. 31. A non-resident employer who has not made themselves subject to New Zealand’s jurisdiction has no liability for FBT.
Policy and Regulatory Stewardship 55 Featherston Street PO Box 2198 Wellington 6140 New Zealand T.04-890 1500 2 March 2021 Foreign trust remedials In 2017, new disclosure requirements were enacted for foreign trusts with New Zealand resident trustees (the 2017 requirements). The Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Act 2017 amended the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA), implementing the recommendations of the Government Inquiry into Foreign Trust Disclosure Rules (2016). Following implementation of the 2017 requirements, o fficials have identified a number of legislative errors or unintended consequences which require remedial amendments. This letter sets out the proposed amendments and invites you to make a submission on the proposed remedials. The closing date for submissions is 23 March 2021. In summary, the remedial issues are: 1.T he definition of “foreign trust” is not aligned with the requirements for the foreign- sourced income exemption in sections CW 54 and HC 26 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA). 2.A power to deregister trusts does not exist. 3.The term “in the business of providing trustee services” is not defined and may be confusing. 4.Certain information may not be required for new settlors of, or beneficiaries with fixed or final interests in, a foreign trust. 5.There is no requirement to update annual return information when it changes. 6.Testamentary trusts do not have trust deeds and cannot qualify for the foreign-sourced income exemption in section CW 54. 7.The foreign trust disclosure rules in the TAA are not included in the ITA definition of “trust rules”. 8.The Commissioner has no discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption where the foreign trust was not registered at the relevant time. 9.The penalties have not been updated to reflect the 2017 requirements and are not fit for purpose. 10.References to a minor beneficiary’s age should instead refer to their date of birth. Issue 1: The definition of “foreign trust” is not aligned with the requirements for the foreign-sourced income exemption in sections CW 54 and HC 26 New Zealand taxes trusts based on the settlor’s tax residence. Accordingly, section CW 54 of the ITA exempts foreign-sourced amounts derived by resident trustees when the requirements of section HC 26 are met. Section HC 26(1)(a) requires that: no settlor of the trust is at any time in the income year a New Zealand resident who is not a transitional resident; ... 2 When the trust is a foreign trust, section HC 26 also requires the trust to meet certain requirements: the trust must have a trust deed, be registered, and the trustee must comply with the foreign trust disclosure requirements in the TAA. However, a trust can qualify for the foreign-sourced income exemption without being a “foreign trust”. A “foreign trust” is defined in section HC 11: HC 11 Foreign trusts A trust is a foreign trust at a moment in time if no settlor is resident in New Zealand at any time in the period that— (a) starts on the later of 17 December 1987 and the date on which a settlement was first made on the trust; and (b) ends with the moment in time. The non-resident settlor requirements in section HC 11 and section HC 26(1)(a) are not completely aligned . The requirement in section HC 11 looks at the entire lifetime of the trust (for trusts settled after 17 December 1987), whereas the requirement in section HC 26(1)(a) only looks at the income year in which the relevant foreign-sourced amount is derived. As such, a trust that does not have a settlor resident in New Zealand at any point in the current income year could use the foreign-sourced income exemption without technically being a “foreign trust” subject to the registration and disclosure requirements in the TAA. Example 1: settlor migrates from New Zealand Maia is resident in New Zealand. In the 2013 income year, she settled a family trust (the Trust) with a New Zealand trustee. The Trust holds a variety of foreign investments. The Trust is a complying trust as it has always met its tax obligations in New Zealand. Maia moves overseas and ceases to be resident in New Zealand in the 2018 income year. In the 2019 income year, the Trust derives foreign-sourced income. When the Trust’s 2019 tax return is filed, the foreign-sourced income derived in that year could qualify for the exemption in sections CW 54 and HC 26 of the ITA, as no settlor of the trust was at any time in the income year a New Zealand resident. However, it would not technically be required (or able) to register as a “foreign trust”, as it had a New Zealand resident settlor between the 2013 and 2018 income years. The same issue arises for settlors who are transitional residents. As transitional residents are still tax resident in New Zealand, a trust with a transitional resident settlor could not be a “foreign trust” under section HC 11. However, such a trust could still use the foreign-sourced exemption in section HC 26(1)(a) as that section carves out transitional resident settlors from its non-resident settlor requirement. Example 2: settlor migrates to New Zealand Pierre is resident in the United Kingdom. In 2001, he settled a family trust (the Trust) with a UK trustee. The Trust holds a variety of European investments. In the 2019 income year, Pierre moves to New Zealand and replaces the Trust’s UK trustee with a New Zealand trustee. Pierre becomes resident in New Zealand on 1 June 2018 but is a transitional resident for the period from 1 June 2018 to 30 June 2022. When the Trust’s 2019 tax return is filed, any foreign-sourced income derived in that year could qualify for the exemption in sections CW 54 and HC 26, as Pierre, the only settlor of the trust, is a transitional resident. However, the trust would not technically be a “foreign trust”, as it has a New Zealand resident settlor. These outcomes are inconsistent with the original policy intent of the disclosure requirements. The intent was that only registered trusts that have met the disclosure requirements would be able to use the foreign-sourced income exemption. The issue stems from the fact that the ITA assesses eligibility for the foreign-sourced income exemption on a yearly basis, whereas the 3 TAA’s registration and disclosure regime does not contemplate trusts changing in classification between complying, non-complying and foreign trusts. Proposed change Our preferred remedial change is to: • Revert to the previous definition of “foreign trust” in section HC 11 of the ITA under which a trust can be a foreign trust in relation to a particular distribution. • Enact a new defined term “foreign disclosing trust” for the purposes of sections HC 26(1)(c) and (d) and the disclosure regime in the TAA. The new definition would set out which trusts must comply with the TAA’s registration and disclosure requirements and should include any trust qualifying for the foreign-sourced income exemption. These remedial changes would only apply prospectively. Issue 2: A power to deregister trusts does not explicitly exist The current legislation envisages that foreign trusts may be deregistered (see section HC 26(1)(c)(iii) of the ITA) but there is no explicit power to deregister trusts. Proposed change We propose to set out explicitly the circumstances where a foreign trust may be deregistered, and the effect of such deregistration. Requirements for deregistration The Commissioner should have the explicit power to deregister a foreign trust where she is satisfied the trust: • is no longer a foreign trust • no longer has a New Zealand resident trustee, or • should not have been registered in the first place, as the requirements for registration were not made out. The Commissioner should be allowed to backdate a deregistration to the point where the trust ceased to meet the statutory requirements for registration (for example the trust ceased to be a foreign trust). The Commissioner should be able to exercise this deregistration power on her own initiative or on application by a trust. A trust applying for deregistration would have to provide sufficient information to satisfy the Commissioner that the trust should be deregistered. Consistent with existing practice, the trust would need to provide the following when applying for deregistration: • Reasons for the deregistration. • Evidence of the termination or migration of the trust (for example, a deed of winding up or deed of appointment or removal of trustees). • Contact details of the new trustee where the trust has migrated. • A final annual return for the period up to its deregistration (including financial statements, details of settlements and distributions in the final period, and details of settlors making those settlements or beneficiaries receiving those distributions). This 4 may be a part-year return if the trust is terminated or migrated shortly after the end of its balance year. • Such other information the Commissioner may require. Effect of deregistration Once a trust has been deregistered, it should not be required to notify the Commissioner of additions or alterations to details it has already provided (as required under section 59B(5) of the TAA) or provide annual returns (as required under section 59D(1)). A trust that has been deregistered will not be able to use the foreign-sourced income exemption in section CW 54 of the ITA (for income derived after deregistration), as section HC 26 generally requires foreign trusts to be registered to qualify for the exemption. If the foreign-sourced income exemption has been claimed for a period the trust was not registered, the Commissioner could amend the trust’s returns to include the foreign-sourced income, subject to any existing time bar. Issue 3: The term “in the business of providing trustee services” is not defined and may be confusing In some cases, the requirements are lighter for trusts with only foreign trustees that are natural persons and not “in the business of providing trustee services”. Such trusts: do not have to look back as far when disclosing historical settlements on application for registration (section 59B(3)(b) of the TAA); are allowed a longer grace period to register the trust (section 59C(3)); and do not have to pay registration and annual return fees (section 59E(5)). Some commentary has used the term “professional trustee” as a shorthand for trustees in the business of providing trustee services, even though “professional trustee” is a separately defined term. Section 3 defines “professional trustee” for the purposes of section 43B as follows: professional trustee, in section 43B, means a person whose profession, employment, or business is or includes acting as a trustee or investing money on behalf of others We consider the terms “professional trustee” and “in the business of providing trustee services” cover broadly similar concepts. It may therefore be less confusing to combine the two terms. Proposed change We propose to replace references to trustees “in the business of providing trustee services” with “professional trustees”. This change would increase simplicity and certainty. Issue 4: Certain information may not be required for new settlors of, or beneficiaries with fixed or final interests in , a foreign trust When a trustee applies for registration, they are required to provide the following for each of the persons listed in section 59B(3)(c)(i) to (vii) of the TAA: • The name, email address, physical residential or business address, jurisdiction of tax residence, taxpayer identification number, and connection with the trust. • A signed declaration that the trustee has informed the person of, and the person has agreed to, certain requirements of the TAA, Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism Act 2009 (AMLCFT Act) and regulations made under the AMLCFT 5 (section 59B(4)). Alternatively, the contact trustee may provide a signed declaration certifying that the person is dead or cannot be located. However, the legislation may not technically require the contact trustee to provide a signed declaration for settlors making a settlement after the application for registration (new settlors), even though the other information above is required. It is also arguable whether the information above and a declaration are required for beneficiaries with a fixed interest in the trust property (fixed beneficiaries). Although the information and declaration are required for each beneficiary of a “fixed trust”, some taxpayers may consider a trust not to be a “fixed trust” if it also has discretionary beneficiaries under the same trust deed. While we consider that in these cases there would actually be multiple trusts (some fixed, some discretionary), it would be clearer to amend the relevant sections so that they refer to beneficiaries with fixed interests in the trust rather than beneficiaries of a “fixed trust”. It can also be unclear whether the information above and a declaration are required for final beneficiaries. We consider it arguable that final beneficiaries should be subject to the same requirements as fixed beneficiaries because a final beneficiary’s interest in the trust can be more certain than a discretionary beneficiary’s interest. On the other hand, we understand that, like discretionary beneficiaries, final beneficiaries can sometimes be hard to identify if they are part of a wider class. We welcome submissions on this point. Proposed changes We propose to: • Require the contact trustee to provide the signed declaration for any new settlors at the same time as the annual return relating to the period in which the settlement was made is filed. • Amend sections 59B(3)(c)(vi), (vii) and (d) so that they refer to beneficiaries with fixed interests in the trust rather than beneficiaries of a “fixed trust”. • Clarify whether final beneficiaries are covered by the requirements that apply to fixed beneficiaries in section 59B(3)(c) and (4) or the requirements that apply to discretionary beneficiaries in section 59B(3)(e). Issue 5: There is no requirement to update annual return information when it changes Section 59B(5) of the TAA generally requires the contact trustee to notify the Commissioner of additions or alterations to the information provided on registration, but not for information provided in annual returns. Proposed change We propose to require the contact trustee to notify the Commissioner of additions or alterations to the information provided in annual returns (including information on new settlors and beneficiaries with fixed interests — see Issue 4) within 30 days after becoming aware of the addition or alteration. This is consistent with the existing time limit under section 59C(2) for disclosing changes to information provided on application for registration. The effect of this change means that if, for example, a settlor’s physical address changes, the contact trustee must notify the Commissioner within 30 days after becoming aware of it, regardless of whether the settlor’s original address was provided on registration or in an annual return. 6 Issue 6: Testamentary trusts do not have trust deeds and cannot qualify for the foreign-sourced income exemption in section CW 54 For a foreign trust to get the foreign-sourced income exemption in section CW 54 of the ITA, it must have a trust deed (sections HC 26(1)(c)(i) and (d)(i)). This requirement applies equally to foreign trusts established under a will (testamentary trusts) as it does to trusts set up during a settlor’s lifetime (inter vivos trusts). However, a will is not legally a trust deed. As a result, foreign testamentary trusts are not currently able to obtain the foreign-sourced income exemption. We do not consider this was the intended policy result. Proposed change We propose to allow testamentary trusts to obtain the foreign-sourced income exemption by allowing a will establishing a trust to be treated as a trust deed for the purposes of section HC 26. We propose to make this change retrospective to 21 February 2017, when the new disclosure requirements came into effect. Issue 7: The foreign trust disclosure rules in the TAA are not included in the ITA definition of “trust rules” The foreign trust registration and disclosure rules in sections 59B to 59 E of the TAA are not included in the definition of “trust rules” in section YA 1 of the ITA. Accordingly, some provisions and definitions that should apply to the foreign trust disclosure rules do not. An example is section HC 28, which contains an expanded definition of “settlor” for the purpose of the trust rules. There was never a policy intention to treat persons falling under the section HC 27 definition of a “settlor” differently from persons falling under the expanded definition in section HC 28 for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules. The legislative history of section HC 28 suggests that the section was split out for legibility reasons rather than policy reasons. We recognise, however, the intention that people who have provided minor and incidental services to a trust for consideration below market value, would not be regarded as “settlors” for the purposes of the foreign trust disclosure rules (even though they would be “settlors” for other income tax purposes). 1 That intention is already achieved through the specific carveouts in sections 59B(3)(b) and 59D(2)(b)(i) and will not be affected by including the foreign trust disclosure rules in the definition of “trust rules”. Proposed change We propose to amend the definition of “trust rules” in the ITA to include the foreign trust registration and disclosure rules in sections 59B to 59E of the TAA. Issue 8: The Commissioner has no discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption where the foreign trust was not registered at the relevant time If a resident foreign trustee has satisfied the Commissioner that the trustee made reasonable efforts in the income year to comply with the requirements of sections 22, 59B, 59C or 59D of the TAA, and has corrected the failure to comply within a reasonable period after becoming 1 Taxation (Business Tax, Exchange of Information, and Remedial Matters) Bill (149–2) (select committee report) at 4 https://www.parliament.nz/resource/en- NZ/51DBSCH\_SCR71859\_1/a766cca1dc215ab6c19f957d7a9d3668f18ebe8f 7 aware of the failure, the trust may still obtain the foreign-sourced income exemption under section HC 26(1B) of the ITA. However, that same power is not available to the Commissioner if a foreign trust was not registered at the times required by section HC 26(1)(d)(ii) and (iii), even if the trustee had made reasonable efforts to be registered in time. There is no policy reason for this difference in treatment. Proposed change We are considering two ways in which this issue may be fixed. Where the trustee has made reasonable efforts to be registered in time and the other conditions for the exemption are met, either: • give the Commissioner a discretion to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption, or • allow the Commissioner to backdate a registration. We invite submissions on which of the two approaches is preferred. At this stage, we consider backdating the registration would most likely be simpler and cleaner, particularly where the trust has derived multiple items of foreign-sourced income in the relevant period. Issue 9: The penalties have not been updated to reflect the 2017 requirements and are not fit for purpose When the registration and disclosure requirements were enacted, penalties for non-compliance were not correspondingly enacted or updated. In particular, sections 143(1B) and (1C) of the TAA, which set out how the absolute liability offences in section 143(1) apply to resident foreign trustees, reflect the wording of the pre-2017 disclosure regime. For example, section 143(1C) refers only to section 59B (registration and initial disclosure requirement) but not to section 59D (annual return requirement); and section 143(1C)(b) refers to the appointment of another resident foreign trustee under section 59B(7) even though that subsection no longer provides for the appointment of a trustee. Furthermore, the main consequence of non-compliance with the 2017 requirements is that the foreign trust will not be able to use the foreign-sourced income exemption. There is an exception in section HC 26(1B) (discussed above under Issue 8), which can apply when the Commissioner is satisfied that the trustee has made reasonable efforts to comply. However, this is all -or -nothing in its effect (that is, the exemption either applies or it does not) which means that the consequences of not complying may be disproportionate to the seriousness of, or culpability involved in, the non-compliance. For example, a resident trustee may not have taken reasonable efforts to comply with all the disclosure requirements, but ultimately did comply. Denying the foreign-sourced income exemption altogether in such a case may be considered excessively harsh, but at the same time the Commissioner may not be satisfied that the exception in section HC 26(1B) is made out. On the other hand, where the Commissioner is satisfied the exception is made out, it could be considered unsatisfactory that the foreign trust effectively suffered no consequences for its non-compliance. Similarly, denying the foreign-sourced income exemption would not have any effect on a foreign trust that does not derive foreign-sourced income. Another compliance tool, such as a civil penalty, could assist the administration of the foreign trust registration and disclosure regime, having regard to the purpose of that regime. A civil penalty could be imposed in a way that is more proportionate to the offence committed. 8 Proposed changes We propose to update section 143 of the TAA to take into account the 2017 requirements as follows: • ensuring that subsection (1C) refers to section 59D, and • removing the reference to section 59B(7). We also propose to: • Enact a new civil penalty based on section 142I of the TAA (penalties relating to failure to provide foreign information relating to a person or entity for a financial account) of up to $1,000. • Give the Commissioner a broader ability to allow the foreign-sourced income exemption in section HC 26(1B) where the trustee has made reasonable efforts to correct a failure to comply with the requirements within a reasonable period, even if the failure could not in fact be corrected. The new civil penalty could be applied for failures to comply with the 2017 requirements, such as when a trustee misses a deadline, provides an incomplete annual return, or provides false information. This penalty can apply instead of, or in addition to, the trust being denied the foreign-sourced income exemption. As with the section 142I penalty, the new civil penalty would not apply to failures to provide information if the Commissioner is satisfied that the failure occurred through no fault of the trustee or that the trustee made reasonable efforts to meet the requirement. Issue 10: References to a minor beneficiary’s age should instead refer to their date of birth Currently, the TAA requires the contact trustee to provide the Commissioner with the ages of minor beneficiaries to a fixed trust (sections 59B(3)(d) and 59D(2)(e) of the TAA). Technically, the updating requirements mean that the trustee would have to inform the Commissioner of the minor’s new age within 30 days of the minor’s birthday each year, until they ceased to become a minor. This is impractical. Proposed changes We propose to replace the references to age in sections 59B(3)(d) and 59D(2)(e) with references to date of birth.

The Government, therefore, would like to ensure that there are no tax barriers to formally aggregating these forest blocks. 1.2 To help achieve that objective, this issues paper considers the following questions at a high level: • What is aggregation and what are its benefits? • Do the relevant tax rules inhibit the efficient aggregation of smaller forest blocks? • If a tax issue does exist, how important is it compared with other factors that might deter formal aggregation? • How might the tax impediments be safely removed while remaining fiscally neutral? 1.3 Under current tax law, formal aggregation involves the sale of individual forest blocks to a new entity (an aggregation entity), triggering a disposal for tax purposes. Taxing increases in the value of revenue account assets, like forestry, when a disposal occurs is a standard feature of the tax system. Foresters have been concerned that in the case of aggregation this treatment would bring forward much of the tax liability that would normally arise later – that is, at the time of harvest, or upon any subsequent sale to a third party. 1.4 It is not clear that the tax rules are the fundamental reason behind the lack of formal aggregation as that lack could equally be the result of wider issues, such as a concern that aggregation removes individual flexibility over when to harvest. At the margin, however, the tax disposal rules are likely to deter aggregation. 1.5 If a tax change is to be provided for formal aggregation, care will have to be taken to avoid compromising either the general tax treatment of forestry or, to the extent possible, the consistency of tax treatment with other types of investments. An overarching criterion is that any aggregation must be fiscally neutral. Summary of the proposal 1.6 There is a case for the tax system to ignore, for tax purposes, the disposal on aggregation when the foresters are simply exchanging ownership of their individual forest interests 1 for an equivalent economic interest in a look through entity. That 1 Forest interest in the context of this issues paper is either growing plantation trees that are grown on land also owned by the forester, or ownership of the cutting rights to plantation trees where the forester almost always does not own the land. 6 is, the foresters who received the deductions for planting and growing the forest, continue to be liable for taxation on the harvest or sale proceeds. This would require a legislative change. 1.7 This issues paper therefore seeks confirmation that the tax impediment to aggregation outlined above has been correctly identified. It also asks for public views on a potential exception to treating an aggregation of forestry interests as a disposal for tax purposes, when: • the aggregation entity is either a look through company, limited partnership or ordinary partnership, and the foresters have similar relative assets and risks before and after aggregation, so that they continue to be liable for taxation on the harvest or subsequent sale of the forest • the only consideration the foresters receive from the aggregation is an interest in the new look-through vehicle, and • the forest blocks are of a similar age, with the trees being mainly at least 20 years old, which means that they are likely to be approaching harvest. 1.8 Subject to submissions on the issues paper and final Cabinet decisions, the proposal could potentially be included in an omnibus tax bill in 2022. Making a submission 1.9 Submissions are invited on any issues raised in this document, and on the specific questions posed in the document. 1.10 Submissions should include a brief summary of submitter’s major points and recommendations.

Role of small and medium forests 2.2 The Ministry for Primary Industries estimate that small and medium-sized foresters 2 own around 520,000 hectares of exotic plantation forest. This subset of the forestry industry holds standing trees worth around $20 billion. 2.3 Small and medium-sized forests are fundamentally different from large corporate- run forests because unlike larger blocks, the trees tend to be of a similar age (figure 1). As much as forty percent of the standing trees aged 21 years or older are owned by smaller owners. Much of the plantation forests owned by small and medium-sized forest owners is nearing harvest age. In the near term, this subset of New Zealand’s forestry is positioned to become significantly important to the industry–for example, domestic processors will be increasingly reliant on accessing logs from small and medium-sized forest owners. Figure 1: National exotic plantation forest age class distribution, split by ownership class Source: National Exotic Forest Description, 2020 2 The Ministry for Primary Industries defines small forest owners as those having less than a total of 40 hectares of individually titled forest and medium sized owners as having between 40–999 hectares of forest. About 13,000 different entities in New Zealand own forests of less than 100 hectares. Because forestry is not really the focus or main source of income for these owners their blocks are scattered, of mixed quality, and often planted on poor country. Despite this, their trees could be worth around $20 billion if harvested. 8 Benefits of aggregation 2.4 As New Zealand foresters are selling an internationally traded commodity, they are generally price takers. Thus, they must reduce costs throughout the growing cycle in order to improve returns. A way to reduce costs without compromising wages and safety is to seek economies of scale. Owners of smaller forests can obtain economies of scale by aggregating their holdings to operate them as larger estates. This type of restructuring of the ownership of small and medium-sized forests, or at least the cutting rights to the timber, would be an important way to unlock the value of many small blocks given their often isolated and/or difficult location. 2.5 A further benefit of amalgamation is the potential to even out price fluctuations. Price fluctuations are an inevitable feature of commodity markets, including timber. As a larger total area of forest, harvesting an amalgamated forest is more likely to be on-going, taking longer to harvest. Trees harvested all at the same time in a smaller forestry block are more subject to peaks and troughs in the market, while an amalgamated forest is more likely to receive long-term average log prices. 2.6 A collateral benefit could be amalgamated forest owners being more receptive to following the practice of larger-scale growers and continuing to harvest, albeit at lower volumes, when prices decline, to maintain the associated infrastructure. This would help to create a more stable working environment for harvest contractors and their staff. Being able to behave like larger scale growers increases the likelihood of better-quality service providers being interested in the work opportunities in amalgamated forests. Those service providers can bring with them better health and safety practices and environmental systems, again because of the economies of scale. 2.7 Aggregation could take place at any stage in the growing cycle, but there is a greater incentive to consider aggregation closer to harvest. Small and medium-sized forest owners with insufficient standing trees to maintain a permanent workforce have few options to manage harvest costs. Broadly, these options involve either managing the harvest themselves or selling their trees, land or cutting rights to a company or a co-operative. In these circumstances, aggregation is seen as a way of increasing owners’ bargaining positions when negotiating with harvesters. Current level of aggregation 2.8 Aggregation can be formal, for example, the owners selling their forests to a special purpose aggregation vehicle that they own, or it can be informal, for example, adjacent owners getting together to cooperate on harvesting. 2.9 There have been limited attempts at formal aggregation in New Zealand (overseas examples are discussed in appendix 2). 2.10 To date, the more successful arrangements in New Zealand have tended to be more informal. For instance, informal collaboration between adjacent owners, or through forest management companies planning the harvesting of forests in a particular area in an efficient way to achieve some degree of economies of scale. 2.11 Aggregation without tax consequences is currently possible through an unincorporated joint venture, based on a current Inland Revenue product ruling, 9 which is outlined in the next chapter. We are not aware of this approach being widely used. This may be for a variety of reasons. 2.12 Foresters may consider an unincorporated joint venture does not provide them with sufficient control or certainty. Also, there were significant compliance costs for the applicant having to apply for the ruling and set up the structure. Although those costs should be materially less for any subsequent parties wanting to use the same structure now that the binding ruling has been issued, the ruling is very much circumstances driven which may either make forest owners reluctant to use that structure or lead them to seek their own ruling (therefore incurring additional compliance costs). For example, the forests in the ruling were managed by the same company who would have had time to plan and organise a joint venture; circumstances that may not be practicable when there are unrelated woodlots. 2.13 Table 1 expands on this discussion. Table 1: Summary of aggregation and its benefits Question Answer Current situation What do we mean by ‘aggregation’? Formal aggregation would result in a new legal entity collectively owned by smaller forest owners. These owners would continue to have similar relative risks and benefits after aggregation with respect to the trees, with or without the land. The forests in the new entity need not be in close physical proximity, but the financial benefits may be greater in these cases (for example, sharing the cost of roading infrastructure). There is no formal aggregation (except that which is done pre- planting). Under current tax law there are potential tax implications associated with the transfer of forests on aggregation. A joint venture and several limited partnerships already exist (under the product ruling) but this does not involve a sale of individual forests to a new legal entity. Collaboration is an alternative to aggregation and can work in some circumstances but as it is informal it is seldom reported. No change is required to facilitate this as collaboration requires no registered legal structure. Because it is informal, it relies on trust, and can break down when tested strongly by market prices. There may also be non-tax barriers, such as a reluctance of individual owners to cede control. 10 Question Answer Current situation What is the economic and wider case for aggregation? The aim is to achieve economies of scale, which reduce the risks and increase the benefits of forestry operations. Specifically: • reduced cost of forest operations • increased profits for contractors and forest owners (see appendix 1) • allows mills longer supply contracts giving them more confidence to invest • potential non-financial benefits such as improved health and safety, and environmental outcomes, and • encourages joint certification of timber for export access. Accurate cost information is difficult to obtain because of market dynamics. Questions for submitters • Have we correctly identified the potential benefits of formal aggregation? • Have you contemplated or undertaken an unincorporated joint venture? If not, why? • Are there other arrangements not mentioned above that could be used in New Zealand to achieve the equivalent of aggregation, to maximise the benefits from economies of scale? 11 CHAPTER 3 The tax issue 3.1 Aspects of the taxation of forestry are unique, partly because of the very long lead time between planting and harvest. Trees are revenue account property, and as with all revenue account property, a sale or other disposal transaction results in taxable income. 3.2 However, while typically the cost of revenue account property is accumulated and is deductible against this taxable income, in the case of forestry, the costs of planting and growing the trees are immediately deductible. The only cost that is not immediately deductible is the cost of purchased trees, this cost only being deductible against the sale/harvest of the trees. There is no intention to change how these forestry costs are treated, and this is not the focus of this issues paper. 3 Rather the focus is on the disposals arising from aggregation. Forestry disposals 3.3 Under the Income Tax Act 2007 a seller of a forest or forest cutting rights must treat the sale of standing timber or rights as income. Therefore, the sale of land with forest or cutting rights generally triggers a taxable event (under section CB 24 or CB 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007). This triggers a tax impost which would normally otherwise occur later, say at the time of harvest. In practice, all forms of formal aggregation come within the scope of this current law as they involve the “sale” of the forest to the aggregation entity. 3.4 The main disadvantage of bringing forward the tax liability is that the tax liability becomes payable when there is often no cash available to pay it. Revenue from the forest would otherwise typically not be received until the timber is harvested, but tax would need to be paid on the increase in the forest’s value to the date of formal aggregation. Irrespective of whether the tax is funded through borrowings or an owner’s resources, there would then be an interest (or interest forgone) cost. 3.5 Moreover, the tax implication for the purchaser, the aggregation entity, is that they cannot deduct the purchase cost until they either harvest the timber or sell the standing timber or rights to another party. 3.6 Treating the sale and purchase of trees, land or cutting rights as a taxable event is appropriate as it is consistent with the tax treatment of other revenue account assets. 3 Ideally, income tax should recognise income and expenses as they accrue unless it is impractical to do so. In the case of forestry, for various reasons, it is considered impractical to recognise income on an accrual basis, so income is instead recognised on a cash basis. In practice, this means income arises when either forestry assets (including cutting rights) are sold or timber is harvested. It also means, given the long period before harvest, that forestry expenses are generally deductible well in advance of when forestry income is brought to account. However, this aspect is not the focus of this officials’ issues paper. The fact that the purchaser of a forest does not get a deduction for its cost until the forest is sold is not unique to forestry. Where other businesses hold assets held on revenue account, the purchase price can only be deducted when the property is sold. 12 The alternative would be to tax the increases in the asset values annually (that is, on an accrual basis), but that would entail material compliance and cash flow costs. 3.7 For the focus of this issues paper, the particular issue is whether this taxation approach is appropriate when aggregating forestry interests. Conceptually, the aggregation could be ignored for tax purposes so long as the small and medium sized foresters are not relieved of their eventual obligation to return, as taxable income, the harvest or sale proceeds. Aggregation under product ruling 3.8 Current tax law enables a form of aggregation to take place within confined circumstances using a private ruling sought in 2018 that was subsequently issued as a product ruling. 3.9 Product ruling BR PRD 18/07 4 enables limited partnerships who each own a forestry block in a forestry estate to group together in an unincorporated joint venture to facilitate the harvest of their timber and to transfer the land they own to a new limited partnership. In the ruling, each limited partnership is a separate managed investment scheme and each has granted itself a forestry right which separates the ownership of the trees from the ownership of the underlying land on which the trees are planted. 3.10 When the conditions are met, there are no tax consequences from the perspective of either sections CB 24 or CB 25 of the Income Tax Act 2007. There is neither income derived from the disposal of timber (section CB 24) nor income from the disposal of land with standing timber (section CB 25). Policy considerations Tax policy framework 3.11 The overall policy intention is that tax is applied in the least distortionary way given that tax will generally have an impact on business decision-making. In this context, it is important to ensure that the tax obstacles to genuine forestry aggregations are minimised when the owners of the forests are in effect the same before and after aggregation. At the same time, we need to ensure equity of treatment across sectors. 3.12 As noted earlier, treating aggregations that involve the transfer of the parties’ interests into a new separate legal entity as a disposal is not confined to forestry. A disposal can arise for other businesses that create a new ownership entity as part of aggregation given a change of ownership structure is generally a catalyst for a tax disposal. The Income Tax Act generally focuses on taxing any gain or recognising any loss at the point of a transaction rather than as they accrue, because the gain or loss is unambiguous at that point. This means that a taxable event occurs whenever a transaction takes place with another party, including a related party. There are 4 Available at https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/en/rulings/product/br-prd-1807-millwood-forest-lp 13 specific exceptions, such as relationship property transfers, 5 but the underlying principle is that a transaction is recognised unless there is no fundamental change in ownership. Companies can transfer assets within consolidated groups and can also amalgamate in certain circumstances without tax consequences. In such cases, the original owners continue to hold the economic benefits and risks of the investment after the consolidation or amalgamation but continue to use the company form. Is there demand for aggregation? 3.13 A further crucial policy issue to consider is whether more aggregation would take place even if the tax rules considered there were no disposal for tax purposes. To succeed, aggregation needs to be something that owners will be likely to take up. Take-up is pertinent, as creating options within the tax rules to facilitate aggregation poses a risk that those options are primarily used instead by those aiming to avoid income tax on forestry sales in general. 3.14 On the face of it, achieving higher profitability and reduced costs should be a potent force for aggregation, particularly when there might be clear benefits, such as when boundaries are contiguous or there is low margin forest. 3.15 In Europe, co-operative arrangements are common, with co-operatives having 60% market share of forestry in Sweden and 31% in Finland. However, the much higher rates of collaboration in Sweden and Finland may be partly explained by the different nature of their forests. Swedish and Finnish forests typically have long rotations and individually valuable trees that can be harvested economically in small units on an on-going basis. 3.16 In New Zealand, the issue of aggregation may become more important with the increased reliance on small and medium sized forest blocks as a source of logs. 3.17 On the other hand, there may be some concern among foresters that aggregation/co- operative arrangements remove their individual flexibility over when to harvest. Instead, they are bound by group or managers’ decisions. Improved returns may not be sufficient to overcome this perceived loss of flexibility. 6 This may in part explain why earlier schemes to enable aggregation had variable success. 3.18 Overall, it is not clear whether the current lack of formal aggregation is the result of the tax rules or arises from wider market factors. However, at the margin, the current tax disposal rules are likely to have an impact. 3.19 This leads us to the specific tax issue: presuming that, ignoring tax, the benefits from formal aggregation are real, under what circumstances might the tax rules be amended? 5 In the case of forestry, there is no disposal of forestry assets under either sections CB 24 or 25 when there is a relationship property transfer; when the transfer is to close relatives on the death of a person; or a forestry proprietor grants themselves a forestry right. There is no cash flow impact in such cases. 6 This flexibility may in part be illusory. For example, if individual smaller foresters are wanting to harvest in an up-market, they will be competing against each other for a limited labour force which pushes up costs, leads to congestion at ports, and helps to add ultimately to an oversupply on the world market. 14 Questions for submitters • Have the tax impacts been described accurately? • In your view, would removing those impacts materially increase the demand for formal aggregation? In other words, is there an underlying demand for the concept of formal aggregation in New Zealand? • If so, would that underlying demand be material? 15 CHAPTER 4 What restrictions should apply? 4.1 This chapter is based on the presumption that formal aggregation will not proceed if there is a taxation impediment. However, any tax amendment must meet the overarching objective of being fiscally neutral. 4.2 Overall, there is likely a case for ignoring the aggregation disposal when foresters are simply exchanging ownership of their individual forests for an equivalent interest in a new entity that they own. Thus, they would derive no taxable income from the aggregation transaction. The likely legislative amendment required to ignore that disposal would be achieved through an exception to the section CB 25 disposal rule in the Income Tax Act, further to the exceptions discussed in paragraph 3.12. 4.3 Various restrictions should be applied to mitigate the risks associated with such an exception. Business form 4.4 There are a number of business structures that could be used for aggregation. An aggregated entity could be an ordinary company, or a look-through vehicle such as a partnership, a limited partnership or a look-through company. These are more formalised structures than an unincorporated joint venture and may therefore provide more certainty or comfort for participants. Some pose more risk to the tax system in the aggregation context, as discussed below. 4.5 For risk management purposes forests are typically owned by entities that have limited liability. Further, given the desire by the owners to use the tax losses created by planting and maintaining trees, these are typically look-through entities. 4.6 Ideally, the tax outcome should not depend on the type of structure that the owner chooses. While the tax rules try to reduce the distortions at the margin, there are inevitably differences in treatment across entity types. Company 4.7 Companies are a common form of collective ownership and are, therefore, generally well understood. A company facilitates owners’ entry and exit as it would simply involve a sale of existing shares or issuing of new shares. However, that would be an issue from a tax policy perspective as the grouping should be designed to simply enable an existing group of investors to group together to achieve economies of scale from harvest, not to enable those investors to sell out prior to harvest without tax consequences. An ordinary company structure would not, therefore, meet the criterion that the original owners continue to bear the economic and tax risk. 4.8 A simple example illustrates why, from a tax policy perspective, the use of companies is not appropriate. The owner of the forest has either directly or via a look-through entity planted and grown the trees. This has entitled the owner to use 16 the start-up losses. If, immediately before harvest, they were allowed to aggregate without tax consequences into a company they would then own shares which they can sell without tax consequences, even if it is just to the owner’s family trust. It is necessary, from a tax policy perspective, that the owner pays the tax on the eventual disposal of the forest and that aggregation does not allow this tax to be avoided. Look-through entities 4.9 A look-through company (LTC), a partnership and a limited partnership are look- through entities for tax purposes. 7 Being look-through/transparent for tax purposes means that the income of the entity is attributed to the owners in accordance with their partnership/ownership share and, therefore, is taxed directly at the partner/owner level. A LTC and a limited partnership have the added benefit of limited liability. 4.10 The impact of ownership changes would be less of an issue with a look through entity than with a company as introducing new partners/owners and selling existing partnership/ownership interests to entering partners/owners gives rise to tax consequences because it is treated as a sale of a portion of the underlying partnership/LTC assets rather than the sale of shares. 4.11 Limited partnerships are subject to the “loss limitation rule” which restricts the aggregate tax losses that a limited partner can deduct to the amount the limited partner has at risk (that is, the amount they have invested, lent or guaranteed to the limited partnership). This rule is unlikely to be an issue in practice for forestry partners if the market value of the forests they have contributed to the limited partnership is more than the subsequent aggregate losses. Ordinary partnerships are not subject to the loss limitation rule, and LTCs are only subject to the loss limitation rule in a very specific situation. Conclusion 4.12 For forestry aggregations, a look-through entity poses less risk to the tax system than an ordinary company because any subsequent real change of ownership of the forest is a sale for tax purposes. A look-through entity also seems to be a viable aggregation vehicle from an owner’s perspective. 7 LTCs are intended to facilitate a sole trader or a small group of sole traders seeking to incorporate without a material change in tax treatment. The rules are, therefore, designed to limit LTC status to smaller incorporated entities controlled by natural persons and their trusts. For example, there are limitations on the number and types of shareholders (an ordinary company cannot be a shareholder). There is no limitation on the amount of assets that an LTC can have. An LTC is similar in many respects to the old qualifying company except for the full flow-through for tax purposes. A limited partnership (LP) is a similarly separate legal entity from its partners, like a company, but with flow- through tax treatment. Any “person” can be a partner in an LP. A general partner (similar to a director) manages the business, is jointly liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership and is an agent of the partnership. An LP can have more than one general partner. Often the general partner is a corporate to limit its liability. There are no limitations on the number of limited partners. Limited partners are more like passive investors in that they cannot participate in the management of the LP. 17 Other restrictions 4.13 There is a risk that a new exception may be expanded beyond the focus of aggregating small-medium forest lots. The wider the exception, the more likely that tax planning opportunities will eventuate and that it potentially just amounts to a way of avoiding the taxation of sales of immature forests. 4.14 To reduce this risk, further key criteria should be applied: • In addition to the aggregation vehicle needing to be a look through entity, the foresters would need to have similar relative assets and risks after aggregation so that they would continue to be liable for taxation on the harvest or subsequent sale of the forest. Instead of owning their own forest, a forester would have a share in all the aggregated forests, of equivalent value. Specifically, the beneficial owners of the forests would need to consist solely of foresters who had: – exchanged title to land or land and trees for an interest in the aggregated business, or – ceded a registered Forestry Right over the land for an interest in the aggregated business. • The only consideration the foresters receive from the aggregation would be an interest in the new look-through entity. • The forest blocks would need to be of a similar age, with the trees being mainly at least 20 years old, meaning that they would likely to be approaching harvest. This criterion that the aggregation is for harvesting purposes, might be able to be subsequently relaxed if the risks from this constrained aggregation prove to be manageable. • The exception is at least fiscally neutral, given the initiative is not intended to be a tax concession. The fiscal neutrality of any new exception is a fundamental consideration for the Government. Aggregations that involve no change in who bears the tax risk and that simply enable greater economies on harvest would be fiscally neutral. Emissions units 4.15 Individual foresters may also have received emissions units in recognition of the carbon capture benefits of their forest blocks. Any tax policy proposal relating to aggregation will need to be mindful of emissions units. Aggregation may mean the transfer of some or all of those units to the aggregation entity. Doing so would have tax implications under current tax law. This is because the transfer of the emissions units will be treated as a disposal of revenue account property – a taxable event. 4.16 While there are a variety of possible scenarios, 8 the key point is that all individual foresters aggregating their forestry interests should treat their relevant emissions units on hand in the same way. This is to ensure that the unit holders are prorating (in relation to carbon capture) the units that they bring across with their forests when aggregating their interests. This is important because of the potentially significant 8 For example, some foresters may want to hold on to the units and some may have already sold them. 18 value of the emissions units and the need to avoid any changes in relative risks and benefits on aggregation. 4.17 Submissions are invited on the various scenarios and their tax treatment upon the aggregation of forests. Questions for submitters • In your view, would the proposals outlined in this chapter help to achieve the objective? Would this be a viable option for aggregating holdings? • Should a small-to-medium sized forest block be defined, particularly in terms of size, to best reflect the intended focus of the potential exception? For example, should each individual block being aggregated be no more than 100 hectares, or 500 hectares, or 1,000 hectares? Note the criteria that the forest blocks would need to be of a similar age and that the aggregation entity would need to be a look-through entity, may mean that it is unnecessary to define a small-to- medium sized forest block as large forest holdings would generally not meet those criteria. • Would there be valuation issues? 19 APPENDIX 1 Estimated economies of scale from small forest aggregation Table 2: Estimated economies of scale from small forest aggregation Operation Aggregation Savings Land preparation 5 ha becoming 20 ha $10 /ha Planting and silviculture Unquantified Pre-harvest inventory 5 ha becoming 2,000 ha $5 /ha Planning and consents 10 ha becoming 100 ha 10% of costs Roading costs and traffic control Depends on configuration Significant savings, maybe tens of thousands of dollars Harvesting 40 ha becoming enough area to guarantee continuity of work for one year or more $15 /m3 or $7,500 /ha Trucking Unquantified Wharfage 200,000 m3 becoming 500,000 m3 $1 /m3 or $500 /ha Shipping and marketing As wharfage $1 /m3 or $500 /ha Total Of the order of $10,000 /ha Source: Levack, H. 2015. “Economics of Scale in Forestry”. NZ Tree Grower. May 2015. Vol 36 No 2. ISSN 0111-2694. 20 APPENDIX 2 Other country information Information on other countries’ treatment of aggregation is scant. Much of the information that we have been able to find relates to the treatment of forest sales. Australia The market value of standing timber may be assessable income when, for example, the trees were planted for the purposes of sale. Capital gains tax will therefore generally not apply as the profits will be assessable as either ordinary income or as income from an isolated commercial transaction, even if a “tree farming business” is not being carried on. The land on which the trees are situated is separately subject to capital gains tax. Canada A distinction is made between commercial and non-commercial woodlots depending on whether the intention is to operate a business in which the harvesting of wood is more than an incidental activity. Gains on sale of timber in a commercial woodlot are income whereas gains on sale of non-commercial woodlots are subject to capital gains tax. United Kingdom Woodland trees are not subject to capital gains, inheritance, or corporation tax on timber sales. However, the sale of the land on which trees are situated would be. A report Bigger, Better Forests by the United Kingdom Policy Exchange Organisation (published in 2019), notes the diseconomies of scale of small woodlots and suggests a policy response of providing small farms with access to larger organisations that can aggregate the woodland resources across many small parcels of land. The report notes that such aggregators are common in Scandinavia, where membership organisations can include tens of thousands of smallholders who supply wood to large sawmills. The report also notes that the United Kingdom currently lacks many of the supply chain attributes needed for such an arrangement, but the aggregator model is a good long-term aspiration. Forestry cooperatives in Sweden, Finland and France Forestry cooperatives have existed in Sweden, Finland and France for a hundred years.

The requirements apply to trusts that have assessable income and do not fall within certain exclusion categories. 1.2 Trustees of such trusts must prepare a statement of profit and loss and a statement of financial position to at least a special-purpose level. These statements, unless otherwise required by the Commissioner, must be included with the annual return for the 2021–22 and later income years. 1.3 Inland Revenue will administer the setting of minimum requirements for these special-purpose financial statements. An Order in Council will mandate to what degree of detail the financial statements should be prepared. 1.4 This issues paper outlines proposals for the minimum requirements for financial statements to be included in the Order in Council. The financial statements may be prepared to any level above the minimum specified by the Order in Council. 1.5 Two similar Orders have been made under section 21C of the TAA: • the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 1 sets out the minimum standards for financial statements of companies, and • the Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Foreign Trusts) Order 2017 2 sets out the minimum standards for financial statements of foreign trusts. 1.6 The Commissioner will require certain trust financial information to be provided using prescribed forms. However, although prescribed forms may summarise financial statements, they do not replace them. The Commissioner will not require financial statements to be included with the prescribed forms, but they may be requested later. 1.7 The December 2020 amendments also require trustees of domestic trusts to make disclosures in their annual returns about information on settlements and distributions as well as appointer details. Inland Revenue is currently consulting on a draft operational statement setting out the Commissioner’s approach to applying the trust information gathering powers contained in section 59BA and section 59BAB of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3 1 Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014. https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2014/0069/latest/whole.html 2 Tax Administration (Financial Statements—Foreign Trusts) Order 2017. https://legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2017/0258/latest/whole.html 3 Inland Revenue. (2021). ED0235: Reporting requirements for domestic trusts. (Draft operational statement). https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/consultations/draft-items/ed0235 6 Summary of proposals Who is affected? 1.8 For the 2021–22 and later income years, these minimum standards apply to trustees of trusts required to comply with the disclosure requirements set out in section 59BA(2) of the TAA. 1.9 These minimum standards also apply to trustees of trusts required to comply with a request made by the Commissioner under section 59BAB. This section allows the Commissioner to require disclosure information from certain trustees for the previous seven years, where such information exists. 1.10 Sections 59BA and 59BAB are reproduced in the appendix. More information on these sections is also available in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 33 No 3 (April 2021). 4 1.11 If a trust does not derive assessable income, it is not required to file a return and the disclosure requirements do not apply. This includes, for example, trusts that own holiday homes and derive no assessable income. If a trust is non-active and an IR633 Non-active trust declaration 5 has been filed with the Commissioner, it will also be excluded from the disclosure rules. Section 59BA(3) lists other trusts that are not required to meet the disclosure requirements. 1.12 Inland Revenue records indicate that approximately 180,000 domestic trusts (excluding estates) report assessable income each year and may be affected to some extent by the new disclosure requirements. However, the financial statement disclosure requirements will primarily affect approximately 55,000 of these domestic trusts. These are trusts that report assessable income to Inland Revenue but do not currently report business income or file any financial statements. Principles for the minimum proposed requirements 1.13 Officials propose minimum standards for financial statements based on the following principles: i. The statements should be based on the double-entry method of recording financial transactions and the principles of accrual accounting. ii. The statements should include a statement of accounting policies and changes. iii. Amounts may be disclosed using tax values, historical cost, or market values at the discretion of the preparer of the statements. iv. The statements should include a reconciliation between the profit or loss in the statement of profit and loss to taxable income and a reconciliation of movements from opening to closing balances, on a line-by-line basis, of all beneficiary accounts. 4 Inland Revenue. (2021). Increased information required in trustees’ annual returns. Tax Information Bulletin. vol 33 (no 3), 5–8. https://www.taxtechnical.ird.govt.nz/tib/volume-33---2021/tib-vol-33-no3 5 Inland Revenue. IR633 Non-active trust declaration. https://www.ird.govt.nz/roles/trusts-and-estates/trusts- and-tax-residency 7 v. Transactions involving associated persons (as defined in subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007) should be included in a schedule unless they are minor and incidental to the activities of the trustee. vi. While disclosure of specific financial items in the annual return is proposed, there is scope for judgement on the level of detail beyond this. vii. There will be a de minimis exception for small trusts if the trustee has not derived annual income in excess of $30,000, or incurred annual expenditure in excess of $30,000, during the income year, and the value of total trust assets did not exceed $2,000,000 within that income year. The de minimis in this proposal only provides partial relief from minimum financial reporting requirements (for example, cash accounting will be acceptable for small trusts). Small trusts will still be required to disclose amounts in any forms prescribed by the Commissioner. How to make a submission 1.14 Submissions are invited on the level of detail suggested for the minimum financial reporting requirements. 1.15 Submissions should be made by 15 November 2021. 1.16 Submissions can be made: • by email to policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz with “Reporting requirements for domestic trusts” in the subject line; or • by post to: Reporting requirements for domestic trusts C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Regulatory Stewardship Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 Wellington 6140 1.17 Submissions may be the result of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, and this may result in their publication. The withholding of particular submissions on the grounds of privacy, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. Submitters who consider any part of their submission should properly be withheld under that Act should clearly indicate this. 8 CHAPTER 2 Proposed financial reporting requirements 2.1 This chapter sets out the proposed minimum financial reporting requirements for financial statements for trusts to comply with their obligations under section 59BA of the TAA. 2.2 Financial statements must be prepared to at least these minimum requirements. They may be prepared to a higher standard or be general-purpose financial statements, provided the required information is included. The proposed minimum requirements Form of financial statements 2.3 The financial statements must consist of: i. a statement of financial position setting out the assets, liabilities, and net assets (equity) of the trust as at the end of the income year, and ii. a profit and loss statement showing income derived, and expenditure incurred, by the trust during the income year. Accounting principles statements must comply with 2.4 The financial statements must be prepared applying the following accounting principles: i. the double-entry method of recording financial transactions, and ii. accrual accounting. Valuations 2.5 The financial statements may disclose amounts using the following valuation principles: i. tax values, when those values are consistent with double-entry and accrual accounting ii. historical cost, when tax values are not consistent with double-entry or accrual accounting or when, in the preparer’s opinion, historical cost provides a better basis of valuation, and iii. market values, when, in the preparer’s opinion, market values provide a better basis of valuation than those in subparagraphs (i) and (ii). Statement of accounting policies 2.6 The financial statements must contain a statement of accounting policies. This must set out, in sufficient detail so the material policies applied or changed can be identified: 9 i. the policies and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements, and ii. a description of the effect of any material changes in those accounting policies since the previous year for which financial statements were prepared. 2.7 The financial statements must disclose whether they have been prepared on a GST- inclusive or GST-exclusive basis. Matters the statements must show 2.8 The financial statements must show the information prescribed in chapter 3. 2.9 The financial statements must disclose comparable figures for the previous income year. How matters must be shown 2.10 Interest and dividends received must be shown in the financial statements grossed up for resident withholding tax. 2.11 Dividends received must be shown in the financial statements grossed up for imputation credits to the extent the dividends are taxable and the credits are available to satisfy the trust’s income tax liability for the income year. Small trusts exempt from some minimum requirements 2.12 Small trusts are exempt from the following minimum requirements: i. applying the principles of accrual accounting (cash accounting will be acceptable for small trusts) ii. providing a statement of accounting policies, and iii. disclosing comparable figures for the previous income year. 2.13 A trust is small for an income year if, for that income year, the trustee has not derived annual income in excess of $30,000, or incurred annual expenditure in excess of $30,000, during the income year, and the total value of trust assets did not exceed $2,000,000 within that income year. Commentary 2.14 The $30,000 income and $30,000 expenditure de minimis thresholds proposed for trustees are consistent with de minimis thresholds in the Tax Administration (Financial Statements) Order 2014 for companies. 2.15 The proposed introduction of an asset threshold reflects the Commissioner’s interest in understanding the use of trusts for wealth accumulation. It will mean that trustees with assets above $2 million will be subject to all of the minimum financial reporting requirements. 2.16 Given that some trusts may move in and out of this disclosure regime (for example, if they did not have assessable income in one year), the proposed asset test will be 10 limited to assets held in the income year for which a disclosure is required rather than applying the test to assets reported in previous income years. 2.17 The de minimis in this proposal only provides partial relief from minimum financial reporting requirements rather than full relief, which will support the integrity of the financial statements required under section 59BA(2)(a) of the TAA. 2.18 According to Inland Revenue estimates based on data provided in 2020 IR10 financial statement summaries, if a $30,000 income and $30,000 expenditure test is introduced for de minimis purposes, 44% of trustees subject to the disclosure rules will qualify for the de minimis. If trustees are also required to hold assets that do not exceed $2 million within that income year, the proportion of trustees that qualify for the de minimis will fall to 38%. Questions for submitters 1. Do you have any comment on the specific items proposed? 2. Should small trusts be partially exempt from these requirements? If so, is exemption from the following requirements appropriate? • The requirement to apply the principles of accrual accounting (cash accounting will be acceptable for small trusts). • The requirement to provide a statement of accounting policies. • The requirement to disclose comparable figures for the previous income year. 3. If there is to be a partial exemption for small trusts, is the proposed $30,000 income and $30,000 expenditure threshold, and the requirement that the value of total trust assets did not exceed $2,000,000 within that income year, appropriate? 11 CHAPTER 3 Proposed information that financial statements must show 3.1 This chapter covers the information a trust must show in its financial statements. The information required will be prescribed in a schedule in the Order in Council. The proposed information required 3.2 The proposed information required i n the schedule covers: • reconciliations • trusts with a particular type of business • items from prescribed forms, and • associated persons transactions. Reconciliations 3.3 A reconciliation of the trust’s financial statements and taxable income for the income year. 3.4 A reconciliation of movements from opening to closing balances, on a line-by-line basis, of all beneficiary accounts, including loans. 3.5 An appropriately detailed, taxation-based, schedule of the trust’s fixed assets and depreciable property. Trusts with a particular type of business 3.6 If the trust is a forester, information about the cost of timber as at the end of the income year and a reconciliation of movements in the cost of timber during the income year. 3.7 If this trust is a specified livestock owner, details of livestock valuation methods, valuations, and calculations for tax purposes. Items from prescribed forms 3.8 All relevant amounts from the trust’s financial statements that must be disclosed in any forms prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3.9 Sufficient notes to support amounts required to be disclosed as an exceptional item on any form prescribed by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue under section 35 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Associated persons transactions 3.10 The information listed for a transaction between the trust and any associated person of the trustee (within the meaning of subpart YB of the Income Tax Act 2007), 12 unless the transaction is minor and incidental to the activities of the trustee. For each disclosed transaction: i. the name of the associated person and a description of the association ii. interest expenses incurred by the trustee for any loan made to the trustee by the associated person iii. amounts paid by the trustee to the associated person in the nature of loans or other advances iv. expenses incurred by the trustee for services provided by the associated person (including wages, salaries, management fees, and payments for other services provided to the trustee) v. expenses incurred by the trustee to the associated person for rentals or leases of land or other assets vi. expenses incurred by the trustee to the associated person for acquiring or using intangible property, including royalty payments, and vii. a reconciliation of movements in trust corpus, trust capital and loans or current accounts to, and from, the beneficiaries or other persons with powers of appointment of the trust and associated persons of the trust. Example A trust would show in its financial statements: • The amounts from the IR10 Financial statements summary form issued by the Commissioner, which generally applies to trusts with business income. • The amounts the Commissioner will prescribe for all trusts subject to the section 59BA provisions (if they are not already provided in an IR10 form). At the time of preparing the issues paper, the proposed amounts are as follows (items not currently recorded in the IR10 form are indicated as being “new”): i. Total accounting profit before tax ii. Tax adjustments to reconcile accounting income with assessable income in tax return iii. Untaxed realised gains iv. Total Assets v. Associated persons financial arrangements (NEW) vi. Shares/Ownership Interests\* vii. Land\* viii. Buildings\* ix. Total Liabilities x. Associated persons financial arrangements (NEW) xi. Total Equity xii. Drawings \[the nature of this item for trusts will be clarified in the operational statement\] xiii. Closing current account balances \[the nature of this item for trusts will be clarified in the operational statement\] \* Trustees will disclose the valuation method adopted for these assets. 13 Commentary 3.11 The information to be shown for reconciliations, particular types of businesses, and associated person transactions are generally consistent with requirements in the minimum standards for financial statements of companies. This will provide consistent reporting across similar types of business structures. 3.12 The three main differences between these proposals and the minimum standards for financial statements for companies are: i. The proposed new requirement to disclose the name of the associated person/description of the association. This is considered necessary for the associated person information to be better understood. ii. The proposed introduction of a minor and incidental test for associated person disclosures. This will reduce trustee compliance costs. iii. The proposed requirement to disclose the reconciliation of movements of beneficiary accounts. This is consistent with the minimum standard for financial statements of foreign trusts and is relevant to understand beneficiary disclosures provided under section 59BA(2)(d). 3.13 For the reference to prescribed forms: i. The Commissioner will not require financial statements to be included with the prescribed forms, but they may be requested later. ii. For trustees with business income, financial statements should include all relevant amounts that must be disclosed in the prescribed form IR10 Financial statements summary. iii. If the trustee has business and non-business assets and liabilities, the IR10 amounts and the amounts in financial statements from 2021–22 should reflect both business and non-business assets and liabilities. iv. The amounts the Commissioner proposes to prescribe for all trustees subject to the section 59BA provisions (if they are not already provided in an IR10 form) will be subject to consultation in the draft operational statement. They have been provided in this document as an example only. The intention is to align these amounts as closely as possible to a subset of amounts contained in the IR10 form in order to be consistent, minimise compliance costs and avoid duplication. Questions for submitters 1. Do you have any comment on the specific items proposed to be included in the schedule? 2. Are there associated persons transactions that should be excluded from the minimum requirements for trustees? If so, why? 15 APPENDIX Tax Administration Act 1994: Sections 59BA and 59BAB Section 59BA Annual returns for trusts (1) A trustee of a trust who derives assessable income for a tax year must file a return for the tax year of all income derived in the corresponding income year by the trustee as trustee of the trust.

Cabinet will need to approve a revenue strategy prior to the Budget, so that it can be incorporated into the Government’s fiscal strategy report. A revenue strategy is a requirement of the Public Finance Act (PFA). It is also an opportunity to set the strategic direction of revenue policy. The revenue strategy helps to inform the development of priorities for the tax policy work programme (TPWP). ...and officials seek your direction on its content The Ministers of Finance and Revenue are meeting with officials on 11 February to discuss the revenue strategy. Officials seek your direction on the broad content of the revenue strategy. This will enable officials to draft a revenue strategy for your consideration. Following your direction on the revenue strategy, officials will provide advice on the TPWP. Officials have proposed key issues to be addressed in the revenue strategy... Officials suggest that the revenue strategy is structured around four parts: • the economic strategy; • the fiscal strategy; • objectives for the revenue system and revenue policy; and • tax policy framework. The revenue strategy should be consistent with the Government’s wider economic and fiscal strategy. Specifying the Government’s objectives is a requirement of the PFA. It is an opportunity to provide clear and coherent objectives to guide policy development. Table 1 sets out the key questions for your feedback. Officials propose that this is used to structure your feedback on the Joint Ministers meeting on 11 February. \[33\] T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 3 TABLE 1: FORMULATING A REVENUE STRATEGY Objective: Formulate the Government’s revenue strategy to set strategic direction, prioritise the tax policy work programme and meet requirements of the Public Finance Act. Economic strategy With an overall goal of wellbeing, we understand that the Government’s areas of focus are: o Responding to COVID-19 o Accelerating the economic recovery o Lay the foundations for a better future Are there specific wellbeing priorities that should inform the revenue strategy? For example: climate change, housing affordability and child poverty. Fiscal strategy The Government’s overall fiscal objectives include stabilising and reducing debt to prudent levels over the medium term. Does the Government wish to signal consideration of raising additional revenue in the longer term? Do you wish to consider revenue- reducing measures in the shorter term to support the recovery? Revenue objectives What are the objectives for tax policy and tax system? Officials recommend framing objectives in terms of: - Raising sufficient revenue - Efficiency - Fairness How specific does the Government want to be in its objectives? The Government could provide further detail on its objectives for revenue, efficiency and fairness. For example, an indication of how the Government views fairness in the tax system. Policy Framework What is the overall strategic framework for tax policy? The principles that have guided the system have been: broad base, low rate; rate alignment; and neutrality. However, the system is not fully meeting these principles and may not be achieving the Government’s objectives. How does the Government respond to pressures on the current framework? Option 1: Keep the framework, focus on ensuring integrity and improving fairness and neutrality. Option 2: More strategic consideration of overall coherence of the system. Consider merits of fundamental reforms, such as “Nordic” dual income tax system. TAX POLICY WORK PROGRAMME Officials will come back with further advice on priorities based on revenue strategy. \[33\] T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 4 Recommended Action We recommend that you: a discuss the content of the revenue strategy with officials (refer to questions in Table 1); b direct officials to provide a draft revenue strategy and advice on the tax policy work programme; c note the following timeline for development of the revenue strategy and TPWP. Milestone Date 1 Joint Ministers meeting on the revenue strategy and TPWP 11 February 2 Joint report to Ministers attaching draft revenue strategy and TPWP Cabinet paper Week beginning 22 February 3 Draft revenue strategy and TPWP Cabinet paper is consulted on and lodged 4 March 4 DEV considers revenue strategy and TPWP paper 10 March 5 Cabinet confirms revenue strategy and TPWP Cabinet paper 15 March 6 Publishing of the Fiscal Strategy report (which includes the revenue strategy) May 2021 Jessica Rowe Acting Manager, The Treasury, Tax Strategy Emma Grigg Policy Director, Inland Revenue, Policy and Strategy T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 5 Tax Policy Report: Formulation of the Government's revenue strategy Purpose of Report 1. Cabinet will need to approve a revenue strategy prior to the Budget. This is an opportunity for the Government to set out it is revenue objectives and principles for the tax system, which will in turn assist with creating a tax policy work programme to give effect to these objectives and principles. This report seeks Ministers’ direction so that officials can draft a revenue strategy. Background on the revenue strategy 2. The main purposes of the revenue strategy are to: a. provide a strategic policy framework so that revenue policy is guided by clear objectives and principles; b. ensure revenue policy is consistent with the Government’s economic and fiscal strategy; c. guide the setting of priorities for the TPWP; and d. communicate the Government’s policy framework and objectives to stakeholders to support transparency, inform private decisions and contribute to stable and predictable economic environment. 3. Formulation of the revenue strategy is part of the strategic phase of the generic tax policy process (GTPP). The GTPP’s strategic phase involves the development of an economic strategy, fiscal strategy and revenue strategy. 1 Following the strategic phase, the tactical phase involves the development of a three-year work programme and an annual resource plan to implement the revenue strategy. Relevant legislation 4. The Public Finance Act (PFA) requires transparency regarding the Government’s revenue strategy and revenue objectives, and these must have regard to the principles of responsible fiscal management. 5. The key requirements in the PFA relating to revenue are the following: a. The Government must set a revenue strategy – the PFA requires the Government to release a fiscal strategy report with the Budget. The report must include “details of the Government’s revenue strategy, including the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy”. b. The Government must set an objective for total Crown revenue – the fiscal strategy report must state the Government’s long-term objectives for total operating revenues, as well as other fiscal variables. c. In formulating the fiscal strategy, the Government must have regard to the principles of responsible fiscal management (set out in full in Appendix 1). The principles include the requirement that, when formulating the revenue strategy, the Government will have regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates. This principle will need to inform Ministers’ decision-making on development of the revenue strategy. 1 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/how-we-develop-tax-policy T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 6 6. The fiscal strategy report must also cover the following matters: a. Explain how the long-term fiscal objectives accord with the principles of responsible fiscal management and state the period for which those long-term objectives relate. b. For the financial year to which the report relates and at least the next two financial years, indicate explicitly, by the use of ranges, ratios, or other means, the Government’s short-term intentions for revenue, and other fiscal variables. c. Include scenario projections. The fiscal strategy report must also contain fiscal projections of trends in the fiscal variables, including revenue. The projections must illustrate, for stated significant assumptions, likely future progress towards achieving the long-term fiscal objectives. 7. The Budget Policy Statement (published no later than 31 March in each financial year) must state any changes to the long-term fiscal objectives or short-term fiscal intentions from those stated in the most recent fiscal strategy report. Process and timeline 8. The revenue strategy is first agreed by Joint Ministers of Finance and Revenue and then taken to Cabinet for approval. The revenue strategy is incorporated into the drafting of the fiscal strategy report, which is a published on Budget day. 9. Officials are working to the following timeline for the development of the Government’s revenue strategy and TPWP: Milestone Date 1 Joint Ministers meeting on the revenue strategy and TPWP 11 Feb 2 Joint report to Ministers attaching draft revenue strategy and TPWP Cabinet paper Week beginning 22 Feb 3 Draft revenue strategy/TPWP Cabinet paper is consulted on and lodged 4 March 4 DEV considers revenue strategy/TPWP paper 10 March 5 Cabinet confirms revenue strategy/TPWP Cabinet paper 15 March 6 Publishing of the Fiscal Strategy report (which includes the Revenue Strategy) May 2021 Scope of the Government’s revenue strategy 10. The scope of the revenue strategy is a matter for the Government. The only legislative requirement is that it must cover the Government’s objectives for tax policy and the tax system. We suggest that the scope include overall Crown revenue, recognising that non-tax sources of revenue are important for the Government’s fiscal and economic objectives (e.g. revenue from the Emissions Trading Scheme). 11. Set out below are four broad parts to be addressed within the strategy: economic strategy; fiscal strategy; objectives for the revenue system and revenue policy; and policy framework. The four parts interact and are intended to flow logically. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 7 12. A final element is setting the TPWP. We have included some preliminary comments on the possible parameters for the TPWP without detailed proposals at this stage, given the need to ensure the TPWP is informed by the revenue strategy. 13. By way of example, a copy of the Government’s 2018 and 2020 revenue strategy is set out in Appendices 2 and 3 2 . Economic strategy 14. The revenue strategy should be consistent with, and contribute to achievement of, the government’s overall economic strategy. 15. The Government’s three broad economic and wellbeing goals are to keep New Zealanders safe from COVID-19, accelerate the economic recovery and lay the foundations for a better future. Wellbeing will continue to be a priority for the Government with a focus on reducing child poverty, tackling climate change and addressing housing affordability. 16. Raising sufficient revenue is important for contributing to the Government’s wider wellbeing goals. This suggests a focus on ensuring longer-term revenue sustainability and avoiding policy measures that would create permanent revenue holes. 17. The tax system can play a role in supporting the economic recovery. • The main way that the tax system can support economic recovery is by maintaining a stable and efficient tax system. This would minimise distortions to investment and employment, and not impede capital and labour being re- allocated to their most productive opportunities in the recovery. • Depending on economic and fiscal conditions, there could also be a role for temporary tax measures to provide greater encouragement for productive business investment and/or broader demand stimulus. • There could also be consideration of whether reforms to the tax system could promote longer-term productivity. 18. Ministers may wish to consider whether the revenue strategy should address specific Government priorities, such as housing, climate change and child poverty as follows: a. Housing affordability – this has been a focus in the last few months for you and there will be ongoing focus on this work in the TPWP. b. Climate change – the Emissions Trading Scheme, which raises Crown revenue, is the primary policy instrument to support the government’s mitigation objectives. The Government may want to signal its objectives in this area, including the potential level and use of the ETS revenue, or the investigation of other environmental taxes. c. Child poverty – a role of the tax system in addressing child poverty could be to raise sufficient revenue to fund government expenditure (including benefits and other transfers) targeted toward Government priorities, including child poverty. It will also be important that the tax and transfer systems are coherent and that they collectively achieve the government’s objectives for equity and efficiency. 19. It will be important to consider whether tax policy is the appropriate instrument for progressing any objective. Taxation is a relatively blunt instrument and cannot always be appropriately targeted. In many cases, government transfers, expenditure or regulatory reform will be more appropriate instruments. 2 The 2018 Revenue Strategy articulates the priorities of the new Government whilst the 2020 Revenue Strategy is the annual refresh of the Revenue Strategy. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 8 Fiscal strategy 20. Given revenue is integral to the wider fiscal strategy, the revenue strategy needs to be consistent with the Government’s overall fiscal strategy. This section sets out the fiscal context and suggests how fiscal strategy is likely to interact with revenue strategy. Further advice on the fiscal strategy will be provided in the coming weeks to support discussions about Budget 2021. 21. The Government’s fiscal strategy is set out in the short-term intentions and long-term objectives published in the Budget Policy Statement. In the short term, the intentions acknowledge that debt will rise, but commits to “reduce deficits over the forecast period as conditions allow”. The long-term fiscal strategy is anchored around the objective to “stabilise net core Crown debt as a percentage of GDP by the mid-2020s and then reduce it as conditions permit (subject to any significant shocks)”. 22. The short-term intention for revenue is to ensure consistency with the operating balance objective. The long-term objective for revenue is to ensure consistency with the debt and operating balance objectives. There is no specific objective to maintain revenue at a certain level or within a certain range. 23. This fiscal strategy can be achieved with a wide range of possible revenue and expenditure paths. Within the HYEFU forecasts, the reduction in OBEGAL deficits is primarily due to the withdrawal of temporary COVID-19 expenditure and tight operating allowances in future budgets. Tax revenue as a share of GDP is expected to remain relatively stable. 24. In the medium-term projections published alongside the Budget Policy Statement, net core Crown debt steadily reduces as a share of GDP. Again, this is supported by restraining expenditure growth as a share of GDP, while tax revenue (by assumption) remains around its historical average as a share of GDP. 25. The fiscal forecasts and projections indicate that the debt objective will be achieved principally through constraining spending growth, low interest rates and economic growth, with a minimal role for increasing revenue as a share of the economy. This approach carries risks, particularly as the intended level of spending constraint may be challenging to achieve given long-run cost pressures, particularly in healthcare. Restraining spending growth may also compromise your broader economic objectives. 26. Given these pressures, you may wish to prepare options for raising revenue in the medium term. This would enable meeting your fiscal objectives while supporting a higher level of public expenditure than currently planned. The potential need for revenue raising initiatives to meet fiscal objectives could be signalled through the revenue strategy, or addressed as part of the TPWP. 27. The macroeconomic outlook remains uncertain. Early signs, particularly labour market data, indicate the economy is recovering faster than forecast, and that the scarring from COVID-19 could be less than expected. A stronger economy could support higher expenditure than currently planned while still meeting fiscal objectives, and without the Economic strategy With an overall goal of wellbeing, we understand that the Government’s areas of focus: o Responding to COVID-19 o Accelerating the economic recovery o Lay the foundations for a better future Are there specific wellbeing priorities that should inform the revenue strategy? T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 9 need for revenue-raising measures. However, it would be prudent to prepare revenue options to support fiscal sustainability in the event of slower growth or higher expenditure requirements than currently forecast. 28. As continued support for the recovery, the “automatic fiscal stabilisers” should generally be allowed to operate over the economic cycle, especially if there are downside shocks. This supports “cushioning” of households and businesses from economic cycles. You may also wish to consider the scope for temporary revenue- reducing measures to help accelerate the economic recovery, depending on economic and fiscal conditions. Longer term, you may want to investigate strengthening the automatic stabilisers to support macroeconomic stability, especially given the constraints on monetary policy. 29. In the short-to-medium term, the TPWP could focus on building the analytical base for a long-term revenue objective. A work programme based on this objective could include analysis of the long-term outlook for government revenue, and how long-term economic and fiscal trends will impact on the government revenue requirements. This work could ensure the Government has a range of tax policy options available to respond to longer-term challenges. Such a work programme could feed into the Treasury’s long-term fiscal statement (to be published in 2021) and Treasury’s and IR’s long-term insights briefings.

Objectives for the revenue system and revenue policy 30. The PFA requires that the revenue strategy state the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy. 31. The Government’s tax principles should be a key part of the revenue strategy. Therefore, the PFA already provides for a process to articulate tax principles. 32. Clear articulation of the outcomes that the Government is seeking from the revenue system serves two main goals: it supports revenue policy development to be coherent and have regard to consistent objectives. 33. Such objectives could be framed in several ways. One option is to articulate core tax policy principles as the over-arching objective, such as “to raise sufficient revenue in an efficient and fair manner”. The Government may wish to provide more detail on how the Government understands these key objectives – sufficient revenue, efficiency and fairness – to provide greater meaning and clarity about the Government’s priorities. Fiscal strategy The Government’s overall fiscal objectives include stabilising and reducing debt to prudent levels over the medium term. Does the Government wish to signal consideration of raising additional revenue in the longer term? Do you wish to consider revenue-reducing measures in the shorter term to support the recovery? \[33\] \[33\] T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 10 Suf ficient revenue 34. The revenue objective should be consistent and coherent with the overall fiscal strategy. As discussed above, this consistency could simply be asserted (implying revenue should be consistent with operating balance and debt objectives) or a more specific objective for the level of revenue could be determined. Efficiency 35. The Government’s efficiency objectives for the tax system could start with the Government’s objective to improve wellbeing of New Zealanders. The tax system’s key contribution to wellbeing is that it raises revenue that is necessary to fund the provision of public goods. Taxes create behavioural distortions – such as by reducing the returns to entrepreneurship, investment or work – that reduce wellbeing. Wellbeing is enhanced when the social benefits of government expenditure exceed the costs of raising revenue. 36. In some cases, taxes can improve efficiency by aligning social and private returns to an activity. This is in situations where there are ‘externalities’. Examples of the use of ‘corrective’ taxes include the R&D tax credit where the social returns to R&D investment are thought to be greater than private returns, due to knowledge spillovers. At present, New Zealand makes relatively limited use of taxation as an instrument for achieving specific policy goals by influencing behaviour. There are profound challenges to using the tax system to influence behaviour, in particular the limits of policymakers’ knowledge about the existence and size of externalities and whether tax policy is the most effective instrument to target the problem. There are fiscal risks as the prevalence of potential externalities could lead to a patchwork of tax incentives and subsidies that is ultimately incompatible with the Government’s revenue and fairness objectives. 37. The tax system can aim to minimise the efficiency costs of raising revenue, subject to achieving the Government’s revenue and fairness goals. It may be useful to articulate in broad terms the principles to achieve efficiency: a. Minimising economic distortions from raising revenue, subject to achieving the Government’s revenue and distributional objectives. b. Neutrality in the tax treatment of different forms of income and investments as a guide to minimising distortions. c. Corrective taxes should only be used where there is clear evidence of an externality, taxation is the most appropriate instrument and fiscal risks can be managed. d. Stable and predictable tax settings, which enables the smoothing of tax rates across time. This supports both microeconomic efficiency and macroeconomic stability by allowing the automatic stabilisers to operate over the economic cycle. 38. As part of efficiency, the revenue strategy could also comment on administrative efficiency, compliance costs, and integrity. In particular, the objective of ensuring taxpayers pay the correct amount of tax with minimal compliance and administrative costs. The strategy may want to comment on the objectives of the Business Transformation programme and any other specific priorities for tax compliance and administration. 39. The soon to be completed Business Transformation programme has put Inland Revenue in a position where it can more easily make policy changes, both through more flexible technology and an agile workforce. We now better understand what these capabilities mean for Inland Revenue, both now and in the future. The Government has invested significantly in this transformation, and a key part of the strategy would be to maximise the benefits of transformation. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 11 40. Given the near completion of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, and the combination of the impacts of COVID-19 and the changing nature of the economic and social environment, it seems an opportunity to leverage the new system and consider impacts to the administration of the tax and transfer system. Ministers may wish officials to consider what opportunities and challenges exist and what changes to the administration of the system Inland Revenue should focus on. This could take the form of a green paper developed through extensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders. Officials propose to discuss this with Ministers separately. Fairness 41. The revenue strategy should comment on the Government’s overall objectives for fairness in the tax system. This will require judgement from Ministers about the desired level of specificity in the revenue strategy. 42. Although fairness matters inherently, fairness can also be related to other aspects of wellbeing. In the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework, fairness is related to social capital through its impact on trust and social cohesion. Trust is important for voluntary compliance with the tax system. 43. There are two standard principles used in tax policy to express fairness: a. Horizontal equity: The principle that people that are in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. b. Vertical equity: The principle that those with higher income, or higher ability to pay, should pay a greater amount of tax. 44. The Government may wish to express its fairness objectives with more specificity. 45. For vertical equity, transfer expenditure (ie, welfare benefits and tax credits) are particularly important for distributional outcomes. Therefore, it would be appropriate to specify any objectives in terms of the overall tax and transfer system. The Government may wish to consider its vertical equity objectives in terms of the following concepts: a. Progressivity – the degree of progressivity of the tax system and how the government defines progressivity; b. Re-distribution – the degree of re-distribution of the tax (and transfer) system. The degree of income re-distribution is a function of both progressivity and the size of taxes and transfers. c. Inequality or poverty – the outcome from the tax system in terms of the distribution of income, wealth or consumption, including measuring the extent to which the tax and transfer system reduces inequality. 46. The objectives may refer to particular bases (eg, income, wealth or consumption), units of focus (eg, individuals, families or families with children) or time periods (eg, annual or lifetime). Measurement can be a significant challenge, owing to the limitations of survey and administrative data. Improving measurement and analysis of distributional issues could be a priority for the TPWP, and officials are focused on a programme to understand whether NZ’s tax system is sufficiently progressive which is the subject of a budget bid. 47. \[33\] \[33\] T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 12 Policy framework 48. Once the broad objectives for the tax system are set, the revenue strategy could articulate the framework, or key principles, that underpin the tax system. This can help to communicate to stakeholders how the tax system will operate and guide policy development. 49. New Zealand’s tax framework has been based around three general principles over the last three decades: a. broad bases and low rates; b. rate alignment across entities and forms of income; and c. neutrality. 50. These principles have been considered desirable to raise revenue in an efficient and coherent manner and to maintain integrity. Distributional objectives were primarily achieved using targeted transfers (main benefits, supplementary assistance and Working for Families tax credits). While the core features of New Zealand’s tax framework have generally remained intact, and broadly been endorsed by various reviews, there has been some erosion of the framework over time, and there has been a lack of reform that could have further broadened tax bases. In other words, New Zealand’s tax settings do not fully adhere to these principles: a. New Zealand’s tax bases are not as broad as they could be, notably with the absence of most capital gains. b. New Zealand’s tax rates are not particularly low. The company tax rate is amongst the highest in the OECD. c. There is no longer rate alignment across forms of income, with different tax rates applying to income in the form of personal income (top rate is 39%), companies (28%), Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) (28%) and trusts (33%). 51. The deviations from the ‘broad base-low rate’/’alignment’/’neutrality’ framework appear to have been driven by the following trends: a. greater concern for progressivity and re-distribution that has created upward pressure on the top personal tax rate; b. global tax competition that has put downward pressure on the company tax rate; Revenue objectives What are the objectives/principles of tax policy and tax system? - Raising revenue - Efficiency - Fairness o Vertical equity: Distributional and progressivity goals o Horizontal equity - Other considerations: social capital and voluntary compliance. How specific does the Government want to be in its objectives? The Government could articulate specific principles of a good tax system, such as about the level of progressivity. \[33\] T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 13 c. concern about household saving that has led to lower effective tax rates on certain saving vehicles (KiwiSaver and PIEs in general); and d. Lack of expert and political consensus about the direction of tax reform and base-broadening reforms. 52. The above issues could point to areas for longer-term consideration of New Zealand’s tax system, including the following questions: a. What are the effects of the non-alignment of tax rates and what should be the strategic policy response? b. Whether there are base broadening reforms that could contribute to improving efficiency and/or fairness? c. Whether New Zealand should make greater use of corrective taxes, such as the development of an environmental tax framework? d. Whether New Zealand’s business tax settings, including the company tax rate, are appropriately set to maximise wellbeing? e. Whether New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of income from saving, including the taxation of saving, is appropriate? i. In particular, the main coherent alternative to a comprehensive income tax approach is the ‘Nordic’ or ‘dual income tax’ approach that taxes labour income at higher rates than capital income. 53. Some of the above issues could be picked up in the TPWP, subject to resource constraints and other priorities. For completeness, it is noted that you can still preserve a broad base low rate framework and advance progressivity where there is non- alignment of rates by bolstering integrity measures. A top tax rate of 39% is still relatively low by world standards, and you can ensure that the 39% top rate sticks by introducing additional taxes at a shareholder level to ensure income earned through companies (at 28%) cannot be used to circumvent desired progressivity. 54. The revenue strategy could express the policy framework by noting the main revenue bases and other key principles of a desirable tax system. The main judgement call required from Ministers is whether you wish to affirm the main features of the current system, or want to signal any directions for change or emphasise any particular objectives. 55. A second judgement concerns the level of detail within the policy framework. In formulating the revenue strategy, there is a trade-off to be made between transparency and flexibility. You might prefer to articulate high-level elements of the system, which will ensure that the revenue strategy provides flexibility when later setting priorities for the TPWP. Conversely, you may wish to more clearly identify priorities from among those noted above, particularly where there is a tension between competing objectives. This will provide stakeholders with greater transparency regarding the potential direction for revenue policy and the subsequent setting of the TPWP, but would limit flexibility going forward as commitments would be more entrenched. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 14 Tax Policy Work Programme 56. The TPWP should be informed by the Government’s revenue strategy. We will subsequently provide you with advice on the TPWP that will make this connection. The preceding discussion highlights potential priorities that you may wish to consider including on the TPWP. 57. Building up the evidence base about the tax system could be a particular focus for the work programme. Ensuring that the tax system raises revenue from those with the ability to pay is a key part of a well-functioning tax system. As part of this, a progressive tax system where people believe everyone is paying their fair share is required to support trust in the tax system and government in general. As part of the TPWP, further work on whether the New Zealand tax system is sufficiently progressive (including both data collection and research) will be undertaken and communicated publicly. This will help to support public faith in the tax system, highlight areas where the current system is unfair and may require change and thus support greater understanding by policymakers and the public about options for future tax reform. 58. Against that background, strategic issues for tax policy include: a. Fiscal sustainability: ensuring the tax system generates sufficient revenue in the context of the Government’s fiscal strategy. b. Accelerating economic recovery: ensuring tax settings support economic recovery and longer-term productivity and wellbeing. If there is limited appetite for revenue-reducing measures to help accelerate the economic recovery, officials suggest this is signalled as part of the TPWP to help manage private sector expectations. c. Integrity and fairness: ensuring the tax system is robust and minimises opportunities for tax avoidance, and helps ensure that personal income is taxed at progressive tax rates, including strategic responses to the non-alignment of tax rates. d. Distributional analysis: understanding the effective progressivity and distributional incidence of the tax and transfer system and how it impacts inequality. e. International integrity: ensuring the international tax settings remain robust to the digitalisation of the economy and multi-national companies pay their fair share of New Zealand tax. f. Environmental frameworks: ensuring the revenue system appropriately supports environmental objectives. g. Housing market: improve understanding of how the tax system affects the housing market, including impacts on housing demand and supply. Policy Framework What is the overall strategic framework for tax policy? The principles that have guided the system have been: broad base, low rate; rate alignment; and neutrality. However, the system is not fully meeting these principles and may not be achieving Government’s objectives. How does the Government respond to pressures on the current framework? Option 1: Keep the framework, focus on ensuring integrity and improving fairness and neutrality. Option 2: More strategic consideration of overall coherence of the system. Consider merits of fundamental reforms, such as “Nordic” dual income tax system. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 15 59. There will be other issues that the TPWP will likely need to be resourced for. These include: a. Maintenance of existing tax bases. b. Reform of tax administration to take advantage of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. c. Other government initiatives – such as implementation of top personal tax rate and any measures targeted at the housing market. d. Supporting other government work programmes – including the welfare system overhaul and consideration of social insurance approaches. Generic tax policy process 60. The development of the revenue strategy is also part of the first phase of the generic tax policy process (GTPP). This phase is known as the ‘strategic phase’. The development of the TPWP is the second ‘tactical’ phase. The tactical phase involves consultation on the development of a work programme, to ensure that stakeholder views on tax policy issues are considered and to promote transparency of government objectives. 61. The later stages of the GTPP are the operational phase (which covers detailed design and also includes a strong consultative component), the legislative phase and the implementation/review phases. 62. New Zealand has had a GTPP since 1994. The purpose of the GTPP is to ensure that we create a tax system that is widely accepted by taxpayers and responds to New Zealand’s changing needs. 63. There will be a need to prioritise matters in the work programme given limited policy resources. We recommend that the Government prioritise and manage these trade-offs within the constructs of the existing generic tax policy process (GTPP). 64. Taxes are complicated and unintended consequences can arise if proposals are not carefully considered. It can be difficult to know about potential inconsistencies or other problems without the benefit of consultation. Submitters are closer to the coalface and will often have better access to information on the size and nature of the problem and how the issues can be solved. This consultative component of policy development allows the private sector to question officials about the reasons for different changes and inform the public about the Government’s intentions in making changes. Even if the private sector do not agree with proposals, they have an interest in making sure any new rules are workable in practice. Their insights in this regard increases the durability of reforms. For submitters, having a better understanding of the Government’s reason for making changes promotes transparency. This is important in getting broad buy in to changes and in limiting lobbying for special concessions. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 16 Appendix 1: Section 26G of the Public Finance Act 2004 Principles of responsible fiscal management (1) The Government must pursue its policy objectives in accordance with the following principles (the principles of responsible fiscal management): (a) reducing total debt to prudent levels so as to provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on the level of total debt in the future by ensuring that, until those levels have been achieved, total operating expenses in each financial year are less than total operating revenues in the same financial year; and (b) once prudent levels of total debt have been achieved, maintaining those levels by ensuring that, on average, over a reasonable period of time, total operating expenses do not exceed total operating revenues; and (c) achieving and maintaining levels of total net worth that provide a buffer against factors that may impact adversely on total net worth in the future; and (d) managing prudently the fiscal risks facing the Government; and (e) when formulating revenue strategy, having regard to efficiency and fairness, including the predictability and stability of tax rates; and (f) when formulating fiscal strategy, having regard to the interaction between fiscal policy and monetary policy; and (g) when formulating fiscal strategy, having regard to its likely impact on present and future generations; and (h) ensuring that the Crown’s resources are managed effectively and efficiently. (2) However, the Government may depart from the principles of responsible fiscal management if— (a) the departure from those principles is temporary; and (b) the Minister, in accordance with this Act, states— (i) the reasons for the departure from those principles; and (ii) the approach the Government intends to take to return to those principles; and (iii) the period of time that the Government expects to take to return to those principles. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 17 Appendix 2: The Government’s 2018 Revenue Strategy This revenue strategy sets outs the Government’s objectives for the tax system and tax policy, in the context of its economic and fiscal strategies. Economic Strategy The Government is committed to improving the well-being and living standards of all New Zealanders through productive, sustainable and inclusive growth. We will focus on lifting productivity and wages, transitioning to a net zero emissions economy, helping our regions thrive, updating and building infrastructure, growing exports, supporting Māori and Pasifika aspirations, and reducing child poverty. We will measure our success in terms of how we protect our environment, improve our skills and health, strengthen our communities and deliver shared prosperity. Fiscal Strategy Underpinning our economic strategy is our commitment to responsible fiscal management within five Budget Responsibility Rules which include ensuring that New Zealand has a progressive taxation system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. We will ensure we raise sufficient revenue to achieve our fiscal objectives of delivering a sustainable operating surplus and ensuring net debt falls to 20 per cent of GDP within five years of taking office. We will do this while maintaining government operating expenditure to within the recent historical range of spending as a ratio of GDP, and prioritising investments to address the long-term financial and sustainability challenges facing New Zealand. Objectives for the tax system The primary function of the tax system is to raise revenue to fund government expenditure, in a way that supports economic and fiscal goals. The Government has established the Tax Working Group to consider what could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system.3 The Group’s Terms of Reference include an exploration of a wide-ranging set of issues that interact with the tax system, such as the changing nature of work and the role of taxes in improving environmental outcomes. After the Group provides its final recommendations in February 2019, the Government will focus on considering its recommendations and making changes that will improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The Government has the following objectives for the tax system: • A system that is efficient, fair, simple, coherent and collects the tax that is due, on time and in full • A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families. • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy • A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP • A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner. Another objective of the Government is to continually improve public confidence in the tax system and Inland Revenue. The system should help people meet their obligations, be fair, and inspire confidence. The Government is committed to raising revenue in ways that meet these objectives. The Government supports a sustainable broad-base low-rate framework for T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 18 the tax system. This helps ensure that taxes are fair and efficient, and that they impede economic growth as little as possible. It also helps keep compliance costs low and minimises opportunities for avoidance and evasion. The Government also believes the interface between the tax and welfare systems should support social policy objectives, including reducing child poverty. The progressive tax and transfer system should be as simple as practicable, easily accessible and understandable, cost-effective, support transitions into employment and empower New Zealanders to make informed decisions. The Government intends to establish a Welfare Expert Advisory Group to consider the fundamentals underpinning the welfare system and how to improve the interactions between welfare and tax systems, including a review of Working for Families payments. The Government believes that the tax system can help in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. The Government will ensure that tax policy development is inclusive, consultative and transparent. This includes making the work programme publicly available, and undertaking regular stakeholder consultation on changes to tax settings. Tax policy priorities The Government’s tax policy priorities under this revenue strategy include: • Considering the recommendations of the Tax Working Group, which is due to report to • Ministers by February 2019, and the Welfare Expert Advisory Group. • Improving public confidence in the tax system and helping people understand that the tax • system can help support wellbeing. • Continuing to update, simplify and improve the integrity of the tax system through Inland • Revenue’s business transformation programme. • Where possible, work in a multilateral way to strengthen the national and global tax system • (such as working with the OECD on base erosion and profit shifting). • Delivering other priorities in the Government’s coalition and confidence and supply • agreements. • Delivering other items from the Government’s tax policy work programme, including: o social policy; o enhancing and maintaining the broad-base, low-rate tax system including ongoing work to improve the integrity of the tax system; o international tax and work to address base erosion and profit shifting; and o business transformation and information sharing. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 19 Appendix 3: The Government’s 2020 Revenue Strategy A fair, balanced and progressive tax system will promote the long-term productivity and sustainability of the economy The primary function of the tax system is to raise revenue to fund government expenditure. It should do this in a way that supports this Government's overall economic and fiscal objectives. Our long-term objectives for the tax system are as follows: • A system that is efficient, fair, simple, coherent and collects the tax that is due, on time and in full. • A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families. • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. • A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure. • A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner. The Government remains committed to these objectives. We support a sustainable broad- base low-rate framework for the tax system. This ensures that taxes are fair and efficient and that they do not impede economic growth. It also helps keep compliance costs low and minimises opportunities for avoidance and evasion. At the same time it is important that people and businesses pay their fair share of tax. This includes multinational companies and those in the digital services field. As part of these efforts the Government will continue to participate in multilateral negotiations, convened by the OECD, on the future of the international tax framework. The Government also aims to continue improving public confidence in the tax system and Inland Revenue. With this in mind the Government will ensure that tax policy development continues to be inclusive, consultative and transparent. We will also continue the modernisation and simplification of New Zealand's tax system through Inland Revenue's Business Transformation programme. The key priority for tax policy at present is to support the COVID-19 response The tax system has a key role to play in supporting the Government’s COVID-19 response and recovery efforts. In the short run the tax system must help to cushion the impact of COVID-19 on the economy. It is critical to ensure that the tax and welfare systems work together appropriately to deliver income support to affected businesses and workers. The Government is also taking policy and administrative measures to increase cashflow and reduce compliance pressures on businesses. Tax policy will help position the economy for recovery by supporting investment and job creation. The Government has already announced business tax changes that will promote investment, reduce compliance costs and support cashflow. These measures include: • The reinstatement of depreciation deductions for commercial and industrial buildings. T2021/85 : Joint Report: Formulation of the Government's Revenue Strategy and Tax Policy Work Program Page 20 • A n increase in the threshold for provisional tax. • An increase in the threshold for writing off low-value assets. • A time-limited discretion for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to remit use of money interest (interest charged on the amount a taxpayer owes) if a taxpayer is unable to pay on time due to the impacts of COVID-19.

You met with officials on 11 February 2021 to provide direction on the Government’s revenue strategy and the setting of the Tax Policy Work Programme (TPWP). Prior to the meeting, officials provided advice on four key issues and content that could be included in the revenue strategy (refer T2021/85; IR 2021/052). 2. This report responds to the direction provided during that meeting and attaches a draft revenue strategy for your review and comment at Appendix 1. This report also provides an update on the progress of the proposed TPWP. Key priorities included in the revenue strategy 3. We understand you were broadly comfortable with our earlier advice, our outline of key issues and the content we recommended be included in the revenue strategy (refer T2021/85; IR 2021/052). You asked officials to prepare a draft revenue strategy that includes references to matters of particular relevance to the Government. We have incorporated those references in the following ways: Economic strategy 4. You asked that the revenue strategy outline the Government’s overarching policy goals for the next three years as stated in the recently published Budget Policy Statement. We have included these goals directly in the draft revenue strategy, with examples showing how revenue policy can contribute to the Government’s goals, including environmental goals, as discussed during the meeting. Revenue objectives 5. You asked that the revenue strategy expand on the Government’s objective of fairness in the tax system. The draft revenue strategy includes the objective of reducing wealth inequality, which is intended to reflect this discussion. Fiscal strategy 6. In response to officials’ advice that the revenue strategy needs to be consistent with the Government’s overall fiscal strategy, the draft revenue strategy describes the fiscal pressures facing New Zealand and notes that the sustainability of the revenue base is critical to managing fiscal pressures over the long term. Framework 7. We have responded to your request that the revenue strategy provide context on how the principles of a broad base-low rate framework and neutrality are reflected in the New Zealand tax system. We have also reflected your request that the revenue strategy indicates a focus on developing a tax system that is progressive, reduces income inequality and that is fit for purpose in a changing world. The draft revenue strategy expressly refers to ongoing work on international taxation and the digital economy. Treasury: 4425638v1 Draft revenue strategy and high-level tax policy work programme for comment Page 4 8. A draft revenue strategy is attached for your review at Appendix 1, and we seek your comments so the revenue strategy can be finalised. Should the Government’s short-term intentions and long-term objectives also be amended? 9. The update of the revenue strategy also provides an opportunity to update the Government’s short-term intentions and long-term objectives for Government revenue. 10. The Public Finance Act 1989 (sections 26J and 26K) requires the Fiscal Strategy Report (FSR) to state the Government’s short-term intentions and long-term objectives for government revenue (as well as other fiscal variables: operating balance, expenses, debt and net worth). The short-term intentions relate to a period of at least two years. The long-term objectives must relate to a period of at least 10 years. 11. The intentions and objectives in the 2020 FSR, carried through to the 2021 Budget Policy Statement (BPS) (as described below as Option 1), could be maintained in the 2021 FSR. 12. We will shortly provide advice on the FSR including whether to amend the Government’s short-term intentions and long-term objectives for Government revenue 13. Officials recommend that the short-term intentions remain unchanged but that the long- term revenue objective be amended with language more consistent with the updated revenue strategy (Option 2). The proposed wording starts with the level of revenue; this is intended to more closely align with the purpose of the requirement (in the Public Finance Act) that the FSR includes a long-term fiscal objective. The proposed wording then notes the Government’s objectives for the tax system relate to fairness, efficiency and progressivity. Short term intention (3 years) Long-term objective (10 years) Option 1: Maintain the same wording as in 2020 FSR and 2021 BPS. Our intention is to ensure revenue is consistent with the operating balance objective. The Government will ensure a progressive taxation system that is fair, balanced and promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy, consistent with the debt and operating balance objectives. Option 2: New wording to be consistent with updated revenue strategy. \[no change\] Our intention is to ensure revenue is consistent with the operating balance objective. The Government will ensure a sustainable level of revenue that is consistent with the debt and operating balance objectives. Revenue will be raised in a fair and efficient manner with a progressive tax system. 14. Whilst officials’ recommend amending the long-term objective for Government revenue, you may want to consider the merits of making this change in the broader context of whether other changes are required in the FSR, and this will also be outlined in later FSR advice to the Minister of Finance. Treasury: 4425638v1 Draft revenue strategy and high-level tax policy work programme for comment Page 5 Tax policy work programme update 15. We have commenced work on outlining a TPWP to reflect the core priorities in the draft revenue strategy. These priorities will be reflected in workstreams that are key priorities of the Government, such as housing, integrity measures to support the new top individual tax rate, along with environmental and international tax considerations. 16. In December 2020 Inland Revenue officials reported to the Minister of Revenue with a high-level overview of the current TPWP priorities for early 2021 (IR2020/517 refers). That report included an appended A3 (attached as Appendix 2) with a high-level overview of current workstreams. We consider that many of these workstreams still reflect Government priorities and should be carried over to the revised TPWP. 17. However, there is a prioritisation exercise that will have to be completed. From a resource allocation perspective, there are a number of key decisions that will have a large impact on the shape of the TPWP. These include: 17.1 17.2 17.3 17.4 18. We will report to Ministers with a recommended draft TPWP once the impact of these measures is known. To the extent these measures are progressed and require policy resources that are not supported by additional funding, decisions will need to be made on whether other items are either slowed down or stopped to accommodate them. 19. Another key consideration is that the TPWP has traditionally included Inland Revenue’s social policy work programme. Although this sits outside of the revenue strategy, this work occupies a considerable percentage of Inland Revenue’s policy and operational capacity. 20. As with previous work programmes, in formulating this draft, we will also consult with stakeholders regarding their key considerations for tax policy. Next steps 21. Officials’ propose meeting with you to discuss the content of the TPWP and the draft revenue strategy before reporting with a final revenue strategy for Cabinet approval. 22. This later report will also seek direction on how you would like the revenue strategy and TPWP to be communicated publically. In prior years, options have included inserting extracts of the revenue strategy in the FSR whilst publishing the complete revenue strategy on the Treasury’s website and the TPWP on Inland Revenue’s website. 23. The timeline below has been proposed to obtain Cabinet approval to the revenue strategy and to coordinate with the drafting of the FSR. To reduce the number of Cabinet papers being considered, we recommend finalising the revenue strategy with you and then appending it to the Budget Cabinet paper, to be approved with that paper. The alternative option is to have a separate revenue strategy Cabinet paper to be considered along a similar timeline. \[33\] Treasury: 4425638v1 Draft revenue strategy and high-level tax policy work programme for comment Page 6 Milestone Date 1 Joint Ministers meeting on the TPWP and revenue strategy if required 11 March 2 Officials provide a final revenue strategy 25 March 3 Cabinet confirms the revenue strategy as an appendix to the Budget Cabinet paper. Early April 4 Publishing of the Fiscal Strategy Report (FSR) (which includes the revenue strategy) May 24. As outlined in paragraph 15-20, the TPWP will not be able to be finalised until decisions have been made around key government priorities. Officials plan to report to you in late March or early April with a draft TPWP and Cabinet paper for noting by Cabinet. Precise timelines regarding proposed Cabinet dates and a timeline for publishing the TPWP will be canvassed in this later TPWP report.

Jessica Rowe Manager (Acting) Emma Grigg Policy Director, Inland Revenue, Policy and Strategy Hon Grant Robertson Minister of Finance Hon David Parker Minister of Revenue Treasury: 4425638v1 Draft revenue strategy and high-level tax policy work programme for comment Page 8 APPENDIX 2: DRAFT – NOT GOVERNMENT POLICY Draft Revenue Strategy 2021 – for comment Economic and fiscal strategy The public finances, including government revenue, are important for wellbeing. Public policy supports New Zealanders’ wellbeing when the social benefits of government expenditure outweigh the social costs of raising revenue. The Government’s overarching policy goals for the next three years are: • Continuing to keep New Zealand safe from COVID-19; • Accelerating the recovery and rebuild from the impacts of COVID-19; and • Laying the foundations for the future, including addressing key issues such as our climate change response, housing affordability and child poverty. Government revenue underpins many of these outcomes by funding the social expenditure needed to meet these challenges. In some cases, revenue policy has a more direct role in contributing to these goals. This includes policies that support the economic recovery, promote housing affordability and mitigate climate change. Government revenue needs to be sufficient to ensure a sustainable fiscal outlook. The level of revenue will be maintained to be consistent with reducing operating deficits and stabilising net core Crown debt as a percentage of GDP by the mid-2020s and then reducing it as conditions permit (subject to any significant shocks). A sustainable revenue base is critical for managing fiscal pressures over the long term. These pressures relate to the ageing population, health care costs, infrastructure demand and the need for resilience to climate change and other shocks. There is also rising global concern with inequality and many countries, including New Zealand, face the challenge of fostering inclusive growth. Revenue objectives The Government’s revenue policy objective is to raise sufficient revenue in a fair and efficient manner. This will assist in fostering inclusive growth. The Government’s fairness objectives for the tax system are: • Progressivity: Individuals with a higher income, and therefore ability to pay, should pay a greater proportion of their income in tax. • Reducing inequality: the tax system should help in limiting excessive wealth inequality over the longer term. • Horizontal equity: The principle that people that are in the same position should pay the same amount of tax. The efficiency objective is to minimise the economic costs of raising revenue, subject to the Government’s revenue and fairness objectives. Continued public trust and confidence in the tax system and its administration is important. This supports voluntary compliance and broader social capital. Treasury: 4425638v1 Draft revenue strategy and high-level tax policy work programme for comment Page 9 Framework The Government has a strong focus on the fairness of the tax system. This means that the income tax system should be progressive and, in combination with transfers, reduces income inequality. The Government has increased the progressivity of the personal income tax system with a new top tax rate. The tax framework is based on the principles of broad base-low rate and neutrality. Income and consumption tax bases are broad in the sense that there are few specific concessions for particular economic activities, goods or services. This enables tax rates to be set lower than otherwise. Neutrality in the tax treatment of different investments promotes economic efficiency and productivity. However, in another sense, New Zealand’s revenue base is narrow, due to the inconsistent taxation of capital income. In some cases, revenue policy will be used to influence behaviour. This is appropriate only where there is clear evidence of net social benefits, tax policy is the most appropriate instrument and fiscal risks can be managed. As an example, the research and development tax incentive promotes business innovation. People and businesses must pay their fair share of tax, including multinational companies. The international tax framework needs to adapt to shifts in the global economy, including increased cross-border activity and digitalisation. New Zealand is continuing to work with the OECD to find a multilateral solution to the challenges that the digital economy poses for international taxation. Tax settings will continue to be broadly stable and predictable. This supports efficiency and macroeconomic stability. The Government expects Inland Revenue to maintain public confidence by administering the tax system in a fair and efficient manner. The tax system has been modernised and simplified through Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The tax system must remain fit for purpose in a changing world. Ongoing work will focus on implementing Government policy, maintaining the integrity of existing revenue bases and monitoring the sustainability and fairness of the tax system. The Generic Tax Policy Process shall be used to develop and consult on tax policy where practicable. Appendix 3: TPWP priorities for early 2021 \[33\]
