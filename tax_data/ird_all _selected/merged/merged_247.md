SUBMISSION TO THE T AX WORKING GROUP ON THE F UTURE OF TAX: SUBMISSIONS BACKGROUND PAPER Sam Warburton Economist and Research Fellow The New Zealand Initiative About the author I am an economist with fourteen years’ experience in various policy roles, all with significant economic and regulatory impact analysis components. I was employed in the Ministry of Transport’s Funding and Infrastructure team for four years until August 2017, which included dealing with tax and expenditure policy. I have advised on three Government Policy Statements (GPS) on land transport: GPS 2015, the draft GPS 2018 for the then National-led Government, and the draft GPS 2018 for the now Labour-led Government. This year, I will be producing a report under The New Zealand Initiative banner on the problems with current transport funding (tax), planning and expenditure policies. This will be followed by a report on how to reform the sector. During my studies, I was awarded the New Zealand Association of Economists & Treasury Scholarship, and all of Victoria University’s prizes for economics and public policy at the time, including the School of Economics and Finance Prize in Economics, the Jan Whitwell Prize for Monetary and Macroeconomics, and the Civil Service Institute Prize in Public Policy and Public Administration. Disclaimer This submission is mine. Views expressed are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of The New Zealand Initiative, its staff, advisors, members, directors or officers. Structure of this submission This submission discusses the criteria which taxes should be assessed against, and then applies those criteria to transport taxes. My submission has the following chapters: 1. Tax criteria 2. Transport taxes in the Tax Working Group’s Background Paper 2 3. Things everyone involved in transport funding should understand 4. An assessment of transport taxes 5. Efficiency 6. The inequitable impact of fuel taxes, particularly on poor people 7. Transparency My general position Tax criteria Efficiency and equity should be the focus of analysis. The other four proposed criteria four criteria are either components of efficiency and equity or an overall constraint. Focussing on these four risks not capturing other factors that are also important. The Tax Working Group (TWG) should be careful to properly structure its criteria. If it doesn’t the TWG risks, double-counting some benefits or costs and missing other benefits and costs. Fuel taxes The Background Paper cites a couple of issues around transport taxes. One is revenue integrity. The Background Paper correctly notes that this isn’t a particularly urgent issue. The Background Paper does not note much bigger and very urgent problems, in particular, the extraordinary burden fuel taxes place on the poor. Fuel taxes are grossly regressive. Fuel taxes over-tax poor regions and subsidise rich regions. Within regions, Māori, the unemployed and sole parents are among those who are over-taxed and subsidising others. Fuel taxes should be replaced by congestion and road pricing. 3 1. T AX CRITERIA 1. The Background Paper lists six criteria: • Efficiency • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal adequacy • Compliance and administration costs • Coherence and then focusses on the first two of these. 2. There is a reason efficiency and equity should be the focus and that is because the other four criteria are either components of efficiency and equity or an overall constraint. They are not so much separate issues that can be traded-off against (overall) efficiency or equity. 3. The TWG should be careful to properly structure its criteria. If it doesn’t the TWG risks, double-counting some benefits or costs and missing other benefits and costs. 1.1. E FFICIENCY AND EQUITY 4. Efficiency and equity are well, and succinctly defined. I reproduce them here as I reference them in my consideration of the other criteria later: Efficiency: Taxes should be efficient and impose as little cost on society as possible. By this it is meant that taxes should be imposed in a way to maximise national welfare, by not creating biases between different investments or activities, unless there are sound reasons to believe that there are wider social costs that these taxes are addressing. Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. This involves both horizontal equity (fair treatment of those in similar circumstances) and vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax). 4 1.2. R EVENUE INTEGRITY 5. The Background Document says that revenue integrity means: The tax system should minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage and provide a sustainable revenue base for the government. 6. This goes to both efficiency and fairness. It is not ‘horizontally equitable’ 1 if some people can avoid tax and others cannot. It is not efficient if some people can avoid tax nor when that avoidance creates that potential for ‘biases between different investments or activities’ 2 . 7. Imagine, as an example, two taxes with exactly the same overall impact on efficiency. The first is income taxes which, let’s assume for the purposes of illustration, reduce labour supply (with an associated deadweight loss) but are hard to avoid. The second is company tax which, let’s assume, has no impact on labour supply but is easy to avoid. 8. In this example, both taxes have the same overall impact on efficiency, but labour taxes would be favoured because company tax gets marked negatively for avoidance. Avoidance (revenue integrity) is one part of overall efficiency and should be treated as such. Avoidance should not be treated as something to be traded-off against efficiency, only against other things that affect efficiency such as the impact on labour supply. 9. That economic models should be able to estimate the impacts of both reduced labour supply and tax avoidance in dollar values only strengthens the case that all factors that affect overall efficiency should be treated equally, or at least identified and properly accounted for. 10. That said, a tax system may be so full of holes that people lose faith in it. If there is to be a ‘integrity’ criteria it shouldn’t be about minimising avoidance as that is captured by efficiency, but by a constraint in the analysis that the overall system be reasonable enough that people have confidence in it. This should, however, be captured under the ‘coherence’ constraint. 1.3. F ISCAL ADEQUACY 11. Fiscal adequacy is the overall constraint. Left-leaning governments generally want more tax revenue. Right-leaning, less. 1 See definition of equity. 2 See definition of efficiency. 5 12. The Chair of the TWG appears to have acknowledged that fiscal adequacy is a constraint rather than something by which to assess the merits of particular taxes when he said 3 : Implicit in our terms of reference is the notion that whatever the package - or packages - of proposals that we come up with they will be roughly fiscally neutral. The one caveat I would add personally to that is that they must be capable of sustaining somewhat higher levels of spending if that is considered necessary or desirable by future governments and their electors. 13. While it’s possible to say things like ‘congestion charging will fix congestion but not raise enough money to pay for all our desired transport infrastructure’, pointing to ‘fiscal adequacy’ gets us nowhere except saying we’ll also need other taxes/charges to pay for infrastructure. 14. Congestion charges are to reduce the externality that is congestion. That’s the problem it solves. 15. Negatively viewing congestion charging because it doesn’t raise enough money to pay for all infrastructure would be wrong. A properly-designed tax system (see chapters 2 to 7) would have congestion taxes to solve the externality and infrastructure charges (road pricing, public transport fares) to pay for infrastructure. 16. Both congestion charges and infrastructure charges could well be assessed as both efficient and fair, and satisfy the fiscal adequacy constraint, without inaccurately placing a greater value on infrastructure charges over congestion charges in the analysis. 1.4. C OMPLIANCE AND ADMINISTRATION COSTS 17. Compliance and administration costs are also a component of efficiency. 18. Same as with revenue integrity, two taxes that are equally efficient overall should not be treated differently just because one has higher compliance and administration costs while the other, for example, reduces labour supply more. The only justification for this might be an equity/fairness/social reason to, but this should then be explicit in the equity and fairness criterion. 3 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-spch-2018-03-02-purpose-principles- possibilities.pdf 6 1.5. C OHERENCE 19. Somewhat ironically, the coherence criterion says we should be careful about looking at anything ‘in isolation’ after previously listing three criteria that should not have been isolated. 20. There’s nothing wrong with worrying about coherence but it is, like fiscal adequacy, a constraint rather than a criterion. One tax that solves one problem, while opening up other problems in other taxes may not be efficient. 21. Taxes, like any other policy mix addressing other policy problems, can only be efficient and equitable together and individually if they are coherent. 22. But if two taxes are in conflict, how do you decide which one to pursue? The one that is most efficient and equitable, of course. 23. Coherence is really just a constraint. A check to do regularly throughout the analysis to make sure you’re counting all impacts of taxes on each other when assessing efficiency and equity. 1.6. O THER RECENT WORK WHERE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MISUSED 24. You don’t have to go far to see where adding too many primary criteria leads to disastrous analysis. The Ministry of Transport included so many criteria in its analysis 4 of regional fuel taxes – revenue integrity, equity, compliance costs, and coherence as well as environmental sustainability and speed of implementation – that it forgot to include economic efficiency. 25. The inclusion of compliance costs criterion and the absence of an overall economic efficiency criterion led the Ministry to conclude that road tolls (a user pays tax/charge) was economically worse than any other way of paying for transport such as general tax, rates and fuel taxes. 1.7. O THER CRITERIA 26. The TWG is certainly going to receive submissions about other criteria, e.g. environmental harm. 27. These will have as much justification for singling out as the revenue integrity and compliance costs criteria. They should not be elevated to the level of overall efficiency and equity, but will be components of one or other. 4 https://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/About/Documents/Regional-Fuel-Tax-RIS.pdf 7 1.8. R ECOMMENDAITONS 28. I recommend that the TWG puts efficiency and equity as the top two criteria, with every other aspect of tax listed under one or both of those. 8 2. T RANSPORT TAXES IN THE TWG’S BACKGROUND PAPER 30. The Background Paper makes only small references to transport taxes. Here are those mentions in their entirety: Technological advancements in transport may affect the traditional base of fuel excise duty as vehicles become more fuel efficient. \[p.12 in a section about technological change\] The definition of “environmental” is also broad: as an example, in some cases the tax revenue on petrol excise taxes is ring-fenced to be used to build roads. Nevertheless petrol taxes are included in the list of environmental taxes because they are environmentally related. \[p.49 in a section about environmental outcomes\] Existing tax incentives include accelerated deductions of forestry capital costs (for example, planting or tending costs), accelerated deductions for some types of environmental expenditures, and the exemption of electric vehicles (EVs) from road user charges until EVs make up 2% of the national fleet. \[p.50 in the same section about environmental outcomes\] 31. These sections, I gather, are just to give people a taste of the kinds of issues and complexities in our tax system. 32. Revenue integrity (“...may affect the traditional base of fuel excise duty...”) is the biggest issue the Ministry of Transport is concerned about because that’s what agencies do: care about their budgets. 33. The focus on these issues suggest there aren’t bigger issues. There are. 34. While increasing numbers of hybrid vehicles over time will make it increasingly difficult to maintain current transport taxes, there are enough current problems with transport taxes to completely reform the way we gather transport revenue now. 9 3. T HINGS EVERYONE INVOLVED IN TRANSPORT POLICY SHOULD UNDERSTAND 35. This chapter sets out how transport is currently funded (from a variety of taxes), and how it should be funded according to criteria of efficiency and equity. 3.1. C URRENT TRANSPORT FUNDING ARRANGEMENTS 36. The National Land Transport Fund (NLTF) is made up of revenue from: • fuel excise duty – currently 59.524 cents per litre • road user charges – varies by vehicle weight and configuration; for example, a light diesel vehicle (3.5 tonnes or less) pays $62 per 1,000 kms, while an 8-axle truck pays at least $333 per 1,000 kms • motor vehicle registration – a fixed annual fee per vehicle. 37. A regional fuel tax of 10 cents a litre would increase the per litre charge on petrol to 69.524 cents (and to about 79.524 cents with the proposed national fuel tax increase), and introduce a per litre charge on diesel of 10 cents. 38. There has been some suggestion – from the Taxpayers’ Union, from Judith Collins, even recently from the Ministry of Transport – that fuel excise duty and road user charges should only be spent on roads or things that benefit drivers. 39. This view is mistaken. 40. Apart from state highway maintenance and improvements, most all other transport expenditure from the National Land Transport Fund is matched close to 1 to 1 from rates including local road maintenance and improvements, public transport (which is about half funded from users), and walking and cycling. 41. Many ratepayers drive very little, or not at all. 42. A commitment to only spend road taxes on roads would commit ratepayers to only spend their contribution on roads. This would be a massive subsidy to road users. 43. While motorists might pay for some projects they don’t benefit from (e.g. a driver in Southland paying for public transport in Wellington), ratepayers might pay for projects they don’t benefit from (e.g. people who walk to work in Wellington paying for roads people use to drive to work in Wellington). 10 44. Governments have to be mindful of this balance when deciding how to set taxes, rates and public transport fares and in divvying-up expenditure. 3.2. H OW TRANSPORT FUNDING SHOULD WORK 45. Instead of everyone paying a bit towards projects they don’t really want, people should pay for the projects they do want. User pays 46. Motorists should pay for roads. Public transport users for public transport. Walkers and cyclists – well, it’d be hard to get them to pay, so funding for that will likely always come from rates. These charges would also vary by region, or local authority, so that, for example, people in Canterbury where it is cheaper to put in transport, don’t subsidise people in Wellington where it is more expensive. This is a user-pays approach. For roads, it is known as ‘road pricing’. Congestion pricing 47. Instead of motorists subsiding public transport for the congestion relief benefits, there should be congestion charges. The problem with public transport subsidies from motorists is that they have to be paid to everyone who uses public transport, even the ones who would always use public transport even if they were paying the full price. 48. Consider an example of lowering public transport fares to encourage people off the roads and onto trains and buses. Because you can’t tell who’s newly off the road and who was already using public transport, you must lower fares for all users. You will succeed in getting some additional people off the road, but it’ll cost you in terms of paying everyone who uses public transport, not just the additional people. 49. Congestion pricing – an extra charge on road users if they want to travel at peak/congested times – encourages people to take public transport or travel at a different time of day. It gets the same behaviour change, but at a much lower cost. Further, the revenue from the congestion charge can be used in any number of ways including: • compensating low-income people for the higher cost of travel if they have to keep driving, or the inconvenience of changing modes or travelling at a different time of day • providing more public transport, walking and cycling, or roads 11 • lower public transport fares or road taxes • anything else. Social provision of transport 50. What then of public transport for social welfare reasons / providing choice to those who have little choice or limited means? 51. As above, the revenue from congestion charging can be recycled to leave the poor no worse off (or even the rich no worse off if you wish). 52. Other than that, transport social welfare should be provided by the Crown as other social welfare programmes like subsidised health and education are. We have a progressive income tax and social welfare system that taxes the rich a bit more in order to support the poor. 53. It is inappropriate to use fuel taxes – a regressive tax; one that is paid disproportionately by the poor – to provide social welfare transport to the poor. 54. Nor is it appropriate to tax a subset of society – motorists – to pay for social welfare transport. 55. Motorists should pay for their costs of transport. New Zealand society should pay, and the rich among society a bit more, for social welfare transport. Overall 56. While people can legitimately favour fuel taxes or rates depending on their preferences and concern for different ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ from each and the weight they place on efficiency and equity, the approach outlined above of congestion pricing, road pricing, and Crown funding for social welfare reasons is as close as any policy gets to an ‘everybody wins’ solution. 12 3.3. H OW TRANSPORT FINANCING CURRENTLY WORKS 57. While less directly related to the issue of taxes, it’s also important to understand the role financing plays in transport. Central Government 58. Road taxes are ring-fenced (also known as ‘hypothecated’) for land transport expenditure. Funding ranges for different types of expenditure – public transport, state highway improvements – are set in the Government Policy Statement on land transport. Taxes are set by regulation. 59. Being largely outside of the normal Budget process, there is less scrutiny of taxes and expenditure. The Ministry of Transport advises Ministers, but it’s not in the context of competing uses of tax revenue from other Votes and the process attracts little interest from Treasury. 60. Because of the lack of scrutiny and to protect against overly political decision-making, transport is funded on a pay-as-you-go basis – capital expenditure is paid for when it is undertaken by today’s motorists and ratepayers, not over the lifetime of the asset as businesses or households might normally do (such as with home loans). 5 61. Lots of expenditure is planned in the next few years, particularly in Auckland, that will last decades and lifetimes. Burdening today’s road tax and ratepayers with all of that cost rather than spreading the cost over the lifetime of the asset is both inefficient and inequitable. It’s a high price we pay because we can’t trust politicians to make good investments. Local government 62. While councils do usually finance transport investment through borrowing, Auckland council is currently targeting a self-imposed limit on borrowing of 270% of operating revenue beyond which, the Council says, credit agencies would downgrade Auckland Council from its AA rating. 63. Transferring – as a regional fuel tax does – the burden from Councils to ratepayers and motorists, of course, doesn’t really reduce the risk of higher borrowing costs to Auckland as a 5 There are a handful of exceptions with some projects financing through borrowing from the Crown or public- private partnerships (PPPs). 13 whole – it just transfers it from the Council to households, many of whom with house prices where they are, will have borrowing of 1,000% of income. 3.4. H OW TRANSPORT FINANCING SHOULD WORK 64. Capital expenditure on transport should be paid off by all who use it, not just today’s motorists and ratepayers. 65. This could be achieved through an overhaul of transport planning – reducing the potential of political decision-making and increasing the chance that transport investments accurately reflect what users want. 66. If we are to change the way we gather transport revenue, we should also look to change the way we allocate that revenue so that we can further improve the operation of transport taxes and the transport planning system as a whole. 14 4. A N ASSESSMENT OF TRANSPORT TAXES 67. There’s a common claim that fuel excise duty is a highly-efficient tax in that its administration costs are low and that it doesn’t distort the market too much. 68. I test that claim in chapters 5, 6, and 7, and assess FED against the objectives of efficiency and equity. I also make special mention of how FED stacks up against transparency (being a component of efficiency). I find that FED is about as efficient as RUC in terms of administration costs and deadweight losses, and performs far worse on equity and transparency. 15 5. E FFICIENCY 5.1. A DMINISTRATION COSTS 69. It is true that FED costs little in administration costs. FED is collected at the point of import or from domestic refineries, rather than a charge individuals process. According to the Ministry of Transport, administration costs are about 0.10% of revenue 6 . 70. This compares to administration costs for current 0.76% for current volumes of light RUC. 7 71. Administration costs are not, however, the only component of efficiency. Taxes result in distortions and deadweight loss. 5.2. D ISTORTIONS AND DEADWEIGHT LOSS 72. The cost of taxes is typically described in terms of deadweight loss. Taxes increase the costs of goods and services, reducing the amount that consumers are willing and able to buy. In general, this creates a deadweight loss – a reduction in benefit to consumers and producers over and above the revenue generated. 73. The situation is a bit different if a Government is simply cost-recovering a product it provides through a user-charge. If a tax/charge perfectly matched the cost of the good or service the Government provided, there would be no deadweight loss – the tax would be similar to a business charging a customer. 74. Treasury, in its cost-benefit analysis guidelines, says FED is one of these cost-recovery charges with no deadweight loss: Note that some ‘taxes’ (such as the fuel excise duty) are calculated to reflect the value of an externality or the resource cost of providing government goods or services and therefore function like market prices; in such cases the deadweight cost is zero. 6 Ministry spreadsheet: ‘tax efficiency model - Final\_for Sam Warburton’ This excludes the compliance costs for the tax payer. The Ministry assumes that this is equal to the administration cost, but I have excluded it from the calculations for this sub-chapter. This includes revenue raised for ACC. 7 My estimate. Assumes collection costs are in proportion to share of revenue relative to heavy RUC, and heavy RUC accounts for all refunds. 16 75. In a report comparing current and potential sources of revenue, the Ministry of Transport wrote that 8 : FED is relatively efficient in terms of deadweight impact on economic output because demand for petrol is relatively insensitive to the level of FED. 76. The Ministry did not comment on whether or not there are deadweight losses from road user charges. 77. The Treasury’s position is incorrect, and the Ministry’s is incomplete. They both overstate the relative efficiency of FED as a source of revenue. 78. The costs of maintaining any stretch of road varies with the weight and configuration of vehicles, the kilometres travelled by those vehicles, and factors that don’t vary by vehicle like topography and weather. 79. The costs of maintaining any stretch of road does not vary by how much fuel a vehicle uses. By charging some vehicles more per kilometre because of higher fuel consumption and some vehicles less per kilometre, FED over- and under-taxes (subsidises) people. Contrary to Treasury, taxing some to subsidise others generates a deadweight loss through the under- or over- use of roads, respectively. 80. In the illustration below 9 , two drivers with the same demand for driving. The first driver has a vehicle that is 30% less fuel efficient than average. The second has a vehicle that is 30% more fuel efficient than average. If each were taxed only for their use of roads, their per kilometre costs are marked by the solid lines, with no deadweight loss. Taxing drivers by their fuel consumption raises the per kilometre cost for the less fuel-efficient vehicle, and acts as a subsidy for the high fuel efficient vehicle. The deadweight loss is indicated by the grey-shaded areas. 8 http://www.transport.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Our-Work/Documents/ff-assessment-of-revenue-tools.pdf, p25 9 The illustration is to scale. The long-run elasticity of demand for petrol is -0.3. The fuel cost of running an average fuel efficiency vehicle is $0.17 per km. 17 Figure 1: Illustration the effects of over- and under-taxation 5.3. F UEL EXCISE DUTY AND ROAD USER CHARGES MAY BE SIMILARLY EFFICIENT 81. While the deadweight loss is not large for an individual, it is not zero. If RUC has higher administration costs and FED has greater deadweight loss, there is a question about which is more efficient. 82. I estimate that switching all petrol passenger vehicles (including hybrids) would cost about $15.7 million per annum in collection costs and between $4.5 million and $8.9 million in compliance (time) costs associated with purchasing RUC. Including commercial vehicles, motorbikes and heavy petrol would increase compliance costs. 83. Total costs are between $20.1 million and $24.6 million, and lower than a similar analysis by the Ministry of Transport which estimated costs at about twice that. The Ministry’s analysis split current RUC administration costs equally between heavy and light RUC, assumed compliance costs were equal to administration costs, and scaled up to be the relative amount FED revenue. We apportioned current RUC administration costs in proportion to the amount of light and heavy RUC revenue, assumed compliance costs involved between one and two 18 purchases per year 10 . The $20.1 million to $24.6 million estimate will over-estimate costs if there are economies of scale from more vehicles using RUC. 84. Against this, there would be some relatively small savings from disestablishing the FED system. The Ministry had figures of $1.5 million in administration costs and an equal amount in costs to fuel companies and importers. I’m not sure what the source of these figures are. We counted cost savings from disestablishing the FED refund system costing $1.0 million per year 11 , and compliance costs to fuel companies, importers and refund applicants of $1.5 million as per the Ministry’s assumptions 12 . There is a small, but unknown and uncounted, cost to Customs of collecting FED. 85. Using the simple partial-equilibrium method illustrated in Figure 1, I estimated the deadweight loss from FED from light private passenger vehicles to be between $5.3 million and $6.6 million per annum. Demand was modelled with a long-run elasticity of demand of - 0.3 and a constant elasticity of demand function. 86. The deadweight loss will be an underestimate in at least two ways. First, because it excludes commercial vehicles, motorbikes and heavy petrol vehicles which make up 6.2% of petrol vehicle kilometres travelled. Second, because it only estimates costs from people driving less or driving more than they would with a per kilometre tax. Over- and under-taxation changes not just how much people drive but what vehicles they might purchase, whether it’s low income people buying a smaller vehicle than they would otherwise or a hobbyist putting off buying a vintage car. 87. The taxation of off-road petrol use (e.g. agricultural quad bikes, boats, lawnmowers) also causes a deadweight loss. The Ministry of Transport estimates 13 that between 4.7% and 5.7% of petrol is used off-road generating between $88 million and $107 million in revenue. About $59 million of that is refunded 14 , leaving between 1.6% and 2.6% of petrol use facing a price of about $1.88 per litre 15 rather than the tax-free rate of $1.29. If the elasticity of demand is the same as for on-road vehicles (-0.3), the deadweight loss is between $1.6 million and $2.7 10 Three minutes per transaction at an average hourly wage rate of $28.14. 11 The 2016/17 NZTA annual report (p.92) records a cost of $1.2 million. I’ve rounded this down to $1.0 million as the annual report says the $1.2 million includes some temporary costs to get through a backlog of refund applications. 12 It is also a reasonable match to the cost of operating the refund system. If the costs of processing refunds is similar to the cost of applying for refunds, $1.5 million seems a reasonable estimate included 13 Annual vehicle fleet statistics, tab 1.9. 14 Ministry of Transport’s revenue model. 15 Unweighted average petrol price for 2016 from MBIE’s weekly monitoring. 19 million. If the elasticity of demand is higher, as might be the case given that many off-road uses are recreational, the deadweight loss will be higher. For example, an elasticity of demand of -1.0 results in a deadweight loss of between $5.9 million and $9.7 million. 88. Table 1 summarises the costs and benefits if light private passenger vehicles were switched from FED to RUC. Table 1: Estimated impact 16 of switching FED to RUC for light passenger vehicles Impact Low estimateHigh estimateNotes Costs Collection costs $15.7m $15.7m Possible over-estimate Compliance costs $4.5m$8.9m Under-estimate Total $20.1m $24.6m Benefits (costs avoided) Refund system $1.0m$1.0m Compliance costs $1.5m$1.5m Deadweight loss – drivers $5.3m$6.6m Under-estimate Deadweight loss – off-road -0.3 elasticity $1.6m$2.7m Probable under-estimate -1.0 elasticity $5.9m$9.7m Total -0.3 elasticity $9.4m $11.8m -1.0 elasticity $13.7m $18.8m 5.4. C ONCLUSION 89. While FED has a big advantage over RUC in administration costs, deadweight loss closes the gap considerably. A more precise set of estimates that included the impact on other petrol vehicles and a broader calculation of the distortion and deadweight loss from FED might see a conclusion that FED and RUC are, more-or-less, equally efficient ways of raising revenue. 16 Totals may not sum due to rounding. 20 6. T HE INEQUITABLE IMPACT OF FUEL TAXES, PARTICULARLY ON POOR PEOPLE 6.1. T HE IMPORTANCE OF FAIRNESS 90. Efficiency isn’t the only objective people care about in tax or any other policy. 91. If efficiency was the overwhelming objective of tax, the inelasticity of fuel purchases to price changes would see fuel used not just as a way of raising revenue for transport purposes, but for Government spending generally. This is the approach taken in a number of other countries 17 and in New Zealand before the National Land Transport Fund was ring-fenced in 2008. 92. Economist Matt Rognlie set out the problem with focussing overly on efficiency: When designing a tax system, the deadweight loss isn’t the only relevant consideration. To see why, let’s consider a silly example. Imagine a tax with the lowest deadweight loss imaginable: a tax on breathing, levied at a rate of $10 every day that you take a breath. The demand elasticity here is exactly zero—no one (I hope) is going to stop breathing for an entire day just to avoid paying the tax. This is a wonderfully efficient tax: it has zero deadweight loss. In fact, this is effectively a lump-sum tax, a tax demanded equally of every individual. Since lump-sum taxes are a perfectly efficient way to collect money, anyone thinking about how to minimize deadweight loss will always raise revenue exclusively through lump-sum taxes. But this is a cheat: obviously we don’t observe lump-sum taxes in practice, even though at the margin it would be possible to implement them. (If the government demanded that everyone coughed up an additional $50, almost everyone could manage to do it.) The reason why the government doesn’t do this, of course, is distributional: we care about the poor, and it wouldn’t be fair to ask them to pay exactly the same dollar amount as the rich. This is important for even the most 17 Reference needed? 21 conservative fiscal policy proposals—many of them suggest flat taxes, but never a regressive lump sum. 6.2. T HREE TYPES OF INEQUITY A general inequity 93. Operators of light (cars, vans, utes) diesel vehicles all pay the same tax of 6.2 cents per kilometre. The amount that operators of light petrol vehicles pay depends on the vehicle’s fuel efficiency, which varies widely. Figure 2 shows the distribution of under- and over-taxation for light petrol vehicles. 94. That many people can pay 25% less tax and others 50% more per kilometre is inequitable. Figure 2: Under- and over-taxation of fuel excise duty for light petrol vehicles Fuel tax versus rates 95. It’s possible to argue that a fuel taxes are fairer than other sources like property rates if people who drive more pay more for the maintenance and improvement of roads. It’s possible to argue that rates are fairer than fuel taxes if rates raise more revenue from richer households than poorer households. 96. What people consider is fair depends on the extent of, and how much they weight, each of those aspects. Unfortunately, there isn’t, as far as I’m aware, analysis of the burdens of rates on different parts of society with regard to transport. This makes it very difficult for 22 Parliament and society to decide the best course of action yet, but should be a focus for the TWG. The burden of fuel taxes falls disproportionately on the poor 97. It is not possible to argue that a fuel taxes are fair when they charge poor people with less fuel-efficient cars more than rich people with more fuel-efficient cars. 6.3. P OOR RURAL AREAS SUBSIDE RICH URBAN AREAS 98. According to my analysis of data supplied by the NZ Transport Agency and the Ministry of Transport, poor rural regions subsidise a handful of rich cities. 99. Figure 3 shows the average fuel excise duty paid per kilometre compared to a vehicle with the national-average fuel efficiency. That is, vehicles with average fuel efficiency pays no more or less tax than the average vehicle, while those with higher/lower fuel efficiency pay less/more tax. Figure 3: Under- and over-taxation of fuel excise duty by territorial authority 23 100. Wellington city is the most undertaxed territorial authority, paying 5.7% less tax per kilometre than the national average Wairoa is the most over-taxed paying, 9.3% more tax per kilometre than the national average. 101. Only 12 territorial authorities are undertaxed. The twelve can be characterised as relatively affluent cities with more transport choices (such as public transport should people not wish to pay higher fuel taxes). 102. Fifty-five of the 67 territorial authorities are over-taxed and are relatively low-income. Low - income areas of New Zealand are subsidising high-income areas. 103. Table 2 lists the 12 under-taxed territorial authorities, their level of under-taxation and their household incomes. Table 2 also lists the 12 most over-taxed territorial authorities. Table 2: Dozen most under- and over-taxed territorial authorities Twelve under-taxed Twelve most over-taxed Territorial authority Tax Income Territorial authority Tax Income Wellington -5.7% +42.8% Wairoa +9.3% -33.5% Auckland -2.3% +19.9% Mackenzie +9.1% -13.6% Kapiti Coast -1.6% -16.3% Ruapehu +8.3% -30.4% Lower Hutt -1.4% +8.9% Southland +8.1% 0.0% Porirua -1.3% +23.7% Kaikōura +7.4% -22.1% Upper Hutt -1.1% +7.2% Gore +7.0% -14.6% Christchurch -1.0% +2.4% Waimate +6.8% -24.6% Hamilton -0.6% +0.3% Hurunui +6.3% -11.6% Palmerston North -0.4% -8.3% Kaipara +6.3% -33.5% Tauranga -0.3% -12.5% Clutha +6.2% -12.7% Dunedin -0.1% -14.7% Central Otago +6.2% -14.1% Nelson -0.0% -14.9% Ōpōtiki +6.1% -36.8% 104. The territorial authority data shows that fuel excise duty is regressive: lower-income people pay more tax per kilometre. But territorial authority data also hides wide differences within territorial authorities. 24 6.4. P OORER, AND MORE AT-RISK HOUSEHOLDS, ARE OVER-TAXED AND SUBSIDISE RICHER HOUSEHOLDS 105. Within regions, Māori, the unemployed and sole parents are among those who are over-taxed and subsidising others. This accords with what we would expect: those on lower-incomes 18 cannot afford more fuel-efficient vehicles 19 , and those with bigger families need bigger, less fuel-efficient vehicles. 106. Figure 4 shows who pays the most and least tax per kilometre by family type, ethnicity, and employment status. 20 The first table suppresses results where there are fewer than 30 households (below which you would be concerned about data reliability). The second table relaxes the suppression to fewer than 10 households. The additional results in the second table will not be statistically sound, but are consistent with other results and what we would expect. 107. Families with at least one Māori person pay, on average, 14% more tax than the average New Zealand Household. Households with at least one unemployed person and at least one child pay 6% more. Sole parents pay 5% more. 18 Ministry of Transport survey data about incomes was not good enough to use, but being Māori, unemployed and a sole parent are all correlated with low income. 19 Note that there will be additional hidden costs here. Those on low incomes have a greater incentive to buy vehicles that are smaller (and more fuel-efficient) than they would otherwise prefer. Despite, low income households’ vehicles are, on average, less fuel efficient than the national average. 20 Where an ethnicity is recorded as any ethnicity other than European, that household has at least one person of that ethnicity. For example, a Māori household has at least one Māori person, while a European household consists of only European people. With regards to employment status, a person who was both a student and employed was recorded as a student. A person receiving a benefit and employed was recorded under ‘other benefit’ rather than employed. Employed, therefore, refers to employed people who are also not a student or receiving welfare support. 25 Figure 4: Under- and over- taxation by household type 26 6.5. THESE INEQUITIES ARE NOT SMALL 108. That Māori pay 14% more might not seem like a big deal to some, but even this hides burdens on different households. Figure 5 shows the distribution of under- and over-taxation among Māori families. Figure 5: Under- and over-taxation of Māori households 109. 55% of vehicles owned by Māori households, are overtaxed compared to 39% for New Zealand as a whole. 110. 30% of vehicles owned by Māori households are overtaxed by 25% or more, compared to 16% for New Zealand. 111. 11% of vehicles owned by Māori households are overtaxed by 50% or more, compared to 6% for New Zealand. 6.6. THE OVER-TAXATION ADDS UP TO CONSIDERABLE AMOUNTS 112. Taxing vehicles by the litres they consume rather than the kilometres they’ve driven creates wide differences in tax paid, with the 10% lowest fuel efficiency vehicles paying between 110% and 135% more tax per kilometre than the 10% highest fuel efficiency vehicles. 113. Table 3 shows the difference in the current tax paid between the vehicles with the most and least fuel efficiency assuming they travel the national-average 10,500 kms per annum. The last 27 column, for example, compares the 20% most fuel-efficient vehicles with the 20% least-fuel efficient vehicles. Table 3: Differences in current tax paid per annum by operators of light petrol vehicles All types of light petrol vehicle (household, taxis, hire vehicles, goods, other) 5% 10% 20% Highest fuel efficiency $305 to $315 $330 to $340 $355 to $360 Lowest fuel efficiency $765 to $870 $720 to $785 $670 to $700 Difference per vehicle $ $450 to $565 $385 to $455 $310 to $345 % +145% to +185% +115% to +135% +85% to +100% Household light petrol vehicles only 5% 10% 20% Highest fuel efficiency $310 to $315 $330 to $340 $355 to $365 Lowest fuel efficiency $770 to $870 $720 to $780 $665 to $700 Difference per vehicle $ $450 to $560 $380 to $445 $305 to $345 % +140% to +180% +110% to +135% +85% to +95% Difference per household $735 to $915 $625 to $730 $500 to $560 114. The average household pays $950 in fuel excise duty per annum ($580 per vehicle 21 ). 115. Owners of low fuel efficiency vehicles subsidise owners of high fuel efficiency vehicles. Households with vehicles among the 10% lowest fuel efficiency pay between $1,385 and $1,490 tax per annum. Households with vehicles among the 10% highest fuel efficiency only pay between $645 and $660 per annum. 116. As earlier, Māori, the unemployed and sole parents are over-represented among households with low fuel efficiency vehicles. 117. For the average household in Kawerau with a household income of $37,300 per annum, the extra $500 per year some of them are overtaxed amounts is a lot. 6.7. THE BURDEN ON THE POOR WILL INCREASE WITH HIGHER FUEL TAXES 118. The last National-led Government increased fuel excise duty by 17 cents per litre between July 2009 and July 2015. I estimate this increased annual tax on a 10% most fuel-efficient vehicle 21 New Zealand households own an average of 1.64 vehicles for household use. 28 by $115 and $120, compared to $235 to $250 for a 10% least fuel-efficient vehicle (nominal figures). 119. The current Labour-led Government intends to increase nation-wide fuel excise duty by about 10 cents over the first three years of a ten-year period. I estimate that this will increase the annual tax on a 10% most fuel-efficient vehicle by about $70, compared to between $140 and $150 for a 10% least fuel-efficient vehicle. 120. For Auckland, where the intention is to have a regional fuel tax of a further 10 cents a litre, I estimate that this will increase the annual tax on a 10% most fuel-efficient vehicle by between $135 and $140, compared to between $260 and $275 for a 10% least fuel-efficient vehicle. Table 4: Increases in tax 2009 to 2018 and beyond All light petrol vehicles 5% 10% 20% National-led Government 2009 to 2015 Highest fuel efficiency $110 to $110 $115 to $120 $125 to $125 Lowest fuel efficiency $250 to $280 $235 to $250 $220 to $225 Labour-led Government intentions for 2018 onwards Other than Auckland Highest fuel efficiency $65 to $70 $70 to $70 $75 to $75 Lowest fuel efficiency $145 to $165 $140 to $150 $130 to $135 Auckland (including regional fuel tax) Highest fuel efficiency $125 to $130 $135 to $140 $145 to $145 Lowest fuel efficiency $275 to $305 $260 to $275 $245 to $250 121. In Auckland, the average household will pay about $320 more in nation-wide and regional fuel taxes per annum than it does today (from $930 to $1,250). 122. For a household with vehicles that are among the least 10% fuel efficient, the additional tax will be between $440 and $470 per annum, with disproportionately more of these households being Māori, unemployed, and sole parents. 6.8. RECOMMENDATIONS 123. Fuel taxes are inequitable and grossly regressive. They should be replaced at the earliest possible opportunity with congestion pricing and road pricing – approaches to transport funding that are as close to an ‘everyone wins’ policy as it gets. 29 124. If congestion and road pricing are more than a few years away, we need to think about moving from fuel taxes to road user charges and/or compensating poor households. 30 7. TRANSPARENCY 125. In 2015, the Ministry of Transport completed a project looking at a variety of current and potential transport taxes/charges. Here’s what it wrote about the advantages of fuel taxes: 126. Perhaps inadvertently, the Ministry cited that advantage again in its regulatory impact statement on regional fuel taxes (page 16): 127. The only people who benefit from not knowing how much tax they’re paying and whether expenditure plans warrant those levels of taxes are people who don’t care and Governments and their agencies that would rather that those people who do care, don’t notice. 128. This is a remarkable, striking admission and not in keeping with requirements for government to be open and transparent. 129. Transparency is also required so that people can judge for themselves whether taxes are fair and whether the tax is justified (whether the resulting expenditure is worth it). 31 Final remarks 130. The Background Paper cites a couple of issues around transport taxes. One is revenue integrity. The Background Paper correctly notes that this isn’t a particularly urgent issue. 131. The Background Paper does not note much bigger and very urgent problems, in particular, the extraordinary burden fuel taxes place on the poor. This has been going on for decades and must be remedied as quickly as possible 132. Fuel taxes should be replaced by congestion and road pricing. 133. Thank you for your consideration of my submission. I look forward to contributing further as the review continues.

The tax  should be so high as to radically harm the economy in the short term and force  industry to adapt in the long term. All revenue from the tax should be  redistributed via a universal basic income to partially shelter citizens from the  harmful effects on the market.  ●Increase in company tax where profits are paid to non residents and removal of  company tax where profits are paid to New Zealand residents. Profits paid to  non-residents should be charged at the same rate as the highest New Zealand  income tax bracket.  ●Increase in top tax rate by the amount of now removed company tax (to a total of  61%, assuming top tax rate remains the same).  ●Introduce an inheritance and gift tax on cash and capital received over some large  threshold.  ●Introduce a financial transaction tax.  ●Ensure that the tax system remains simple with few exemptions      “If you want to knock Bolshevistic notions and revolutionary socialistic notions out of men,  you give them a stake in the country - something to lose, something to take a pride in” - Bill  Massey   \[1\] 2 Fairness    Tax should have two purposes. The first is to pay for the necessary functions of  government. The second is to redistribute income from richer to poorer. The second  purpose is necessary due to the way capital accumulates. As an individual’s profits  increase, so too can their investments, resulting in capital accumulating in fewer and  fewer hands, as evidenced by the growing wealth inequality in New Zealand. Profits  created by workers are kept by owners and rent seekers, who add little value to what is  produced and risk only the wealth that was collected in a similarly unfair way.    This is not a call to a planned economy. The free market provides freedoms that are  sorely missed when taken away (but are also enjoyed most by the well off). The ability  for any person to start a new business can be liberating and allows innovation to thrive.  Profit seeking individuals are a integral mechanism of the invisible hand that makes  resource allocation and distribution so efficient (when all externalities are priced in).  Freedom of economic activity is a freedom like any other.    The reason I bring up these points is because tax should be the main mechanism which  tames the free market, allowing freedom and innovation whilst ensuring fairness. As an  individual’s wealth increases, so too does the illegitimacy of their right to it. The Tax  Working Group has been asked to keep the level of tax revenue as a proportion of GDP  consistent, but I don’t think that should be the case. As an individual’s level of profits  increase, the government should tax that income at higher and higher rates. If the  government runs out of things to spend the revenue on, the income should be  transferred directly to citizens equally. The younger generation in New Zealand is  becoming more and more despondent about their ability to ‘get ahead’. Houses which  were an affordable investment for the older generation are now out of reach of most.  Resentment is increasing and New Zealand will soon have to resolve the unfairness of  the free market via increased tax revenues.    Climate Change    3 Climate change is by the far the most important issue in the world. It is a major threat to  world economy and the human species as a whole. Extreme weather conditions can lead  to famine which correlates strongly with armed conflict. Large amounts of valuable land  is under threat of going underwater which will lead to millions of migrants worldwide.  New Zealand, although a small greenhouse gas emitter by world standards, emits a large  amount for our population. We should take the initiative to be a world leader like we  have in the past to mobilise our economy towards this challenge like we did in the two  world wars.    The current emissions trading scheme has been criticised for being ineffective. The  omission of agriculture in the scheme has no sound reasoning and is the result of  political cowardice. The scheme could be salvaged by radically increasing the cost of a  carbon unit. This still leaves the problem of businesses buying dodgy credits from  overseas. A simpler option would be to replace the ETS with a simple carbon tax levied  on producers and importers. Whatever option is chosen, the price of carbon should  increase so heavily that consumers notice the effects when buying consumer goods. Well  meaning people (of which there are many) have no way of telling what goods have a  high carbon cost associated with them. I have seen people at the supermarket comparing  similar food packets to see how far the food has travelled as a measure of carbon  emissions. This is a tragic state of affairs considering that due to differences in food  production, it is sometimes the less carbon intensive method to ship goods  internationally than produce them locally. The consumer shouldn’t need to think about  things on such a level. Market mechanisms can be utilised to ensure that high carbon  goods are prohibitively expensive. This also gives people the freedom to decide that some  high carbon goods are worth paying for. If the price of carbon is high enough, the  efficiency of profit seeking businesses will create new technologies and innovations that  will far exceed the goodwill of a supermarket shopper. Businesses and consumers both  need to feel the pain of a carbon price in order to make decisions in the market which  lead to a low carbon economy.    A high carbon price will not be popular politically. If the cost of goods increases  significantly (as it should) then the brunt of the hardship will be paid for by the poor who  already cannot afford it. As such, all of the revenues collected from a carbon tax should  4 be redistributed to people evenly. The carbon tax then would then provide for a  universal basic income, which has its own benefits. Consumers will still not be as well off  as they were before, due to the great deadweight loss a high carbon price would cause.  This will need to be sold to the public as the price of becoming a carbon neutral nation,  and as important a cause as mobilising for war.    Capital gains tax    Capital gains are the main source of many people’s wealth. If income from wages is  taxed, it is fair that the profits made from capital gains are also taxed. Capital gains are  even more important to tax, as they are a major source of the growing income equality  between generations and classes in New Zealand. Capital gains should be taxed on  disposal of the asset, as a component of the individual’s income tax. There should be no  exemption for the family home. A family home is an investment like anything else, and  should be taxed accordingly. This becomes even more true as the proportion of long  term renters in New Zealand increases.    Inheritance and gift tax    In an ideal world, economic benefits would be allocated by merit and not by luck. That is  not the case when one person can be born with an inheritance to some amount of wealth  and one person will not. Having this advantage can pay dividends later in life and is one  reason why Pakeha have a much higher rate of home ownership than other ethnic  groups. An inheritance and gift tax would partially fix this injustice. Those who did  nothing to earn wealth except be born to the right family do not deserve it. Inheritance  or large gifts should be treated similarly. If someone inherits a non-liquid asset such as a  house or a farm, then inheritance tax should only be paid when the asset is sold (which  could be many years later).    Many people want the opportunity to provide for their children when they die. This is a  completely reasonable wish, and can be respected by setting the threshold before  inheritance tax applies to a large value. The purpose of the tax should be to stop capital  from being passed from generation to generation, where only the original generation  5 actually did anything to acquire the capital. Because people who inherit huge amounts of  wealth have done literally nothing to deserve it, it should be taxed at a rate as high as  possible before tax evasion or capital flight results in diminishing returns. I leave  calculating what that rate should be as a cost benefit analysis exercise for the poor  government bureaucrat reading this.    Company tax    Company tax should be abolished for profits which go to New Zealand residents and stay  the same or increase when profits go overseas.    When a company is wholly owned by New Zealand residents, it makes little difference  whether the company is taxed 28% or the profit which the residents receive as income is  taxed at 28% + their regular tax rate. One case where it does make a difference is when  the owner of the business has very little income. This could be relevant to a low income  person with some Kiwisaver investments. By abolishing company tax and instead  increasing the top income tax bracket by the same amount, small investors on low  incomes can get a leg up.    Where profits are sent overseas, they should be taxed as high as we can get away with  without causing a large amount of capital flight. Some capital flight would probably be  acceptable to many Kiwis, who resent foreigners buying property in New Zealand. This is  another example where fairness gives way to cost benefit analysis      Financial transactions tax    A small tax on financial transactions will stop resources being wasted on trying to  predict minute movements of markets. This sort of trading has little economic value to  anyone and should not have a foothold in New Zealand      Tax exemptions  6   A fair tax system should be easy to understand and the current tax system does that  pretty well. It is sometimes argued that fruits and vegetables should be exempted from  GST. If people are too poor to afford fruits and vegetables then that is a problem itself  that should be addressed. It is better to give a direct cash transfer to those who need it  and let them decide what to spend it on than to make many exemptions and loopholes in  the tax system.  It is common for small business owners to put assets into family trusts to give the  appearance of low income and make their children eligible for things like the student  allowance. This is a loophole which should be fixed.    Tax to affect behaviour    The government is in the unique position in that they can change the price of certain  goods to affect people’s behaviour. Tobacco tax revenue is much higher than the cost to  the health system in order to dissuade people from smoking. Tax incentives /  disincentives should be created when the government has the mandate to do so, as they  are the only ones with the power to do so, but they should be very careful that they don’t  overstep their boundaries. They should only disincentive behaviour when the public  overwhelmingly supports it. The current levels of tobacco tax are testing that limit.  When there is only a simple majority and not an overwhelming majority of people in  support of the government intervening to affect behaviour, then the government should  refrain from doing so in order to respect people’s freedom to live life the way they want.

Dear Sirs, Thank you for allowing the opportunity to add my comments and ideas to the dialogue around taxation reforms. I apologise for leaving this until the last possible moment! I have read through your briefing documents and official statistics with great interest. I have been a student of Economics since my High School and University days in the 1970s. At one point I studied under Sir Frank Holmes, who was later attached to Sir Robert Muldoon’s economic ‘Think Tank’. As a result I have looked at NZ through an Economist’s eyes ever since that time. Politically I am a left-leaning person, who believes in ‘More Government’ involvement because with Laissez-Faire management no-one protects the weak and vulnerable in Society. I remember vividly from 1988 & 1989 that David Lange was already pointing out that it was already clear that no ‘trickle down’ benefits were ever going to be felt in his constituency of Mangere. In fact there have been widespread undesirable outcomes, although these seem to have taken years to be recognised. I have four grown-up children, all born here in Auckland. The oldest one got married two months ago, and bought a residential property in Wellington with his partner last year. My chief incentive for writing this brief submission is that I desire that my other children should one day be able to afford to do the same thing, and then they should be free to elect to raise a family if that is their wish (I fervently hope so...).. We have lived under ‘Rogernomics’ in a free-market economy for more than 30 years now. Whilst the overall thrust of its economic reforms has been a healthy thing for the country, it must be apparent that a LOT of New Zealanders have fallen by the wayside due to no ‘trickle-down effect’ ever materialising for their benefit. As I see it comfortably more than 60% of the population are worse off now. I also share the general concern for how the working population can possibly shoulder the costs of an aging workforce in 20 to 30 years’ time. I am extremely grateful and appreciative for this Government’s change of economic emphasis. At last we have a coherent and strong voice for the people, and you have a mandate to correct some of the unwanted results of a lack of humanism in Governance. I note your comment in your guidelines for submissions (page 12, paragraph 6) that- “Over time it is likely that a focus on capital income taxation will be increasingly important in ensuring that the tax system is as fair and efficient as possible”. I was also very impressed with the clarity of your section on “Concern about Inequality” on page 17. These are the two points that I am aiming to cover in my submission. \[1\] 2 The need for Capital Gains Taxation. I agree that our present taxation regime through Individual Income Tax, Company Income Tax, and GST really is an admirably clean and simple one. However there are a lot of investors from both New Zealand and overseas who are avoiding tax liability for income they derive here. My best friend from my High School days has retired to Australia after a successful career in Commercial property investment. He moves in circles of a lot of other Kiwis in Sydney, who have retained residential investment properties here in NZ. He related to me 4 years ago their collective surprise at being taxed on Capital Gains made on NZ properties, by the Australian Government. When they have queried this they are apparently told (in his words):- - “The NZ Government may be stupid enough to neglect to levy you taxation against your NZ Real Estate speculation, but we are not. You have derived substantial income from your Property investments, and you will pay some tax (15%) here on that income earned”. Since this type of speculation is now very strongly established and obvious for all to see, it does need to be addressed in your taxation reforms. Back in 2006 I went along to a property investment seminar run by an organisation called ‘Richmastery’. I only went along just to see how they presented it to potential investors. I wasn’t disappointed. Three points are particularly vivid in my memory:- - “Let us show you how to become obscenely rich, faster than you ever dreamed possible!” - “This isn’t Tax Evasion, this is legal Tax Avoidance.” - “Anyone who isn’t doing this is either stupid or lazy.” The next day I took it upon myself to write to the then Labour Government a detailed letter on the subject. The thrust of my suggestions to Government was that NZers are far too wed to the concept of Property Speculation, at the expense of more productive long-term investments in the NZ Economy. (Let’s face it, Real Estate speculation is unproductive, in the overall scheme of things – why is it so often defended?). I have no actual objection to people buying and selling property for a living, but if it is deliberately done as a staple form of personal income then it MUST be taxed. I need to know that such investors are paying a share of tax, like the rest of us do through PAYE. In writing to the Government I pleaded for consideration of some form of Capital Gains Tax. The response I got in the mail was highly dismissive. I have it here somewhere. As I recall it I was told:- - “Mr Campin, this issue is far more complex than you make it sound”. - “Furthermore there is no evidence that a Capital Gains Tax works”. I contemplated replying with a one-line letter asking “Do you mean that Governments do not actually derive any taxation income from Capital Gains Taxes?”, however I decided this was a pointless exercise (I am sorry to say that my conclusion – rightly or wrongly – was that my letter clearly hadn’t reached anyone with both intelligence and a neutral political ideology...). In my opinion our tax system is highly favourable to residential property speculation. It seems that every Accountant and every Lawyer makes it their first investment recommendation to new clients. At one point I went to rent a home in Auckland’s Green Bay and I found myself about to sign a rental agreement with the head of the IRD here in Auckland. I recognised the distinctive spelling of his name from letters and statements I had received from the IRD here in Auckland. 3 Stopping overseas property speculators activity in NZ. Successive Governments seem to fail to grasp the fact that they have been elected by NZ Citizens and Residents, as the voters in NZ. And as I frequently need to remind people in my age group, we are all care-taking NZ for the benefit of our children, and their children. We owe nothing to overseas speculators who dabble in our market and push up the value of NZ property so that it becomes unaffordable for Kiwi families, and thus ruins Kiwis lives. I note that we still have no way of actually knowing how much NZ residential property is now owned overseas. As a matter of fact the actual number of houses involved is not the critical thing. What is critical is that until the recent regulatory changes there were overseas buyers present over the phone at virtually every property auction in Auckland. Therefore in virtually every case they pushed the prices realised up. I don’t believe that there is any reasonable argument for allowing unchecked foreign ownership of NZ property. As I said above, I’d like to think that all four of my children will one day have a realistic chance of buying their own home in NZ. Flow-on effects of rampanyt house-price inflation. I lost a nephew to suicide in 2016, and in our subsequent grief we have worked out with his partner that his major distress was caused by the seemingly insurmountable debt he had shouldered just three weeks earlier in signing up for a substantial mortgage on his first home. In in my opinion, the unhealthy preoccupation with property investment (and the resultant sky-rocketing house prices) is driving up crime rates as well as youth suicides, and lowering birth rates, and leading to depression and other health concerns. It evens leads to poor educational outcomes due parents being too busy or too stressed to take time to guide and assist their children in the basics. When you have to find $650 to $700 every week just to pay your rent, how can you possibly give your kids a pleasant and relaxed home life? Taxation and other reforms are urgently needed. We need:- - Capital Gains Taxation on all speculative property investment. I am very anxious over how hesitant this Labour Government is over the issue. We are relying on you to make this happen. Please remember that if it doesn’t apply to the Family Home, then it only affects people with two or more residential properties. I believe that this is less than one-third of the NZ population. (You can afford to dismiss their cries of outrage, as the majority of them are going to be National or Act voters!). - In fairness to the rest of the working population, I believe that for taxation reasons the Government need to have complete visibility into Property Trusts, so that the IRD knows who owns residential properties, and how many they own. - We also need to permanently and absolutely stop overseas investors from speculating in our real estate market. This should include residential, commercial, industrial and farm land. We know for instance that there are 1.5 billion people in China who would love to own a little bit of NZ. We need you to protect us from this onslaught, please. - We all know that the retirement age has to be pushed out, progressively, first to 66 and then to 67. I’ll be 61 in June, and I am ready and prepared to work until I turn 68. 4 Please don’t shy away from this common-sense inevitability, through lack of courage.....? On a further note whenever the subject of a Capital Gains Tax crops up in the media, the Government needs to be able to remind everyone that it is not going to be taxed at 33% or even the 28% rate. I’m guessing that it will only be 15 or 20 per cent? If an investor sells one of his / her properties at $350,000 profit after 5 years ownership, why shouldn’t he / she pay some tax on that income? As wage and salary earners we pay tax at the full rate on every dollar we earn..... I note the point you have made in your guidelines (page 6, paragraph 2) that “the 10% of households with the highest incomes pay around 35% of all income tax”. This sounds very honourable and fair, on the face of it. Can you tell us what actual percentage of total NZ household incomes they derive? If the figure is 50%, then they aren’t actually paying their share.....? When you have stated (Page 6, paragraph 4):- “the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income”. I have to ask: - Are we somehow factoring in wealth held in property trusts, or is that an ‘unknown’? That’s all I have time to write, unfortunately. It’s 5:06am on the 30 th of April. My contact details are below. I am happy to be contacted if that should be required for any reason. I wish you good success with your Tax reforms inquiry, and I sincerely hope that you get a very wide and therefore representative cross-section of opinions. Thank you & best regards, Steve Campin. \[1\]
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document September 2018 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Stuart Gowers Su mmary Income inequality – can’t be considered by Working Group as not in remit. Pity. Housing Prices – no tax relieve on mortgage payments for non-resident owners Capital Gains Tax – Yes, definitely. Land tax - No GST Exemptions – Fruit and vegetables exempt. Health/Behaviour - Sugar Tax - Yes Retirement savings - OK with Kiwisaver. Company Tax - Progressive tax OK Share dividends - remove imputation so holders taxed at their normal tax rate. Charities - Manufacturing companies should be taxed Environment - presumably we are going to get a carbon tax. General Congratulations to the authors on a well written and comprehensive background paper. In general, I would think a person's net income for the year should be taxed - which would mean no ring fencing. However, I am not opposed to ring fencing capital gains/losses. Also as a general principle, I think that income that has been worked for should be taxed less than income that has not been worked for. And that within both earned and unearned income there should be different rates depending on circumstances and purposes. I don’t see why mere possession of an asset should be taxed, but any profit made from that asset should be. So no Land Tax as such, but income from land rent should be taxed and CGT paid on sale. Income inequality Personal tax and rates are outwith the terms of reference, so the rest of this section is irrelevant to the Working Group. It should not be that some people can be better off not working than by working – in particular, the ones who can least afford to have children being better off by having more children, if that does actually happen. A minimum wage is one aspect, but lower tax rates is another – so lower (or no tax) rates at low incomes, with lower rates going up to higher levels of income. \[1\] To compensate to some extent, at the other end of the spectrum, income above $250k should be taxed at a higher rate - perhaps 40% above $250k and at 50% above $500k. (I’m sure I remember when Jimmy Saville first got a £1,000,000 contract with the BBC, the rate of Super Tax in UK was up to 95% - but that seems a bit on the high side!). This might do something to offset the ludicrous amounts paid to some CEOs – and, even worse, their incredible bonuses and ‘golden handshakes’; in some cases, this applies to their immediate underlings as well. Housing prices A way of using tax to keep down the cost of housing would be good - but how? It seems unjust if rental property owners have tax relief on mortgages when home owners do not (and the same applies to local council rates). One way to correct this would be to give home owners tax relieve on mortgage payments. However, that might make housing more affordable to more people and push house prices even higher. The alternative would be not to allow tax relieve on mortgage payments for non-resident owners. This seems extremely reasonable to me, as the means by which such owners finance the property is unrelated to the upkeep and running of the property. However, it does affect the amount of money they make from the property, so it may just increase rents rather than keep the cost of housing down. Capital gains tax. It seems iniquitous to me that money that has been worked for is taxed, but money that has not been worked for is not; or, more accurately, some types of unearned income are not. With a mechanism for taxing land sales already, could it be expanded so that most physical asset sales were included within such a system? CGT on shares could perhaps be filled in on a standard tax form, along with Term Deposits etc?. CGT should only be on a realisation basis, as the real worth of an asset is only known when it is sold; and this should save paper work by not having to estimate the value every year. I think all assets should be included, although KiwiSaver and other pension schemes could be excluded if they came under CGT in any way. Offshore assets should not be double taxed; if offshore tax rates are lower, then they should be topped up to NZ levels. Non-residents’ capital gains should be taxed in NZ, because that is where the money has been gained. Roll-over relief seems necessary on upsizing, but on downsizing any net gain after the transactions are finalised should have CGT applied. No gift tax or inheritances tax - if income has been taxed, you should be able to give it/bequeath it without it being further taxed. Hence the need for CGT so that all income is taxed at some point. In the case of gifting/willing assets, CGT should be applied when the assets are sold. Gambling winnings should be taxed, but it only seems fair that these should be offset by any gambling losses; this might be difficult in practice. The cost of inflation should be taken into account when assessing CGT. On that basis, the transition to CGT should be immediate and retrospective. But, especially after gifting/inheriting assets, there may be no sure way of determining the initial value. Applying it to the valuation at the time of introduction is a also a can of worms and an enormous effort, but otherwise any increase in capital gains on presently owned assets would not get taxed, and I don’t see why it shouldn’t be. With computerisation, hopefully admin costs should be minimal once the system is set up, and there would be no need for de minimis rules. Yeah, right- so all sales on TradeMe have to pay CGT? Hmm... but there again a 1% tax on all such on-line transactions would bring in a few dollars. Integration of family trusts? Apart from problems with valuation as above, sales of assets should incur CGT, whoever or whatever owns them. GST GST exemption on food might seem reasonable, but the definition thereof might be a bit woozy. And even if caviar is food, such luxury items should be taxed. In order to try to modify behaviour and improve healthy eating, just fruit (solid, not juice) and vegetables should be exempt from GST. Sugar tax. Again in an effort to improve health, a sugar tax should be imposed. Certainly it should be on drinks, but if it could be applied to food as well that would be good (as in breakfast foods, particularly those aimed at children). Fruit juice is a problem because, although previously regarded as healthy, with the current outlook on sugar it is not so. Progressive company tax Lower rates of tax for smaller companies seems reasonable, if only because tax accounting is presumably a proportionally larger item for them than it is for larger companies. Charities Taxing charities would bring in millions, but our Southern Cross contributions are already about $13/day. However, I do think manufacturing companies run by charities (Sanitarium to name the main one, presumably) should be taxed the same as other companies - otherwise they have an unfair advantage and can undercut non-charitable ones. Other Self-employed not declaring income (presumably mainly cash payment), and therefore not paying tax on that income, is a problem – but how to police this is the problem. BEPS Tax avoidance by overseas companies making profits in NZ is a major factor that hopefully will be dealt with on an international basis, but otherwise it should be dealt with by NZ government..

Preface We cry shame on the feudal baron who forbade the peasant to turn a clod of earth unless he surrendered to his lord a fourth of his crop. We call those the barbarous times. But if the forms have changed, the relations have remained the same, and the worker is forced, under the name of free contract, to accept feudal obligations. For, turn where he will, he can find no better conditions. Everything has become private property, and he must accept, or die of hunger. (Kropotin 1892, Ch 1. III) What is taxation, and how ought a system of it be arranged? This is question for which the Tax Working Group was firstly announced then convened for, at the behest of the new Sixth Labour Government (New Zealand Government 2017, 1). This submission paper seeks to do something quite simple. It dismantles orthodox notions of taxation, asks why our discourse has been misled for so long with these orthodoxies, and then reconstructs ideas on taxation with a view to practical, normative steps. The secondary goal of this paper is to break apart the notion that not only is taxation understood solely by economists, but that it is best left to them. Indeed, to quote Thomas Piketty, tax is “too important an issue to be left to economists, sociologists, historians, and philosophers” (2013, 2). Stripping away rhetoric, the professionalisation of politics tends toward anti-democratic sentiment. It does little more than obscure power relations and remove them from the hands of ordinary New Zealanders governed by the legislation of which they are in practicality barred from being a part. 1.1 On the Structure of this Paper This paper is structure into four sections, which follow thematically rather than logically from one another. They move from an interrogation of orthodoxy and then elucidation of what taxation means and what it does, to the terms of reference and scope for this working group, to an historical look at discourse around taxation, and finally some practical proposals. The intention is to take the reader from a deconstruction of traditional ideas around tax, to more accurate ideas of what it is and does, and finally a normative call to how we can use a reconstructed conception to better arrange the system. 2. Ways of Viewing Taxation 2.1 Orthodoxy Tax is undoubtedly important. Not only in the purely abstract sense of its cornerstone placing in macroeconomic arrangements, but for the determinative waves it effects on the social fabric of public life. Everything from power structures to economic inequality may be stretched, pushed in scope, increased and decreased, by it. The historical dynamics of inequality, for example, may only be understood through a long-run perspective analysing tax records (Piketty 2013, 21). Why then are we content to have so many of our ideas about it utterly wrong? Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 4 To answer this, we must look first to whether the orthodox discourses around tax are in fact wrong. Are they misleading or incorrect, and if so, in what ways? After all, it is one thing to assert the emperor has no clothes, another to demonstrate it. However, this orthodoxy is unique in that it is no serious scholarly paradigm, other than in the work of the largely-discredited Chicago School of economics, and functions instead as a narrative tool by which debate is restricted and equality measures frustrated. It necessarily acts to exclude certain ideas from discourse, to privilege others, and to become so a part of the fundamental axioms of approaching tax that its hidden nature as ideology ensures its weaving into of every part of policy and discussion. Overturning orthodoxy requires not a strict scientific-like invalidation, but mere exposure of its theoretical premises to the light of reality. The foundation must be examined. In New Zealand, the orthodoxy might be categorised into two broad groups. The first is commonly manifested as and termed ‘right wing’. It is characterised by a stated concern with fiscal responsibility. Its terms, definitions, and claimed concerns are familiar to us. Fiscal responsibility, household budgeting, belt-tightening, a limited amount of money in the pot, being prudent with taxpayers’ dollars, state sector probity, concern with how programmes can be afforded. The narrative devices, the rhetoric, is so ingrained in public discourse as to be unremarkable to us. Note that this approach has been nearly identical across the developed world since the inception of the Neoliberal age; political figures from Thatcher to Reagan to Roger Douglas, and their respective advisors, have utilised the right wing discursive constructs to promote the appearance of macroeconomic competency in governance. It also useful to understand that concerns for fiscal responsibility are only ever directed at propositions for funding public goods and services, never military spending or corporate subsidies. On matters of military or corporate welfare, ‘fiscal conservatives’ are big spenders. The Reagan administration was not small-government but radically statist, increasing military spending astronomically (Scowcroft 1984, 14- 22) (McMahan 1985, Ch. 2). Conversely, programmes for the vulnerable like food stamps were slashed: by 1982, signs of hunger were widespread in the United States, especially among children (Shlomo and Morgan 1992, 54). Similarly, Roger Douglas’s reforms sought to financialise the New Zealand economy, shifting it from productive enterprise to financial institutions whose trading inherently depresses growth. The ‘left wing’ group, characterised in New Zealand by the actors associated with the larger Labour Party and its supporting pundits in the beltway, operates on similar assumptions. That there is a national deficit to be minimised, that taxes raise revenue for spending, and that such spending ought to balance at the end of the day as a ledger might, are all shared with the ‘right wing’. Rhetorical service is paid to humanitarian concerns, with more of an emphasis on building infrastructure, funding healthcare, and so on. The current Sixth Labour Government drew up and agreed prior to the 2017 General Election to commit itself to the “Business Responsibility Rules” (NZ Labour Party 2017, 1). These outlined its concerns for maintaining surplus and restricted its ability to advocate any non-business friendly policy. That is, in practice it could not, without breaking electoral promises, advance government only for the benefit of the working class and vulnerable in any significant way. What is crucial to realise is that both ‘right wing’ and ‘left wing’ group concerns, debates, and actions tacitly accept the same premises, which are not so much flawed Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 5 as deliberately designed to make politically difficult the possibility of taxation as a tool for public good. Both streams misunderstand how fiat currencies operate, both accept the mythical notions of a household budget-like deficit and government books to be balanced. In short, the acceptable spectrum of opinion is sharply narrow, and reliant on the same faulty premises. When we look at heterodox economics, we find these premises not to be grounded in how monetary flows operate. 2.2 Heterodoxy Modern Monetary Theory (MMT) is at the forefront of monetary and tax-related heterodox economics. It posits that, as state governments are the issuers of their own fiat currency, they spend it into existence, and tax merely subtracts from what has already been spent. Put simply, the fundamental idea that tax generates revenue is instead fundamentally wrong and has been so for over thirty years (Abrahamian 2017). The entire accusation of ‘tax and spend’ is built on mythologies, in the Barthesian sense (1957). Government is often likened to a household, with income and a budget of spending within that gathered income. Treasury itself states on its website, “tax revenue is the major source of core Crown revenue” (2016). Put bluntly, this is a not how taxation or governmental spending works (Kelton 2017). Fiat currency is first and foremost a social construct (Abrahamian 2017). Whilst money itself may be categorised in such a way philosophically (Simmel 1900, 128-130), currency is held to be especially so due as it is backed by declaration of the state alone, not physical entity nor limited resource. If a government may spend money into existence merely by entering numbers into a computer balance sheet, it can use fiscal stimulus however it wants to any amount it wants. Indeed, we know this can be done as quantitative easing was used to save finance and banking institutions during the GFC; it has simply never been used to benefit ordinary people (Mitchell and Fazi 2017, 161). The only limit to such quantitative generation is inflation, which is where taxes may be used to subtract money from the economy and the Reserve Bank may come into use for controls on inflationary pressure. That said, highly limited inflation is foremost a concern of business and financiers, not ordinary wage earners. There are two useful realisations to extract. Firstly, the New Zealand Government has the freedom to choose to generate money into existence for public good, to lift an entire generation out of poverty, and not be beheld to banking or financial corporate interests. Secondly, it can make taxation radically progressive, subtracting money from the economy precisely by exacting it from those same institutions of capital which drain so much from the wider economy, and reducing inequality by intentionally reducing income more at each quintile. If we are to understand how best to structure the tax system, we must be honest about how taxation works in a modern fiat currency economy. To confuse terms through an inversion of language and economic vocabulary has allowed contemporary economists to present predatory rent and debt extraction in all first world economies, and financial conquest in Greece as particular example (by the troika of the IMF, EC, and ECB) as productive and positive (Hudson 2017, iii). In the case of Greece, the seizure of assets and imposed punitive austerity have been represented as “rescue” by creditors, when it is little more than financial extortion (Gailbraith and Martin 2015). Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 6 Under MMT explanations, this is only possible because Greece does not issue its own currency as drachma, but relies on the euro, leaving it at the mercy of European institutions (Kelton 2017). In New Zealand, we issue our own currency, and government spends it into being. It is impossible for the government to overspend on social welfare or public utilities, nor does it require raising revenue by tax to do so. Only when such money, by an inversion of vocabulary, is justified for going to the subsidy of the unproductive rentier class is it dangerous to the economy (Hudson 2017, 240-242). Doing so for the non-rentier sectors – as in workers’ incomes, infrastructure, and welfare – generates growth instead. 2.3 Banks, debt and the FIRE Economy We hear often the mantra ‘all income is earned’, and its paired aphorism that there is ‘no such thing as a free lunch’ (cf Friedman 1975). To this end, bankers may claim that what they extract from an economy by imposing debt obligations is inherently earned by virtue of having had a monetary value placed upon it, and that this may justify any obligation levied upon a sector of society no matter the effect. Deleterious outcomes, like the GFC which crippled an entire generation, are dismissed in this view as externalities. The soporific illusion of ‘all income is earned’ serves as distraction from the financial sector diverting potential resources from productive sectors to feed anachronistic rent-extraction sectors, supplemented by ever new sources of monopoly rent (Hudson 2015, 18-21). When income is generated by FIRE institutions, no change in resources has taken place, nothing productive has happened, but income is paid to a party to the other’s expense, and this is still termed “earnings” in governmental reports like NIPA (ibid). Classical economists from Adam Smith to Ricardo made a distinction between productive and rent-seeking income, explicitly maligning the latter as neither being earned, nor contributing resources (Piketty 2013, 6). To belabour the point, this is because their alimentary value is naught. A child is not fed by an increase in hedge fund value. Banks primarily function through the medium of debt, and the question of debt is one not of absolute wealth but the distribution of wealth between public and private actors (Piketty 2013, 700). The inherent contradiction of such a system beholden to banking interests is firstly that r>g (return on capital and growth of income and output) in a capitalist system (which is also the structural contradiction of capitalism itself), and secondly that rentiers inevitably tend to greater and greater dominance over those who own only their labour (Piketty 2013, 746). This kind of primitive accumulation cannot help but continually drive inequality to higher levels. If we look at the true ‘free lunch’ of passive rent-extracting opportunities, in the 1980s they were financialised – capitalised into bank loans for paying out as interest – meaning banks have a state-backed advantage at the expense of governmental tax collectors, who no longer receive tax on unproductive capital holdings (Hudson 2015, 21). We saw the effect of financialisation in the Great Recession. Rising mortgage debt forced homeowners to rely more on banks, who were gambling with their profits in the financial investment sector (Stiglitz 2008), and debtors were convinced that prosperity depended upon making bankers and bondholders immensely wealthy – a sort of Stockholm Syndrome blaming the victims when crisis struck (Hudson 2015, 22). Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 7 The pro-rentier structure of the economy is state sanctioned and enforced. If an ordinary person were to print their own denominations in their own home, call them New Zealand Dollars, and attempt to circulate them, they would be charged with counterfeiting and likely a few more crimes. When banks create new currency through fractional reserve lending and other tools, they are portrayed as crucial components to a functioning economy. Predation of the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate) sector is not only a driver behind the inevitable crashes of modern capitalistic economies (Minsky 1993, 1-2), and not only do its institutions provide no new productive gains, but they largely escape any more than nominal taxation. Productive sectors, and labourers in particular, bear the brunt of the tax burden by proportion of what they earn. New Zealand lacks a financial transactions tax; an estate or gifts tax (Littlewood 2012, 66); a land tax, as this was abolished in 1992 (Barrett and Veal 2012, 573); or an extensive capital gains taxation framework, though nominal steps are being taken in this direction. In other words, though the FIRE sectors dominate profits, having overtaken industrial profits in 1996 (Kelsey 2015, 60); though they do not create more useful resources as industry does; and though they are dominated by foreign interests, they pay close to no tax. Instead the bill is picked up by individuals through both income tax and the regressive GST regime. 3. Critiques of the Background Paper 3.1 Reflecting a Misleading Orthodoxy Treasury, almost uniformly across its released papers, harbours concerns about “fiscal responsibility”, the Crown “balance sheet”, and so on. Advice to the incoming minister is such that it primes him or her for the presuppositions of Neoliberal orthodoxy (Treasury 2017, 3). The examples are general, and too innumerable to cite. A point of interest about New Zealand in this sense is how embedded the ideological constraints of Neoliberalism are, and deliberately so by its planners. Setting aside the constitutional legality of binding future parliaments, Treasury correctly states that the Public Finance Act 1989 requires any minister to hew to the constraints of orthodoxy in working with their portfolio (section 26G PFA 1989). The Working Group itself inadvertently propagates the same assumptions in staking out its own scope. The submission background paper, citing Treasury, of “fiscal consequences” for social spending toward an aging population (Tax Working Group 2018, 10) mirror the narratives of insolvent Social Security in the United States. In both cases, the underlying aim is easy to grasp. In the United States, there are billionaires with financial interest in partial or entire privatisation of Social Security; the aims are dually ideological and self-interested (Kelton 2017). In New Zealand, general vexation around fiscal responsibility is ideological, where groups like the Financial Services Council regard national pensions as an “industry” and actively advocate privatisation (Whyte 2013). The banks and financial actors who would profit from privatised retirement funds are, unsurprisingly, the major members behind groups advocating it (Financial Services Council 2012) (Radio New Zealand 2012). In both the US and New Zealand, the effect is pundits being paid large sums to explain dryly why poor people need to die of poverty in their old age, unless we make it that Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 8 their lifetime labour profits institutions of unaccountable private power who were strangers to its exertion. 3.2 Restrained Scope The Working Group is limited in scope, unable to address or alter one of the more powerful tools for reducing inequality – progressive income tax. It has been criticised already by groups like the Public Service Association, the union for public servants, for its self-set limitations (Scoop.co.nz 2017). The Tax Working Group has decided not to address the regressive nature of GST and its disproportionate share of the burden on the middle and working class, though it is not strictly barred by its own Terms of Reference from discussing it. Suffice to say, the restrained scope of the Terms of Reference, in light of the terms’ contradictions with stated aims of the group for a “fair and progressive tax system” (Robertson and Nash 2017), are so obvious a self-inflicted criticism they beg no further discussion. 4. Why We Talk About Tax the Way We Do 4.1 Political Economy of the Media Upton Sinclair quipped that it is difficult to get a man to understand a matter when his salary depends upon him not understanding it (1994, 109). So it is with journalists and assorted media figures. They are largely employed by corporate media entities, structured as businesses and owned by larger corporations. To expect any meaningful debate outside the parameters which are comfortable for business interests is to expect a difference from any other industry for no apparent reason. It simply does not happen, in the same way that GM does not draw up new car designs in hopes of making a loss. A basic institutional analysis will yield this understanding. To comprehend narratives around tax, what is said, what is not said, and the foundational assumptions of tax discussions, requires an understanding of how mass media shape the way we think about it. Herman and Chomsky’s work is the definitive scholarship on the political economy of media (McChesney 2008, 287). Their seminal text Manufacturing Consent draws its name from a quote by ‘father of journalism’ Walter Lippmann (1988, x): That the manufacture of consent is capable of great refinements no one, I think, denies. The process by which public opinions arise is certainly no less intricate than it has appeared in these pages, and the opportunities for manipulation open to anyone who understands the process are plain enough... \[a\]s a result of psychological research, coupled with the modern means of communication, the practice of democracy has turned a corner. A revolution is taking place, infinitely more significant than any shifting of economic power.... Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily in the sinister meaning of the word alone, the old constants of our thinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example, to believe in the original dogma of democracy. (Lippmann 1922, Ch XV, pt. 4) Lippman’s prime concern was that in the modern age, the “bewildered herd” of the public are not a “rational force” (1925, 69) and that if a professional class of responsible men are to maintain dominance within a democracy, propaganda must be deployed to that end. His thoughts were uncontroversial; the use of public relations packaged as Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 9 news to shape thought is no strange notion to elites in the Western sphere of influence. Edward Bernays, another influential thinker in media, posited that, “the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country,” (1928, 37) a conception not limited only to public relations. He extended it to news media (1923, 171), and education, arguing, “the only difference between ‘propaganda’ and ‘education’, really, is in the point of view. The advocacy of what we believe in is education. The advocacy of what we don't believe in is propaganda” (212). Bernays’s views were so commonplace and banal among elites that when the Trilateral Commission issued its report Crisis of Democracy, its central concern was an ‘excess of democracy’ in the 1960s because schools, churches, and media institutions had failed to carry out sufficient indoctrination of the young (Huntington, Crozier and Watanuki 1975, 113). Re-establishing passivity of the public in the following decades paramount. Members of that Trilateral Commission would later go on to staff the majority of Democrat President Carter’s cabinet, who began the Neoliberal project of public control through austerity in the United States (Chomsky 1981). Reading these figures in their own words we reach a conclusion, that propaganda is to democratic societies as the bludgeon is to totalitarian states. Masses cannot be controlled by violence, and so the window of public debate must be sharply narrowed and public thought controlled. Setting out to make the case for discourse control being a driving reason behind how narratives are shaped, Herman and Chomsky delineate what they term a “propaganda model” of the mass media. Their case examples are foreign policy stories, but their metaphoric framework of five ‘filters’ that news must pass through remains integral to understanding our public discourse on tax, which I will return to. The five filters are as follows: 1) the size, concentrated ownership, owner wealth, and profit orientation of mass media firms; 2) advertising as the primary source of income; 3) the reliance of the media on information on information provided by the government, business and ‘experts’ funded and approved by primary sources and agents of power; 4) flak as a means of discipline; and 5) anti-terrorism as national religion and control mechanism (1988, 2). The final filter is irrelevant to our discussion of economic narratives. The first two have an obvious effect: if media firms are owned by wealthy corporate entities and they sell audience attention to other privileged entities, in this case advertisers, the worldview which spins outward from this structure will inevitably have an ideological basis in wealthy class interests. The third filter is more of a key to our national discourse on tax, and requires a detour into the history of Neoliberalism in New Zealand. In most cases of history, baize tables and hushed conspiracies are simply not found in the outworking of elite interest. To paraphrase philosopher John Dewey, politics remains the shadow cast over society by big business (Westbrook 1991, 440). That society continues in the interests of a minority is merely the natural outworking of the dominant hegemonic institutions which constitute it. One does not need to exert control over something which one already owns. Is it a conspiracy when the board of Fonterra makes a decision to maximise profit in a certain way? We understand that this is not so, and it is the same for business interests exerting control over the state Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 10 and corporate media. However, in the case of New Zealand as an economic experiment, remarkably there have been such baize-tabled conspiracies and directly attributable actors to the attacks on the public sphere, in concert with the usual institutional pressures. The Business Roundtable is one such visible actor. Its published reports, ideological thought, and significant political efforts were almost single-handedly behind the Rogernomics reforms of the Fourth Labour Government. Key members pushed for the privatisation of public entities and services, which they then quickly bought up (Kelsey 2015, 126-149). The Business Roundtable was ebullient on the matter of their imposed changes being unamenable to reversibility; as member Roger Kerr applauded, “governments cannot nowadays get away with attempts to expand their powers as easily as they once could” (2003, 5). As with other representatives of elite interests like chambers of commerce, the Roundtable is negative toward what it has termed “despotic democracy” (Wilkinson 2001, 169, 205). And, rather in line with its authoritarian impositions of rapid social welfare cuts and engorgements of unaccountable private power which came to dominate the state through 1980s and 1990s reforms, attempted to construct an economic constitution to bind parliaments (Wilkinson 2001). The institution of Neoliberalism as economic orthodoxy in New Zealand came about not by unconscious process but as a result of the growing Washington Consensus and strategically-placed academics and think-tanks working to shape public thought over years (Kelsey 2015, 123). As Hudson observes, economic discourse has become inverted, and the meanings of once useful terms emptied or reversed beyond any recognition, for the interests of a minority (2017, 1-3). We are unable to talk about economics in any meaningful way so long as the discourse is wedded and limited to the orthodoxy. Why then, if our discussion of tax is so determined by institutional forces for the benefit of a small class of persons, is this fact occulted? As Jacques Ellul noted, public relations cannot reveal the true intentions of its principal, as that would be to submit it to public discussion and prevent success; propaganda “must serve instead as a veil for such projects, masking true intention” (1965, 58-59). Economics is political. To shroud its motives in the language of science and disinterest is to cover up those motives (Hudson 2017, 241), and leave us without the tools to have genuine discussion of how we ought to tax society. Having said this, we can examine a real case example of mythologies at work. 4.2 Invention of the Taxpayer Examine any news article on public spending or taxation and note how the citizenry are ubiquitously referred to as the ‘taxpayer’. The notion of a taxpayer as the unit of focus in any discussion is one which necessarily asserts the primacy of a person based on how large their tax bill is (Kelton 2017). In this conception of the world, wealthier individuals, or rather their interests, are subconsciously thought of as more legitimate than lower-waged workers’ interests. As a term, the figure of the taxpayer being the unit of focus in news media narratives is no accident, and it has a traceable history. Thatcher was a pioneer of this discursive trick when she employed it in a speech to the Conservative Party Conference: “There is no such thing as public money,” she proclaimed, “there is only taxpayers' money” (1983). It was an early deployment of this Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 11 piece of public relations, and a successful one. If there is no public money, and as she would later assert, “no society”, the true worth of a human being to any other human being may be summed up on how large their tax contribution has been. In other words, the more affluent the person, the more they are worth to society. Terms like ‘taxpayer’ are enfolded into common parlance, combine with other terms in a limited economic vocabulary, and build the legitimacy of mythologies around economics. One other such phrase, a term of indictment on a political figure, is the accusation that they are ‘tax and spend’. This too has a history, and it is employed for much the same purposes, which we have already covered. If ‘tax and spend’ as accusation is bound up in mythology, for what purpose it exists is different to that of the ‘taxpayer’. Limiting discussion to taxpayers and away from public money removes the power of discourse around tax from ever broaching its social utility, instead ranking humans by net worth. ‘Tax and spend’ is different, but equally useful. Its employment is to distract. The phrase is meaningless, having no origin in economic reality. How can one answer a charge which is substantively meaningless but connotationally loaded? Like the slogan ‘support the troops’, it is never meant to be answered, only to indict a person who does or does not hew to the thought behind the slogan. This is the most effective propaganda of all: thought-terminating. Reversal of definitions is critical to the success of propaganda efforts. In the Neoliberal era, words like democracy have at minimum two definitions: their original meaning, and the opposite. Prominent Neoliberal academic and economist Milton Friedman asserted without irony in Capitalism and Freedom (1992) that as profit- making is essence of democracy, any government which pursues policies restricting unfettered profit is antidemocratic, regardless of how much public support they enjoy (McChesney 2008, 285). Our considerations of tax have been twisted in much the same way, with original definitions of economic terms subordinated to perverse meanings that serve affluent interests. 5. Proposals for Taxation 5.1 Overview We have already discussed how in an MMT framework, or even an updated Classical Economics paradigm of the kind enumerated by Smith and Ricardo, tax is not a source of revenue for a monetary sovereign like New Zealand. Implications of this reorientation are radical in praxis: if tax is not revenue, its purpose may be put wholly to the service of reducing inequality by redistributing wealth. That is, tax seen not as collection but as a limiter on excess wealth accumulation; tax as a non-reformist reform (Gorz 2013). Simply and elegantly, preventing rentiers from becoming too rich from endeavours which profit them and yet have no social utility (Kavanagh 2018). Hudson proposes “Ten Reforms to Restore Industrial Prosperity”: Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 12 His proposals are US-centric and many are not within the scope of this paper, so I have adapted the spirit behind them and elaborated where necessary in the following sections, which outline practical proposals for the Tax Working Group. 5.2 Eliminating Regressive Taxes like GST The Tax Working Group has drawn a line around GST and wishes not to discuss it. While they may not reform this, it is important for the members to understand at least, as they do nothing about GST, that any sales tax is inherently regressive. That is to say, it targets the poor, working class, and middle class. Wealthier people are unlikely to buy significantly more food than ordinary workers, nor toilet paper, or other necessities. But the 15% added disproportionately comes out of a working person’s income; that is, more of a worker’s wages by proportion are spent on daily necessities than a wealthy person’s, as with any effective flat tax (Salmond 2011, 17). Flat taxes were a novel idea from the far right-wing Chicago School of economics, the same theorists who were parachuted into Pinochet’s dictatorially-controlled Chile in the 197os to exact a form of economic punishment on the public and subordinate the population to American business interests. This against a background of well- document political torture. The school’s advocated policies are not taken seriously in almost any respect, except it seems by successive New Zealand governments. Removing GST would significantly alleviate an unjustifiable tax burden on workers. 5.3 Taxing Multinationals Internet companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook benefit from access to the market in New Zealand by publicly-funded internet infrastructure yet pay almost nothing in tax on their subsequently accrued profits. If the Tax Working Group is to do anything with its wealth of institutional expertise, it ought to be to draw up and implement a regime for administering taxes levied against multinational corporations currently escaping the system. This goes for financial companies trading in securities, as the next proposal submits. 5.4 Tobin Tax Financial institutions escape taxation almost entirely in their everyday transactions. Rentier takings seen as contribution rather than subtrahend to the economy is an outworking of the propaganda system. We are so familiarised with the notion that all income is earned that the Classical economic distinction between productive and rentier income is lost on us. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand even backs securities for international banking interests like Goldman Sachs with ‘NZClear’, financial products which have no social utility and an almost entirely parasitic effect on the economy, and ultimately nothing along the way is taxed. A “Tobin Tax”, a minor tax on all financial transactions of about 1-2%, would address this egregious disparity. New Zealand financial institutions were privatised in the 1990s (Kelsey 2015, 52), have continued alongside their multinational counterparts to profit from essentially Simon Monrad Gough Modern Monetary Theory 13 gambling on money, and face no consequences for that same behaviour which caused the Great Recession (34-36). 5.5 Taxing Property and Capital If housing is to be seen not as a social good for the population but as a commodity (Kelsey 2015, 98), it ought to be taxed as such. At present, the proposed bright line test of five years goes some way, but there is missing a comprehensive approach to tax any and all forms of capital. The ultra-rich, after all, accumulate more not in significant increases in their wage income, but in stocks, financial products, and other forms of abstract capital. A simple income-tax regime is insufficient to address the issues raised by the Panama and Paradise papers. 6. Conclusion I am like most New Zealanders. We are workers offered no choice but to give our most precious of resources, our time and labour, to one or another authoritarian institution that is called a workplace. There we may take orders passed down the chain in a fashion resembling political tyranny. We have freedom to choose, so long as it is to which private owner we rent ourselves out. This is what was commonly understood in the 19 th Century, until beaten out of public consciousness, as wage slavery (Faust 1979) (Krause 1992, 82-83) (Zinn 2003, 221). And as workers in another kind of slavery, we already surrender a tax, and one which does not go toward communal public good: before any income is given over, we must agree to give any surplus from our efforts to masters, who we call managers. We are bereft of opportunity to develop our culture. We are enculturated into the normality of this empty kind of existence. It is only after this that the second blow, regressive taxation, corporate subsidies and funding of state violence in the military, puts paid at last to any hope for decent society. The public sphere lies near death, and its early eulogy is delivered by the interests of capital which so reflexively by their uncaring nature deprived it of oxygen. The Working Group has been hog-tied. Perhaps it may never be given the latitude to alleviate substantively the institutional issues in our tax regime. I am like most New Zealanders; not an owner of society, but one who is owned. This opportunity, represented in the Working Group, is one to give at least in some small way a semblance of decency and dignity back to the public. To utilise our available tools to reduce inequality and lift people out of poverty is a necessity if we are to survive as a society to the end of the Twenty-First Century; but more than that, it is a moral imperative. If we can justify injustice here, and fail to address it by wilful blindness, we are advocating injustice everywhere. Kropotkin wrote that we cry foul over the Feudal baron and call those the barbarous times. But we are condoning barbarities ourselves. For every beneficiary punished, it is the working group member who left them burdened by secondary tax. For every financier hiding money in trusts, the member weakly addressing havens. For every child who suffers hunger, the member agnostic toward regressive taxation. We are confronting barbarities. We must not flinch.

Submission to The Tax Working Group from Michael Littlewood On: 1. Whether the preferential tax treatment of saving for retirement can be justified; 2. The inconsistent treatment of investments that might be used in the accumulation of retirement savings. 30 April 2018 About the submitter Michael Littlewood Principal Editor, www.PensionReforms.com Honorary Academic, Retirement Policy and Research Centre University of Auckland Michael was: • A pension consultant for 25 years in London and Auckland for what is now Willis Towers Watson; • Employee Benefits Director for nine years at Fletcher Challenge Limited; • Founder-director of what is now SuperLife (www.SuperLife.co.nz); • Co-founder, in 2006, of the Retirement Policy and Research Centre (www.RPRC.auckland.ac.nz); • A member of the New Zealand government’s 1991-92 Task Force on Private Provision for Retirement. • Author of How to create a competitive market in pensions – the international lessons (IEA, London 1998) and many submissions, reports, op-eds and discussion papers on retirement and saving issues. Michael retired as co-director of the RPRC in June 2015 and remains principal editor of www.PensionReforms.com, a web site that he started in 2006. This is a personal submission Auckland 30 April 2018 \[1\] \[1\] 1. Background to this submission In July 2017, Michael Chamberlain and I published a report that looked at topics related to pensions, saving and financial preparation for retirement. The report is The Missing 2016 Review – building trust for life beyond work. The report is on-line at www.Alt-Review.com. The report gathered together what we know about a range of saving and retirement-related issues, identified the gaps in our knowledge and the questions that needed answering on each of the major issues. This submission uses two of the sections from The Missing 2016 Review that are relevant to the Tax Working Group’s deliberations: - Section 9: On tax subsidies for saving – the original section is here; - Section 17: Income tax and saving vehicles – all ‘income’ should be taxed at the appropriate marginal rates – the original section is here. The Missing 2016 Review suggests there is much to be done in these two tax-related areas. • I have just written a brief paper that will appear in the US in the Spring issue of The Journal of Retirement. It’s called Governments have it wrong on pensions – personal lessons from a consulting career and draws on my career in employee benefit consulting and also my last 30 years or so of participation in the public policy debates. It summarises the underlying messages of The Missing 2016 Review. I strongly believe that governments should confine their public policy initiatives to areas that only governments have a unique capacity to influence – persuading or forcing citizens to save more than citizens want to save isn’t one of those areas. Instead, governments should focus on: • Reducing poverty in old age – governments cannot rely on private provision, even if ‘compulsory’, to achieve that; • Levelling the tax playing fields so that all ‘income’ is taxed similarly, regardless of source; • Levelling regulatory playing fields so that all saving vehicles with similar objectives are regulated similarly; • Gathering impeccable, deep, accessible data that are relevant to behaviour and issues relevant to pensions, saving and retirement; • Running information/education programmes on all of the above. As Michael Chamberlain and I said in The Missing 2016 Review: “...with respect to retirement income policies: - There is a range of things that only the government can do – it should do those things. - There is another range of things that, based on the evidence, the government seems unable to do - it should stop doing those. - Finally, there are things that the government is doing but, based on the evidence, seem not to be effective – it should also stop doing those. This is evidence-based policy-making - if it works, based on the evidence, then do it; if it doesn’t work, stop doing it. If we do not know whether it works, gather the evidence before deciding what to do. For New Zealand, this approach to policy–making on retirement incomes would be a change but it’s time New Zealand tried it. Before that process can even start, there is a lot of information to gather.” 1 1 From the Introduction to The Missing 2016 Review, accessible here. 2. Summary of this submission Section 3: Tax subsidies for saving: Tax breaks for retirement saving, such as the Member Tax Credit in KiwiSaver, are expensive, complex, inequitable, distortionary and regressive. But, worst of all, they seem not to work (raise saving levels). They could even reduce saving levels. Section 4: Income tax and saving: The tax treatment of ‘income’ favours some retirement saving investments over others. Definitions of ‘income’ also matter for income-tested state benefits like Working for Families. These both need fixing. We suggest a ‘first principles’ approach to reform. At the end of each section is a series of questions that the Tax Working Group should answer, both to explain the current tax treatment of retirement savings and to justify any changes to those arrangements. 3. On tax subsidies for saving 2 While governments can certainly influence the ways in which people save for retirement, they seemingly cannot incentivise people to save more for retirement than they want to save. Tax- favoured Tier 2 (compulsory) or Tier 3 schemes (voluntary and occupational) may see more financial assets accumulated than in the absence of such schemes but again, savers can and do change other aspects of their behaviour in ways that may confound the policymakers’ objectives. A set of acronyms summarises the tax treatment of financial assets, particularly in a retirement saving context. There are three main movements of money: • contributions: ‘T’ means that contributions to the scheme come from after-tax income; ‘E’ that contributions reduce taxable income before tax is deducted (or attract a direct subsidy); also, in the case of occupational schemes, that the employer’s contributions are not deemed part of the employee’s taxable pay. • investment income on the accumulation: ‘T’ means that invested assets are taxed with the saver’s other income; ‘E’ that the assets accumulate tax-free. • benefits received: ‘T’ means that benefits are taxed as income in the year of receipt; ‘E’ that benefits are exempt from tax in the recipient’s hands. Most countries treat retirement savings on EET principles – contributions are deductible or directly subsidised through the tax system and, for employees, not deemed to be part of pay (E); there is no tax on the saving scheme’s investment income (E) and the final benefits (usually pensions) are taxed as income (T). In an expenditure tax environment, EET is relatively neutral 3 . That’s because if the government relied entirely on expenditure taxes, taxes are collected when the savings and all other assets are spent. However, in a world where most government revenue is collected from taxes on income, EET is highly favoured 4 . Such a strategy must therefore be designed to encourage greater self-provision for retirement and, impliedly, to reduce pressure on future government-delivered age pensions. That last justification would be part of a stronger case if the state pension were means-tested. Few countries’ age pensions are so tested. On some quite generous assumptions, TTE (and ETT) is a ‘neutral’ treatment in an income tax environment. A bank account is a convenient example: savings into the account come from after-tax income (T); interest earned on the account is added to the saver’s other taxable income (T) while withdrawals from the account are exempt (E). They are not really ‘exempt’; they are withdrawals of tax-paid capital. Countries have different shades of these mixtures and usually run both together. Financial savings that are locked up for retirement may be EET while accessible bank accounts (another potential part of the retirement savings fabric) are TTE. There may also be reduced tax on ‘retirement’ 2 This section was based on my submission for the Retirement Commissioner’s 2016 Review: Ageing populations, retirement incomes and public policy: the four ‘first principles’ of policy-making - A submission to the Commission for Financial Capability (accessible here). 3 They are ‘neutral’ as long as the marginal tax rates on retirement incomes are equivalent to the rates payable on income during the accumulation period. However, given that retirement incomes are generally lower, average taxes on retirement income will also generally be lower. This means that, even if all withdrawals are taxed under EET (that usually doesn’t happen), there is a natural tax bias that favours EET in an expenditure tax environment. 4 In New Zealand, about 60% of tax revenue was income tax in the 2014/15 year: see Briefing for the Incoming Minister of Revenue – 2015, Inland Revenue (accessible here). 40% was through GST and excise duties. accounts. Australia has ‘ttE’ 5 which means lower levels of tax than ‘normal’ on contributions and investment income but, overall, retirement saving schemes are greatly favoured by comparison with, say, bank accounts. On generous assumptions, Australia’s ttE is broadly equivalent to the more usual EET. Of the three money movements, the tax treatment of the investment accumulation is the most significant. This reflects the power of investment earnings (i.e. ‘compound interest’) over the very long periods involved in retirement saving’s accumulation and decumulation periods and the difference between pre- and post-tax returns. Even small differences between pre- and post-tax returns create large differences in the eventual size of the retirement accumulations. Because of the relatively shorter decumulation period in retirement, even if all the benefits were taxed at the retiree’s top personal tax rate, the government will never recover the value of the concessions given on contributions to the scheme and investment income earned on the accumulating savings 6 . That makes tax incentives for retirement saving very expensive, especially over the long run 7 . That is not their only difficulty: (a) Tax incentives are regressive: The rich can afford to contribute more and so capture most of the value of the concessions 8 . Poorer taxpayers, who cannot afford to save, help pay for the cost of the tax concessions (‘my tax concession is someone else’s tax cost’). (b) Regulations are complex: Savings that attract the concessionary treatment must be kept under EET for decades so the regulations that control the money’s entry, accumulation and exit are necessarily intricate 9 . As individuals game the system, the regulations inevitably become more complex and more expensive to administer. (c) Distortionary: Tax concessions ‘label’ a particular form of behaviour as preferable to other equivalent behaviour. EET-approved retirement saving schemes are seemingly better for savers than, say, a bank account that retains the TTE treatment. Advocates for tax incentives should show why locked-up savings are better for a country than accessible equivalents 10 . Tax incentives also distort ‘signals’. Fund managers should aim to deliver real returns (more than inflation) to savers. That task is much easier under EET by comparison with an 5 Ross Guest in Comparison of the New Zealand and Australian Retirement Income Systems (2013) accessible here summarises the tax treatment: in Australia, contributions are taxed at a flat rate of 15% to an annual cap of $A25,000. Investment income is taxed at a rate that probably averages 8% and benefits are tax-free if withdrawn after age 60. The lowest individual marginal rate of income tax is 19% after a tax-free band of $A18,200. The tax rules changed from 1 July 2017, including reduced concessions for very high earners and deductibility for employee contributions (see here). 6 In How to create a competitive market in pensions: the international lessons (1998), Institute of Economic Affairs, London, Michael Littlewood explains the mathematics behind this suggestion. 7 Not many countries count the cost of tax incentives for retirement saving. In 2009, Australia spent almost as much on tax incentives ($A24.6 bn) as it spent on the entire Tier 1 ‘Age Pension’ ($A26.7 bn) – see The great superannuation tax concession rort (2009), David Ingles, The Australia Institute (accessible here). 8 David Ingles (op cit) suggests that in Australia, “The current concessions provide almost no benefit to low-income earners.” Again: “The system has become so skewed that the annual cost of providing superannuation tax concessions to high-income earners is much greater than the cost of simply paying those same individuals the age pension. Providing tax concessions for superannuation as a mechanism to help insulate the budget from the cost of providing for an ageing population is not sensible.” In the US, about 80% of the value of tax concessions is captured by the top 20% of earners; the bottom 60% of earners capture just 7% of that value – see Tax Deferred Retirement Savings, Seth Hanlon (2011) Center for American Progress, accessible here. Again in the US, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the top 20% of households receive nearly twice as much in retirement tax subsidies as the bottom 80 percent combined – see The Distribution of Major Tax Expenditures in the Individual Income Tax System (2013), accessible here. The total cost of those subsidies to the US tax system was $US137 billion (0.9% of GDP) in 2013. 9 ‘Protecting’ the tax concessions in KiwiSaver is relatively less intricate than applies in most other jurisdictions though there is ‘leakage’ (first home concessions; disability; death, emigrants). 10 Some suggest, for example, that “The concessional taxation of superannuation \[retirement savings\] is...intended to address the bias in the current taxation system against long-term saving.” Submission to the Financial System Inquiry, The Department of the Treasury, Australia, 3 April 2014 at page 44 (accessible here). This presumes a public policy interest in the relative quality of long-term savings (‘better’) than short-term savings (‘worse’). Expected after-tax returns on savings, from a timing perspective, should be for savers and investors to decide, not governments. environment where all ‘income’ is taxed. Coupled with the fact that EET savings are locked- in until retirement, fund managers do not have to work as hard to achieve real returns or to retain existing business. Also, savers themselves do not capture the full value of EET concessions. Savers can afford to be less sensitive to the fees charged by managers of EET savings compared with their TTE equivalents. That special treatment increases the risks of capture by managers and promoters. Locking EET savings up until retirement increases those risks. There is also a suggestion of an unintended consequence of New Zealand’s TTE regime. Andrew Coleman 11 thinks it may be a cause of New Zealand’s runaway house prices. Housing has a more favourable tax treatment than retirement saving so disadvantaging the latter. Because it seems politically difficult to fix the tax treatment of housing it may be preferable to move to the internationally more usual EET for retirement savings. The trouble with this argument is the absence of direct evidence of the linkage, as the author himself acknowledges. There may be a correlation or even a coincidence of timing but, unless a direct link is established, this seems a poor justification for re-introducing the distortions of EET to retirement savings. New Zealand may be the only country to have TTE but is not the only country with significant recent increases in house prices. (d) Inequitable: As with compulsion at Tier 2, a retirement income policy driven by work-based income necessarily favours higher income earners. This is a separate point from the regressive nature of tax concessions (paragraph (a) above). Those with higher rates of pay increases and more complete working lives tend to save more when saving rates are set in relation to pay. They arrive at retirement with larger retirement accumulations both in money terms and as a proportion of pay. Tax concessions that favour occupational saving schemes tend to institutionalise these inequalities. (e) Deadweight costs: There are ‘deadweight’ losses to the economy of collecting the extra taxes needed to finance the more fiscally expensive, front-loaded EET environment. These costs reflect the value of the opportunities that are effectively lost when taxation diverts labour and capital from their best uses. (f) Loss of flexibility: Next, individuals face costs through a loss of flexibility. Savings might be better spent from a lifetime perspective on an earlier financial crisis (such as a health condition or housing issue) or on a more productive investment, such as buying and building a business or reducing debt. Compulsory private provision at Tier 2 faces parallel difficulties. (g) Do they work? Given that all countries have tax concessions for retirement saving, we might expect studies that demonstrate the ‘value for money’ test. Do tax incentives actually increase savings? The answer is ‘possibly not’ despite very large sums that accumulate in tax-favoured schemes. It’s very difficult, perhaps impossible, to work out because we do not know what might have happened in the absence of the incentives; what economists call the ‘counter- factual’ 12 . Some studies suggest the overall impact on the quantum of savings and national saving rates is doubtful 13 . 11 Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease, Andrew Coleman, 2017 University of Otago Business School, accessible here. 12 Spain introduced tax incentives for retirement saving in 1988. A report on household behaviour across their introduction concludes that “at most” only one quarter of the contributions were ‘new’ savings: see The Effects of the Introduction of Tax Incentives on Retirement Savings (2007), Juan Ayuso, Juan Jimeno and Ernesto Villanueva, Banco de España (accessible here). That analysis took no account of the cost to the tax system of lost revenue. 13 Alicia Munnell in Current taxation of qualified pension plans: has the time come? (1992) Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (accessible here) suggests that the costs of deferring tax on pension accumulations aren’t justified. Instead, the “taxation of benefit accruals should be shifted to a current basis.” In Tax Incentives to Saving and Borrowing (2003), Tullio Jappelli and Luigi Pistaferri (accessible here) say “...there is considerable empirical debate as to the effectiveness of tax incentives in promoting saving: most studies conclude that tax incentives affect the allocation of household portfolios, but the effect on the amount saved is less clear-cut.” In The Effects of 401(k) Plans on Household Wealth (2000 – accessible here), Eric Engen and William Gale suggest that, without regard for the fiscal and regulatory costs, In fact, if households as a whole were perfectly rational, they would allow for the value of tax concessions when setting target retirement saving levels. The annual amounts required to meet a given target are less if those savings are subsidised through favourable tax treatment. We should therefore expect lower annual levels of household saving in a tax-favoured EET environment than under TTE because of the large value of the concessions given by taxpayers to the saver’s lifetime saving project. Given that tax breaks seem not to ‘improve’ the quantum of savings (along with the other difficulties described above), the expensive, complex concessions in an EET environment arguably become pointless. As a result, while tax policy (or a matching contribution that has similar characteristics to a concession such as KiwiSaver’s ‘member tax credit’) encourages contributions to a retirement saving vehicle (public, occupational or retail), we should expect EET-based incentives to have little, long-term effect on national saving. There have been remarkably few studies as to whether tax breaks work to improve national saving levels and we have offered some international evidence on that issue. Further work is needed both to identify overseas studies and to understand the effect of KiwiSaver subsidies on New Zealanders’ recent behaviour. There is no doubt that the financial services industry favours tax incentives for retirement saving and that alone should give us pause for thought. It is so much easier to generate new business when there is a time-dependent amount paid for by taxpayers. Given that tax breaks for retirement saving are expensive, complex, inequitable, distortionary, regressive and seemingly don’t work, it’s difficult to understand why the government might be interested in using tax to increase subsidies to savings. The Minister of Finance in the last government, Steven Joyce answered a reporter’s question about that in the 2017 Budget lockup as follows: “That's an issue that, from my perspective, would repay further work," Mr Joyce said in the yesterday's pre-budget media and analysts’ lockup at the Beehive... "I literally didn't have time to have a look at it in the current cycle but I'd like to have a look at it in future years – if I get the opportunity." 14 It might be too much to ask that any review of that issue addresses, let alone answers, any of the problems we have identified with tax breaks for saving but we will suggest the questions anyway. Questions New Zealand needs to discuss on tax subsidies for saving: 1. Why does our government have a particular interest in the way New Zealanders save for retirement? That ‘interest’ is currently expressed through KiwiSaver (analysed here in The Missing 2016 Review) and through tax breaks given both to KiwiSaver (estimated cost in the 2017 year: $738 m, rising to $840 m by 2019/20) and to the concessionary tax treatment of ‘Portfolio Investment Entities’ – there is more on that in the next section 4 (Income tax and saving vehicles). Where are the cost/benefit analyses to support these direct, costly interventions in New Zealanders’ saving behaviour? 2. Are we correct that tax breaks for retirement saving are complex, distortionary, expensive, regressive and inequitable? “between 0 and 30 percent of 401(k) balances represent net additions to private savings.” If the fiscal and regulatory costs were also included, we think those percentages might turn negative. 14 From the National Business Review, 26 May 2017, accessible here (paywall in place). 3. Are we further correct that tax breaks for retirement saving probably do not ‘work’ (if by that we mean that they probably do not raise savings overall)? Where is the evidence that costly incentives for KiwiSaver (an accumulated cost to taxpayers of $8.5 billion to date) have increased household savings? In The Missing 2016 Review, we described what evidence there is on KiwiSaver’s impact here 15 . 4. If the answers to either question 2 or 3 above are ‘yes’, can we agree that the government should not try to ‘incentivise’ people to save particular amounts in a particular way and in particular investment vehicles for a particular purpose? 5. Does the presence of tax incentives increase economic growth above the level that it would have been if they had not been there? 15 Based on the limited available evidence that was cited in the report, New Zealanders were probably slightly over- saving for retirement before KiwiSaver started in 2007; of KiwiSaver contributions, only about one-third was ‘new’ savings, the rest being effectively transferred from other financial assets and KiwiSaver members seemed to have accumulated less net wealth than non-members. 4. Income tax and saving vehicles – all ‘income’ should be taxed at the appropriate marginal rates 16 The Tax Working Group’s ‘issues’ paper 17 states: “If our broad-based, low-rate system is working well, there should be only minor (or no) differences in the tax treatment of different forms of investment.” (page 39) With respect only to the different ways in which ordinary New Zealanders might save for retirement, that is simply not the case. The following summarises the main issues that New Zealand faces on income tax associated with ‘collective investment vehicles’ (CIVs): (a) Different categories of CIV pay different rates of tax; (b) Different tax regimes apply to different types of asset; (c) Tax applies to investments differently for CIVs when compared to individual savers. In 2010, Michael Chamberlain and I reviewed the income tax regime of CIVs and the relationship between ‘income’ and the income-tested welfare benefits. In essence, nothing has changed so what follows summarises our findings of eight years ago. Until 2000, New Zealand had a relatively simple tax treatment of CIVs where the CIV’s income was taxed at the top personal rate of tax (33%) that was also the corporate tax rate and the rate that applied to trusts. Under the TTE regime (see section 3 – On tax subsidies for saving), members’ contributions to CIVs that were workplace superannuation schemes were made out of the employee’s after-tax income (the employer’s contributions were also taxed at 33%) and withdrawals were treated as tax-paid capital. An Inland Revenue 2005 Discussion Document 18 stated: “...it is important that the tax rules for investment income operate efficiently and that investors’ decisions are not distorted by different tax treatments for income from investments that are similar in nature...... “The proposals outlined in this discussion document aim to resolve these inconsistencies and the distorting effect they have on investor decision-making.” The results of the review sparked by the Discussion Document were the 2007 introduction of Portfolio Investment Entities’ (PIEs) and the Fair Dividend Return (FDR) approach to the tax treatment of overseas investments. However, as our 2010 Working Paper concluded, “It is clear that the tax regime is complex and distortionary and this seems at odds with the reasons for the 2007 changes.” There are now, broadly, three types of CIV or pooled investment vehicle: - A unit trust type of product where the return is passed through to the investor and taxable income is taxed at the investor’s own marginal tax rate. - A superannuation scheme type of product. These can be a PIE where tax is calculated within the scheme at the investor’s Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR) that mimics, on a favoured basis, the investor’s marginal rate but doesn’t tax all income. Returns are 16 This section is based on our Working Paper 2010-1 for the Retirement Policy and Research Centre: Towards a more rational tax treatment of collective investment vehicles and their investors (accessible here). 17 Future of Tax – submissions background paper (accessible here). 18 Taxation of investment income - The treatment of collective investment vehicles and offshore portfolio investments in shares (2005) Inland Revenue Department, accessible here. ultimately distributed to investors as tax-paid capital. A superannuation schemes does not have to be a PIE – in this case, tax is still calculated within the scheme on a ‘final basis’ but at a standard 28% for the scheme as a whole 19 . - A non-superannuation scheme (which may be a unit trust) that is a PIE and that also taxes the income at the investor’s PIR. Separately, the FDR regime taxes overseas equities’ trusts (and direct equity investments) other than certain Australian shares, on a deemed income basis. Regardless of the investor’s actual returns, taxable income is assumed to be 5% of the asset’s opening value on 1 April in the tax year for an individual and some CIVs, though most CIVs are now taxed on 5% of the average daily value. In nearly all cases, the FDR regime will either over-tax or under-tax the investor’s actual income, measured against the investor’s marginal tax rate and also creates potential liquidity issues as tax is based on deemed income, not income actually received. Contributions by an employer to a ‘workplace superannuation scheme’ 20 or a superannuation scheme or a KiwiSaver scheme, are subject to a complex ‘Employer Contribution Withholding Tax’ (ECWT) if the employer has chosen the multi-rate approach that mimics the employee’s marginal tax rate for the last tax year but includes the contributions paid as ‘income’. Contributions by employers to other types of schemes are subject to Fringe Benefit Tax. Different combinations of direct and indirect investment will produce different overall tax consequences. Overseas investments – ownership basis affects tax treatment Our 2010 Working Paper analysed the practical implications of the 2007 changes by looking at the different ways a New Zealand saver could invest in overseas shares or bonds. We concluded that: • For an overseas share (we used BHP Billiton as an example of an Australian share), there were at least 11 different ways a New Zealand investor can invest in overseas shares and seven potentially different after-tax returns even though the pre-tax return was the same in each case. However, even the four that had similar tax treatments could vary between themselves (and with others) depending on the relationship between timings of dividends and market values relative to the 1 April fixing of market values under the FDR regime. Even currency management options can affect the optimal tax structure. • For an overseas bond, there are 13 possible ownership choices with 13 potentially different after-tax returns for the same pre-tax return. The ‘best’ answer for a New Zealand investor will depend on the investor’s marginal tax rate, effective marginal tax rate and issues such as costs, convenience etc. For most, owning overseas bonds through a PIE or registered superannuation scheme that invests in an Australian or overseas unit trust that includes currency hedging bought overseas will probably be optimal. Tax treatment of CIV’s income and distributions The way in which a CIV’s income and distributions are taxed also varies by category. Whether returns are ‘income’ within the CIV depends on the CIV’s classification (registered superannuation scheme, unregistered superannuation scheme, unit trust, PIE, ‘group investment fund’, family trust or even an ordinary bank account). 19 There is also a trust (such as a family trust) where undistributed income is taxed at 33%, the top personal marginal rate of tax. 20 ‘Workplace saving schemes’ are registered under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 Also, the PIE tax calculations for an individual member are complex as the PIR depends on the total of the PIE’s income attributable to the member and the member’s taxable income in one of the two preceding complete tax years (the lower year). The member must advise the PIE’s manager what the correct PIR for each year should be. Interaction with state benefits The definition of ‘income’ matters not just for tax but also for an individual’s entitlements to a number of state-provided benefits or obligations that depend in some way on ‘income’. These include the Family Tax Credit (FTC), In-work Tax Credit (IWTC), Minimum Family Tax Credit, Parental Tax credit (together referred to as ‘Working for Families’), the Independent Earner Tax Credit (IETC), Student Loan payments and allowances, Child Support payments and income- tested welfare benefits such as Sole Parent Support, Job-seeker Support and the Accommodation Supplement. In all these cases, the ‘income’ that counts is taxable income 21 . Non-taxable benefits or benefits that are subject to either ‘Employer Contribution Withholding Tax’ (ECWT) or Fringe Benefit Tax (such as the private use of a car, low interest loan, etc.) are not counted. Neither are the tax credits (FTC, IWTC, IETC etc.). ‘Income’ within a scheme (and not effectively distributed) is unlikely to be included and that seems illogical. Summary of the 2007 changes There is a variety of ways in which assets and income can be ‘sheltered’ from direct connection with the economic owners of that income. Income derived through the various tax-based vehicles is not always aggregated for either income tax or for the application of income-tested payments. The discontinuities between different parts of the CIV regime, the illogical tax treatment of contributions and investment income and the artificial distinctions between directly and indirectly earned income mean, inevitably, that the 2007 rules will be subject to change as advisers test their boundaries. As is usually the case, wealthier taxpayers will benefit the most as they rearrange their affairs to best tax-advantage. They should capture the KiwiSaver-related concessions and invest the rest either in a PIE or in a superannuation scheme that invests in a PIE. They should not invest directly. Along the way, the tax system seems to have lost the natural meaning of ‘income’. In a progressive tax regime, how much total ‘income’ an individual receives matters to the system’s integrity. ‘Investment income’ needs, potentially, to have no clear connection with the member’s economic capacity to pay tax. If this basic principle had been set aside for practical considerations, that might have been justifiable. Regrettably, that was not the case. As the 2009 Tax Working Group put it: “The tax system lacks coherence, integrity and fairness: Differences in tax rates and the treatment of entities provide opportunities to divert income and reduce tax liability. This disparity means investment decisions can be about minimising tax rather than the best business investment. For individuals, the tax burden is disproportionately borne by PAYE taxpayers since many with wealth can restructure their affairs through trusts and companies to shelter income from taxes or to enable people to receive social support.” 22 21 Though sometimes capital receipts are deemed to be ‘income’ if they are received on a basis that will be applied for an “income-related purpose”: paragraphs (b) and (c) (“whether capital or not”); also paragraph f(xiv)(C) of the definition of ‘income’ in section 3(1) if the Social Security Act 1964 (accessible here) can include payments from a superannuation scheme. 22 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future (2009) Victoria University Tax Working Group, accessible here, at page 9. A ‘first principles’ approach Our 2010 Working Paper proposed the recognition of a number of key points: (a) Principle 1: Tax should not be the driver. For an investor in a CIV, it should not matter, from a tax perspective, what that CIV is called or under which legislation that CIV is regulated. In principle, individual investors should be treated similarly for tax purposes in superannuation schemes, PIEs, unit trusts, group investment funds, life insurance funds or companies. (b) Principle 2: Place of origin should not matter. For New Zealand tax purposes, it should not matter to an individual investor in which country the CIV is resident. Within reason, international CIVs should be treated similarly for New Zealand tax purposes to New Zealand-based CIVs. How the overseas CIV is treated in its local jurisdiction need not affect its New Zealand status when an investor calculates income tax 23 . (c) Principle 3: The individual’s circumstances are important. Again within reason, the tax the investor pays on the CIV’s return should be close to the normal tax the investor would have paid had the investment been held directly. As the original 2005 Discussion Document stated, the investor should choose a CIV for reasons other than tax – for example, for convenience, cost, diversification, liquidity, management skills etc. These principles may need tempering if the cost of collecting the ‘correct’ amount of tax were uneconomic. Any replacement compromise should, however, recognise the principles and the costs of change. The three principles form a suggested ‘gold standard’ against which any proposals should be measured. The old tax regime that governed the different types of CIV violated all three principles. Regrettably, the current regime is not much better in some respects and is worse in others. Income should be ‘income’ and should be taxed and benefit-tested accordingly 24 . The current regime does not come close to that objective. While the tax treatment of CIVs is normally a compromise between principles and practicality, compromise of principle should apply only if there is a combined effect of simplification and increased net returns to investors with no significant loss of tax revenue. Changes in recent years have failed to achieve these objectives and have left a complex patchwork of compromises and significant discontinuities between the income tax and welfare systems. CIVs should be encouraged and their continued development should be seen as a contribution to a successful financial services industry. They should not be tax-favoured. The current ‘proxy-rate’ system of taxing CIV members needs reform. As we said in our 2010 Working Paper: “No member of a CIV presently pays the appropriate tax on their full income (both directly and indirectly earned) under New Zealand’s progressive tax regime. That distortion is potentially magnified when the tax system is set alongside the income-related aspects of our welfare system...” (page 34) 23 The relationship between ‘income’ earned overseas, any tax paid overseas and the New Zealand tax regime will never be simple, especially where imputation credits are involved. The principle should be that New Zealand taxes the gross income and makes allowance for any tax already paid by the investor. 24 The personal rates of tax are 10.5% on income to $14,500; 17.5% on income between $14,001 and $48,000; 30% on income between $48,001 and $70,000 and 33% on income over 33%. We think all ‘income’ whether directly or indirectly received should be taxed at these rates. We suggested that the combination of income tax, income support and the treatment of CIVs leaves an unsatisfactory gap that now needs to be filled. It is not possible to distinguish, in policy substance, between: • income tax (where the state takes money); • income-support (where the state gives back some of that money in different ways to people it decides need that support) and • income-testing (where the state takes back part or all of the income support). Those three strands should go to make up the single environment of defining and calculating 'income'. Only in that context can the significance of CIV-derived income be measured and the problems identified and addressed. The reason that CIVs are adding to the inconsistencies derives from the ‘silo approach’ to tax policy that has treated some CIVs in isolation 25 . That approach must change. 'Income' for all purposes should be defined consistently, no matter how it has been earned. Questions New Zealand needs to discuss on income tax issues: 1. Should all CIVs be taxed similarly? 2. Should individuals pay income tax on all their ‘income’ whether that has been directly received (as with pay or interest income) or indirectly received (as with additions to their account within a CIV)? 26 3. Should the Inland Revenue be calculating individuals’ tax (rather than employers and the managers of CIVs)? 4. Should all ‘income’ count when calculating income-tested welfare benefits? 5. If a CIV investor is tax-exempt (such as a charity) should any tax paid by a CIV be fully recoverable? 6. If the CIV investor has accumulated tax losses from earlier years or from the current year, should any CIV income be offset against such losses? 7. If an overseas CIV has paid any tax that can be attributable to an individual investor, should that tax be offset against any New Zealand tax liability on the same attributable income? 8. Rather than trying to define income exhaustively, should the Income Tax Act 2007 state some broad principles, specifying a list of considerations that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue should take into account when deciding what is ‘income’ and what is not? 25 The ‘silo’ approach to the tax treatment of ‘income’ was probably born of the Inland Revenue’s administration systems. The Inland Revenue effectively contracted-out the calculation of tax to PIEs and superannuation schemes as it could not cope with doing those calculations itself. We think that the Inland Revenue should be calculating tax, not each employer or manager of a collective investment vehicle. Only the Inland Revenue has all the information that is needed to calculate the correct amount of tax for an individual taxpayer under our progressive tax framework. 26 Tax can still be calculated and paid by the CIV but as a down-payment on the saver’s final liability, in a manner similar to the imputation credits that can be added to a company’s dividend. 9. Should the principles of ‘binding rulings’ 27 be expanded to include a formal system of ‘practice notes’ that will give greater certainty of tax consequences and increased flexibility than the current court-based system? 27 See here for more on ‘binding rulings’.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Tax Working Group Secretariat This s ubmission is from Gavin Logan, Dear Sir Michael Cullen and members of the Tax Working Group, My submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, is with reference to selected proposals and questions set out in the Tax Working Group’s Background Paper . The ones that I have submitted on are issues that I have some knowledge off, particularly housing and rentals as I have considerable experience in this area. My submission will cover these 5 important areas: 1) Can tax make housing more affordable? 2) Changing taxes on savings to encourage New Zealanders to save more. 3) Bracket creep and inflationary fiscal drag. 4) Behavioural taxes, Tobacco, Alcohol etc. 5) Revenue neutrality. 1) Can tax make housing more affordable? The simple answer is no. More tax means higher prices and less affordability. But attempting to tax it more could have undesirable unintended consequences on other sectors of the economy. Australia has a Capital Gains Tax. Look at the result! Australia's housing affordability crisis is likely to continue for another 40 years unless there are major changes to the market, according to the latest report from the Committee for Economic Development of Australia. In the 1970s and 80s many New Zealanders moved to Australia because houses were cheaper there. Then in the late 1980s a capital gains tax was introduced. Since then the situation has reversed and housing is now as expensive or more expensive than in New Zealand. New Zealanders no longer go to Australia with the expectation of getting a cheaper home. The only main change was this tax. A Capital Gains Tax is a recipe for a never ending housing crisis! Capital Gains Tax is one of the most complicated, messy and distortionary taxes ever invented. It also taxes small businesses and encourages inefficiency through assets being held by unproductive owners because they don't want to pay the tax if they sell. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 2 Capital gains taxes differ from brightline tests ( also a bad policy in my view) in that they usually have no sunset period and covers more classes of assets including shares and businesses. Capital Gain Taxes tax inflation. If a property or asset is sold and equal one often can't be purchased because tax has taken part of the proceeds encouraging and often forcing business and people to keep assets that are no longer ideal for purpose rather the selling and purchasing an asset that better reflects the new needs of the business or enterprise. They also discourage the sale of businesses that would improve and be more productive if they had a new more progressive owner. The result can be less productivity and employment. Capital gains taxes also, as is very evident in Australia, cause much capital and saving to be spent on often unnecessary home improvements or making houses bigger so the family home can be later sold for a tax free profit while investment property and share are invested in less as the gain is taxable. Taxes on housing and assets discourage investment and savings. I therefore submit that the Tax Working Group should recommend against a Capital Gains Tax on investments excluding the family home. I note that Vancouver Canada has a 15% tax on foreigners buying houses and a host of other policies to discourage investment in property. The net result has been an average house price of $1.6 million and an 11% increase in prices in the last year. Countries that don't use their tax systems to attempt to interfere with the housing market seem to have the least problems with shortages, affordability and high rents. I think that deprecation should be reintroduced for new build rental properties to increase supply and lower rents. 2) Changing taxes on savings to encourage New Zealanders to save more. We should change the tax system to encourage saving. Savers, particularly ones with bank term deposit or similar things currently pay tax on interest that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I have money in bank term deposits at present that after tax and inflation have less than 1% real interest. I submit that taxpayers should be given a deduction from taxable income earned via term deposit saving to cover inflation. This figure should be set by the Reserve Bank every year, thus avoiding politicians making that decision. 3) Bracket creep and inflationary fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets needs to be addressed. I submit that the Tax Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed so doing this to income tax would not be a problem. 4) Behavioural taxes, Tobacco, Alcohol etc. 3 I don't know for sure how much of the Tax Working Group's brief covers these areas, but I would support increasing taxes on alcoholic drinks and further increases on tobacco products. I am not sure about the workability of taxes on excessively sugary drinks or fatty foods as defining what is in and what's out is difficult. However in principal I support them as if done carefully the encourage manufactures and importers to keep the levels in their products under the tax threshold. I would submit that looking at the viability of using tax to improve the nations eating, drinking and general health would be a worthwhile endeavour. Overseas there has been some limited success stories with this approach. 5) Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax increases are recommended by the Tax Working Group, I submit that other areas where tax can be reduced should be identified to compensate for this. Yours faithfully Gavin Logan \[1\]

Submission to Tax Work Group 2018, by Rod McIntyre I favour taxation that is focused on needs, simplicity and efficiency. I dislike policies in the name of “fairness” as that is subjective, or “changing behaviours” which can be misguided and insulting. My perspectives are from a 45 year working life in blue-collar private businesses (construction and industrial). I am a capitalist-socialist believing in hard work, rewards, fair appropriate redistribution (based on needs not so-called “fairness”), and limiting welfare to dire needs rather than dependency and an alternative to hard work. Tax on international company business in NZ Profit transfer tax loop holes must be closed. Company tax rate The present rate is competitive enough, with no fiscal scope for meaningful reduction. Income tax Generally ok as is. Upper income tax rates I would have no objection to increases in marginal tax rates at much higher income levels, starting with above $200,000 at 3-4%, then above $400,000 at another 3-4%, and finally above $600,000 at another 3- 4%. This is based on need, not so-called “fairness.” It is certainly arguable that it is unfair that higher earners, often working very long hours under considerable stress and personal sacrifices following extensive education and training, should pay “more than their fair share” and pay “other people’s share”, as indeed they presently do. But the reality is that earnings above $200,000 cannot be considered to be a need and the wealthy do exceedingly well and still would with increased marginal rates. They benefit from a stable and prosperous society in a way that those earning average wages and below never can, and are far less vulnerable. Sufficient incentive to advance to such income levels has to be preserved mindful of the fact that, for example doctors and surgeons can earn vastly more after tax overseas. Likewise, professionals, advanced technical specialists, business people and senior managers where the highest calibre people are essential to NZ for it to prosper and improve. Such people must not be lost overseas and need to be attracted from overseas. Higher marginal rates would encourage greater retained-profit earnings being left in businesses, available for investment in productivity and R&D. Trusts The 33% flat tax rate is arguably “unfair” visa via the present top personal income tax rate and company tax rate, but probably ok as is. Capital gains tax Any CGT would be a wildly fluctuating and therefore an extremely unreliable source of tax revenue. During recessions and flat periods which run for 4-5 years in most decades virtually no CGT revenue would be received by government at the very time that other income and taxes fall and government needs to support the economy and welfare more. CGT risks incentivising politicians of whatever ilk to allow policies which support asset inflation, aggravating debt and crisis fall-out. During booms CGT would tend to give politicians a false and dangerous sense of fiscal availability. CGT is also hugely complicated. During the routine recessions capital losses over the course of 3-4 years are normal for property, whether realised (including by mortgagee sales due to bank calls on debts), or retained. Will such losses be useable to offset past or future CGT as they logically must? It would be -2- farcical, never mind “unfair”, to pay CGT then in following years for substantial market value retracement to occur after earlier market values were shown to be temporary. How would loss carry forwards be dealt with administratively? How to assess CGT when someone has improved a property, to whatever degree? Should personal labour and project management be chargeable as an improvement expense deductible with other costs from a subsequent market value of the asset? Is not property improvement to be encouraged to lengthen its usable life? What rate of inflation should be factored in to assess a real rather than nominal capital gain? How should the improved asset value be “fairly” realistically assessed in consideration of the effect that improvement often has on market value; i.e. should a credit be based on costs, or “marked to market” factoring in the added appeal of an improved property at sale? Alternatively, what if costs are greater than market sale price? CGT fails the simplicity and efficiency tests. Also, evidence overseas is universal that it has not prevented run away house prices, with around a million dollars being common in most OECD cities. Realistically, property prices may finally be close to their ultimate ceiling, constrained by incomes which are inelastic, bank lending limits, and no more room for lower interest rates. It would instead be better policy, compulsory for all governments, and councils, to proactively track and ensure housing supply apace with population increase (or better, slash the latter to save billions on infrastructure and services which never keep up). Use of tax revenues The counterpart always must be disciplined controls of spending by all government related and local body organisations. “Nice to haves”, excesses and waste must be avoided. Private enterprise and prudent household like financial and operational disciplines are imperative across all activities. GST Ok as is. Must not complicate with exemptions like food, fruit and vegetables, or anything else. Inheritance duties Thrift among families should be encouraged morally and to improve wealth building which increases capital pools available for productive investment whether in housing stock, finance lending, children’s’ higher education, business investment, or equities. “Blowing it” in response to the threat of inheritance tax would be bad for the economy and underpin NZ’s weak savings and investment capital. Wealth or asset taxes Built up wealth has already been taxed as income. Moreover, it would be repugnant to tax the face value of assets (except land banking as described below). Tax must otherwise be limited to income, i.e. payable from net inward cash flows. The objective of working bloody hard and being prudent over a working life time is to accumulate assets including lifestyle and investments for retirement, from which income only should be taxed at personal, Trust or company rates, to the exclusion of non-cash producing assets including family home and bach (touch the latter will be like the plan to slash the recreational snapper catch with riots in the streets; plenty of quite ordinary folk including tradesmen with families enjoy their bachs as a sanctuary from hard work). Land tax –land banking These are challenging and problematic to regulate and administer, however there is a serious need to discourage land banking where speculator-investors withhold the availability of land within urban boundaries from development for many years. Regarding “fairness”, the greater good prevails (no thanks to over population). Loss of agricultural land for urban expansion, and urban boundaries, to be considered. -3- Negative gearing tax relief on rental housing Very dangerous for rental housing stock to remove this particularly now that house prices are sky high hence a barrier to investment and limiting potential for capital gain, plus with increased government impositions and costs on rental ownership and p.i.t.b. of dealing with tenants and maintenance. Negative gearing tax relief surely exists to encourage rental stock (rentals house about 70% more people per house than privately occupied homes). Thanks! Rod McIntyre MBA, NZIQS \[1\]

Despite 100 years of trying there is little to suggest it is an effective tool to improve housing affordability. • Land tax exemptions narrow the potential land tax base, add to administrative complexity, encourage avoidance and introduce economic distortions. They should be limited as much as possible. • A land tax with exemptions will not be paid by landlords, they will pass it on to tenants. If the family home is to be exempt from land tax, residential rental property should also be exempted to prevent further biasing the tax system towards homeownership and to limit adverse consequences to renters. • Land tax levying taxation unconnected to income can lead to cash flow problems for taxpayers. This is worse in poor economic conditions which can lead to pressure for exemptions that risk undermining the tax. • Land subject to land tax should be revalued annually. • A broad based land tax with a low, flat rate should be introduced. However including exemptions will likely undermine its benefits. 2 Introduction I am a PhD student at Victoria University of Wellington, presently researching my thesis on the historical use of land taxation in New Zealand from 1891-1991. Based upon my work and findings I offer the following observations and recommendations as to the potential implementation of a new land tax for New Zealand. I am happy for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact me about this submission. The Purpose Of Land Tax Historically there have been two uses for land tax in New Zealand; as a social policy tool to discourage land aggregation and speculation while improving land affordability or as a revenue instrument to raise tax revenue. While there have been attempts to achieve both, these aims are somewhat contradictory and benefit from different approaches. A social policy orientated land tax aims to discourage land holding for speculative purposes or in excessive quantities, reducing land demand and therefore lowering prices. This can take the form of broad based taxation or a targeted approach where the tax falls more heavily upon those taxpayers who own the most valuable, or greatest amounts, of land. Regardless of the chosen base, the key element is tax rates high enough to encourage behavioural changes. This social policy focus was the main driver of New Zealand’s old land tax which adopted a targeted approach through the inclusion of high tax free value thresholds and graduated rates. There is little evidence that land tax in New Zealand was ever especially effective at reducing land prices or demand however. This may have been because the base was too narrow, historically the vast majority landowners were excluded, or the tax rates were insufficient. Following the introduction of a new land tax a small fall in the price of any liable land would be expected as future tax payments are capitalised but there is some evidence to suggest that a land tax could achieve larger falls. In 1937 and 1988 land tax was predicted to lead to prices decreases of around 25%. Both cases occurred during poor economic conditions and saw high tax rates (2-2.5%) artificially inflated through the use of land value records that predated the most recent economic crash (the Great Depression and 1987 Share Market Crash respectively). In these cases the value changes were limited to a relatively small group of properties; estates worth more than £40,000 in 1938 1 and commercial property within the Wellington CBD in 1988. 2 This suggests that a land tax could result in a large falls in land prices but the required rates are very high and changes appear limited to land liable for the tax. That means that a land tax excluding the family home would probably not have a significant effect on housing affordability, regardless of the rate. Historically attempts have been made in New Zealand to make the land tax burden more targeted to discourage particular types of landholding. In the past this has seen the addition of 50% higher rates for absentee landholders and unimproved land in an attempt to limit foreign ownership and land banking. In neither case was this especially effective. Additional taxation for unimproved land required additional assessment by the Tax Department who lacked both resources and expertise to 1 MacLaclan, R J, The Effect Of Graduated Land Tax On Unimproved Value, 19 January 1939, (AAVI W3486 12/270 Box 32, Archives New Zealand) 2 Central City Land Valuation Face 25% Fall In Tax Squeeze, National Business Review, 1 December 1988 3 actually do it, so it was seldom assessed. 3 The absentee tax had the potential to be a useful deterrent to absentee landholding but it was vulnerable to avoidance, with trust and company structures generally used to give landholdings a nominally New Zealand based owner. If the avoidance issues could be solved an absentee tax may be a useful tool the limit landowning by non- residents. Aside from dubious evidence of effectiveness, a social policy focused land tax as has other weaknesses, primarily that it is not a sustainable revenue source. As land tax discourages non- exempt land holding, revenue falls. Should a social policy focused land tax be successful, new taxation will be required in the future to offset the revenue loss. More targeted approaches can also be vulnerable to avoidance through ownership splitting, potentially requiring new anti-avoidance rules to deal with it, and do not align with the broad based taxation generally embodied by the New Zealand tax system. Conversely a land tax designed to optimise revenue is generally regarded as simpler. This land tax should be broad based, with few, if any, exemptions, and a low, flat rate. This expands the tax base to include a generally untaxed capital element while producing a relatively sustainable revenue source. This generally does not impose economic distortions and should have little to no effect on existing land holding behaviour, but this means it is ineffective as a tool to improve land affordability. This approach is less vulnerable to avoidance. It is also easier to administer, reducing the strain on Inland Revenue resources that marred land tax administration throughout the 1980s. A revenue focused land tax that does not include the family home is workable, it is the approach New Zealand’s last land tax took from 1983. However this collects much less revenue; it previous peaked at 1.03% of total tax revenue, 4 and has historically been criticised as not worth effort and aggravation it causes. The previous tax working group recommended the adoption of a land tax conforming to the revenue model. 5 This is generally recognised as best practice and what New Zealand land tax was moving towards before abolition in 1990. Land tax as a social policy tool, while sounding good, is undermined by limited evidence that it works, despite 100 years of New Zealand experience with it. Recommendation: Any new land tax should be introduced with a revenue focus. The preferred model would be a broad based, low rate, flat tax applying to almost all land, including family home, but the current Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference mean that option will not be considered. Nonetheless exemptions should be as restricted as possible. The Burden of Land Tax The 2010 Tax Working Group raised questions as to where the burden of land tax would fall. Theoretically a pure land tax should fall on land owners who, because it applies equally to all land, 3 Report Upon The Provisions And Operation Of The Land And Income Tax Act 1923 And Its Amendments, 1937, page 204 4 Chapter 25. Public Sector Finance, New Zealand Yearbook 1992 5 A Tax System For New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, January 2010, page 11 4 would be unable to pass the tax on. This sees land tax as less favourable to those who hold more of their wealth in land. The 2010 Tax Working Group identified Maori authorities and those with landholdings but limited incomes, such as retirees, as likely to be particularly affected. An exemption for the family home would likely limit the adverse effects for retirees but is less likely to help Maori authorities. The traditional solution to this has been to exempt Maori authorities. An exemption for communally owned Maori land was included within the old land tax from 1891 and lasted the tax’s entire life. This was always a matter on administrative practically and as late as 1989 attempts to remove it were stalled when Treasury was unable to figure out how doing so would work. 6 While exemption does solve the problem, an exemption based on Maori ownership can be seen as discriminatory by the public. The inclusion of exemptions within land tax sees its burden move further beyond landowners however. Once exemptions are included the theoretical inability to pass on land tax breaks down, creating a particularly bad situation for tenants. As land tax began to apply to more property over the 1980s and owner-occupied residential housing was exempted 7 Treasury observed that land tax does not fall on landlords who generally passed it onto their tenants, either directly or through increased rents. 8 This occurred for both residential and commercial tenancies and there is nothing to suggest that it would not reoccur if a new land tax was implemented. The increased rental cost, particularly for residential tenants, risks further biasing the New Zealand tax system in favour of home ownership and penalising the poorer and younger members of society who cannot afford to own their own home. Furthermore increasing rental costs is unlikely to help alleviate the rental shortage presently being experienced in some cities. 9 The historical solution to this problem was to expand the exemption for owner-occupied residential property to any property used for the purpose of a residential home, whether owner-occupied or tenanted. 10 Including this in any new land tax would likely reduce the harm faced by residential renters but would exempt many investment properties, undercutting any intention to use land tax to discourage land speculation. With exemptions for land used for the family home and residential tenancies the majority of land tax would be paid by businesses. This is broadly the same as how land tax operated in New Zealand from the 1960s. 11 While the cost is generally absorbed by the businesses, in the past greater land tax bills have led to concerns that the tax would be passed on to consumers through higher prices or that that businesses may reduce operations and employment as land tax costs increase. 12 Land dependent industries such as agriculture are generally worse effected and have usually been 6 Treasury, Review Of Exemptions From Land Taxation, 22 June 1989 (AALR W5427 873 Box 1862, Archives New Zealand) 7 Land Tax Amendment Act 1983, s3 8 Treasury, Budget Report 137, 27 April 1988 (AALR W5427 873 Box 1861, Archives New Zealand) 9 Stuff.co.nz, 'Massive' demand for Wellington rentals and shortage won't ease soon, Trade Me says, 19/01/2017, https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/property/100675144/rentals-in-hot-demand-and-shortage-wont-ease- anytime-soon-trade-me 10 Land Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1988, s2 11 Taxation In New Zealand: Report of the Taxation Review Committee, Appendix to the Journals of the House of Representatives, 1967, B-18, page 413 12 Wellington Shopkeepers Seek Land Tax Review, National Business Review, 17 March 1988; Major Recession Seen For Capital Through Land Tax, Evening Post 23/3/88 5 exempted. This appears to have been based on the political influence of farmers rather than policy grounds however. As farmers are operating a business they should be liable for land tax. Recommendation: If an exemption for the family home must be included within the land tax it should be expanded to any home used for residential purposes. Recommendation: Despite historical precedent farmers should not be land tax exempt. Miscellaneous Issues One major problem with implementing a new land tax would be its sustainability. Land tax levying a cost unconnected to an income flow is not ideal and has the potential to lead to cash flow problems in the best of circumstances but can put the system under serious pressure in poor economic climates. As taxpayers’ normal income streams are lessened in poor economic conditions the largely fixed expense of land tax can be difficult to pay and when this affects large groups of people it leads to political pressure for exemptions and tax relief. This was seen following economic crashes in both 1929 and 1987. The problem is worsened by the existing exemptions in the system as they set a precedent and taxpayers will argue their liability is comparatively unfair. When economic conditions improve these exemptions are not fully rolled back gradually undermining the land tax’s usefulness. Recommendation: Land tax exemptions should be limited to make it more likely to be politically sustainable. Valuations used for land tax purposes need to be revalued frequently and responsive to market changes. New Zealand land tax has been historically be plagued by slow revaluations. In good times as land prices rose land values quickly became understated, reducing potential tax revenue and, following revaluations, forcing taxpayers to deal with large tax increases they were often not expecting. 13 In those times when land prices actually fall slow revaluations see taxpayers paying tax on values that no longer exist, creating significant public hostility to the towards the land tax and further increasing political pressure for exemptions and tax relief. Past experience shows that set revaluation periods are required to prevent these problems but revaluations every five or three years were not quick enough. Annual revaluations have previously been considered by governments 14 but have a higher cost and have never be implemented. Nonetheless annual revaluation is likely the best approach. Recommendation: Land subject to land tax should be revalued annually. It is worth considering the degree to which any new land tax would bind the Crown. Traditionally land owned by the government, government departments and local government has been exempt from land tax. However in 1989, as part of an attempt to align the public sector with the principles of 13 Following the 1988 and 1989 revaluations of Wellington and Auckland many taxpayers land their land tax liability increase by more than 600% compared to the previous year 14 Butcher, D, Press Release: Land Tax Issue Linked To Unreal Property Values, 12 May 1989 (AALR W5427 873 Box 1862, Archives New Zealand) 6 the State Sector Act 1988, 15 land tax was amended to apply to most land owned by government departments and local government. It was hoped that forcing these entities to operate under the same cost environment as the private sector would encourage efficiency, accountability and transparency. Expanding land tax to government departments essentially acts as a budget cut. In some cases this can be politically unpopular with the public, such as the taxation of schools or hospitals, 16 while the taxation of some other land, including that used for the road system and national parks, makes little sense. Upon local government this policy would impose significant costs. 17 Accordingly the original policy created hostility from local authorities, who saw it as an exercise in central government greed, 18 and any attempts to re-implement it likely face significant opposition. Recommendation: A new land tax should exempt publicly owned land Conclusion The usefulness of any potential land tax depends upon what those implementing it want to achieve; if the intention is to improve housing affordability other measures are likely to be more successful but it has promise if targeted solely as a revenue source. It has the potential to raise revenue while producing little economic distortion and diversify the existing tax base. Any land tax will stand or fall based on its exemptions however. Exemptions do not just narrow the potential land tax base, they add to administrative complexity, encourage avoidance and introduce economic distortions which cause the tax burden to move. They establish a precedent and over time they will be widened, undermining the tax’s usefulness. Ideally I would recommend introducing a land tax with very few exemptions that does tax the family home but this working group is not empowered to consider that. In light of this restriction I find it more difficult to recommend a land tax. In the short term it may produce some amount of revenue but I would not be surprised if it followed historical precedent and its usefulness was eroded over time. Other tax reforms would likely have greater benefit. 15 Treasury, Budget Report 117, 29 June 1989 (AALR W5427 873 Box 1862, Archives New Zealand) 16 Hospitals were made liable for land taxation the 1989 budget.

Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This submission is based on that of the NZ Taxpayers Union. I have added comments (see italics) from my perspective as an investor and residential and commercial landlord. This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low-investment, low-productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Overseas based companies, especially those gaining revenue from Internet sales and advertisements in NZ, should pay tax here, rather than shift the profit to low or no tax jurisdictions. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). Depreciation should also be allowed for Housing, or at least some components. Real estate (buildings) does indeed depreciate. For instance, compensation was considered for a property I had due to a proposed Transmission Line (High Voltage with a 40m high pole) going across it. The dwelling was valued below cost by the Valuers who stated that it (a relocatable house) was depreciated to below its cost, due to its age. Clearly building (especially tenanted ones) do depreciate. Allow full deduction on “improvements” to properties. Such examples include the mandatory requirement to upgrade insulation, ventilation and heating. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. However, If CGT was to be introduced on residential housing, it should be for both investment and owner-occupied housing. If not on the latter, then there will be incentives for investors to upgrade their own properties but not those of their tenants. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Children’s saving accounts should be exempt from tax. This would encourage them to save from an early age. To balance any distortions that could occur, the money should only be able to be used for “legitimate” purposes, such as transfer to their Kiwisaver Accounts (currently there is no incentive for those under 18 to contribute) or for educational or health purposes. A limit can be put on this, such as the first $200 (inflation adjusted back to the time when that was the limit) being tax free. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, John Paynter MSc, BCom, JP \[1\]

The submission highlights a range of different approaches adopted by Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development to debt collection. In addition, the submission notes the different approaches to debt collection adopted across a range of other government agencies and recommends consideration of a centralised debt collection agency to manage government debt. This would increase equity with consistent treatment of debtors holding government debt and potentially increase collection of debt. The submission also recommends consideration of the use of director penalty notices where companies enter into liquidation with outstanding withholding taxes. The final recommendation is consideration of greater funding for the Inland Revenue audit, investigation and litigation functions, which will further assist with revenue collection. 1 INTRODUCTION Thank you for the opportunity to make a submission to the 2018 Tax Working Group. This submission focuses on two connected issues: revenue collection and fairness. Higher levels of government revenue may be achieved from the implementation of new taxes or increasing extant taxes. However, it may also be achieved from greater focus on collecting tax that is known to be owed and/or pursuing tax that is hidden and not known to be owed. Thus, the primary focus of this submission is on tax debt collection and management. Collecting additional tax revenue owing will contribute to the fiscal objective of supporting a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure. Ensuring that everyone who has a legal obligation to pay tax is actually paying the amount owed will improve fairness in the tax system. Fairness extends not only to tax policy, but also to the application and implementation of that policy. This submission has four parts. Part one outlines the background to the issues addressed in this submission. Part two provides a more detailed analysis of the issues outlined. Part three discusses some possible options with recommendations provided in part four. 2 BACKGROUND Table 1 shows Inland Revenue debt as at 2016/17 and for the previous five years.

Inland Revenue writes off significant amounts of tax debt each year. This may be through insolvency or bankruptcy, or through negotiated outcomes undertaken with Inland Revenue. Table 2 shows the value of Inland Revenue debt written off in 2015/16. Over $1.1 billion of tax revenue was written off in this period. The majority of the debt written off was from core tax ($936 million).

This is only one example of evaded tax. The amounts written off by Inland Revenue may be contrasted with those written off by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) shown in Table 4. In 2015/16 Inland Revenue wrote off $1.1 billion of debt, while MSD wrote off $13 million. The amounts classified as overpayments in Table 4 are those that result from error. This error may be on the part of the Ministry or error by the recipient of the welfare benefit. It has not been possible to get a breakdown of the overpayment amount in order to identify how much of this amount is accurately classified as debt; therefore, this amount may be overstated. Table 4: Ministry of Social Development Debt Written-Off (2015/16) 10 Debt Type Amount Recoverable assistance (loans) $3,512,935 Fraud $1,057,137 Overpayment $8,698,572 Total $13,268,644 Writing off significant amounts of tax debt creates equity issues between taxpayers. Taxpayers who earn only wages and salaries have no option to not pay their tax, as it is deducted at source. They therefore do not benefit from the options available to other taxpayers to negotiate outcomes with Inland Revenue. The different treatments of tax debtors and welfare debtors generates further inequities in the tax system. Inland Revenue and MSD have different approaches to: remission or writing-off debt; the treatment of debtors who are suffering from serious hardship; the treatment of the partners of debtors where fraud exists; collection of debt; and amounts invested in collection of debt. Each of these is discussed below. 2.1 Writing off debt As noted above, Inland Revenue and MSD write off significantly different amounts of debt – over $1.1 billion by Inland Revenue and $13 million for MSD. The two agencies operate under different legislative provisions that, at least in part, contribute to this outcome. Under the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must maximise the recovery of outstanding tax from a taxpayer. 11 However, the Commissioner may not recover outstanding tax where it would be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue resources or would place the taxpayer (a natural person) in a position of serious hardship. 12 The duty to maximise revenue collection is subject to an overriding obligation to protect the integrity of the tax system as per s 6A(3) of the TAA, where the Commissioner of Inland 9 Inland Revenue, Research Reinforces Need for Simpler, Easier Tax Processes, Retrieved from: https://media.ird.govt.nz/articles/research-reinforces-need-for-simpler-easier-tax-processes/, 23 April 2018. 10 Information received under the OIA, 30 November 2017, Ministry of Social Development. 11 TAA s 176(1). 12 TAA s 176(2). 4 Revenue is charged with collecting: ‘over time the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law having regard to (a) the resources available to the Commissioner; and (b) the importance of promoting compliance, especially voluntary compliance, by all taxpayers with the Inland Revenue Acts; and (c) the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers’. By way of comparison, under section 86 of the Social Security Act 1964, the Chief Executive of MSD has a duty to ‘take all reasonably practicable steps to recover a debt’. The MSD approach to writing off debt is ‘where all reasonable and practicable avenues of recovery have been exhausted the Ministry may consider writing off the debt’. 13 Examples provided by MSD include where a debtor has died and the estate is insolvent or distributed prior to the Crown notifying its claim; where the debtor is insolvent and has been adjudicated bankrupt; or the Official Assignee has recognised under the No Asset Procedure that the debtor is insolvent with no realisable assets. 14 Death does not automatically result in the elimination of a welfare debt. Section 86(4) of the Social Security Act 1964 provides for recovery from the estates of a deceased beneficiary any excess amounts of benefit obtained. No similar provision exists for tax debtors. 15 Instead, taxpayers may approach Inland Revenue and request relief on their tax debts. Moreover, there are statutory provisions that provide for tax debt to be written off. 2.2 Serious hardship As noted in the previous sub-section, under the TAA the Commissioner of Inland Revenue must collect the highest net revenue that is practicable within the law, having regard to: available resources; the promotion of compliance by all taxpayers; and the compliance costs incurred by taxpayers. 16 Notwithstanding this objective, recovery of tax must not place the taxpayer in a position of serious hardship or be an inefficient use of Inland Revenue resources. 17 There are provisions within the TAA for taxpayers to apply for financial relief, such as when recovery of their tax debt will place them in a position of ‘serious hardship.’ 18 The TAA definition of serious hardship includes when the taxpayer would be unable to meet:  minimum living expenses estimated according to normal community standards of cost and quality;  the costs of medical treatment for an illness or injury of the taxpayer or their dependant;  the cost of education for the taxpayer’s dependants; or 13 Information received under the OIA, 9 May 2013, Ministry of Social Development. 14 Information received under the OIA, 30 November 2017, Ministry of Social Development. 15 There is no specific provision in the Revenue Acts for the Inland Revenue Department to collect tax debt from the estate of a deceased taxpayer. However, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be a creditor of an estate where taxes are owing, in the same manner as other creditors, and would accordingly have a civil claim against the estate ahead of other beneficiaries of that estate. Information was requested from the Inland Revenue Department on evaded taxes recovered from the estates of decreased taxpayers. I was advised this information is not recorded in a readily accessible format and was not able to be provided. 16 TAA, s 6A(3). 17 TAA, s 176(2)(a)-(b). 18 TAA, s 177. Not all tax debt is eligible for financial relief, such as some tax evasion debt. 5  other factors that the Commissioner thinks are relevant. 19 Compliance, or non-compliance, with tax obligations is not a factor taken into consideration when making the decision on financial relief. 20 ‘Normal community standards of cost and quality’ must take into account the individual circumstances of the taxpayer, such as which part of the country the taxpayer resides. 21 Inequity arises with the current treatment of serious hardship, as individuals who earn wages, salaries or other income where tax is deducted at source, do not have the same opportunity to negotiate with the Inland Revenue if they are in a similar position of serious hardship. Where Inland Revenue may remit or write-off penalties, interest and/or tax debt in cases of hardship, MSD will take hardship into account by ‘negotiating realistic repayment rates with debtors so that significant hardship is not caused’, 22 while also noting that ‘hardship does not necessarily preclude recovery’. 23 In ‘exceptional circumstances’ payment may be temporarily deferred until a person’s financial circumstance improves in order that significant hardship is not caused. 24 However, the different approaches insofar as what is serious hardship for a taxpayer and what is serious hardship for a welfare recipient result in different outcomes. 2.3 Partners of debtors From 7 July 2014, amendments to the Social Security Act 1964 result in partners of those who receive overpayments of welfare benefits resulting from relationship fraud becoming potentially jointly and severally liable for the debt generated from fraud committed by their partners. Moreover, criminal liability for the fraud may be extended to the partner of the individual who committed the fraud. Prior to this change of legislation, only the person who received the welfare benefit was liable for the welfare debt and prosecution was only actionable against the person engaging in the fraudulent activity. Under the amended legislation, the liability arises where the partner of the beneficiary who committed the fraud has benefited from the fraud either knowingly, or where they ought to have known they were benefiting from fraud. 25 The partner of the beneficiary who has committed the fraud does not need to know the precise amount of the fraud, or how the fraud occurred. At the time of the legislative change, a number of issues with the legislation were noted, including one from the New Zealand Law Society who submitted that: ‘absent a positive act that would normally ground criminal liability ... the justification for criminal liability is not apparent’ . 26 Importantly, these 19 TAA, s 177A(2). 20 TAA, s 177A(3). 21 Inland Revenue, Standard Practice Statement SPS 15/03 Writing Off Outstanding Tax (Inland Revenue, 2013) 56. 22 Office of the Associate Minister for Social Development (2012) Welfare Debt Recovery, 3. 23 Above n.22, 2. 24 Above n 22, 3. 25 A person ‘ought to have known’ they were benefiting from funds obtained fraudulently when ‘they would have known had they made inquiries that a reasonable person would have made’ (above n.22). This is interpreted as the person may not actually have known they were benefiting from fraud, but should have been aware of the possibility that they were (above n.22). Social Security Act 1964, s.86AA(4). 26 New Zealand Law Society, (2013) Social Security (Fraud Measures and Debt Recovery) Amendment Bill, Submission by the New Zealand Law Society, http://www.lawsociety.org.nz, 6. 6 legislative changes dilute the generally accepted foundation that all individuals in society are treated as equals. 27 The amended legislation targets a single group of people for more punitive treatment in the justice system, because they are receiving a welfare benefit. If there is valid reason for, and benefit from, targeting the partners of those on welfare on the basis of presumed guilt, then a logical extension is to include the partners of those convicted of tax evasion or other forms of financial fraud where partners are also likely to benefit from the offending. Adopting a similar approach to the partners of tax evaders would address some of the inequity that exists from this legislation that currently applies only to a small section of society, i.e. welfare recipients. 2.4 Use of deduction notices / asset seizures The TAA has a number of provisions that allow for deductions of tax from payments such as wages, salaries or individual bank accounts, when tax debt exists. 28 Table 5 outlines information on the use of deduction notices by Inland Revenue and MSD. 29 Deduction notices were issued to 7-12% of welfare recipients. This compares to around 1% of taxpayers. It is noted that despite many more deduction notices being issued to welfare recipients, many welfare debtors will not be employed or have few financial assets from which debt can be collected. Table 5: Deduction Notices Issued (2011-2015) 30 Tax Welfare Year Ended Notices Issued % of Taxpayers Year Ended Notices Issued % of Welfare Recipients 30 Jun 11 64,025 0.915% 30 Dec 2011 20,275 6.76% 30 Jun 12 68,501 0.979% 30 Dec 2012 25,733 8.58% 30 Jun 13 57,395 0.820% 30 Dec 2013 33,425 11.14% 30 Jun 14 66,126 0.945% 30 Dec 2014 35,115 11.71% 30 Jun 15 73,013 1.043% 30 Dec 2015 36,269 12.09% Inland Revenue advise that 36 charging orders in total were applied under section 169 of the TAA over the five-year period shown in Table 5. A charging order prevents a debtor from selling the property over which the charging order is placed until the creditor has had the opportunity to seize or sell it to satisfy any outstanding debt. Inland Revenue do not seize assets from debtors. Instead, they advise that they have other, more efficient, mechanisms to collect debts. However, the values of debts written off suggests that there is capacity to supplement these mechanisms with other tools, such as asset seizures or greater use of deduction notices. 27 Sen, A. The Idea of Justice (Penguin Group, 2009). 28 TAA, s 157. 29 Deduction notices are issued to third parties, typically banks or employers, in order that deductions are taken from amounts payable to the debtor. Deductions may be lump sums or instalment arrangements. 30 Information received under the OIA, 12 July 2016, Inland Revenue and 30 November 2017, Ministry of Social Development. 7 2.5 Stronger penalties In cases of serious tax evasion, Inland Revenue has access to stronger penalty options, such as criminal prosecution. However, these are infrequently used and only a small number of criminal prosecutions take place each year. Instead, Inland Revenue will typically endeavour to negotiate repayment options with taxpayers who have incurred tax debts. Conversely, MSD will prosecute in situations where the case meets the Crown Law and MSD guidelines for prosecution, which is in approximately one-quarter of cases investigated. Inland Revenue pursues approximately 50-60 prosecutions each year for serious tax offending, while MSD pursues approximately 700-900 for welfare fraud. Thus, around 15 times as many prosecutions take place for welfare offending as compared to tax offending. In addition, approximately 15-20 times as many investigations occur for welfare cases than for tax cases. 31 While tax cases are likely to be more complex and therefore more costly to investigate and prosecute, this does not fully explain the different approaches to financial fraud that are adopted between the two agencies. 2.6 Investment in collection At $3 billion of known debt and potentially many billions more of undetected tax, tax debt is economically more significant than welfare debt (currently around $1 billion). However, there is greater effort to collect welfare debt. Recent data is not available, therefore I have used data obtained in 2012. In 2011/12 the cost of debt recovery for welfare debt was $17.00 for each $100 collected. 32 At June 2012, the tax debt recovery cost was $2.86 for collecting $100 of overdue revenue. 33 At the same time, 92% of current MSD clients with debts were repaying their obligations with average payments of $14.32 per week while 13% of Inland Revenue debts were repaying by instalment. 34 The different costs of collection are likely to reflect the different approaches to debt collection: MSD collects a large number of smaller payments and cannot write off debt except within a limited range of circumstances. 2.7 Comparison across agencies Table 6 outlines the different amounts written off across a number of agencies. Table 6 also shows the number of deduction notices served by each agency and whether the relevant legislation has a provision to alleviate debt when the debtor is in a situation of serious hardship. The final row shows the proportion of write-offs against year-end debt held by the respective agency. Table 6 shows that Inland Revenue writes off significant amount of tax – 85 times the amount written off by MSD. All the other government departments shown write off relatively low amounts when compared to Inland Revenue. While the amount of student loan debt written off is low, the amount of write-downs of the debt are high and comparable to the write-downs of Inland Revenue. Student loan write-downs are due to the high cost to the government of providing student debt facilities. 31 Lisa Marriott, Justice and the Justice System: A comparison of tax evasion and welfare fraud in Australia and New Zealand, Griffith Law Review, 22(2013): 403-429. 32 Lisa Marriott, Unpaid Tax and Overpaid Welfare: A comparison of the debt recovery approaches in New Zealand, New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy, 20(2014):46-70. 33 Data provided under the Official Information Act 1982, 9 May 2013. 34 Above n.32. 8 While it appears that the Ministry for the Environment write-off a high proportion of their debt, the actual amount written off is low at $55,042 (or around 1/20,000 of that written off by Inland Revenue).

This section outlines a range of possible options. 3.1 Director penalty notices Typically, non-compliance with tax laws results in some form of civil or criminal action which, if the offender is found guilty, results in some form of punishment. However, there are situations where non-compliance does not result in a negative consequence, such as when companies enter liquidation and, as a result, withholding taxes that have been deducted are not paid to the government. Unlike some other countries, New Zealand company directors are not automatically liable for certain tax debts (such as pay-as-you-earn deductions (PAYE), goods and services tax (GST), pension contributions and other amounts withheld from employee salaries) if that company is wound up. In other countries, directors may be held liable for these taxes in the event that the company enters into insolvency, as these payments are held in trust by the company for the government or employees. Moreover, it is these taxes that a struggling entity may use for funding cash flow shortages when in a position of financial distress. By way of illustration, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom have schemes where directors may be personally liable for a company’s debts, in addition to the usual provisions that exist through 35 Sources: Official Information Act requests and annual reports from respective agencies. 36 Due to bankruptcy. 37 The Student Loan Scheme Act provides for the use of deduction notices, but it is not known if they have been used to help collect student loans. 38 This figure combines Inland Revenue and Student Loan debt as Inland Revenue cannot provide a break down between student loan write-offs, with the exception of that written off due to bankruptcy. 39 The write-off amount for MBIE is greater than the year-end receivables held. 9 company law (such as where there is fraudulent activity). In Australia, under the Director Penalty Notice regime the Commissioner of Taxation has powers to collect certain outstanding tax debts from company directors. These taxes are unpaid Pay-As-You-Go deductions and Superannuation Guarantee Charge amounts. 40 A similar provision exists in Canada, where it extends to GST, employee payroll deductions and the harmonized sales tax. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs in the UK may use Personal Liability Notices where negligence (or fraud) is present. A Personal Liability Notice will make the individual personally liable for PAYE, National Insurance Contributions or value-added-tax. The Personal Liability Notice is not limited to a liquidated company and may be issued to a going concern where there is risk of non-payment. 41 3.2 Increase investment in audit, investigation and litigation There are only a small number of tax prosecutions each year in New Zealand, where the criterion for prosecution is serious non-compliance. As revenue collection is the primary objective of Inland Revenue, prosecution proceeds in only the most serious of cases, as prosecution is unlikely to result in additional revenue. This differs to welfare fraud, where prosecution proceeds in over one-quarter of all cases detected. While Inland Revenue have recently adopted a range of other tools to encourage compliance, such as credit reporting, it is noted that recent funding for audit, investigations and litigation has not increased in line with revenue collection. 42 In 2011, the OECD published a document comparing debt collection mechanisms across OECD countries. 43 While this information dates back to 2009, it provides an historical perspective on resources invested in the debt collection mechanism in a range of countries. Across the 34 OECD member states reported, New Zealand had one of the lowest proportions of staff usage on debt collection and related functions at 9.4%. 44 New Zealand has a low cost of collection ratio for tax debt, which the OECD observe is used as a measure of efficiency and effectiveness of the administration. 45 New Zealand’s cost of collection ratio 40 Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Director’s personal liability for unpaid company tax, Retrieved from: <http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-directors/directors- personal-liability-for-unpaid-company-tax/> 15 December 2017.

Countries reporting lower proportions are: the Czech Republic (6.3%); Norway (5.1%); the Slovak Republic (5.5%); Switzerland (6.1%); and Turkey (7.8%). 45 OECD, Tax Administration 2015. Comparative Information on OECD and Other Advanced and Emerging Economies (OECD Publishing, 2015). 10 ((administration cost/net revenue collection)/1) is 0.85. 46 While this would appear to be a positive sign, other countries that have low cost of collection ratios typically have a low tax burden. In the case of New Zealand the low cost of collection may reflect a high level of efficiency or it may also reflect non-collection of debt that incurs higher costs to collect. Significant resource has been invested in improving tax compliance and collection in New Zealand. However, as observed by the OECD, there is little to be gained from sophisticated strategies for enhancing or enforcing compliance, if the tax owed is not actually collected. 47 Globally, governments are becoming more innovative in the methods used to assist with debt collection, such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition to assist with collecting tax debt (the Netherlands), 48 publishing the names of taxpayers with debts (Finland) or using specialist debt collection agencies (the UK). 49 The UK approach was reported as collecting an additional 77% more cash than if the debt collection agencies had not been used. 50 A range of factors have been identified as contributing to positive debt collection outcomes, including: the existence of extensive debt collection powers; the ability to collect taxes from third parties, close businesses and cancel licences; the ability to obtain liens over assets; requiring tax clearance prior to being awarded government contracts; withholding government payments where tax debt is outstanding; and imposing tax debts on company directors. 51 Additional factors include investment in information technology and effectively resourced tax authorities. The OECD note the importance of having a well-staffed debt collection function, which is organised within a dedicated unit. 52 3.3 Standardised Debt Collection Differences in debt collection are visible across different government agencies. Some agencies, such as the Ministry for Primary Industries, collect all fines, penalties and levies imposed. Others, such as the student loan scheme administered by Inland Revenue, collect around 55% of debt. In a small country such as New Zealand, there may be efficiency gains and more effective outcomes from a standardised approach to debt collection across all government debt. This would extend to collection of debt, penalties, interest or fines, as well as write-off provisions. Such an approach would increase transparency and equity, as all debtors would be treated equally. Currently, some debt, such as student loan debt or fines may be remitted where it is ‘just and equitable’ to do so. However, this is not the case for all debt. There is a case to be made that all debtors are entitled to ‘just and equitable’ treatment in relation to debt repayment. 46 Above n.45, Table 5.4, p.181. Data reported as at 2013. It is acknowledged that a range of factors can impact on these measures resulting in difficulties in engaging in cross-country comparisons. These factors include when the tax authority has other roles such as collecting social insurance contributions or excise taxes, the legislated tax burden or economic conditions. 47 OECD, Forum on Tax Administration. Scoping document: Working smarter in tax debt management (OECD Publishing, 2013). 48 OECD, Forum on Tax Administration. Information Note.

Some legislation permits remission of debt where the debtor is in a position of serious hardship. However, such a provision does not apply in a standardised manner to all debtors. Where hardship provisions do exist they do not result in equal treatment of different types of debtors. Those taxpayers whose tax is deducted at source do not have the potential to take advantage of the serious hardship provision. At the present time, multiple debt collection activity occurs across all agencies. Not only does this result in duplication of resources, it minimises the extent to which best practice used in larger government departments can be adopted by smaller government departments. The OECD note increased use of advanced analytics for targeting debtors with accompanying targeted intervention strategies. 53 Such tools could be appropriately shared across all debtors if debt management was the role of a coordinated agency. 4 RECOMMENDATIONS Following from the above discussion, please find below my recommendations for consideration by the Tax Working Group:  Investigate the process of writing off tax debt and consider introducing consistency of debt write- off processes for all government debt.  Consider the role of a centralised agency for government debt collection in order that debt collection approaches are consistent for all government debt.  Consider extending liability to partners of tax debtors where the tax debt results from fraudulent activity in order to achieve consistency with welfare fraud.  Consider increasing Inland Revenue funding for audits, investigations and litigation to assist with revenue collection. This will assist with deterrence of tax evasion, collection of revenue, and reduce the inequitable treatment of welfare debtors when compared to tax debtors.  Consider the adoption of a directors’ penalty regime, for withholding taxes, including GST, in the event of company insolvency. 53 OECD, Tax Administration 2017 Comparative Information on OECD and other Advanced and Emerging Economies (OECD Publishing, 2017) 18.

We are wanting to get ahead in life for my family and friends and being comfortable without being punished and restricted due to limited success. I hope this Tax Working Group is genuine in its intention. It is a major concern that political agendas with no sound basis are being employed to systematically deconstruct a working system into something bordering on a socialist state, distributing wealth because others feel they deserve equal reward for unequal effort. The Taxation system must not be used as a mechanism to socially control and dictate behaviour’s. Taxing people to control them will not work, it could be deemed a simple tax grab that has no evidence of working. Government needs to be there in support of All New Zealanders as a backup, not as a generational support system. Government interference is the cause of most problems in this country. Taking more from us will do nothing but make things work. When considering all these aspects of tax it is essential that the heart of the Working class isn’t ripped apart and that every avenue to get ahead in life is removed or taxed out of them to try and maintain "equality". Any additional, altered and increased taxes is an extremely high risk move for at best minimal rewards and this risks further eroding the ability of the average New Zealander and Family to get by let alone get ahead. The whole structure of the tax system is finely balanced and taking our money for a Governments agenda is wrong. We know how to spend our money better than any Government and we can do it more efficiently and responsibly. There are only TWO entities in this country that can systematically take what they want from the hard-earned income of the average worker. That is Central Government and local Authorities. The fact that all others must work within a strict budget and simply cannot go to their boss and say I want more money because i cannot work or live within a budget is unrealistic. The fact that Government and Local Authorities can do so at will without true justification is abhorrent. The main cause of the so-called Income inequality is Local Authorities and Central Government. Any changes that increase tax paid will only affect the average New Zealand in a negative way. By taking our money and telling us that Central Government and Local Authorities know how to utilize this money in a better way is wrong. All it does is create more dependency on Central Government to survive while removing further rights and motivation to advance each individuals situation. This allows for low productivity (which has always been an issue in this country) The vast majority of tax payers are workers and small businesses and they need to fully justify any increased financial intake with increased productivity 2 TAX WORKING GROUP DESCRIPTION/QUESTIONS AND SUBSQUENT RESPONSES/NOTES. "The Government has established the Tax Working Group (the Group) to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group has also been directed to apply a particular focus on the future to its work, with a view to exploring the major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond" This is a fair statement of intention however this vastly differs from points later specified in the Working Document. To do a thorough and proper examination of the whole Tax system must include ALL aspects of the System, not sections or specific areas. By specifying only sections of the Tax System is defeating the purpose of this whole exercise and does not truly investigate and determine what is appropriate. This is not comprehensive • changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring; - This is an important aspect that needs to be discussed and determined. All possible issues are unknown at this stage. There are far simpler solutions that have become a political football while this has continued • te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards; - Irrelevant to this. With the equity and business nous that Iwi have now established, this on it’s own should easily resolve itself and not require inclusion with this document • the changing nature of work; Unknown and speculative with inconclusive evidence and to predict or assume is dangerous particularly when it may involve major change or none at all. It is better to evolve at a slow, steady pace to keep things stable without being reckless. • technological change and the different business models that will bring; Unknown and speculative with inconclusive evidence and to predict or assume is dangerous particularly when it may involve major change or none at all. It is better to evolve at a slow, steady pace to keep things stable without being reckless. • falling company tax rates around the world; This is an important aspect that needs to be discussed and determined - they need to come down to complete and allow the majority of New Zealanders a chance to advance in life. More money in small business hands and more in the workers pockets clearly leads to less subsidies and benefits required to be distributed by Government • environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species; Unknown and speculative with inconclusive evidence. Very dangerous to go down a path that will be extremely costly especially if/when proven exaggerated or even wrong. Science can NEVER be settled. Perfect example is South Australia, fast track changes with extreme financial costs over a short period of time and significant damage to finanes for decades to come • growing concern about inequality; and This is caused by Government interference. Less tax intake, more money in small business and more money with the workers who try to contribute. Reward effort not envy • the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. New Zealand must refrain from Big spending and further debt as we are susceptible to any changes internationally. Let New Zealanders get themselves sorted. Government be there as a temporary support system The design of the current tax system New Zealand currently has a ‘broad-based, low-rate’ tax system. The Government raises about 3 90% of its tax revenue from three tax bases:1 • Individual income tax • Goods and services tax (GST) • Company income tax. There are very few exemptions to these three taxes (which is why our tax system is described as ‘broad-based’). The benefit of having a broad base is that it allows the Government to raise substantial revenue with relatively low rates of taxation. Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP. New Zealand’s tax system is distinct in other ways. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not generally use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour – with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes, which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking. New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings is also distinct. The tax system does not offer large concessions for retirement savings; retirement savings contributions are taxed when they are made and as investment income is earned, rather than when the savings are drawn down in retirement. The Group’s work provides an opportunity to examine whether a broad-based, low rate system remains fit-for-purpose, and whether there is a case to depart from the internationally distinctive approaches to behavioural taxes and retirement savings. It is also an opportunity to explore whether there is a case to broaden the base further, for example with new taxes such as a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home) The above is the tax system we have and has in general worked well. It is by no means the perfect system and there will never be the perfect system. Adding or increasing taxes is not the solution. That has always happened before and clearly it hasn’t worked. A tax in any form will always affect the middle and lower incomes as this will essentially remove their ability to live and survive without a Government handout. Stay away from workers livelihoods. Distributional outcomes Higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. According to established income measures, the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest incomes) pay around 35% of all income tax, whereas households in the lowest five income deciles (that is, 50% of households) collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax. The tax and transfer system (transfers are payments like Jobseeker Support and New Zealand Superannuation) reduces income inequality, although by less than most of our comparator countries. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to the Canadian system, but a smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average. Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income. Why are we comparing ourselves to other counties and then adjusting to suit them? Is there any evidence that they are right with their system and that it works? If our rates are similar then why increase? The issue is that we have with our location substantial additional costs that make it more expensive to live while these comparison countries do not have these. In general term we need to compare but for specific purposes it does relate as we will always more costs due our location. This aspect must be considered integral when considering more taxes. Taxing on wealth with no information about any impacts or consequences is not appropriate. I am middle New Zealand and sure I would like to be wealthy but certainly do not begrudge the well off. They work hard or produce new products and services, create jobs and have taken a risk etc. I feel no need to take from them for being successful. They have had to pay tax all the way through 4 their gains and to be punished for that is fundamentally wrong and very disturbing. There has to be avenue for risk taking, job creation, innovation and the distribution of wealth is essentially an envy tax This a clearly an envy tax. This is disgusting. Savings There is some debate about the influence of our tax settings on the rate and composition of saving in New Zealand. In a broad-based, low-rate tax system, there should ideally be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between different types of investments. Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform, but it may be possible to achieve more consistency in the treatment of different types of investments. 2 Long-term residential accommodation is also not subject to GST, but applying GST to rent would raise various practical and fairness issues. Savings is a weakness in New Zealand. We simply don’t because we cannot afford too. Remove or reduce tax on established, well defined saving schemes. Encourage people to do so. At this stage Kiwisaver is the only scheme that partially achieves this but the concern is that the different Governments over time will erode this by administering taxation around the edges which will diminish it effectiveness. Encourage not discourage saving Overall outcomes The Group is keen to hear public views on the overall performance of the tax system, and has a particular interest in assessments of the fairness and balance of our tax settings. Thinking outside the current system The current tax system is a simple and very effective way of generating sufficient funds for the Government. The fact that No Government has the ability to do what is right with the funds that are currently generated is disgraceful. Shouldn’t need to raid the workers limited money to cover the inabilities or incompetence of successive Governments. The system is fair if you contribute to it. Its not fair to see others rewarded for not doing it. That is not fair. Encourage workers to better themselves and discourage low productivity. Encourage contributions to society, not handouts New Zealand has reduced its use of other tax bases under the broad-based, low-rate tax system. Previous reforms have eliminated the sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty and cheque duty. New Zealand also does not levy financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes, or a general capital gains tax. The Group will examine whether there is a case to introduce any additional taxes, particularly in light of growing international debate about income and wealth inequality. The Group also acknowledges public concerns about the tax practices of some multinational corporations, which exploit inconsistencies and mismatches in domestic tax rules in order pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. In this regard, New Zealand is currently implementing a suite of measures – developed in cooperation with other OECD countries – that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment in New Zealand. But we also need to consider the taxation of income from the digital economy. Internet-based firms can trade with customers over the internet without having a physical presence in the customer’s country that is necessary for income tax to be charged under present rules. This issue is becoming increasingly important as the digital economy accounts for a greater proportion of business activity. The Group invites comment on what the public sees as the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system, and which of these should be addressed most urgently 5 The above statement in general is welcoming. This avenue is required to level the playing field for legitimate competition in the New Zealand market. There is one concern with the above statement. Income and wealth inequality. This is wrong. Income is determined by effort, productivity, work ethic and experience. You don’t pay people for any other reason but for what the job (not the person) is worth. Low skill, lower wage. If an individual is not happy with this then upskill, change job and work hard. It is up to the individual. As stated above a wealth tax is an envy tax. This is wrong. Appendix 1 The Tax Working Group has been established by the Government in order to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The Government’s starting position is that the guiding principle for the New Zealand tax system – namely, that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible – is sound. The Working Group will consider what improvements to this framework could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. In particular, the Working Group will consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade. The Government has the following objectives for the tax system: • A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected. The Current system is as close to achieving these objectives as possible. Adding to it or altering it will only erode its ability to achieve it successes • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy Removing more money from the tax payers will represent the complete opposite that it is trying to promote • A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP. As per The Tax Working Group document “Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP)”. This is achieved. Why take more and decrease the livelihood of most New Zealanders? • A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability. This is achieved. Why take more and decrease the livelihood of most New Zealanders? Housing Affordability is something that has no solution. This issue has been around for more than 50 years and can not be reversed without complete control of the government and a socialist state. Is this what is coming for New Zealand? • A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families. What does progressive tax even mean (socialist tax system). This is jargon speak for stealing from the people who work for the people who don’t. No Government can raise the standard of living for the lower incomes so it is easier to bring the middle down • An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. Current system is working well. Trying to fix or alter something working reasonably well will lead to complete disaster because it is done by the Government The Working Group should report to the Government on: • Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth. The current system is working as fair as possible and balanced correctly • Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. To technical for myself to respond • Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient. The current system is working as fair as possible and balanced correctly. Minor changes to personal tax brackets, raise the thresholds as previously proposed and make the first $10,000 tax free. This allows lower income earners to effectively see more of their money and use 6 accordingly. They know what’s best of them and how to use it for themselves and families. Give New Zealanders to power to look after themselves. Most can easily do it. Considering the substantial taxes already to be imposed on all of us, there needs to be relief in the form of our money in our pockets. Its not being greedy to want more of your own money, its greedy to want more of other people’s money • Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals. In examining the points above, the Working Group should consider in particular the following Taxing companies, trusts and individuals already occurs, everyone and everything has to pay. Trust and individuals with average earnings pay the top tax rate, well above the company tax yet they do not have the ability of claim back or offset to the same extent of businesses. All three should be brought down to the level of businesses in the name of “Fairness”: • The economic environment that will apply over the next 5-10 years, taking into account demographic change, and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices, and how these are driving different business models Too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment • Whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system. This will have a detrimental effect. New taxes always do • Whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment. No exemptions. The rate must stay the same. If there is threshold smaller businesses will likely avid expansion if it meant incurring additional tax and compliance costs. It is tough enough and this will simply complicate it. Try to maintain the simple system we have • What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. In considering the matters above, the Working Group should have due regard to the overall structure of the tax system to ensure it is fair, balanced and efficient, as well as simple for taxpayers to understand and comply with their tax obligations. The following are outside the scope of the Working Group’s review: The Government role is to maintain the current system and make sure that it is strictly adhered too. Before altering a simple system to increase revenue, the Government must allow the IRD to effectively chase and punish all entities that are deliberately avoiding paying a reasonable amount of tax (corporates and multinationals etc). Then Government must be tougher on outstanding debts owed to it. That is the first thing that must done before even considering taking more from people who cannot afford it. • Increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST Income tax rates must remain as is but the thresholds need to be increased to allow for lower and middle-income earners especially to have more of their hard earned money. Each individual/family knows best how to budget their own money. Allowing (which is pathetic term really considering they earned the money not the Government) them to have more of their own money means less dependency of Government benefits. The current cycle does not and will never work. Stop stealing our money. • Inheritance tax Families spend decades scrimping and saving. Parents and other family sacrifice so that their family can go on comfortably without having to suffer like they did. What right does Government have to punish these people who contributed their whole life to the tax system and then with their remaining money/assets try to take a another cut of something because you feel like it because it not fair. This is an ENVY Tax and I oppose this • Any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or the land under it. The current system is achieving this. Stop this punishing regime and leave New Zealanders with a bit of dignity. By removing any motivation to advance in life is only going to cause more problems • The adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system (this will be considered as part of a separate review of Working for Families). In addition, the focus of the 7 Working Group should not be on more technical matters already under review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme,including: There haven’t been any major flaws exposed so why fix something that is not broken. Other than that, this is too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment further • International tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda Too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment • Policy changes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The Working Group will be able to recommend further reviews be undertaken on specific issues which the group considers it has not been able to explore sufficiently, or that were excluded from its terms of reference but which could benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations. The Working Group’s membership will include individual(s) with expertise in Māori community and business environments. Too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? The current system is as fair is it can be as outlined in the Tax Working Group Distributional outcomes. It clearly indicated the following “Higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. According to established income measures, the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest incomes) pay around 35% of all income tax, whereas households in the lowest five income deciles (that is, 50% of households) collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax.” The top income earner pays a large proportion of tax and increasing that would be unfair. Therefore do the majority of middle New Zealand (middle Incomes) have to be taxed higher? Is that fair? I don’t think so. The balance is correct. The only changes to personal tax that should happen are bracket creep and the first $10,000 be tax free. That is fair Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? This is by far the best system that I have heard of. In comparison to other systems overseas there seems to be a complexity to other systems that is not here. This system for most New Zealanders is great because it is simply dealt with and most people don’t need to do anything at all. It is dealt with on their behalf. It works well so don’t stuff it up Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Tobacco and Alcohol are two that we have to control behavior. Does this or any other government truly believe that controlling the masses with more and more taxes is an effective way to remove bad behavior. What right does the Government have to impose on people this dictatorial way of compliance. A sugar tax, an environmental tax, a fuel tax and the list goes on and on. The stated reason would be to save the tax payers the burdon of costs to the economy or the health system. The really reason in 8 Government control. It would be just the first step and this would allow future Governments to impose more taxes and controls over behavior. Who determines what is good and bad behavior? Who is right or wrong. The individual must be responsible for themselves. It must not be allowed to happen cannot and it won’t work. I strongly oppose this and implantation would be wrong. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Yes No taxes on Superannuation and No tax on established savings scheme. Any aspect that involves saving for retirement should not be taxed (assets such as housing directly relating to retirement for the average New Zealander) New Zealanders do not save. Encourage them to save Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? I believe this about right because there would/should be mass discussion about this otherwise it is too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment further Appendix 2 – Design issues with a capital gains tax If you think the Group should design a capital gains tax (CGT) for Government consideration, we need your feedback now on a number of detailed design issues: A Capital Gains tax should not be considered. What is the purpose for this particular form of tax? There are several aspects that have not have any discussion about and it seems that the wording and language that this is already going to happen, despite most not understanding what is actually happening. • Is it to level the playing field between people who work hard and want to get head in life and those who require constant handouts and have potentially made the wrong decisions in life? • Is a pure revenue driven exercise to allow expenditure on unproven projects that will end up being white elephants? • Is it to create a dependent society and therefore increase control over everyone, especially when they need everything supplied to them to survive? • To remove and essentially punish the hard working, innovative person/s from contributing to New Zealand • Is it because other countries do it so we must do it too? Have any of the negative side effects even been noted or taken into account such as? • Investment tightening • Tight regulations • Opportunities for lower and middle New Zealand to get ahead. This is suffocating and stifling any limited avenue to create and expand the worth of individuals/families • Compliance Costs • Implementation Costs • This will increase dependency on the Government for retirement. For those older generations that have solely their Family home and a single rental, this will remove a significant portion of retirement funds that will need to be made up by the Government 9 • Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. No. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant • Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated?No. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant • What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? No. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant. Why not include a wrist watch or mobile phone? This is going beyond rationality • Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? No • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? No • How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? Unable to Comment due to being the average New Zealander • When should non-residents be subject to tax? All individuals who are within New Zealand and are here must be contributing • Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. No. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant • Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? No • How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? Death and inhertitance should be left out of any tax discussions. It is a delicate situation and would be more complicated dealing with people not of sound mind at the time Emigration and Immigration. If you are in the country or have assets earning income in the country then you pay tax in accordance with the current system we have • How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? Don’t tax them, what is the point? This is getting far to miniscule and technical. They should be left as is. This will complicate the processing of this and then anyone fortunate to win money will have this taken off them. How would this work if someone had a benefit with child support? is this income and therefore they are cut off? The lotteries commission benefits from this system and so do communities in NZ. Does this mean they lose revenue that is used to distribute to worthy entities throughout the country. How does work for charities? Should they be exempt. Exemptions mean loopholes. Don’t waste our time and money on this • What should the rate of tax on tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? Zero. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant. The fact that this question is here clearly indicates that public submission are a waste of time and the Working Group is going through the democratic motions for the sake of it with no intentions of actually listening to us . The agenda has been set and we just have to accept this. • Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? No. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant • Should there be a de minimis rule? • What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? Too technical for myself to respond therefore unable to comment other than a Capital Gains Tax must be not be implemented 10 • What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). Zero. I oppose Capital Gain tax therefore it is relevant. To make this fait accompli even remotely fair would be to at least give discretion to New Zealanders and start it clean from a point in the future and make it for assets acquired post introduction. Anything less and back dated is greed • How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Family Trust are set up with good intentions. To make sure that family assets is safe and that there is peace of mind. Most New Zealanders are vulnerable to external sources from businesses and the economy itself and anything can happen that could conceivably wipe a family clean and leave them with nothing. No Taxes for this. If there are major concerns regarding a trust set up for criminal activity allow the IRD to investigate if sufficient evidence is available or there is a long line of questionable activities. Family trusts that generate any income are immediately subject to the highest tax rate on that income. As it is not an individual it must be treated as a separate entity. The rate is an excepted rate in line with the highest tax rate. There is no need to alter this on the grounds of fairness. Appendix 3 – Questions for submitters 57Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Tax and business • Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? No • Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Unable to Comment due to being the average New Zealander • Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? These allowances are there to help offset significant costs and compliance. Unable to Comment due to being the average New Zealander not owning a business • Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? Tax exemptions create inconsistencie. Remove all exemptions and therefore it makes the Tax system truly fair. No NEW TAXES Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? The tax system takes so much from the tax payer that the remainder of there money is used for Mortgage and Rental payments then for essentials of living, nothing for saving. Local Authorities have this belief increasing rates is required to do the same job each year. What we tend to see is Social engineering from Local Authorities who clearly ignore their core requirements and feel that more money is required. How can New Zealanders get ahead when they know rates will always increase with no actual benefit to this. This is a cycle that is ever increasing. If Rates go up, this will always be passed on to Renters who we assume are trying to save for their own home. There needs to be a reset for Local Authorities. Implement a Rates Freeze for 3 three years (evaluate after a General Election). Give New Zealanders a little 11 breathing room. With the freeze it does make Rent rises harder to justify and should allow tenants more scope to save. Fundamentally there is little Government can do to solve an issue that has always been around in New Zealand and other Western Countries. But minor changes like this is a start. Further reduction in compliances / taxes on owners could mean less Rent rises. This is a private/ commercial situation that the Government cannot control without seriously damaging the Economy Make Saving easy by removing tax from saving accounts? Incentivize saving without redistributing the cost to others in the economy. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Land tax There is a current Capital Gains tax is play. There is no need to introduce a more complex mechanism that will remove the only avenue for hard working New Zealanders to get ahead. There are no Multi-millionaires routing the system. They are generally beyond this and achieve their success reasonably quickly. This avenue is for available to ALL New Zealanders who only have minimal resources to help them progress in life using the slow, safe path. They still pay significant tax anyway. You don’t avoid taxes The inclusion of a Capital Gains tax will have detrimental affects on Middle and Lower New Zealand as there only avenue of investing is removed. • This will this affect Housing Investment as it will collapse • This will affect the average Families ability to save or invest • This will affect the ability of older New Zealanders to retire who are nearing retirement age who have invested in say one additional house thinking that they could sell down and retire. Why sell now if they are taxed again? • This will have a detrimental effect on housing stock • This will affect stock markets which generally has trouble achieving significant investment from average New Zealanders • Any assets deemed to be valuable such as art, bonds etc would be included There seems to a be perception that this will solve a lot of problems however if you assess other countries who have this system in place, they seem to be having the exact same problems regarding incomes, wealth and housing affordability. This is not the solution and everyone knows it. This is clearly another attempt at dispersing wealth evenly and a cynical ploy to control everyone. What is a definition of a "family Home" The destruction of the institution of Family over the years and decades and the broadening of society means that this is essentially nonexistent. Is someone living alone a family? What if two families by one house? If someone dies therefore is it still under the family home exclusion or is now inheritance tax? Is it still exempt? Allowing exemption of the family home allows for a loophole that lawyers and accountants will exploit. They always have and always will unless there are NO EXEMPTIONS. There are so many questions unanswered or in fact questions not even asked that this seems like a con job with a smoke screen covering something that most New Zealanders would oppose if they knew the truth. I strongly oppose this for all the reasons stated and for many more not stated. 12 Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Environmental taxation A Land tax is current there. It is built in as part of Local Authority rates. This is how they determine the value of the rates (The Improvement Value and the Land Value). Another Land tax would be double dipping. There are several situations of double dipping including GST on The rates bill. I strongly oppose this tax What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Progressive company tax There are no opportunities to effectively tax something that is an unknown. There are currently many avenues that try to achieve this. By being more specific New Zealand will continue to fall head first into the social controls that we should avoid. We currently have Cigarettes and Alcohol under this. There is some solid evidence that support this measure, however this has an effect on a naturally dwindling proportion of the population. The scale for this is small. I oppose this extremely drastic and dangerous pathway as New Zealand would not survive economically in comparison to the rest of the world. This will be a death nail. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Company tax rates must decrease to stay competitive and it must be across the broad. To support all businesses, less compliance costs for a start, they are stifling them to a point where they cannot survive let alone expand. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue The Australian GST system for example has multiple exemptions regarding fresh foods as well as other products etc and with those exemptions comes increased compliance costs and substantial monitoring requirements. When determining an exemption, what is the definition of a particular product? Does it meet the strict standards and definitions initially set out? Who determines what is exempt and monitors this? Why consider making exemptions when most common products will only decrease by a few cents and there is no guarantee that the retailers will decrease prices. This will not happen. There are far too many negatives to this to make any meaningful gains when taking in account the cost of compliance. The Current system of GST is simple and efficient. Sure there are issues regarding GST on other Taxes (Fuel, Rates etc), but this is a fairer way to generate revenue for the Government and with increased tourists this helps increase their contribution while it should allow reductions of personal tax rates. 13 ASSESSMENT AND SUMMARY • The fact that within the Future of Tax - Submission Background Paper it has been stated that the NZ Taxation System is " Justifiably commended internationally for being simple and efficient system should be the basis of maintaining for the benefit of all New Zealanders. This is exactly how it should be. With the Government’s starting position being that the guiding principle for the New Zealand tax system – namely, that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible, therefore why the need to change? • It is impossible to achieve a perfect system so don’t try fixing something that is working reasonably well. Trying to improve something that is structurally working well may achieve minimal increases in revenue or more likely cause significantly long term damage and an increase in division in New Zealand • I believe it has been projected by treasury that revenue to the Government coffers is likely to increase over the next few years under the current system. Therefore making changes that have no basis or evidence of improving the current simple and efficient system is not required. • If all Exemptions are not removed then this is a political stunt therefore this is a complete waste of my and other New Zealanders time and effort. From experience when submissions are called for it always ends up being a token jesture of Democracy to present the view of being open. • If this agenda is legitimate then this Tax Working Group must make the truly courageous announcement and decisions as outlined below in the recommendations. If not this Tax Working Group is just a Political side show with a false public agenda and the underlining virtue Signalling indicates to New Zealanders that this is a fait accompli and we have no true democracy • It is requested that this Tax Working Group are upfront and honest and take this seriously, remove the preconceptions that are there regarding real agendas and be realistic regarding this issue. The wrong decision and implementation of the Virtual Signalled Taxes will likely result in an increased rate of decline in the standard of living and create a state of dependency which will benefit no one. • If lower and middle-income earners have more of their hard-earned money, just consider the phycological and emotional wellbeing that everyone would have, not having to worry about money, not required to beg for their own money from a Government Department, no humiliation asking for help from others, no shame while being in public. This is caused by Government constantly taking from everyone and then bribing us with our own money. They know they can stand independently and the can be proud. The simple solution, the first $10,000 tax free and raise the tax thresholds for all 14 I SEEK THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THIS TAX WORKING GROUP TO BE ADHERED TOO. • GST should remain as it is. • Personal tax brackets to remain with thresholds moved up. This is outside the narrow scope set out but is the fairest, simplest and most effective way to increase wages and decrease dependency on Government support • The first $10,000 should be tax exempt (this applies to all). • We currently have a Capital Gains Tax of sort and it should remain as is. Expansion of this will destroy any remaining endeavour in this country. The use of an expanded system in any other country has achieved nothing other than take the hard working persons money off them just for being productive and achieving some success. • Minimal Tax rate to saving accounts with reputable Institutions to encourage savings • No taxes to retirement savings. Leave that to the individual as this will help encourage personal savings and will reduce the need for Government pensions in the long run • No taxes or uniform lower taxes on established savings schemes to encourage savings • No Capital Gains, Sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty, trust tax, wealth tax, inheritance tax, Gambling tax, behaviour taxes. None because it is not sustainable for most average New Zealanders • For any Tax changes there MUST NOT be ANY EXEMPTIONS. If this Working Group are 100% truly entrenched in the ideology behind this scheme to change the “Tax System” for the betterment of all New Zealand, then it must remove ALL exemptions because any exemptions allow for loopholes. With loopholes in play this means there are avenues and ways to structure and minimize Tax. Nothing should be exempt. SIGNATURE AND DATE VAUGHN ALLAN 30 APRIL 2018 \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to: Tax Working Group P.O. Box 3724, Wellington 6140 Submission from: Wayne Grattan B. Com CA This submission can be released in its entirety under the OIA if required. Proposal Summary 1. The guiding principles of the NZ tax system, as stated, must be retained: a. Simple and efficient. b. Broad based with minimum exemptions. c. Neutrally and in the background as much as possible. 2. Government expenditure levels should not be a principle of the tax system because: a. A large percentage of expenditures are transfers which are unrelated to a tax system. b. Different Governments will have different views regarding an appropriate level of expenditure as a percentage of GDP/ the New Zealand economy. c. An historical level of expenditure is not necessarily a good measure of what the future may look like. 3. The use of the tax system to implement single issue government policies particularly those related to changing behavior should be avoided. In line with the principles/positions above, I would like to see the tax working group consider implementation of the following specific proposals: Simple and Efficient 1. Have a base level of income which is “tax free” The income tax rates could be amended so that the first tax rate is a Nil rate. By way of example the tax on income up to say $300 per week ($15,600 per annum) would be Nil with rates above that adjusted to ensure that this change was tax neutral should this be seen as appropriate by the tax working group. There are a number of clearly identifiable benefits to such a change, as follows: - I. Reduction in compliance costs – a drop in the number of citizens who need to file tax returns. \[1\] II. It increases the incentive to enter the work force especially for first time employees. III. Reduces the attraction of black or grey market operations. IV. It increases the take home pay of those on the minimum wage or working part time. V. Could be linked to a matching change/reduction in benefits and transfers – This could be implemented to ensure that the rates adjustment was fiscally neutral to individuals receiving Government assistance (including those receiving superannuation). VI. It increases the attractiveness of moving off a benefit and into paid employment. VII. Psychological boost to all citizens from a tax system that doesn’t require those on minimum incomes to also support state services. Widen the tax base 2. Review the definition and application of Charitable Purposes as set out in the Income Tax Act Providing income tax exemptions to businesses that are registered charities fundamentally undermines the guiding principle of the tax system in relation to neutrality, being broad based and being simple and effective. It is therefore important that such exemptions are well deserved and only available for entities that truly provide charitable services. A number of charities in NZ operate a diverse range of businesses that don’t pay income tax but compete with those that do. The result is a very uneven playing field and a mayor disadvantage to, and disincentive for other businesses to operate and grow here. A number of registered charities assist a small number of recipients or those with family associations such that they look like tax paying companies or trusts. It would be appropriate for these entities to be treated in the same way as companies are for tax purposes. In addition, it is usual for religious organisations to be registered as charities despite many being substantial entities with substantial asset bases including commercial rentals. There is a strong argument that a level playing filed would require tax to be paid in such commercial income particularly any portion that is not used for charitable purposes. I would like the working group to consider and investigate: - i) That the definition of charities be tightened to: a. Remove those that serve belief-based organizations b. Remove those that support family groups ii) That all businesses pay income tax and registered charities be entitled to claim a rebate only in relation to the amount of money spent in that year for charitable purposes. 3. Tax overseas companies It has been recognized that a number of overseas based companies, particularly those operating in the IT sector, have been gaming the transfer rules to avoid paying tax in New Zealand (as well as other countries). The use of royalty and intellectual property payments to subsidiaries based in other countries, often those considered tax havens or low tax countries, has been recognized as a problem globally however it is not clear that New Zealand has been tough enough to ensure that the right amount of tax is paid in New Zealand to recognize the income earned here. I would like the working group to review and tighten the transfer payment rules to ensure that all businesses pay tax on income earned in New Zealand regardless of the country of residence. Further it is important that rule changes in this area are well publicized so that citizens are aware of the authorities’ enforcement of a level playing field for all businesses operating in New Zealand. Neutrally and in the background as much as possible 4. No new or increases in “behavior modifying” or targeted taxes Targeted taxes that are designed to modify behavior (as opposed to those that charge for the service provided) create distortions and always have unintended consequences. For example, cigarette taxes are highly regressive given that the majority of people who smoke are in the lower socio-economic group. Research shows that it is also more difficult to change the behavior of this group meaning that further tax increases have reducing impacts but increasing unintended consequences such as rising family poverty. The increase in cigarette taxes increases poverty levels and impacts on those who can least afford additional taxes. Further negative implications are increases dairy robberies, hungry children and families under stress and unable to feed their children. All are unintended and undesirable consequences. There are strong arguments supported by economic theory and overseas research that shows that should Governments see fit to target a change in behavior doing so via targeted expenditure and using behavioural changes processes (nudge theory refers) can be as effective as using a tax or charges regime that can be avoided by those on higher incomes and are also often more regressive than the alternatives. Given that all taxes are distortionary the use of behavioural change processes should be preferable. They have been used successfully in the past in New Zealand to change behavior (seat belt use being an example).

The future environment Changing demographics Yes, the baby boomer bulge is moving towards retirement age. However our population is now 4.75 million versus 2.5 million as at 1960, the end of the baby boomer generation. Therefore the proportion of baby boomers is steadily reducing as a proportion of the population as the country grows. Further, I think the statistics you use are misleading. The baby boomer generation is those born between 1954 and 1964. The population of NZ in 1954 was around 2.1 million. In 1964 it was around 2.5 million. Therefore 400,000 is the maximum number of people that could be called baby boomers. Today’s population is at around 4.75 million. As a proportion of the population that is only 8.4% Yes I know that the population includes those under 18, however not all baby boomers will be in retirement at the same time. Many are still working now, and when the last reach age 65 the forward part of the bulge will be dead. Your risk isn’t baby boomers retiring, your risk is too few working age people working, and “family resettlement” being used to add nearly-retired parents to the population. Therefore another risk is the entrenchment of low achievers in the welfare system. This country is crying out for many different types of skills, yet there is a persistent level of unemployed that have never been employed, and seem forever to be able to avoid employment. I see these proposals for more tax to be an aggressive attack on those that demonstrate a persistent attitude on saving, investment and self improvement. It is time to be more aggressive on persistent failure to contribute to society. Te ao Māori and the future I do not understand why Māori economic development is being separated from the rest of NZ economic development. Now that the consequences of the English failing to abide by their agreements is drawing to a close by way of Treaty settlements, and Māori economic entities are becoming large, powerful and wealthy, there is no economic or social reason why Māori economic interests should be treated any differently. Every time you make an exception for a Māori interest, whether it be a property free from rates, or an entity free from tax, you undermine the tax base. For example Ngāi Tahu Holdings does not pay tax because it’s sole shareholder is Ngāi Tahu Charitable Trust. This is a wholly artificial construct, and should be undone. The same applies to Sanitarium and any similar construct as well unless 100% of earnings is attributed to the charity and applied to charitable purposes that can be audited. Technological change and its impact on tax bases You seem to have a rather myopic view on the effect of technological change. There have been huge technological changes over time. The invention of the motor car put farriers and blacksmiths out of work. But they found other work. Largely I think the same will happen now. We cannot protect jobs that become redundant as the world moves on. There are two areas where the government should put more attention: 1.Promoting an environment where it is not acceptable to remain on welfare 2.Being more proactive on international companies applying artificial transfers or costs in order to reduce gross profit on the NZ books Welfare​: It is not acceptable for an unemployed person to sit in Tokoroa or Murapara and say “there aren’t any jobs” and then expect welfare to be continuously forthcoming. Most successful people moved to where the work is available. I moved from Rotorua to Hamilton for study, and then to Wellington because that’s where the work was offered. From a tax perspective, that person refusing to move when there is a clear shortage of workers in other areas is not acceptable. The overall system of taxes and transfers needs to be adjusted so that this situation can no longer continue. International companies​: I know this is being looked at, but really how long does it take? Royalties in the millions? A charge for Intellectual Property? Anyone can see this is nonsense. Simply exclude those clearly abused items as pre-tax deductible expenses. Company Tax pressures You speak of the disparity in company tax and personal/trust tax encouraging tax sheltering. It is (or should be) fairly easy to spot tax sheltering. This happens a lot where an individual creates a company entity where there are a very limited number of employees - often only one - who is paid a salary that is artificial and not in line with the business of the company. These can easily be undone. LAQC’s were undone into LTC’s where the LAQC is “looked through” to see the underlying financial position of the shareholder. Mr Cullen you should be well versed with this. A very similar approach could be used for single-employee companies. You don’t even need to solve all the problems. As soon as you start taking action on the low hanging fruit, you will find a lot of people change their circumstances to avoid being targeted. Environmental challenges Climate change is real. But it is not largely human induced. None of the models and predictions have been accurate. NZ’s contribution to greenhouse gas emissions is miniscule. To address environmental concerns what we should be doing is: 1.Ditch the ETS. It’s stupid and ineffective. 2.Concentrate on fresh water quality. Hint: It’s not all about farmers 3.Invest in science for real problems, not Chicken Little predictions. Concern about inequality Inequality of outcome (that is, household income) isn’t the problem that needs solving. Inequality of opportunity is the appropriate problem to address. If by way of redistribution you level out everyone’s household income, what incentive is there to work hard and make a success of yourself? In every country where a model of income equality has been attempted, it has been an abject failure, and lives have been lost as a result. Stalin’s Russia. Pol Pot’s Cambodia. Chavez’s Venezuela. All failures. Vietnam and China are reasonable successes because they adopted a commercial model. Scandinavia has been able to have a generous social agenda because they funded it through oil. If you want to have enough money to fund equality outcomes, become an oil exporter. They royalties could be significant. However it is almost too late to take advantage of the opportunity oil presents. Update​. I have recently heard the announcement of the coalition government to stop all oil and gas exploration. This is an incredibly moronic decision. It does nothing to change the consumption model, and when the gas runs out, what is going to provide the reliable base load? We export what oil we do extract because it is such high quality. What are we going to do now? Become more dependant on foreign oil? That is monumentally stupid. Purpose and Principles of a good tax system I will make a couple of comments on the ideas put forward in this section. Distribution and equity You said: “​Some people have more than one option for structuring their business affairs, whereas others do not. For example, an employee will always have tax deducted at source by their employer through the PAYE system. A contractor doing broadly equivalent work may be able to conduct their business as either a sole-trader, a partner in partnership, through a company or through a trust. Such decisions can allow tax rate benefits as well as the ability to access work-related deductions.​” I refer you back to my comments in the Company tax pressures section. It should be fairly simple to identify some structures that are artificial and apply pressure on them. Others should then fall more broadly into line. Others like me, have used some company and trust structures not to “hide money”, but to protect it from marauders. I am in my 50’s now, and I have spent my entire - PAYE earning I might add - life trying to ensure I have sufficient savings in retirement. Those savings include property, but also diversified international shares via KiwiSaver and private savings, as well as local shares, and forestry. To hear now that this government thinks I have been dishonest, unfair, and denied the state income for my own greed is insulting. The results of the current tax system As I was reading this section, one thing was abundantly clear. This working group has already decided that a capital gains tax is desirable, and that the target is property. This is disappointing. First, you need to go back and look at all your graphs. The tax contribution from the wealthiest demographic is already very high. We all accept that we pay more tax than those with lower income or fewer assets. However a situation whereby transfers mean that a family can earn an income of some $55,000 before paying a single cent in net tax is already skewed. Your data suggests that very little can be done in the second decile since that is largely made up of retirees who did not undertake any savings whatsoever and rely entirely on the state for everything. The tenth decile shows that very little is received from the state by way of transfers, and that is mostly superannuation as well. One could argue that the super wealthy do not require superannuation, but if you decided to means test superannuation, at what level would the means testing apply? History shows that it is likely to apply at very modest levels which can put some people materially at a disadvantage, especially the older people for whom their only asset is their house, albeit a valuable one. If it were to apply to assets over, say $2 million, then you’re not going to save very much, I suspect. Which brings us back to the capital gains option. Targeting property for this would be very distortionary. Would this aply only to residential housing? Why? What about the commercial lock-up. What about the parking spaces rented out? What about the marina berths rented out? What about the dairy owner that has their shop and home in the one property? Already it government has repeatedly said that the “family home” will be exempt. I would be shocked if you did not realise that most speculators - and by this I do ​not​ mean landlords - buy a property, call it their family home while they do it up, and then flip it. I know several people who do do this with one or maybe two houses a year. I say again, landlords are not the speculators, flippers are. Landlords report to the IRD, we pay tax on our rental income. I pay in the order of $10,000 tax a year, principally because I have driven down the debt levels. That $10,000 is in addition to my PAYE, in addition to KiwiSaver, and in addition to my managed share portfolio. The biggest positive effect you can make on taxing capital gain is to remove the family home exemption to the bright line test. Summary I personally think that the tax system is progressive enough. Higher income earners already pay a disproportionate amount of income tax. Higher income earners typically spend more and provide higher GST receipts. My main objection is that I have been paying tax, and as far as I’m concerned plenty of it. I don’t see how I have contributed to inequality because I have held these assets for decades and am transparent with the income flows. The focus on housing also seems to be a desire to tax “expensiveness”. More on that below. Recomendations: Remove the family home exemption.​ You will capture the flippers as most will not want to keep houses for two years let alone 5. Yes you might capture some people who are mobile, but the vast majority of families stay put. If necessary adjust the bright line somewhere between 2 and 5 years. Instruct IRD to investigate small closely held structures.​ These are mostly held by high income people - IT contractors, surgeons, builders and other trades - as a means to pay themselves an artificially low salary while the contracted entity both attracts large income streams and seems to buy or lease plenty of luxuries for the benefit of very few directors or shareholders. They are often also GST registered and plenty of personal expenditure is made GST exempt using this method. Your problem here is that this is a legal structure. However these entities should only really be used for genuine employment activities of people unrelated to the ownership structure. Taking steps to investigate and unwind some of these structures will have a cascading effect as others rush to protect themselves. Do not impose a capital gains tax.​ Income is already taxed. That tax-paid income is used to buy assets the income of which is already taxed. To impose a further tax on capital gains is manifestly unfair, especially if it is targeted at housing. There are plenty of other real estate categories that would escape this tax as it is being articulated. it becomes murky with home-and-business situations, and you could then argue that any product sold at a profit should be subject to tax on the income as well as the sale. An example might be a restored classic car that is bought for $100, restored, rented for weddings and then eventually sold for $100,000. Capital Gains Tax has been shown to not have the desired outcome on housing affordability. Australia has a CGT but their housing market is also very expensive. Alternatively​ have a bright line after which capital gains does not apply. You can capture flippers by including the family home for 2-5 years, and apply capital gains up until an asset is held for, say, ten or fifteen years, after which capital gains no longer apply. Tackle ​housing affordability​ at source. Housing is expensive because there is a shortage. Materials are expensive making houses more expensive. Labour is expensive. I have quotes of $1000 to install a simple gas heater. This makes houses more expensive. Land supply is difficult. Consultation and consents are time consuming, and expensive. Regulation is expensive. The forest manager of my forestry has demanded an additional $750,000 from all the partnerships in order to comply with FMA requirements. How is that conducive to investment? All these things make housing expensive, and despite all of this, a council can still sign off houses that are later deemed to be uninhabitable. In summary, it appears that the wealthy already pay a very large share of the government income. The middle class and poorer sections of the country pay no net tax. Recent government announcements are actually closing off sources of tax revenue by stopping natural resource extraction (which is how Scandanavian countries have developed such impressive Sovereign Wealth Funds).

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Submission to the Tax Working Group on The Future of Tax in New Zealand Submission made by: Alan and Christine Willoughby Sir s Before addressing the questions asked individually, we consider that it is important for you to remember the quote attributed to Winston Churchill: "For a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing on a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle.” Chapter 2: The future environment: We see two places in which tax revenue may be increased by taxes on those who most benefit from the New Zealand economy but who at present do not (to our knowledge) pay taxes in New Zealand: a. Many overseas companies, e.g. the Australian-owned banks, may make obscene profits from their operations In New Zealand but many or all are permitted by law to repatriate their profits and pay taxes in their country of origin, which may or may not be tax havens. We believe that all income derived by businesses in New Zealand should pay tax on that income in New Zealand at the same or a higher rate than New Zealand owned companies. b. New Zealand has a reputation as an amazingly natural country with huge opportunities for nature and adventure tourism. In the tourist industry, the slogan ‘south is safe’ is used to encourage tourism in the southern hemisphere due to the apparent safety of these countries compared with northern hemisphere countries. The government department, Department of Conservation, is underfunded to the extent that they rely to a large extent on volunteers to extend their funding to preserve often endangered native fauna and flora, and to maintain the infrastructure of tracks (including Great Walks through internationally recognised World Heritage areas), information centres, and huts in the New Zealand great outdoors. While many of the huts have user-pay charges, many facilities do not. In our view, as these are supported by taxpayers, they should remain free to New Zealand citizens. However, overseas visitors frequently visit these areas free of charge and, worse, some organised groups are taken to those places by unscrupulous Asian tourist operators who charge extra for their clients to visit, then pocket the money themselves. We consider that a tax on non-resident visitors to New Zealand should be made and the entire taxation revenue should be used to fund Department of Conservation to maintain and protect New Zealand’s unique natural environment. The amount of this tax, we suggest, should be approximately $25 per person, payable a maximum of annually on their first entry into New Zealand in any calendar year. Such a tax could be collected by an addition to either air fares of overseas visitors, or an addition to cruise ship fares on ships destined for New Zealand ports. This tax would be little different from the taxes charged in Australia for visiting national parks, with the exception that the Australian system is administered on a state basis, so on a recent trip through three states we had to pay a tax on three occasions; at least in New Zealand it would be a single payment. \[1\] Chapter 3: Fairness in taxation: There are two aspects to a ‘fair’ taxation system: a. To be seen as fair, taxpayers must see that those who are most capable of paying higher tax, actually do pay a higher tax. “To each according to his means.” Even returning to the ‘old’ taxation system in which ‘Family Benefit’ was paid to young families for the purpose of enabling parents to adequately provide for their families would appear to be a very positive move. The advantage of that system was the ability of responsible parents to capitalise their family benefit to contribute to their deposit for the family home. We are aware of the changes in society since such a system was operating, but we also notice the increasing negative comments made regarding people who are recipients of the current welfare system and who regard it as a cash cow, allowing them to seemingly obtain unlimited funding for lifestyles which could be seen as toxic. That is blatantly seen as unfair. It is unfair to those who cannot take a pay rise that is offered because that would mean they would no longer qualify for benefits which they relied upon for daycare of their children (we know two close relatives who have suffered from this situation). A fair tax system, associated with a fair benefit system, would never allow a person to be better off on a lower wage or on a benefit instead of a wage. Such a system is blatantly and obviously unfair. b. To be seen as fair, a tax system must not be seen to penalise those who have worked hard over a long period of time by charging an ‘inflation’ tax, aka capital gains tax, on the monetary value of assets which have not gained in value except due to the depreciation of the value of the dollar. So an asset purchased 20 years ago may have doubled in the monetary amount that it would now sell for, but that is due to the decrease in the buying power of the dollar, not to the increase in value of the asset. Such an increase must never be taxed. Remove the incentive to succeed and you will decrease the pool of people who choose to remain in New Zealand and succeed; you will end up with a nation of beneficiaries. c. To be seen as fair, a tax system must only tax actual income, not assumed income as has recently been mooted on the increase in asset value despite there having been no income due to that asset value increase, which could result in the owners of these assets being possibly unable to pay the tax due to lack of income. Punishing the successful is never a good idea as it discourages success and encourages those who would seek success to seek it elsewhere. Chapter 4: The current NZ tax system: 1. Frameworks: In New Zealand (as in many ‘developed’ nations) there is currently a health crisis due largely to the overconsumption of unhealthy, prepared food at the expense of fresh, organic fruit and vegetables. In Australia, fresh foods are exempt GST; here GST is charged on all foods. While there are arguments for the NZ system, mainly due to its universality and ease of application, the Australian system encourages, and is seen to encourage, the use of fresh vegetables in place of prepared, over-sweetened, preservatised and chemically ‘enhanced’ ‘food’ that an increasing number of especially low socioeconomic families regard as their main diet. In addition to this, a ‘health tax’ could be imposed on ‘foods’ containing empty calories, e.g. over-sweetened fizzy drinks, oversalted potato crisps and sweetened, low nutrient breakfast cereals. This tax should be directly available to the health system as they will require the revenue to treat those who consume those products. 2. Taxes and behaviour: The government has recently made comments about the possibility of a capital gains tax, a land tax, bright line tests, LVR restrictions and far more stringent requirements for landlords of residential rental homes. The headlines on a recent property investors’ journal read “Investors consider mass exodus”. At a time when the increase in demand for rental properties has never been higher and the government has divested itself of large numbers of state owned houses, it seems strange that the government seemingly cannot realise its growing dependence on private landlords to provide accommodation for the increasing percentage of families who are choosing to rent rather than tie up their capital by investing in a house. This trend shows no sign of stopping and is likely to increase in the future. The argument that a house owned by a family houses the same number of people as a rented house appears to be invalid; statistics show that there is an average of around 1.5 times the number of people living in the average rental as there are in an owner-occupied home. Thus the number of ‘homeless’ and the demand for rental houses will increase in future as more people find it impossible or too great a commitment to purchase their own home. It would appear, therefore, that serious thought should be given before punitive taxation measures are taken against those who provide the major part of the rental home resource. Landlords are usually property investors and run their operation as a business like any other. To tax them in a way that is seen as punitive when compared with taxation of other business ventures would be a potentially disastrous move with far-reaching negative consequence well into the future as residential landlords move out of that market and into the more lucrative, lower maintenance commercial property market. 3. Retirement savings: Kiwisaver is an excellent savings system and, in our opinion, should be made compulsory. It is unfortunate that the government has removed the incentive to enrol for Kiwisaver as that was a major incentive for enrolling in the scheme. In the future, an increasing number of people will be self-sufficient in retirement due to their Kiwisaver savings. The government should forecast this change and discuss publicly the probablilty of decreasing the retirement benefit once the Kiwisaver savings reduce the dependence on pension benefits. This would also provide greater incentive for those who have not joined Kiwisaver to do so to avoid poverty in their retirement. Comments we would make regarding the remaining chapters and subjects within those are covered in what we have written above. Thank you for the opportunity to contribute our views. We trust that these will be carefully considered. Alan and Christine Willoughby

Annika Streefland The differentiation on capital gains should be on 3rd or more properties used for rental and commercial capital gains purposes ie not on the home AND bach. Graham Astley The practice of deducting or cancelling a persons entitlement to National Super because their partner receives a pension from overseas is effectively a tax, and a very unjust one applied to a benefit which is not means tested. But this is exactly what that is, a means test. This issue is on the cusp of blowing up and urgent reform is needed now Neil Christian Briefly, to add any new capital gains tax means that tax concessions must be given at the same time, however there already is A capital gains tax! What is the point in strangling genuine Kiwis who are saving for retirement with new C/taxes? We all know Money is its own merry goround the economy of wealth and re-distribution will happen naturally and all will benefit, but it is an economy that the government needs not strangle or meddle with, Why on earth should any political party penalizing the it's client base with more tax! Working/investing kiwis are tired of tax working groups, capital gains tax is so predictable and unfair, just because immigrants from other countries flagrantly launder money and exploit our property market dosent mean we need to introduce new suffocating taxes on all Kiwis. How about GST registering every immigrant that buys a house, and upon selling within 10yrs is required to pay a capital gains tax & the GST on the sale price. Hardworking kiwis Should not penalized for the sake of immigrants from other countries. There is a school of thought here in NZ that is fundamentally flawed, it says that tax is the answer yet when policy icreativity is so lacking ! and falling short! Why have our politicians forgotten the obvious ? Immigrants owning property for less than 10yrs need to be taxed if they sell! & not Kiwis, retiring Kiwis in NZ do not have the luxury of an extravagant retirement, our country is not wealthy so why penalize kiwis that want to take care of themselves with their own investment portfolios? a work hard, save hard and invest hard kiwi must be encouraged not discouraged, this is an ethic that should be promoted. Dave d'Abo NO just another way to fund labor's welfare projects Shaune Tappan (1) do not introduce any more taxes including land and capital gains tax. We are already taxed too highly and not seeing the benefit of our tax in certain areas like roads, hospitals etc. we also have no say in how the money is being spent, so it is certainly not a ‘fair’ system. (2) foreign home owners should be taxed more highly on land and income (rental) so that those genuinely interested in settling here would do so. We don’t need speculators. (3) tax every New Zealand citizen at the same rate if you want to be fair. People that have worked harder do not deserve to be taxed higher, and - in the same vein - people who refuse to work should not receive the benefit of not paying or paying a low rate. Everyone should play their part equally in our tax system. (4) let us vote on how government spending should occur. (5) Why should New Zealanders have to pay tourist rates in their own country? Introduce a system which allows discount if you carry a New Zealand passport. At present we cannot fully enjoy the benefits of staying in this country after taxes. (6) stop racial discrimination in our tax system. Why should Mauri or any other culture enjoy more benefits than others in our tax system? To be fair, treat everyone the same. Thank you, Shaune Roger Scott My mother owns a house but she is unable to live there and it now needs to be rented to find her health care. I think it would be unjust for her to have to pay tax if she was forced to sell it. I don't think those who inherit a family property should pay capital gains tax because it is difficult enough for young people to get on the property ladder as it is. Salaries and wages here are too low forcing young talent off shore to earn a good salary. You want to keep young talent here whether they are professional or trades people. I really think overseas investors who try to avoid tax in their own country by investing in New Zealand homes a) forces up the prices and b) should be taxed sufficiently. Need to also look closely at hawkish property developers who register as New Zealand companies to build large numbers or rentals for those who have been priced out of the market. Switzerland had quite good laws around protecting themselves from foreigners buying up property. There were designated areas where I could have bought as a non resident. No doubt the wealthy pay lawyers to find the loopholes. john McCullough immigration can not cope.The generational Kiwis have paid to set up the infrastructure that was needed ,now they are paying for the overseas workers infrastructure.There needs to be a tax put on industries that employ overseas or new arrivals to cover the extra cost on services to average kiwis, same as different tax for overseas investors move here to make capital gain on property. Same as tourism.The cost of it's development and growth is carried by the tax payer. Britta Fromow •Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? Yes, fruit, veg, and unprocessed foods I also think that the tax system should be fairer to all. I can't understand why my uncle, as a farmer, can claim his private aircraft (which is bought and used as a toy) as a farm vehicle when he can easily survey his farm using his drone, tractor or farmbike. I can't understand how his family holidays in NZ and Europe are tax deductable because he drives past a paddock and says 'look at those sheep'. I can't understand why he can write off all his income (he has operated at a legitimate loss once in his lifetime) every single year so that his family has a community services card and his daughter at university gets a student allowance and hardship money from the government. This family paid for the daughter to go to an elite boarding school at over $30,000 per year. She has overseas holidays paid for, was bought a Peugeot at age 17 and a BMW at age 18. She wears only designer clothes and flats alone in Dunedin with an accommodation benefit (courtesy of the tax payer) when her parents pay for all her rent and her designer furniture, etc, while claiming a loss. How can this be a fair tax system? For the environment, I believe that water usage should be taxed, regardless of residential or industrial usage. It will force people to use greywater systems and reduce water \[1\]

Page 1 of 4 Barbara Holland Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission: On the Future of Tax General remarks 1. I support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. 2. I do not believe the current system of taxation that enables provision of publicly funded infrastructure establishment, maintenance, and/or services has been neutral, fair, or just. The fact that we have such a gulf between rich and poor on income and wealth measures; such alarmingly high rates of child poverty, violence, poor mental health, homelessness; and unequal opportunities to put a stake in the ground and engage in meaningful work to create a secure future with real choices confirms to me that the present system of tax-take and allocation for social wellbeing purposes is not in balance. We are a relatively small nation. It isn’t that hard to see that marked inequalities between groups of people and between regions are shaped as much by structural arrangements as by individual will, opportunity and circumstance. We should all be able to expect access to reliable, efficient and effective publicly funded services. Fair taxes are what enable provision of these social goods. 3. I applaud the holistic approach taken to adopt The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four ‘capital stocks’ and associated flows as a basis for public policy direction. I believe this lens should be applied to all government decision-making. 4. I believe this approach is a more appropriate fit with Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations and commitment to respect the land and the people, now and into the future. Economic drivers and production activities must also include accountability for their impact on the environment and natural resource sustainability – not just be measured for their financial return. Polluters must pay. We must not let our natural resources (particularly water) be taken offshore without fair returns to New Zealand. \[1\] Page 2 of 4 The tax system is one tool that can more fairly support these wider social wellbeing measures, provided it is more universally and equitably applied. 5. Where significant areas of a region’s landmass are locked up into public conservation lands (PCL) and protected for the benefit of all New Zealanders there must be some kind of benefit-transfer from government back to that region to ensure the limited number of local ratepayers are not unduly burdened with infrastructure costs that also benefit the whole country (eg roads, water supply, communications, civil defence services) yet must meet needs over large distances where other economic and residential activities are not permitted, or are very limited. For example, Te Tai Poutini is sparsely populated and although there is some concession revenue gain from PCL-related activities the region is also looking for opportunities to build/support stronger employment and income growth. This region has no public transport, a low-median income and many more existing on less than the living wage, along with high local body rates so it is challenging for many to seize/develop new business opportunities without external funding start-up support. The current Regional Development Fund will undoubtedly go some way to offsetting this disadvantage. It has been a long time coming but how far will it stretch and for how long? A fairer division of the overall tax take would avoid a short-term lolly-scramble. 6. I support a government change in direction that drives more environmentally sustainable and accountable economic activity. Where private businesses may need to change their focus or even cease their current economic activities because they do not meet the greater good criteria for socially responsible trading there must be a transition strategy, government-led if necessary, so that communities are not left stranded from the exit of employment activity. Immediate changes I wish to see 7. A review of all for-profit businesses that currently have Charitable Status. Multi- million dollar traders ranging from Sanitarium to those run by The Christian Church Community Trust (Gloriavale Christian Community), to name just two examples among the multitude of other for-profit business arms incorporated within this class of charitable trust operators, must start contributing a fairer share of tax for the nation’s wellbeing. 8. Revision of existing targeted tax rates where the alcohol industry reaps vast profits from their private trading activities but they contribute very little through taxation to counter the enormous costs of alcohol-associated harms that are carried by individuals/whanau and the publicly-funded sector. 9. I do not believe the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand fair for the majority of New Zealanders. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of adults) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with the wider costs to society of alcohol- related harm. The government receives excise tax from alcohol ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). Page 3 of 4 10. Further, the government is missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). This anomalous situation needs to be addressed. It is the alcohol content that causes the harm. 11. I believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should more closely reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Of particular concern is the increasing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. We must end retail supply of cheap alcohol. Specific measures to target heavy drinkers would significantly reduce inequalities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Further, low income heavy drinkers would benefit the most when the price of alcohol is increased. 12. All alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. AWC believes a Minimum Unit Pricing policy would achieve this aim. 13. Recommendations: • That alcohol excise rates are increased by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10%; • That the excise rates on alcohol are adjusted annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers); • That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%; • That a minimum price per standard unit of alcohol be introduced. A new targeted tax 14. I suggest government extends the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high-sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier. Poverty, sugary diets, poor oral hygiene have their impact across children and adults. Management of the alarming rise of pre-diabetes and current diabetes incidence already imposes significant costs on our publicly-funded health system. This burden will only get worse if no action is taken now as a society to forestall these avoidable impacts on wellbeing, employment capability, and life years lost. Future-focussed big system tax changes I want to see 15. (a) A universal basic income (UBI) Rationale: - It is about social justice and basic economic security first and foremost rather than tackling poverty after the fact; Page 4 of 4 - More effective in reducing poverty and inequality than schemes targeted on the poor; - Guarantees basic income for all, paid individually to each man and woman, including those with disabilities, and avoids labelling of deserving/undeserving poor; - Avoids a moral hazard where increasing income to just above poverty level means losing more than the extra earnings – this creates a disincentive to earn extra; and - Immoral hazard leading to hiding extra income. - There are high administration costs inherent in current means testing and application of sanctions. (b) A universal financial transactional tax (FTT) and thereby do away with income tax and the complex collection of GST; it would close existing taxation loopholes; and it would limit banks and financial traders who gain from the globalised economy but are still able to impose excessive costs on the New Zealand public who must use their services to transact their daily business.

TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMISSION B Woolsey 27-4-18 INTRODUCTION (Look at the forest before the trees) Before 1970 NZ had evolved into a comfortably wealthy little country, with only minimal debt. Since 1970, NZ Ltd has had a fundamentally flawed ‘credit’ business model. It went into negative equity in 2012, and is continuing to trade at a loss, using variations of the same model. This working group is trying to obtain more funding for the increased revenue requirements for this model. As of 2015 the total revenue acquired already by ‘all Govt’ means, is now more than the total remuneration of all 'shareholders'. The NZ dollar is now only a debt token that creates more debt, fundamentally We need a new business model, where NZ Ltd managers exercise fair governance, to operate the Company in a fiscally sustainable manner, within the means of the worker/shareholder, to the mutual benefit of all. The present system has failed, and is inherently unsustainable. NZ EQUITY 7% INFLATION (7% base) REVENUE LOOP+120% INFLATION-WAGES-GOODS SERVICES-DEBT The ‘Capitalist’ monetry system in the western world depends on everything keeping in step with 7% inflation, which is a doubling every 10 years. Cost of houses, goods, wages, taxes, rates, levies, services all double every 10 years, and this purchasing power is retained by savings + interest at 9% (inflation +tax). The system is balanced by productivity and by loans/borrowing halving every 10 years. By declaring the Cost Price Index (CPI) as a measure of inflation at 1-3 %pa, wages have been bought down to 1% -3%pa for the mid/lower wage-earners, resulting in a drop in consumer income to 1/3 the optimum. Due to hardship, inflation cannot occur at the required rate, suppliers suffer, welfare climbs and DEBTS ACCUMULATE, private and national.Using the contrived CPI as “inflation” to determine wages is bad governance, harmful to the state and people of NZ But ‘all Govt’ (Including local Govt, the SOEs their companies and subcompanies) charges and revenue have continued at 7%pa and now total more than the total average wage. This implies that either wages are 1/3 too little, or Govt revenue is 3x too much for sustainability. This shows up in the 50yr inflation graph, which has been recorded over the last 40 years. Many submissions and practical solutions were offered to Govt, to no effect. OUR CRISIS DID NOT HAVE TO BE. As a simple crosscheck, look at the housing crisis. The average NZ house price has increased 8% over the last year. In real household expenditure, all the costs associated with housing account for half the household expenditure, therefore total inflation is 4% on just half the income alone. Plus the inflation on the other half. A house used to cost 3x the average income. Now it costs 10x. (3:1 again). Savings effectively halve every 13 years, due to the low interest rates compared to hardware inflation., causing house deposit savings to plateau. Plus the amount able to be saved is reducing as household costs increase compared to income. As a further check, your taxes to GDP graph shows taxes at 34% of GDP. But GDP is only a commercial activity number measured unfortunately in dollars, which gives great opportunity for misuse and concealment. In the 1960’s when the inflation graph starts, GDP was roughly 3x the national remuneration, as defined in the yearbook. Thus a Govt revenue of 11% of GDP was 33% the national remuneration. This is shown in the inflation graph. Simiarly the current 34% of GDP (ON TAXES ALONE) is over 100% the national remuneration. But GDP has become more efficient with modern banking, and perhaps with more money cycles with credit card use, the ratio is 4:1 or worse. I cannot find the current makeup of GDP, which is at the heart of many Govt financial reports. Do YOU know the makeup of this critical number? As a further check, a Salvation Army report today, reveals that even those in permanent employment are having to seek food parcels. The majority have never had to ask for help before. As a further check the poorest 40% only own 3% the country’s wealth. If you own your own house freehold, you are deemed rich. The current policy is to limit the peoples ability to get loans to buy houses, thus attempting to drive houseprices down. Everyone loses. THE NZ LTD BUSINESS MODEL IS FATALLY FLAWED EmployedFood Parcels Auckland Rail map 90% cover 7%pa houses wrt 2%pa wages City Buses are congestion INFRASTRUCTURE Using a simple mortgage calculator, which is an essential tool for planning/money calculations, (and for detecting flim-flam) 2% pa population growth will require a complete DOUBLING of all roads, energy, houses, rail, employment, water, sewerage, transport, health, welfare, etc EVERY 35 YEARS. SAVINGS(To reduce the CPI / inflation disparity at less cost than present) INTEGRATED LIGHT RAIL (FLIER=Free Light Integrated Express Rail) Savings = $10B When I realised the certain outcome of the economy about 1980, I started submissions to Government. The equity graph was produced for about 10 years prediction. The prediction for 1992 Govt negative equity was only months out. This implies an accuracy of over 90%. The Govt reorganized the economy so the debt was on all NZ.The new prediction for ALL NZ negative equity was 2012, again only months out, and very high accuracy. The worst performing part of the economy at the time was the ARC and Auckland rail. It still is. In 1983 I designed a light rail railcar, built using bus techniques. In 1996 , with Nissan Diesel, I tendered to do a train system at less than 10% of the cost of the ARC dream. Current cost would be $1.2m per dual 16 tonne vehicle, replaced every 15 years (so always modern). Looking at the current bus pamphlet the AT current routes are CBD based. The buses are the CBD conjestion. Only 13% of commuters want to go to the CBD. Using the local buses in 10 min loops between stations, meeting fast trains, kept the ‘dead’ miles down, enabling the fare to be free. This was paid for by the rail subsidy at the time, and a rolling $40m ($120m now) loan, both increasing at 7%pa. Due to the light weight, prefabricated track could be used, just between pads at each end and aligned for high speed. With the (small train) tunnels under the harbour, 90 % of the greater city was covered. THERE WAS NO FARE. The collection costs were more than the fare. This was sustainable. We were declared not a selected tenderer, and thus did not have to be considered (at 90%cheaper) The current 10 yr AT/ACC/Govt rail plans at $11.5B?? the extra 20m passenger trips pa will cost $57.5 per passenger trip over 10 years, for which the passenger will pay $5. Note, each passenger has 600 trips per year (300days), so 20m passenger trips is only 33k actual passengers. YOU work out the cost per passenger. HEALTH Hearing aids = Buy 2 models direct from factory. Cost about $200 @ 1000up for top quality units with rear noise cancellation etc. Free. Full business plan available. Typical current ‘cost’ about $4000 ea Cateracts = Give the Hollows foundation a bus setup attached to the breast x-ray unit. Pay them $350 a cateract. $50 for the operation, $300 donation to do their charity operations. The 10% of special cases by normal hospital. They are very experienced, qualified, specialists. Free KIWIBANK Kiwibank had half its shares uplifted for half price, and no payment was made to Kiwibank,, harming the depositors and bondholders.(actually much more serious than this) Return all shares and funds with compensation, and make Kiwibank a standalone SOE. The SOE would be a Royal charity for the benefit of NZ savers with a community card .(Doesn’t pay tax or dividends, nonprofit) Pays 9% interest, so savings retain their value, and eliminates the savings plateau boundary, where inflation is more than the savings deposit. Savings limited to an average Auckland house deposit. I have reached two pages of submission in simple plain language. That is about the limit of full attention. This is highly condensed and more details of extensive submissions and full size graphs are available on request. Thank you for your time and attention

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax First name: Carmen Last name: Collie Position: Co-ordinator Organisation: Christchurch Alcohol Action Plan ☒ I am aware that my submission will be released on this website, with my email address withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply ☐ I would like to speak to this submission if the opportunity arises For more than 25 years, I have worked extensively with communities and organisations to minimise the harms associated with alcohol misuse. Currently, I am the Coordinator of the Christchurch Alcohol Action Plan. I support the Tax Working Group’s review to identify a fair tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders. With regard to the current approach to alcohol excise tax in New Zealand I consider that the current level of excise tax is not fair and fails to address the amount of alcohol related harm suffered by New Zealanders. I believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available in society, e.g. tobacco, cannabis, heroin, methamphetamine. Increases in alcohol excise rates are urgently required to address the growing number of hazardous drinkers in New Zealand. In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. Almost every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. The greatest increases are among our women. There remain significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori - these are unjust. To achieve fairness, alcohol excise taxes need to addressed • Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been • New Zealanders are missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential social services. • Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this does not come close to the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society (around $5 billion in 2005/06). • People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Recommendations For a fairer and more equitable society, I recommend the following: • Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% • Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) • Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. • It is preferable that all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain. This is fair across all beverages. Currently, some products are taxed by volume whereas others are taxed by alcohol content. It is alcohol that causes the harm. \[1\] These recommendations are fair as low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Thinking outside the system, I recommend that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy also be implemented to address the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is the most fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups.

Page 1 of 3 Chris Kelly: Submission to tax working group I am a lawyer who has for some years specialised in the law concerning wills, estates, trust and elder law. 1 I wish to put forward some ideas for the reform of tax on trusts. I also want to make some comments about how to broaden the tax base generally. Taxing trusts and trustees Trusts are usually assumed by most people to be primarily used to avoid tax. This is not entirely true. Trust are set up for many reasons. The main tax advantage – income splitting to take advantage of lower rates for lower income tax payers - was addressed in part by the “minor beneficiary rule” some years ago. There remains, however, some ability to reduce tax by allocating income to family members over the age of 16 who are not yet working. This ability to allocate income is mainly of benefit to those with high levels of family income. For such families, the cost of employing accountants to file both trustees’ and beneficiaries’ tax returns is relatively minor comparted to the tax savings. For those on middle to low incomes, it is often not worthwhile going through the process. In my experience tax savings through use of trusts are mainly of benefit to high income families or those with quite substantial assets. It would simplify the tax system if all trust income were simply taxed as trustees’ income. Distributions to beneficiaries would thus be tax free (because tax had already been paid on that income stream). This should reduce the scope for trustees to play games with distribution to whoever is on the lowest tax rate irrespective of who actually gets to spend the money in reality. Trustees’ income should all be taxed at the top rate for income tax. Currently this is 33% but, as I explain below, I consider there is scope for higher tax rates to be imposed on those on higher incomes. Thus trustees’ income should potentially be taxed at 35% or even 39%. There may be some need to retain the present system (taxing income distributed to beneficiaries at the individual beneficiary’s own rate) for trusts arising in estates. 2 Trusts set up solely for the support and welfare of handicapped people may also need to be able to continue under the current system, but I would think these should be the only exceptions. Of course, there would be no need to change the current rules applicable to charitable trusts, superannuation schemes, unit trusts etc. Income tax and medicare surcharge The current income tax bands have not been adjusted in line with inflation for some years now. This has had the effect of compressing the bands. People on quite modest incomes find themselves taxed at a higher band than previously. The bands need to be recalibrated in line with inflation. There is also scope to tax those on high incomes at a higher rate. 33% is very low for the top rate. For example the rate for incomes over $120,000 could be 35% and incomes over $180,000 could be taxed at 39%. This would put the emphasis on taxing those who can afford to pay. Government also needs to increase the total tax revenue to allow increased spending on such things as housing, 1 I am co-author of recognised authoritative legal texts, including Garrow and Kelly’s Law of Trusts and Trustees. I have also present a number of papers for legal conferences and contributed articles to several legal journals. 2 That is trusts arising under the will of a deceased person or on an intestacy. Page 2 of 3 schools and hospitals. I propose this in the full knowledge I am likely, as a consequence, to pay more income tax, because I am in a higher income bracket, but I accept that as a necessary contribution to society. It would also be worthwhile considering a surcharge to cover the health system, similar to what is done in Australia. The money from the surcharge should be completely devoted to the public health system – private medical insurance should not be subsidised in any way. The tax rates could be reduced somewhat for those on lower incomes so that the medical care surcharge would not impose too much of a burden. Thus, instead of a 33% tax rate, the rate might be 30% with the surcharge taking the effective rate to about 34%. Company tax There is always a risk that companies will disguise returns to their owners as expenses, so as to reduce tax. This problem has been addressed in relation to larger overseas companies but my experience suggests it remains an issue with some local companies also. My suggestion would be: • Smaller companies, with no significant overseas ownership, would be taxed much as partnerships are at present – the income would be attributed direct to the shareholders; • All other companies, including any with overseas ownership of any significance, would be taxed on their total turnover, not on net profit – for example a tax of 9% or 10% on total turnover might equate to 33% of net profit but would leave less room for avoidance. It would be necessary to define what are “small” companies. Inland Revenue should be able to provide statistical basis for such a definition. Possibly companies with total capital less than $5 million and no less than 10% of ownership held outside NZ. Farms The taxation of farms is also quite complex. Again there is wide scope for personal expenditure to be disguised as business expenses. To most farmers, income is what is left in the bank account at the end of the season. One solution might be for farms to be taxed on the capital value of the property. There would then be no point trying to manipulate expenses to create a notional loss or small profit. Farms could be exempt from income tax and GST provided they pay a tax on the capital value of the land and buildings. GST and other direct taxes I have read proposals that GST should be reduced back to 10%, as it was originally, and other environmental taxes and charges used to make up the difference. I strongly agree with this approach. As is widely recognised, GST is a regressive tax and a heavier burden is placed on lower income people who have less ability to pay. Alternative taxes that I believe need to be introduced, include: • A sugar tax – the rate of tax should increase according to the level of sugar in each product; Page 3 of 3 • Continue to increase the tax on tobacco; • Increased tax on alcohol, especially drinks likely to be attractivd to teenagers (who need to be discouraged from early heavy alcohol consumption) – for example ready to drink mixes; • Taxes on plastic bags, bottles and packaging, with higher tax rate for plastic which is not recyclable or is not recycled. Transaction tax A transaction tax or Tobin tax of some kind should also be introduced. This would help fund the reduction in the GST rate as above. At the least a small charge each time someone sells NZ dollars – or moves money out of the country - would be a simple and easy tax to collect through the banking system.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Submission to the Tax Working Group Submitter: Th e Tax Working Group is welcome to contact me should they wish to discuss any matter raised in my submission. Submission on the future of tax I consider that we need to: 1. Tax wealth or assets This tax needs to have the broadest coverage possible in order to minimise distortions in the allocation of investment and in how wealth is held, and to discourage the holding of assets that are yielding a very low return. To avoid unnecessarily complicating the regime and to avoid 'bothering' those who have few assets or little wealth there should be a tax-exempt threshold, say $500,000 per person. It should be an annual tax and coverage should include the family home. In the design of such a tax, one objective should be to treat all forms of retirement savings (including investment in property) in the same way as far as taxation is concerned. This may mean re-assessing how retirement funds such as KiwiSaver, National Provident Fund, etc. are currently taxed. I believe that such a tax would: - encourage more productive use of assets that are giving a low return; - re-balance investment away from investment in housing property thereby moderating housing price increases; - increase the inter-sectoral fairness of the tax system by taxing capital gains on property which is largely exempt at present; - increase the inter-generational fairness of the tax system by raising more tax revenue from the Baby Boomer and older generations and having it spent on the generations that have followed the Baby Boomers (who, I believe, on average are having a harder time building their asset base than their parents did). 2. Make greater use of taxes, permit sales and charges to modify behaviour In my view we should be making greater use of these instruments where there is evidence that they are (at least reasonably) effective in modifying behavior in a significant way. I support their use in both cases noted by the Tax Working Group, i.e. where the activities have significant social costs and where the activities are harmful to the \[1\] 2 individual and for some reason the individual is not able or willing to act in their best interest. I note, however, that the distinction between the two cases is often not clear-cut because invariably instances of the latter case also have significant social (often health care) costs associated with them. I consider that in this area the Tax Working Group should look beyond just taxes and also consider sale of permits by government (e.g. emission permits under the Emissions Trading Scheme, or potentially water abstraction or discharge permits) and charges by government (e.g. time of day charges for road users). Besides modifying behavior, such taxes, sales of permits and charges could be sources of revenue for government. However, on the other hand it may be desirable that they are designed to be fiscally neutral with all the revenue raised being returned to households (e.g. feebate schemes for motor vehicles, or the now-repealed Australian federal government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme). In relation to using taxes to modify behavior, for the reasons set out in Section 3 below I do not support taking GST off healthier food items, low emission vehicles, etc. 3. Retain the current coverage of GST The simplicity of the current coverage - basically no exemptions - is a huge administrative benefit. GST is regressive but in my view it is better to address its impact on low income households’ ability to afford the essentials of life (food, shelter, energy) through payments or subsidies targeted at low income households rather than fiddling with GST coverage and complicating it. 4. Introduce a separate, highly progressive tax on NZ Superannuation Many recipients of NZ Superannuation (myself included) do not need it and there are many areas of government expenditure where this money could be put to much better use. This problem is only going to increase over time as the population ages; in my view the current entitlement to, and taxation of, NZ Superannuation is very unfair to the generations who are younger than the Baby Boomers. I consider that raising the age of entitlement to NZ Superannuation in the short to medium term is undesirable as it would create the need to have a different benefit for those who really do need financial support at age 65. That leaves means testing, and in my view the simplest, least costly and least intrusive way to means test NZ Superannuation is to tax it in a highly progressive manner: for example, no change for recipients whose annual taxable income (including NZ Superannuation) is below say $25,000, but above that threshold, the special tax on NZ Superannuation would kick in and reach say 90% by the time recipients’ annual taxable income (including NZ Superannuation) was say $50,000. 30 April 2018

To: Tax Working Group From: David Thorp Submission For a fair and comprehensive tax system The New Zealand tax system needs more than a tweak and it is therefore unfortunate that some specific necessary changes are proscribed by the working group’s terms of reference. My submission however assumes no constraints and posits a tax system that represents an ideal for which to aim. A more comprehensively fair tax system would see the following changes: • capital gains taxed as income; • estate transfers taxed (on death or gift); • the income tax scale made more progressive; • the regressive goods and services tax reduced to 12.5%, without exemptions; and • a wealth tax introduced, or at least a land tax. An ideal tax system An ideal tax system has three essential components: income tax, estate tax and wealth tax. These three taxes are all progressive and play distinct and complementary roles. Tax on income (that includes capital gains) I am proposing that the income tax be made more comprehensive by including all income flowing from the investment of capital assets, including capital gains. Recognising that capital gains are income and should be taxed accordingly reflects the reality and puts an end to the unjustifiable preference given to unearned income over earned income. Realised capital gains would be treated as income, after adjustment for inflation, with losses allowed, ring-fenced and capped. If the “family home” is to be exempt from taxing capital gains, the exemption should however be capped, at say $1.5 million. The income tax scale should be more progressive, with at least one higher rate added: say 50% on incomes over $150,000. A more steeply progressive income tax scale also has the effect of reducing the after tax payments of New Zealand Superannuation to those on higher aggregate incomes. Corporate profits are (progressively) taxed as income in the hands of individuals and company tax therefore need not be made progressive. New Zealand should not join a destructive competition for low tax rates. Tax on inheritance A progressive tax should be introduced on the transfer of estates, on death or gift. There is a significant concentration of wealth that on transfer represents “unearned income”. Tax on wealth A wealth tax is required to stop the continuing and unlimited concentration of wealth and its potentially destabilising effects. The working group’s background paper shows a high concentration of wealth with the top quintile but pays no attention to redressing this. It states that: “Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid-1990s but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income.” No case is made for a wealth tax, although a land tax would address an element of wealth concentration. A wealth tax should at least be signalled for the future while interim measures should include a land tax, which it is noted can be easily implemented. While nearly every developed country taxes real estate, only local body rates are levied on real estate in New Zealand. Until a wealth tax can be introduced, New Zealand should at least implement a land tax and probably stamp duty on transactions to make best use of this finite resource and to help regulate real estate prices. Thomas Piketty in Capital in the 21 st Century insists that a wealth tax is an essential part of the ideal tax system and: “The primary purpose of a tax on capital is not to finance the social state but to regulate capitalism. The goal is first to stop the indefinite increase in the inequality of wealth and, second, to impose effective regulation on the financial and banking system to avoid crises.” Tax on wealth levied annually might be: 0% on aggregate capital assets up to $2 million in value; 1% on $2 to 10 million; and 2% above $10 to $20 million. Tax on goods and services The goods and services tax should be reduced to 12.5%. This would reduce the burden on those on lower incomes, reduce the case for exemptions from this tax, and reduce the revenue importance of this regressive tax. Progressive tax scales Progressive taxes were a major innovation of the 20 th century and played a key role in the reduction in inequality, until the 1980s. Progressive taxes are a crucial component of the social state and represent an ideal compromise between social justice and individual freedom. Unfortunately, today, the progressive tax is seriously threatened by international tax competition. But New Zealand should not join the race to the bottom. A more steeply progressive tax system is indispensable for making sure that everyone benefits from globalisation and to encourage support for the globalised economy. The globalised economy The globalised economy means that capital increasingly moves and investments are made across national borders. Capital is held in tax havens to avoid tax and the transparency of capital movements is limited. Multinational corporations exploit tax havens and low-tax jurisdictions to channel their profits and they pay little or no tax. New Zealand should continue aggressively to seek international transparency of capital flows and the full taxing of corporates in the countries where they do business. David Thorp 29 April 2018

Submission to the Tax Working Group Eric Bolt To deliver a tax system that is fair to the tax payer, an office needs to be established to provide independent oversight of Inland Revenue and the ability to provide guidance with tax legislation. I will cite examples of current practices and conclude that a trustworthy tax system must have checks and balances to protect the rights of tax payers. A better tax system is not just about what is taxed and how it is taxed, it also needs to consider the processes that administer taxation. Administration of the tax act is undertaken by Inland Revenue which is a government department reporting to the Minister of Revenue. Like the police, it has wide-ranging powers. Unlike the police it can use those powers without accountability to an independent authority. We are concerned that Inland Revenue has no accountably for its actions, and if it trespasses the act it operates under, there are no consequences to Inland Revenue. In an increasing age of digital surveillance and reliance on “big data” we believe that tax systems of the future must provide checks and balances for tax payers, and must allow freedom from the fear of persecution, and protection from statistical discrimination. When I started working in the tax industry over 15 years ago the Inland Revenue slogan was “It’s our job to be fair”. And they were fair. The agency account managers were accessible, helpful and empowered. Call centre staff were also helpful and across the department if there was a problem or an issue, it got resolved then and there. Nowadays the attitude is very different. There are no agency account managers, instead there are community compliance officers who have no decision-making authority. Phoning the call centre is a risk - the longer serving staff try to be helpful, however the newer staff are often unhelpful and wilfully obstructive. In a recent conversation a call centre representative, when asked on the procedure for refunds, relayed the following. “If a refund is over $1,500 definitely, or maybe $500, it will be put into review...” “It remains in review until someone contacts the call centre, and then we can refer it on to be released...” Our experience now (and this certainly never was the case in the past), if we call Inland Revenue will most likely request further information, such as a breakdown of costs, or breakdown of details. This is obtrusive behaviour designed to slow down the refund process. This now appears to be a deliberate policy introduced by Inland Revenue management. It ignores two basic principles of the Income Tax Act - namely our tax system is a self-assessment system, and section 6A of the act requires Inland Revenue to minimise compliance costs. The principles behind a self-assessment system make the tax system easy to operate, the mechanism works and those who flout the system will get caught. This allows most tax payers to file returns and receive refunds, in what used to be a couple of weeks. Now the principle is one that challenges every refund over $500. The reason people get refunds is because they have overpaid their tax, so what has happened to the fairness? The fairness in the system has evaporated, so why has this happened? We have seen a change in attitude which is focused on internal cost reduction and revenue maximisation. Cases where business proprietors are prosecuted for failing to pay PAYE, GST or Income tax are not uncommon, and we expect Inland Revenue to follow these through. However, it is not uncommon for Inland Revenue to only act seven years after the first offence. Why? Inland Revenue has the resources to track these payments, yet because the need to keep records expires after seven years and other time barred provisions, Inland Revenue leave this Submission to the Tax Working Group Eric Bolt until the last minute. If it is a crime not to comply with the Income Tax Act, why is it left so long? Either the department is under-resourced, or it is a policy that allows it to maximise the penalties and interest that can be charged. Another action we have seen is the issuing of deduction notices. This is where a letter is sent to an employer, requiring the employer to take tax payment deductions from an employee’s pay. This process is “An automatic process generated by the computer”, without notification to the tax payer or the tax agent. In several cases we have dealt with, the deduction notice was incorrectly issued, often as a result Inland Revenue errors or oversight. In the case of deduction notices which are incorrectly issued, there is a breach of privacy. It is also embarrassing for employees to be accused of owing tax in front of their employers. If the information Inland Revenue is sharing outside the organisation is incorrect, what rights does an individual have? Inland Revenue is driven by legislation, mainly the Income Tax Act. This means if parts of the act are ill considered, ambiguous or discriminatory, then the process to correct this is difficult. Tax legislation is mostly driven by Inland Revenue, whose recommendations are rarely challenged. The select committee process relies on representations, and these are made by those who have the resources to make representation. This means that legislation is passed without understanding how that might affect individuals, groups of individuals or small business. What the tax system lacks is oversight of the system which is independent of Inland Revenue. Section 6A of the Tax Administration Act has the requirement of the department to consider the “compliance costs incurred by tax payers” yet when this is not adhered to there are no obligations on the department or remedy for those affected by such action. Because of this, the department can act as it wishes as there is no consequence to them when they get it wrong. They act with disregard to the self-assessment system, knowingly withhold refunds, take months to process enquiries or act unreasonably. What is needed is an independent office that has the power to review the actions of Inland Revenue - to direct Inland Revenue to act in a certain manner and the ability to provide remedy when Inland Revenue has acted unfairly. This office would act to protect the rights of those affected by the actions of Inland Revenue, review legislation before it proceeds, and recommend actions that ensure the department has the resources it needs to deliver its services in accordance with set parameters. I believe, by and large, New Zealand has good tax system, and we all have to pay tax. However as there is no oversight given to Inland Revenue, the rights of those interacting with the department can be ignored. To have a system that is fair to all tax payers it is of vital importance to ensure that they have the right to have their cases reviewed independently. This I believe will put “fairness” back into the system and protect the trust that is required between those who pay the tax and those who collect it.

Submission to the Taxation Working Group by John Brian Furness 1 Introduction I welcome the formation of the Taxation Working Group, and the opportunity to make this personal submission. The views expressed in this submission are mine and are not submitted as the policy of any political party or lobby group, although there may be some similarities. My qualifications include holding an MBA degree, but mostly having spent a working lifetime as a taxpayer mainly in New Zealand, but also in other jurisdictions (Canada and United Kingdom). Although various numerical figures are noted in this submission, these are not the result of any quantitative analysis. Rather these are estimates based on my general understanding of the topic in NZ. If requested I would be happy to present this submission and answer any questions in person (or via video link). 2 Purpose of the tax system In my view the taxation system has an important role as the revenue collecting "pillar" of our society, which supports the range of services and welfare distribution that make our society decent. Since the 1980's I have observed a marked increase in inequality and decline in the cohesiveness of our society. I am seriously concerned that if this issue is not properly addressed, it will pose an existential threat to the society we aspire to. I do not gain any pleasure from the degree of selfish ruthlessness that has gained a foothold at the upper levels of our society, nor its most obvious manifestation – the extreme inequality now prevalent. I agree with commentators (eg Robert Reich, author of "Fixing Capitalism") who suggest that the prevailing degree of inequality is deeply embedded within our economy and bureaucratic systems, and will require a comprehensive effort to reform. A comprehensive review of the tax system is an important aspect of such reform. Obviously the causes of severe societal and generational inequality is not just the tax system, but the tax system can and should play a major part in addressing it. To this end I believe that a significant reform of the principles underpinning our tax system is required, but also our welfare support system requires substantial changes. NZ adopted a range of neo-liberal economic policies in the 1980's, which stimulated the increase in inequality we see today. This has been exacerbated by laissez faire economics in the past decade. One of the tenets of neo-liberalism was that the "trickle-down" effect would improve the fortunes of the lower strata. After more than 30 years, trickle-down has been exposed as a hoax. In my view therefore, it is time to adopt more explicit measures to reduce the inequality in our society. We ignore this at our peril: in the longer term even the selfish interests of the upper echelons of society are not served by exploiting the poor. In addition to historic injustices, the future of work (and therefore personal income) has significant uncertainty especially to the poorer members of our society. Many commentators predict that over the coming decade, technology will cause significant disruption of employment. The outcome of this disruption is expected to be a general reduction in the total number of jobs within the manufacturing and service sectors as well as a shift to different types of work. I foresee increasing polarisation of work opportunities – to both more intellectual (eg software development) and to \[1\] more menial (eg old-aged care). There is likely to be a "hollowing-out" of middle-tier jobs, which will tend to force people towards the two extremes, and make it increasingly difficult for individuals to transition between them. The disruption seems likely to occur within a single generation, and it is therefore likely that there will be a significant number of people stranded by their current skill set and educational attainment. This will challenge our current views of employment and employability. It does not seem possible that large numbers of, for example newly unemployed truck drivers, will be able to retrain as software developers. It is much more likely that they could retrain for new, but less fulfilling work at the more menial end of the spectrum. One key outcome of this transition is that the current linkage between welfare support and employment will not be sustainable. It seems to me likely that there will be more people who are unable to find suitable employment. This may well combine with known demographic changes to create an impossible burden on those people who do remain employed. Under this future scenario tax revenue will need to move away from employment income tax towards other economic activity – especially income earned as a result of speculation and non- productive investment. I also have serious concerns for the younger generation. The baby-boomer generation of which I am a member has benefitted in the past from their parents and will also extract benefits in future from their children. It is wrong for my "boomer" generation to imagine that NZ society can sustain the heavy burden we now and will place upon it. We have comprehensively failed in our responsibility to leave the world a better place for our descendants. I think it is time we redressed the inter- generational balance. The tax system serves many important purposes, linked to core government policies, which in turn reflect societal aspirations. In my view the tax system should operate to foster advancement of all parts of our society – not just the wealthy. The tax system can and should encourage better choices of education and investment by citizens, while generating the revenue to pay for core services and support those who, often through no fault or lack of initiative of their own, require some assistance. Ideally, the tax system should operate in a simple and straightforward manner with a minimum of compliance effort by all concerned. 3 Making income tax more progressive The changes to tax and other fiscal policies introduced into NZ in the mid-1980's (ie Rogernomics), reinforced and compounded by successive governments (ie GST, user-charges for a range of government services, student-paid education) have had a disproportionately negative effect on the lower socio-economic strata of New Zealand. While income tax per se is moderately progressive, the overall effect of other taxes (eg GST) and systemic disadvantages make the overall system much too regressive. Currently a new wave of "special purpose" taxes (eg fuel tax) are being considered, which will aggravate this situation. In my view there are measures available that would improve progressivity of the tax regime including:  Tax-free income allowance  Changing the tax treatment of tertiary education fees  Supertax on extremely high incomes As noted in the Working Group background paper, there are proposals to reduce the regressivity of GST by introducing multiple rates of GST for different types of goods, as is done in other countries. I do not support multiple GST rates. My experience in UK suggests this creates compliance problems, and disputes at the boundaries between categories. I believe the current simplicity and near- universality of the GST regime should be retained, but other measures adopted to address the regressive nature of GST – principally a tax-free personal allowance (see below). 3.1 Tax Free Personal Allowance One simple mechanism that would improve income tax progressivity, would be a tax free allowance, such as in UK. In the UK, the tax free allowance is currently £11,500 (NZ$22,500pa) which is very significant compared to the median UK income of £27,200 pa. Historically, NZ had a tax-free threshold, and also personal tax rebates, but these were set at low levels with minimal impact, and understandably were simplified out of existence. A tax-free allowance of UK proportions however, would make the tax system significantly more progressive. I suggest the NZ tax-free allowance level be set equivalent to the 25 th percentile gross income. In this way lower income earners would effectively get a full refund of GST and other indirect taxes and charges. As in the UK, the tax-free allowance would apply to all individual tax payers, but this would be recovered from the upper end of the income scale by changes to the current tax-tier thresholds. This approach would directly address the regressive nature of GST, which retaining the desirable simplicity of the current GST system. 3.2 Tax-deductible Tertiary Education The charging of full-tuition costs to students (ironically a policy imposed by the "boomer" generation who received substantially free university education) has systematically disadvantaged the lower strata of our society – who are generally unable to afford to participate in tertiary education. I support the aim of the current government to reduce the cost of tertiary education – in due course back to the levels prevalent in the 1970s. To assist those former students with outstanding loan balances, I suggest that repayment of the fees portion only (ie not living allowances) of existing student loans should be deductible against post- graduate income at a rate commensurate with annual tuition fees historically incurred. Since tertiary education is considered a "private-good", it is entirely reasonable that the investment required to acquire it be tax deductible. Unlike physical assets, the earning power of tertiary education typically depreciates very rapidly after graduation. Allowing tax-deductibility would encourage faster repayment of student loans that the current claw- back arrangements, releasing funds for other purposes. The relevant information to administer this proposal should already be on file at IRD. 3.3 Supertax on extremely high incomes One feature of the increasing income inequality observed over the past few decades has been the significant increase in very high incomes. Research and my own work experience suggests that personal performance alone cannot justify these very high income levels, and they are therefore undeserved. Rather, these excessive remuneration levels arise out of self-serving distortions in the salary setting process of major enterprises (including government departments). I see no moral obstacle to part of this vicarious benefit being shared with society as a whole. I propose that a supertax be introduced at a level of 50% of gross incomes (including all kinds of remuneration or benefits) exceeding $1M pa. The additional tax revenue gained from this measure is likely to compensate for the tax free allowance for the lower 30-percentile of income earners. This measure may make NZ a less desirable country for individuals with excessive salary expectations, but I consider this would be to the benefit of our society in general. 4 Tax impacts on housing Housing affordability is a significant issue for our society. There are many factors at work in housing costs; one of them is the tax treatment of housing investment. Therefore the tax system should be amended to the extent it is able to influence this issue. It seems obvious that one of the factors contributing to our current housing situation has been the favourable tax treatment of property ownership compared to other types of investment. Although housing-ownership is a largely non-productive investment, it has perversely enjoyed tax advantages over more productive investments. I consider this imbalance highly undesirable. I am embarrassed that the baby-boomer generation (of which I am a member) now enjoy benefits of housing investment, at significant cost to younger generations. Not only is this not sustainable in future (especially when combined with retirement pension burden), I believe it requires reversal. The distortionary effect of the current tax regime on investment is obvious when considering the return on rental property. The financial returns are typically only about 3% - similar to bank term deposits. It is only the prospect of untaxed capital gain that incentivises the current level of investment in property, with investors/speculators benefitting vicariously from all of the various other pressures on housing. The fact that foreign investor/speculators are prepared to ignore currency risk is further testament to the perverse attractiveness of NZ housing as an investment. The increase in the house-price-to-earnings ratio from around 3 historically to now more than 8 is a stark indicator of the degree to which my 'boomer" generation has trampled over the reasonable aspirations of younger generations. Past governments have failed to respond adequately to house- price inflation – preferring to feed the myopic illusion of increased wealth. Succeeding generations have a legitimate grievance, which their elders should address. In my view the Government should have explicit responsibility to manage house price escalation – to ensure escalation never again reaches recent levels. The tax system is one of the main tools to achieve this, but also urban planning, immigration and other policies have a role to play. The tax-treatment of housing investment should be changed to remove features that cause speculative pressure so that housing reverts to simply the means to achieve physical shelter. I support investment in property being subject to the same tax treatment as any other capital investment – ie tax should payable on both the cash returns and the increase in capital value over time. It seems sensible to me that the tax become due when the capital gain is realised, ie upon sale of the taxable asset. While regular property valuations could provide a basis for provisional capital gains tax, published valuations only provide a very general guide to actual selling prices. Negative-gearing for housing investment should be disallowed as an income offset. Negative gearing indicates the basic investment is unsustainable as a profit-making enterprise, and this should be reflected in the tax treatment. A sudden significant change in tax treatment for property will be disruptive for many, but at the same time significant disruption will be required to achieve the desirable situation where younger kiwis can again readily access housing ownership. The change in tax treatment of property should be clearly signalled, and be applicable to any purchase made after a specified date. The grandfathering of historic tax treatment should be progressively eliminated over say 10 years, but at a rate aimed to reduce severe drops in the house prices. The most difficult problem is how to protect the modest equity of younger home-owners who have been forced to purchase in the currently hyper-inflated housing market. Obviously, driving out speculation is likely to cause a significant fall in property values, which will wipe out small equity holdings, and leave an over-priced liability to mortgagees. Policy levers aimed at addressing housing speculation should thus be operated with care. 5 Retirement savings At present retirement benefits are paid from current tax revenue, with some support in due course from the "Cullen Fund". Due to the different populations in the age cohorts paying retirement benefits from current tax income will place a heavy burden on future tax payers. This is yet another example of the poor regard which "boomers" have for their children's generation. The contemporary beneficiary group always fall back on the justification that "we have paid taxes all our lives, and now it's our turn to be supported" – inferring a mistaken belief that there has been some historic "setting aside" for this purpose. I believe that retirement benefits should primarily be funded out of historic savings by retirees. This could be from a combination of government and private savings. Compulsory contributions to NZ Superannuation were introduced by the Kirk government in the early 1970's, but venally reversed by Muldoon. The Cullen fund is the latter-day successor, and will ultimately bail-out the very generation who opposed Kirk's initiative. Until a full transition can be made (it is unreasonable to expect the coming generation of taxpayers to fund both their parents' and their own pensions) I support payment of retirement pensions (but at a level much lower than currently) from current tax revenue to provide a safety net for those who require it – as part of a universal basic income. To top-up this basic income Kiwis will need to dramatically increase their personal retirement savings which is very unlikely to occur under the current system. The present taxation arrangements incentivise purchase of property rather than retirement savings. Perversely the tax system incentivises speculative property investment even above owner-occupied housing. In contrast there are few incentives to save cash (which can then be invested in productive assets) as part of retirement preparedness. Current poor saving performance is therefore not at all surprising. Many people (although the proportion is rapidly shrinking) regard their investment in a home as their retirement savings pot. Many baby-boomers have also invested/speculated in additional (rental) property, which has contributed significantly to house price inflation, as investment money chases a slow-moving stock of properties which are also subject to other pressures such as population growth. To counter-balance the tax changes noted above to property investment, I advocate greater incentives for true retirement savings. In my view NZ should adopt an EET (exempt, exempt, taxable) regime for retirement savings – similar to other jurisdictions. I suggest a pre-tax contribution limit of $25,000 pa, up to a maximum lifetime contribution of $750,000 (these limits being adjusted over time). The current Kiwisaver regime could be easily modified to accommodate this. The current fairly trivial government Kiwisaver contribution of $512pa would stop, being replaced by the tax-free contribution regime. I support the current "lock-in" that applies to Kiwisaver savings. The EET regime operated by many other jurisdictions appears to be much better at incentivising retirement savings. 6 Environmental taxes Along with many others I am concerned about climate change and the lack of definitive corrective action by recent governments. While a cap-and-trade regime may be the most efficient way to address climate change, the track record has been to do nothing at all. Until a cap-and-trade framework is developed and implemented, I suggest that a simple carbon tax be introduced immediately on all NZ fossil fuel consumption. Different tax rates can be calculated for coal, fuel and diesel oils, motor spirit, avgas etc, and applied at the point of purchase. The fund thus created must be ring-fenced for climate change initiatives, in particular research into reducing the carbon footprint of NZ pastoral farming, and energy efficiency measures in the housing sector. I am reminded of historic initiatives following the energy crises of the 1970's which provided a stimulus for alternative technology development. Clearly we need to avoid the mistakes such as massive (Think-Big) investments in white-elephant projects, and failure to follow through when short-term prospects improved. If some of the ideas of that time had been implemented then, we would have less of a climate change problem today. 7 Summary of proposals: 1. Income tax should be made much more progressive, reversing the steady regression of the past 3 decades. The main measures I propose to address this are: a. Establishing a significant tax-free personal allowance (at about the 25 th percentile income level), sufficient to offset GST and other costs incurred by low income earners. b. Allowing tertiary tuition fees (not living allowances) to be fully deductible for income tax purposes in the first years of postgraduate employment. c. Introducing a supertax of 50% on personal income (from all sources) in excess of $1Mpa 2. GST should remain as it is currently, ie largely universal and at a single rate. 3. Tax treatment of housing investment should be brought in line with other forms of investment, to make it less attractive for speculation. a. To the degree possible, tax policy on housing should aim to remove speculative pressure from investors, and prevent a repeat of recent rampant house-price escalation. b. This will require introduction of a capital gains tax on residential property investment. This tax should apply to all non-occupier purchases after a specified date. Tax exemption for earlier purchases would be grandfathered, but only for say 10 years. c. CGT should be payable at the time of sale rather than annual accrual – thus obviating final adjustment based on the actual selling price. d. Negative gearing for housing investment should be disallowed e. In the battle against speculation, the policy levers must be operated with care to preserve as much as possible the equity of recent owner-occupied home buyers. 4. Retirement benefits and funding require a major overhaul to achieve sustainability and generational equity. Over the long term, retirement benefits should be funded out of previous savings (both Government and private), rather than current tax revenue. The transition should begin with the current baby-boomer retirees, who are excessively rewarded relative to earlier or later generations. a. The retirement benefit should be reduced to the same level as other state benefits. b. Retirement savings should be incentivised by adopting an EET regime. I propose an annual tax-free contribution of $25,000, up to a lifetime amount of $750,000. 5. Although a cap-and-trade emissions policy may be economically preferable, the fact is that it has not been implemented and will be some time yet. In the interim a carbon tax of $10/T CO2 should be applied to all fossil fuel use, with the resulting fund allocated to climate change initiatives, principally in the pastoral farming research and energy efficiency in the housing sector. 8 Response to on-line submission questions: 1. I believe that major changes are required, which may reach the point of being a complete overhaul. NB tax is only the revenue pillar of state activity. I believe that a complete overhaul is also required to the welfare and benefit system. 2. I consider that the purpose of tax is all of the options offered, ie to encourage better choices, encourage/discourage investment in certain types of business, and to support those who need help, as well as core services. 3. To me, the tax system is generally taxing the right things – with the notable exception of investment in residential housing. However I think the tax system is overall far too regressive. 4. I am strongly of the opinion that tax is able to contribute to housing affordability, mainly by discouraging speculation. Housing is a multi-factor problem, but tax has an important role to play in its solution. 5. Of those tax issues listed, I believe those that matter most are retirement, environment and capital gains. A tax-free personal allowance would assist in making the tax system more progressive at the low income end of the scale, and a very high earner supertax would address the very high income end of the scale.

THE FUTURE OF TAX Introduction I am one of the ordinary Kiwis, writing a submission and trying to finish it off before the end of April deadline. The Tax Working Group, terms of reference in the Submissions Background paper, states that increasing any income tax rate or rate of GST are outside the scope of this review. And any public comments from “The Tax Working Group” have been focused on any of these taxes. A Wealth tax, tax on Financial Transactions, A Broader Capital Gains tax, a land tax (LVT) and new Environmental Taxes. With a strong focus on wealth inequality, specifically around wealth accumulation, which could lead to possible tax reforms, if the government was to follow any of the tax recommendations from the Tax Working Party. But over the past month I have become increasingly confused and frustrated regarding the messages and announcements coming from the Labour led coalition government. Which are often confusing, sketchy and seemingly vacillating and at times appear on the edge of conflicting with the terms of reference and scope of the Tax Working Groups review. Giving me cause to question and speculate as to whether any new tax changes or reforms that may be implemented to our present tax system could then be used to enable the government to bring in the extra revenue to offset the very high government expenditure without impacting on their promises of sustainable surpluses, net core debt and core crown spending targets. There are 3 issues which are a concern for me: 1. “Fiscally Neutral” tax proposals 2. The increase in fuel levies via “Hypothecated Transport” fund 3. The huge ongoing Government expenditure relating to the Supply and Confidence coalition deals that were signed behind closed doors, between the Labour Party, NZ First Party and the Green Party to enable the formation of the Labour led coalition NZ Government along with the huge ongoing expenditure for the Labour Party’s pre-election promises and the Labour Party fiscal responsibility rules signed with the Green Party ahead of the 2017 General Election. Which gave the commitment that the government will keeping posting sustainable surpluses to get Net Core debt down to 20% in 5 years and Core Crown spending near to 30% GDP. 1. “Fiscally Neutral” tax proposals It is entirely plausible that any tax changes stemming from The Tax Working Group could be balanced by tax relief elsewhere and any tax Working Group proposals could be “Fiscally Neutral” causing me to speculate that any revenue from new tax changes or reforms that are implemented to the existing taxes would be offset by an “adjustment” in income tax. “adjustment” meaning by raising the thresholds of cut-off point level of the present income tax system. Regarding the terms of reference and the scope of The Tax Working Groups review. Why is that Increasing any Income tax rate is outside the scope of the tax review BUT adjustment of any income tax rate is within the scope of the tax review? 2. The increase in fuel levies via “Hypothecated Transport” fund The increase in fuel levies for all NZ motorists and revenue used to build rail infrastructure and improve safety on regional roads. We were told that this was a fuel excise and not a tax, but an excise is just a form of tax. The fuel excise used specifically to “transport” in an a hypothecated fund – The National Land Transport Fund. Hypothecated Tax (to dedicate a particular tax to a specific area) The downside is that politicians are able to find “innovative” ways to move the goal posts and obscure the definition of the “specific purpose” of which the tax was hypothecated and can allow governments to regain total control over how public money is spent. Specific Purpose Transport in a hypothecated fund Definition of Transport. Modes: air, land, rail, road, cable, pipeline and space Fixed Infrastructure: Cycleways, roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines Terminals/Operations: Airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, depots and seaports Vehicles travelling on The Network: cars, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, people, helicopters, watercraft, space craft and aircraft Some alterative options for a excise/tax that could be used specifically to “transport” in a “hypothecated fund” 1. A excise on all cyclists, using cycleways and all revenue used to upgrade aviation fuel and gas pipelines 2. An excise on all watercraft and all revenue used to upgrade road infrastructure 3. The Huge Ongoing Government expenditure relating to Coalition deals and pre-election promises NZ has a progressive tax rate and a redistributive income tax system. To add fiscally neutral tax proposals that either bring “adjustments” to the existing tax levels alongside the introduction of new tax reforms, only serve to increase inequality and unfairness to the income tax system and place and extra burden on the decile 9 and decile 10 NZ households, who already collectively pay 52% of all income tax government revenue. As a result of paying the top income tax level and receiving very low levels of government transfers. The proposed new tax reforms will serve only to add additional taxes and increase the upper tax rate level cut off points, but leaving the Government transfers, at the present lowest levels, therefore adding even more responsibility, and extra tax expenses on these NZ households who are already contributing more than half of the governments income tax revenue. New tax reforms and tax “adjustments” should not be borne by “the few”. And not if they have been introduced as a tool to bring in extra government tax revenue as a result of the rollout of ongoing government expenditure to cover coalition agreements and Labour Party pre-election promises And to add to the government expenditure after only just 6 months into the Governments first term there are a total of 75 different groups of people, made up of inquiries, references and Working Groups reporting to the government. Which means there are more Working Groups than there are MPs in the entire Government. If the government appointed tax Working Group determines that they will be recommending Tax reforms in their interim report to the Government Ministers of Finance and Revenue. Then I have a few proposals for consideration along with some further detail around their applications. 1. A personal wealth accumulation tax Targeting the top three personal net worth age groups, with the highest accumulation of individual wealth and who are also the older members of the NZ population Base tax rates ages: 45 years – 54 years Medium tax rate ages: 55 years- 64 years Top tax rate: ages 65 and over plus a number of add on taxes for all three tax rates 2. Pigouvian Taxes and Sin Taxes Specifically targeting all the 120 politicians in parliament add on taxes for all government party list MPs And a sin tax excise specifically to gambling winnings Target Group A: Government Labour Party MPS Target Group B: Government NZ First MPs and Government Green Party MPs 3. Environmental Tax Target group: all NZ Electricity companies who are both generators and retailers of electricity. Purpose of the environmental tax: to subsidise all costs including installation to enable all NZ households to sustain – reduce their energy costs by using solar generated energy to heat and provide power for their homes while also addressing Climate change and environmental challenges and pollution along with making all homes warm and dry. 1. A personal wealth accumulation tax target group Older members of the population who have by the highest personal wealth Base rate: 45 – 54 years (- net worth $182,000) Medium tax rate: 55 years – 64 years (- net worth $278,000) top tax rate: 65 years plus (- net worth $288,000) Add on taxes, applicable to all three tax rates a. They own a family holiday home or Bach Capital Gains tax on the holiday home or Bach Land Value tax on the land surrounding their family home, can be progressive ie The bigger the section the bigger the LVT b.

They will need to exchange NZ currency into Euros, after the exchange rate is factored in and the bank fees are paid. An extra bonus Tobin tax 2. They need to send some cash overseas to use/pay for their planned holiday after the exchange rate and bank fees have been taken. An extra bonus a Tobin Tax. 2. Pigouvian Taxes Specifically targeting the 120 politicians in parliament. Applied when: a. They speak with forked tongue b. They exhibit sour grapes behaviour c. Anytime hot air emissions are detected Additional taxes for all government list MPs: a. If they are judged to be high-flown and overblown b. If they put on a lot of dog Supplementary Taxes (Sin tax/excise specifically to gambling winnings) a. If you are a member of a party that is part of the coalition government and your party has more Party List MPs than electoral seat MPs and the Electoral seat MPs make up less than 14% of your total seats in parliament b. If you are a member of a party that is part of the coalition government and your party MPs are all from the Party List meaning that your party has zero Electoral seat MPs in government. 3. Environmental Tax A progressive tax targeting all electricity companies who are both generators and retailers of electricity. This tax is specific to the net percentage of total annual profits. All government revenue to be placed in a “Household Solar Generated Energy” ”hypothecated fund” specifically to subsidise all costs including installation to enable all NZ households to produce solar generated energy to heat and provide electricity for their homes at zero cost for low income households and subsidies for the remaining NZ households. The Labour led governments Tax Working Group A review of the NZ Tax System NZ is one of 35 countries in the OECD that have a mixed economy structure: a mix of government spending and free market systems, based on the share of government spending as a percentage of GDP – incorporating both the private sector of capitalism and the public sector enterprise of socialism to overcome the disadvantages of both systems. In 2017, OECD “The Structure of Tax Receipts” NZ had substantially higher revenues from taxes on Corporate Income and Gains and Goods and Services taxes (GST). NZ is also equal to OECD average for taxes on property. In 2015 NZ had one of the lowest government debt of all the 35 OECD countries, coming in 4 th out of 35. Comparisons: NZ 35.6% GDP Australia 67.7% GDP Netherlands 77.5% GDP U.K 112.6% GDP USA 125.9% GDP Mixed Economies Very few economists would argue that the government should try and intervene in all areas of the economy. Private business and financial incentives pay an important role in a well functioning economy, even if the desire is to promote greater redistribution. NZ Net debt to GDP 2016 - 24.40% May budget 2017 - 23.8% 2016/2017 fiscal year - 22.20% NZ Debt to GDP (core Crown spending) 2015 33% GDP growth (3.19%) 2016 32.1% GDP growth (3.58%) 2018 28.5% (2017 National Government forecast) 2022 27.8% (2017 National Government forecast) Economic Growth In August 2017 the then National led Government had a government surplus if $3.7 billion for 2016/2017 and economic growth forecast to be 3% over 4 years. The tax take was 7.3% higher compared to the same period the previous year. Government Net debt was $62 billion, equal to 23.8% net of GDP in the May 2017 budget, but in August 2017 was updated with Net Core Crown debt estimated to be $2 billion lower than bydget forecast. This has meant that the new Labour led government has benefited from the higher gain in expected government revenue. Labour Led Government and Expenditure 1. Cancelled National Governments $8 billion tax cuts and used this money for “Families Package and other Coalition Confidence and Supply deals” 2. Expenditure and outlay for “Free tertiary fees” and “Kiwi build” 3. The creation of 75 inquires, reviews and working groups. 4. Maintaining core funding for Health and Education, costing billions of dollars alone, without injecting the further revenue that is needed for these 2 core sectors. NZs Tax System A broad based progressive low rate and distributive tax system. It has a more concentrated source of government revenue than all of the 35 OECD countries with the exception of Denmark. And NZ is now one of the few developed countries currently running on a fiscal surplus. 90% of the governments tax revenue comes from just three tax bases, allowing NZ governments to raise substantial tax revenue, with low tax rates. This simple and low rate tax system reduces government administration costs and gives less opportunity for tax avoidance. The three tax bases Individual Income Tax - 40.2% GST - 31.4% Company Income Tax – 16.3% NZ has reduced its use of other tax bases in order to keep our tax system simple, broad based and low rate. Previous tax reforms have eliminated Sales taxes, excess retention taxes, Land taxes (LVT), estate duty taxes, gift duty taxes and cheque duty taxes. Previous tax reviews have rejected introducing Financial Transaction taxes, wealth taxes and a General Capital Gains tax. The Tax Working Group will now examine whether there is a case to introduce any additional taxes particularly in the light of growing International debate about income and wealth inequality. Income and Wealth Inequality and the present NZ tax system of Individual progressive tax rates along with a redistributive tax transfer system The Fundamental difference between Capitalism and Socialism lies in the scope of Government intervention in the economy (discretionary fiscal policy) A mixed Economy balance Free market – Entrepreneurs are able to make a profit Government intervention – progressive taxes to reduce inequality Distributional Outcomes 10% of households with the highest incomes pay around 35% of all income tax and 50% of all households in the 5 income deciles collectedly pay less than 20% of all income tax. Decile 1 - 8 collectively pay 45% income tax Decile 9 and 10 collectively pay 52% income tax Decile 1- 5 collectively pay 17% income tax Decile 6 - 10 collectively pay 82% income tax Government Cash Transfers Decile 1 - 5 collectively receive 70% Decile 6 - 10 collectively receive 30% Deciles 1 - 5 collectively - the amount they receive in cash transfers is greater than what they pay in tax. Decile 6 pay 1% more in tax than what they receive in transfers. Decile 7 pay 4% more in tax than transfers Decile 8 pay 6% more in tax than transfers Decile 9 pay 12% more in tax than transfers Decile 10 pay 29% more in tax than transfers The NZ Tax System NZ has a progressive and redistribute tax system “The more you earn the more you pay “and a government system to help NZers in the lower income households. The result of our Tax system is that government income tax revenue is dependent on a small group of high earning salaried individual NZers to pay a large chunk of tax. Making it a risk to our tax base as people are mobile and can move overseas. 2016 figures The top 3% of individual income earners ($150,000+) pay 24% of all tax received - on a net basis, 48,000 households pay 28% of all tax - one in three households are contributing nothing to NZs tax take - 663,000 households or 40% are net tax negative and thousands more are net tax neutral A Progressive Broad-based Distributive Income Tax System and Wealth Accumulation Socialist Economy The primary concern is an equitable redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor. Free Market Economy Contents that inequality itself, is the driving foe that encourages innovation which then pushes economic development. Mixed Economy Structure Incorporating both the private system of capitalism and the public-sector enterprise of socialism to overcome the disadvantages of both systems. Household and Individual Accumulated Wealth 1. Household net worth is higher for the 2 top quintiles 4 and 5 2. Personal net worth is higher in the age groups 45-55 years but progressively much higher in age groups 55-64 years and age groups 65 years plus a. Household Net Worth It could be said that the wealthiest households have worked hard all their lives and chosen to save more and invest a proportion of their income long term, and for future financial security and towards their retirement years. By doing so they are in turn helping to promote economic growth, for all New Zealanders to benefit from. b. Personal net worth tends to depend on age, as people accumulate assets throughout their working lives. On average older people are wealthier than younger people. Individual and Household, Accumulated Wealth, Most NZ rich listers are self-made people and entrepreneurs who have created businesses. They are people who have taken personal risks and invested their own capital. Non-Owner-Occupied Housing Wealth This shows that this wealth is held by the wealthiest quintile. But does not distinguish between rental property investors and the NZ tradition of owning a family holiday home or Bach. Baches are often handed down through many generations of family members and are used and shared between family members and their friends to enjoy. If the bach or holiday home is used for both rental and private purposes then it is classed under mixed use assets for IRD and taxed. The criteria being if during the tax year your property is used both for private use and income earning use and it is also unoccupied for 62 days or more. Marginal Effective Tax Rates on Savings All very consistent with rental properly equity around 17% below and owner-occupied housing equity the biggest problem. Past Tax Reviews, established criteria, costs and benefits for the introduction of tax reforms 1. Efficiency - previous government forecast in 2017 economic growth expected to be 3% of 4 years 2. Revenue integrity - present tax system simple broad-based, progressive and redistributive system thus making it harder for tax avoidance 3. Fiscal adequacy - previous government (2017) surplus was $3.7 billion for year 2016/2017. NZ is now one of the few developed countries currently running on a fiscal surplus 4. Compliance and administration costs - present tax system is simple and broad-based which keeps compliance and administration costs down to add further taxes alongside income tax would add complications and greater compliance and administration costs as a result 5. Coherence - all of the tax working groups suggested taxes, have either been eliminated or not implemented with previous government reviews or reforms. To keep our present tax system simple and low cost, any further tax reforms will need to be simple and low cost, none of the taxes that have been suggested fit that criteria and would not make any sense to introduce them to our present tax system. 6. Procedural Equity and Fairness - Our present tax system is a progressive and redistributive tax system. Top 2 deciles collectively pay 52% of all income tax revenue deciles 1-5 collectively. The amount they receive in cash transfers is greater than what they pay in tax. To add further accumulated wealth taxes alongside the top 2 deciles who are collectively already paying 52% of all income tax revenue is neither fair or equitable. These six established benchmark criteria’s have been successfully applied and maintained within the present NZ tax system. Any introduction of further tax reforms by the present NZ government serve only to add extra ongoing administrative and compliance costs and will not beneficial to all New Zealanders. Wealth Tax a tax on tax “You work hard all your life, pay tax, save money and pay tax and then you pay tax in what’s accumulated and left over. Does that seem fair?” - an ordinary kiwis opinion. Previous NZ governments reviews have rejected this tax. - Wealth taxes have been proven to bring in little government revenue France bought one in between 1998-2006. It bought in $2.6 billion government revenue per year but $124 billion flight of capital. - Across OECD nations, a wealth tax represents less than 2% of total tax revenue for governments - It deters entrepreneurs, analyses of 4 countries who abolished wealth taxes increased self- employment by up to 0.5% points. In the UK, not even a Labour government has ever introduced a wealth tax. Denis Headly, famously said “I found it impossible to draft one (wealth tax) which would yield enough revenue to be worth the administrative cost and political hassle.” Land Tax (excluding the land directly under your family home) 1. The land surrounding your family home 2. The land surrounding your farm house 3. The land surrounding your family holiday home or Bach (previous reforms have eliminated land tax) Value Capture Tax Grant Robertson on Property Value Capture Tax: “The government was investigating innovative ways to bridge the funding gap to pay for rail and roading infrastructure the country needs especially around Auckland. These options included Value Capture which the productivity commission championed early last year” For funding infrastructure by taxing the households and businesses that most benefit from it. Includes rail and roading. For households it can be applied before or after public improvement is built. Tobin Tax or Robin Hood Tax A financial transaction tax which includes taxes on currency transactions. “The original purpose has been eclipsed among activists who have increasingly seen the Tobin Tax as a good way of raising revenue for Economic and Social development” - (even Mr Tobin was not impressed) - When you get paid and make a payment on your mortgage - When you send money overseas to pay for your upcoming holiday - When you exchange NZ Cash into other currency’s (after losing money on NZ exchange rate + bank fees) to take with you on your upcoming holiday This tax will affect ordinary Kiwis through Kiwisaver. Previous reviews have rejected Finical Transaction Taxes. Broader/Comprehensive Capital Gains Tax “You are taxed on your income, spend the rest and it is taxed with GST. Buy alcohol, cigarettes or petrol and it has a sales tax on top of GST. Pay for Council Tax (rates) and pay GST on top of the Rates tax. Now they want to take the rest you have managed to save and call it Wealth/Capital Gains and tax it repeatedly (annually). Does that sound fair to you?” - an ordinary Kiwi Previous tax reviews have rejected Capital Gains Tax Tax Working Groups Tax Submission Background Paper appendix 2 Design Issues with a Capital Gains Tax feedback on a number of detailed design issues 1. Rental Properties 2. Holiday Homes/Bach (exemption only for family home) 3. Share market shares 4. Collectables, jewellery, antiques, paintings etc 5. Private assets such as cars, boats etc 6. Assets held by Kiwisaver 7. Other Savings Schemes 8. Gifts and Gambling winnings e.g. lotto 9. Family Trusts 10. Disposal of assets upon death - estates Phil Twyford, regarding Capital Gains/Wealth Tax: “Its not okay that the 1% are making money out of assets and paying very little tax, while ordinary Kiwis go to work to pay their tax every day. We have to change that.” A broader Capital Gains Tax on Residential Investment Properties “It will affect middle New Zealanders. People who are asset rich and cash poor. Like self-employed business owners. New Zealanders who own a family Bach. Elderly people who have saved their whole lives for retirement and are living off their savings and/.or rental property returns.” - an ordinary Kiwis view on extra taxes Nationwide Rental Crisis December 2017, January 2018 and February 2018 Trade Me Rental Figures A shortage of places available to rent nationwide down 49% between Dec 2017/Jan 2018 compared to same time period Dec 2016/Jan 2017. Total number of new bonds lodged in 2017 were down 99%. The biggest annual decrease since 1993. Capital Gains Tax on all residential Investment properties means new rules on Landlords, could see them exit the market and even further reduce the supply of rentals, which are already in short supply. Its getting hard for the overwhelming majority of Landlords, who only own one or two rental properties. These are all sophisticated profit driven land lords. They are nurses, doctors and teachers. They are getting out of the market and doing other things or retiring. Minister of Revenue, Stuart Nash: “The changes to the bright line test will ensure that residential property speculators pay income tax on their gains and makes property speculation less attractive”. Phil Twyford - on plans to address the rental crisis: “The only way to seriously keep rents in check is to greatly increase the supply and the Government has a role to play in this”. In both increasing the supply and softening the rough edges of the Private Market, he wants to introduce legislation to reform Residential Tenancies Act and to increase the supply the Governments Kiwi Build Plan building 100,000 affordable private homes over a ten year period and this would free up rentals by moving tenants into private homes. February 8 th 2018 A goal to build 16,000 affordable homes over the next 3 years may be overly optimistic, documents from the MBIE suggest after Phil Twyford has said that 16,000 would be built in the governments first term, MBIE documents estimated only 8000 homes would be constructed over 3 years. It would take 4 years to build 16,000 homes. “They are not building homes for the homeless or low income earners, they are going to be building affordable homes, that cost $500,000 or more, that most of us can not afford” - an ordinary Kiwis view Tax and Behaviour (and coalition supply and confidence deals) Social costs are taxed at a higher rate and social benefits are subsidised or taxed at a lower rate Pigouvian Taxes A tax that aims to change individual behaviour which the government deems to be harmful to other people or the outside environment Examples: - A fuel tax - A water consumption tax - A royalty on bottled water - Carbon taxes on fossil fuels (could include electricity) - Waste sent to the land fill tax (a Green Party coalition deal - a commitment to minimising waste to the landfill by reducing all waste classes by 2020) - A wind down of the exiting government irrigation schemes (another Green Party Coalition deal) - No new irrigation schemes will be funded by the government (yet another Green Party Coalition deal) Carbon Taxes When Australia introduced a version of a Carbon Tax in 2012, more than half of the Government revenue ended up being given back to pensioners and poorer households to help with their energy costs. In 2007, when David Parker was the Climate Change Minister and Dr Michael Cullen was deputy PM, the Labour government proposed a Carbon tax on both fuel and electricity, estimated to bring $360 million per year revenue for the Government but the government was forced to do a U-turn in the end. 1. The governments recent short term environmental solution that will likely result in long term negative effects for the NZ Economy. The removal of existing government subsidies and investment in irrigation schemes. The benefits to the NZ Economy of irrigated NZ farmland 2000/2002 - 4% of irrigated NZ farmland producing $1 billion net per annum at farmgate. 12% of agriculture GDP 2012/2013 6% of irrigated NZ farmland producing $2 billion net per annum at farmgate. 20% of agriculture GDP Variable summer-dry climatic conditions on the summer dry east coast of NZ coupled with market supply and value added processing requirements mean that irrigation is now essential for consistent and quality food production. Of irrigation infrastructure projects, the vast majority are multipurpose and provide, both irrigation and town and stock water supply. This summer 2017/2018 alone saw six regions declared in drought as dry weather hammered primary produces right around NZ. The government subsidies Irrigation systems in NZ through crown irrigation investments Ltd, which co-invests, provides grants, applying commercial expertise and leadership. On April 6 th 2018, the government cans Canterbury and Marlborough Funding for Irrigation Schemes. Irrigation NZ CEO disappointed, because irrigation projects were worth $1.2 billion to communities around NZ every year. This was a huge lost opportunity for those rural communities. The projects all have local community support and also meet strict environmental requirements around river swimmabiliy and nutrient limits. The harmful effects of Irrigation Schemes on the outside environment - why Labour government canned funding for Canterbury and Marlborough Irrigation schemes. Grant Robertson, minister of finance: “Because they have a potential to lead to intensive farming practices, which may contribute to adverse environmental outcomes” And more likely: a supply and confidence coalition deal between Labour Party and Green Party. No new irrigation schemes will be funded by the Government and a wind down of the existing government subsidised irrigation schemes. A supply and confidence coalition deal between Labour Party and NZ First party “honour existing crown irrigation commitments” 2. The governments recent short term environmental solution that will likely result in long term negative effects for the NZ economy. A ban on all oil and gas offshore exploration permits, resulting in a significant impact on Taranaki because the bulk of the industry is there. Impact for NZ 1. Locally produced gas is used directly in the domestic market, kiwi homes and businesses. 2. 30% NZs net gas production is used for energy generation. 20% for electricity. 45% for petrochemicals, methanol and fertiliser. 3. A lot of gas is used in the production of methanol which is exported, only methanol is exported 4. Compared to France, only 1% of Frances oil and gas consumption is produced domestically except for Methanol which is exported Results 1. At the moment it is impossible for NZ to import natural gas, as there is not the right infrastructure in place 2. It is likely to mean as NZ transitions away from gas, a supply gap will form in the market 3. Oil will continue to be imported just as it always has 4. It will do little, if anything, to NZs use of oil and gas 5. Household power bills will probably rise Economically The moment the government begins stripping existing commercials rights (as seen in oil and gas permits) investment confidence plunges. Conclusion Interest in offshore oil and gas exploration has dramatically tapered off in the past couple of years and opinions are that there will be a downgrade shortly, in the extent of existing oil and gas reserves. If this was to occur, it will likely impact on the belief that there is at least 10 years of domestic natural gas still available to meet the needs of the domestic market and the biggest industrial gas users such as Melhanex, Fonterrra, NZ Steel and fertilizer companies, Balance and Ravensdown, along with electricity generators (who use their gas fired power stations when wind or water is short). If our existing locally produced oil and gas reserves have been used up over this 10-year period of time, then this will likely lead to a greater use of coal industrial heat and the need to build the required infrastructure, for the importation of Natural Gas instead. The Sin Tax A tax used to change individual behaviour that is harmful to the user. - A government sponsored tax without making the use of the products illegal. - An excise tax used to increase the price in an effort to lower their use, or failing that, to increase and find new sources of revenue. NZ already has a Sin Tax (excise) on cigarettes and alcohol. The tax working group is considering further sin taxes on: - Soft drinks - Sugar - Gambling winnings e.g. If you are lucky enough to win lotto, the government will take their share of your winnings!!! Taxing Regulations aimed at unwanted behaviours - Giving government greater intervention and the power and control to dictate the definition of unwanted behaviours without making the unwanted behaviour illegal. Example: a sugar tax government intervention regarding personal food choices and lifestyle decisions. Dr Eric Crampton Chief Economist, “The NZ Initiatives - a think tank”, recently shared his opinion regarding a sugar tax. “The sugar taxes are offensive. They presume that some government official knows better than you, about what food choices are best for you. They presume poor people are too dumb to make the right choices and must be guided by their betters. They are also deeply classist, because they are generally aimed at things like soda, rather than expensive coffee drinks. And if people flip from chocolate bars to potato chips, are they really that much healthier?” Conclusion Its important that we keep our present tax system of lower and flatter taxes and keep it simple to maintain stability and balance within our Mixed Economy Structure. Our present tax system has efficiency, revenue integrity, has a fiscal surplus, has low compliance and administration costs and maintains coherence. It is also broad-based, has progressive tax rates along with a redistributive cash transfer system. “The more you earn the more you pay”. The statistics clearly show that the lowest income households (deciles 1 to 5) collectively receive 70% of all redistribute cash transfers and these cash transfers are greater than what these households pay in tax. And the two highest income households (deciles 9 to 10) together pay 52% of all income tax. Therefore, any household or personal wealth accumulation (highest in the two top quintiles 4 and 5 households) and progressively higher in age groups (45-55 years) (55-65 years) and (65 years plus) personal wealth can be attributed to a decision made by these households and individuals to work hard throughout their working life, take out personal loans to gain qualifications for career advancements, maybe take extra personal risks by becoming self employed and starting their own business, while putting savings aside and making investments for future financial security and retirement. By doing so these households and individuals are in turn helping to promote economic growth for all New Zealanders to benefit from. It is important that we keep our present tax system of lower and flatter taxes and simple. So we can continue to encourage and inspire all Kiwis to finically succeed in life, thereby lifting prosperity for all New Zealanders. Gaylene Freeth \[1\]

I have just returned from an extended overseas trip to find that the deadline for submissions on the Future of Tax is today, Monday 30 April. Unfortunately I have been left with insufficient time to make a polished presentation. Rather all I have been able to do is draw out an opinion paper I prepared before the 2017 election for publication in the NZ Herald that was rejected, according to the Editor, because it was too long. It was entitled Towards a Fairer Wealth Distribution in NZ. However, because it was primarily about reforming the existing taxation system to provide more take home pay to low salary earners I think it is still basically relevant to the Working Group’s request for contributions. I have therefore done a quick reshaping of it so that the ideas I was promoting then are presented within this submission. As far as I can ascertain the only thing that has changed since its original preparation is a new government with different attitudes towards poverty and wealth polarization in NZ than the successive National led governments of Key and English had when in power. I welcome very much this new attitude and the opportunity to make suggestions to the Tax Working Group (TWG). So here we go! The year 2016 was one for surprises, none more so than Britain voting to leave the European Union and America voting a billionaire political fledgling into the Presidency for the next four years. Such outcomes were interpreted by expert analysts as evidence of distrust in career politicians and/or political parties to do anything to improve the lot of an ever, increasing lower income class of disenchanted voters. Irrespective of these startling events, there has been no interruption in the growing polarisation of wealth within most Western democracies. Governing political groups ignore it, partly because the dispossessed have no organized group to voice their plight, but also because the opposition parties are either bereft of ideas on how to attack the matter or if they have ideas are scared of voicing them for fear of losing electoral favour. So as an issue, vast national 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 2 wealth disparity tends to sit in the same basket as climate change – on the back burner. Present inaction is alarming and cannot continue forever unless we are prepared to accept social breakdown and with it a loss of respect for law and order. The tell tale signs are starting to emerge – growing homelessness, people living in cars and growing food queues at welfare agencies, that resemble refugee camps within an otherwise land of plenty that New Zealand really is. A major challenge to democratic free enterprise countries like New Zealand and near neighbor Australia, is whether the growing disparity of wealth within its citizenry can be alleviated via democratic means rather than revolutionary means. With both the Brexit and Trumpery phenomena, a significant chunk of the lower income electorate (‘rural white’ in the case of America) voted for change at any cost even to the point of possibly maiming itself further by doing so. Time will tell if an even bleaker situation awaits the disenchanted of both countries under their new regimes. Late in 2016 I read a NZ Herald article reporting a statistical survey on credit ratings. It ‘informed’ us that “the older you are, the better your credit rating”. Unsurprisingly, it listed the high scoring factors for credit rating enabling you to get loans at lower interest rates as people having doctorates, being married, having three children and being professionals. The low scoring factors were people that were renters, regular smokers, had six or more children and were machine operators or drivers. This hardly requires rocket science to understand. Another article I read within short time of this one was the summary of a report entitled: ‘Child Abuse and Family Structure’. Its statistics sung the virtues of the married state, revealing (amongst other things) that “the risk of abuse for children whose parent/caregiver had spent more than 80% of the last 5 years on a benefit was 38 times greater than those with no benefit history.” It further noted that most children associated with benefit history had a single parent/caregiver. Once again this hardly requires rocket science to understand. In both cases, despite their disparate nature, what separates the best from the worst is the stark difference in economic condition. The managerial or ethical deficiencies are as much symptoms as they are causes. People get into poverty traps and/or lose moral 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 3 direction out of hopelessness, self inflicted or otherwise. Poverty is minimized in societies that have enlightened socio-economic governance, but widespread in countries that turn a blind eye to it. Furthermore, it is much easier to claim the moral high ground when you are well fed, well sheltered and enjoy family unity because of your superior socio-economic status. The Auckland Mission reported in December 2016 that up to 300 families per day were visiting its Hobson Street Drop in Centre for emergency food handouts. Other welfare agencies report similar, ongoing experiences today. In a land of plenty like New Zealand that is shameful. Also shameful is the way some newspaper correspondents maintain that poverty in Auckland is nowhere as bad as welfare agencies claim. Worse still some blame the beneficiaries themselves for the failures of a wage structure that militates against their survival without assistant benefits. These correspondents should pay a visit to the Hobson Street Drop in Centre in Auckland and observe before opening their mouths. The current political approaches to dealing with the growing band of dispossessed in New Zealand are demonstrably ineffective. More to the point it doesn’t seem to matter which party you support for those that vote ethically, as none of the major parties seem willing to shift far enough either side of the status quo to properly address the matter. In so doing they end up treating the symptoms rather than the causes. Thankfully the new Adhern led coalition government has been responsive in setting up the TWG encouraging comment on how the taxation system can work in a fairer way for all New Zealanders, not just those in the upper wealth echelons. A skillfully devised new taxation system can help bridge the divide between the haves and have-nots, which brings me to the substance of my submission. Greed, a word that the secular world seems to have abolished from its lexicon as one of the seven deadly sins, is obviously one of the causes for the galloping rich-poor divide. But that is a matter for personal morality that cannot be treated politically. The other is ubiquitous, concealed in our current taxation system. A system that served the nation well in the good old days of the 1950s to the early 1980s in New Zealand where taxpayers were taxed on their earnings 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 4 only, no longer works to provide the relative poverty free days New Zealand then enjoyed. Why? A lot of the blame rests with Rogernomics that ushered in a 10% GST tax on 1 October 1986 with a raft of income tax cuts to compensate for its immediate impact. GST was a panacea for all our woes; everyone would get richer from the trickle down effect of the income tax cuts. But as lower income workers soon discovered, it did nothing to help them as it applies to everything purchased, including life’s essentials like food and clothing. On the other hand it proved to be a wonderful cash cow for government revenue. It was increased first to 12.5% on 1 July 1989 and then racked up a further 2.5% to its current level of 15% on 1 Oct 2010. The official IRD justification for the latest increase in 2010 was: “New Zealand relies heavily on income taxes in order to fund expenditure. Income taxes may, however, be harmful for efficiency and growth. Taxes on consumption, such as GST, tend to be less harmful to growth as, unlike income taxes, they do not apply to savings and, therefore, do not discourage this activity. A switch from income tax towards GST can, therefore, boost incentives to save and encourage economic growth.” Rogernomics has been a windfall for the wealthy, a disaster for low-income earners with its trickle up effect. And it has presided during a period of an unprecedented widening of the wealth gap in New Zealand. However, a new unacknowledged effect on low-income earners has been the way in which money has become ‘commoditized’. It is now the new God of the secular world, ‘the opium of the people’ as Karl Marx once said unkindly of religion. It is almost as significant a commodity as the food we eat and the air we breathe, despite the fact we can neither eat it nor breathe it! So dramatic has been this change that those in their mid thirties today have no experience of its altered status because they have not lived in a time prior to its commoditization. Money was invented to serve two purposes: to reward labour and to provide for the orderly exchange of goods and services between people 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 5 engaging in commerce – buying and selling. This was the role it primarily played up to the end of say the 1970s. But in more recent decades it has become something bankers and brokers can package and sell off as ‘money products’ that have no use but carry cash value. Financial products can be traded on the share markets with bankers, brokers and wealthy clients cleaning up big time. And accompanying this has been an exponential escalation in the salaries of CEOs and senior executives of banks, companies and corporations as they delivered rapid gains in capital to clients and stockholders with capital to invest in stocks or money products, dubious or otherwise. Days when the bosses earned three to five times the hourly rate of their employees that septuagenarians can recall are unknown today yet government still taxes primarily on income. The massive changes that have taken place in wealth division in free enterprise countries have tracked alongside this new fluid nature that money has assumed. Now those at the top of the salary pyramid in corporations, banks and companies like the CEO of a large company receive hundreds of times the salary their employees at the bottom of the salary pyramid do. They also receive sizeable annual bonuses (affordable to fund because there are far fewer executives than there are low income employees) from having delivered favourable dividend rates to their stockholders. In some cases these bonuses would provide an annual income sufficient to shelter, feed and clothe a family on hard times that queues at welfare centres in need of assistance. The stockholders are happy, the executives are happy, meanwhile an increasing number of people are lining up at our welfare agencies in need of assistance to exist. Furthermore, money can be cleverly moved around under tax exemption schemes, all legitimate, and maximized in amount exempted by shrewd company and taxation accountants and lawyers. These exemptions are effectively unavailable to the rank and file of people like machine operators, mechanics, drivers, etc. that have little if any income left over to ‘invest’ in anything other than a lotto ticket that cannot be claimed as a tax deduction when it loses. The result is that the disposable incomes of those at the top of the wealth pyramid is now greater, probably thousands of times greater, than those at the base of the 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 6 pyramid. It is true that those at the top of the pyramid may work longer hours per day, possibly even twice as many hours (say 16 hours) than those at the base (say 8 hours). This is not surprising as their work is stimulating, rather than mundane, like that of a machine operator. But this difference in hours worked is disproportionate to the factors like hundreds or thousands that separate those at the top and bottom of the salary pyramid in terms of disposable income. It’s a perfect recipe for wealth polarization and has worked assiduously if silently over the past few decades in New Zealand and other similar countries to result in the rich getting richer and the poor, poorer. The real estate market is another symptom of a distorted national wealth distribution. It is governed by market forces with people competing at auction to obtain the best property they can in terms of location and improved value permitted by their after tax income advantage. This competition drives up costs at all levels available in the property market and if the supply doesn’t meet the demand (as happens in cities like Auckland) then values rise at rates that were unthinkable back in the 1970s. For example, my three bedroomed house on the southern slopes of Remuera was worth 3 times my salary in 1971 when I arrived in Auckland as a 30 year old university lecturer from Vancouver. If I arrived here today as a 30 year old university lecturer from Vancouver and tried to buy a three bedroomed place of similar standard to the bungalow I purchased in the same street as I did in 1971, I would now have to pay about 15 times a current university lecturer’s salary. What hope is there of home ownership for even young professionals to be had in another decade if things continue on the same wealth gap trajectory we are on? As home ownership slips from the grasp of even young professionals into whose hands does it fall? Wealthy investors, either home grown or foreign buyers seeking to divest themselves of wealth in their own countries swallow it up. And with it the wealth distribution continues to flow further into the hands of the already wealthy segment of citizenry. So what to do? If New Zealand doesn’t want to continue down this path of increasing wealth polarisation, a major reform of the present taxation system is necessary to ensure people at the lower end of the salary chain earn enough on 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 7 which to survive without welfare benefits that never solve the problem. Either radical change to existing income taxation schemes or some form of a capital gains tax that claws back from the already wealthy to distribute equitably amongst low income earners in their take home pay is needed. Gareth Morgan’s attempt to remedy the problem via a Comprehensive Capital Income Tax (CCIT) scheme is worthy of consideration for this reason alone. I am not qualified like Treasury is to evaluate it but I am pleased to see it being advanced in the absence of anything else by the major opposition parties. However, I am familiar with numbers and can comment on adjusting the existing income tax scale. A simple transition towards the existing Australian tax regime, inter alia, that has a threshold income level of $18,200 before taxation would help lower level income earners. An interesting ANZAC comparison bracket to look at is the $0 – $30,000 group, including the intermediate rate transition points at $14,000 (NZ) and $18,200 (AUS). This is what it looks like: Taxable Income NZ Tax Payable AUS Tax Payable 0 - $14,000 0 – $1,470 0 $14,001 - $18,200 $1,470 – $2,202 0 $18,201 – $30,000 $2,202 – $4,270 0 – $2,242 The crossover point in salary where the nominal tax payable is the same, namely $10,696, is $58,920. After that we have: Taxable Income NZ Tax Payable AUS Tax Payable $70,000 $14,020 $14,297 $100,000 $24,550 $24,297 $180,000 $50,980 $54,547 $300,000 $90,580 $108,547 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 8 Even after any fine-tuning to account for (minor) differences in exchange rates and the distribution of income groupings, the ineluctable fact is that lower income earners are far better off in Australia than they are in NZ under its tax regime. What’s more the higher income earners (the “rich dudes” as Gareth Morgan euphemistically refers to himself) in Australia are paying a higher brunt of tax on taxable income than the privileged in NZ. So when the claim is made that higher taxes on the high income (entrepreneurial?) earners drives them out of the country, why have they not fled from Australia to NZ where the tax rates are lower? It is a hollow threat that doesn’t hold up to anyone but the beneficiaries of the status quo. So altering the NZ tax regime along Australian lines is the best quick fix that comes to mind for the present government. Because it is hard to imagine business reining in the salary structure pyramid that currently exists or a modern government stepping in and regulating it by flattening it out, other measures along the lines of a capital gains tax need to be explored for long-term change. We already subscribe to a form of capital gains tax when we pay our rates. The rating system is based on property values (unimproved land plus improvements to the property(s) we hold title to) and is accepted by ratepayers as fair for local body government. If we do shift in that direction then Henry George, a forgotten but otherwise brilliant American economist and social philosopher of the late 19 th century has provided a template for doing so using a single ‘location’ tax where we are taxed on the value of the unimproved land we hold title to in his monumental treatise called “Progress and Poverty”. This brilliant analysis of land, labour and capital was republished in 2006 by visionary humanists concerned about the future of unregulated capitalism. Even Donald Trump could not escape his social responsibility of paying tax to the government coffers under this system. George, a free enterprise (not Marxist) economist, who sort to use the efficiencies and wealth the free market produces in concert with the noble human aspirations that provide for social justice has been hailed one of the greatest thinkers of the 19 th century by intellectual titans like Leo Tolstoy and Albert Einstein. The latter two may not have been economists (although one of them 30 April 2018 TAX WORKING GROUP OF NZ SUBMISSION Graeme D Putt 9 was a genius when it came to working with numbers) but they were great humanitarians that tower in their contributions and compassion for humankind compared to modern financial ‘prophets’ (or spelt ‘profits’ in their case?) like Milton Friedman and Alan Greenspan. Those that care about the future kind of New Zealand they want for their children and their children’s children should question the vast, existing wealth gap sooner rather than later. If what they want is one of Darwinian socialism where the strong and the wanted are advantaged to produce billionaires like Donald Trump that pay no income tax on their 3.1 billion dollar empires; and the weak and unwanted are relegated to welfare benefit queues, then they should vote for more of the old Douglas-Key-English rubric as it is designed to retain the status quo. On the other hand if what they want is a society in which everyone that has left school pays a just share of tax based on an indicator of their wealth (like for instance land they hold title to) that leads to a narrower wealth distribution to that which presently exists, and consigns poverty levels and welfare queues back to their 1960s levels when they were virtually unheard of, then they should vote for properly researched taxation changes that will get them there. The government recently formed seems dedicated to the ideals of the latter viewpoint in setting up the TWG. I sincerely hope it can deliver on fundamental changes to our tax system that results in greater socio-economic egalitarianism. As a final note added today (the deadline for submissions day) I apologise for the drift of comment away from the theme of tax at times but I would rather get a potentially disjointed submission in by deadline than make no submission at all.

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Do you have any thoughts on how the tax system needs to change? It needs to use tax reform: • To address tax inequalities that have helped make New Zealand an increasingly unequal country to live in. • To help address environmental and climate disruption issues. • To help address housing issues. • To encourage sustainable, clean, future-focused business enterprises. What is the purpose of tax? • To help make New Zealand a more equal country. • To provide a range of public good services across the country. • To help those who need support. • To encourage New Zealanders to make better choices. • To encourage investment in some businesses and enterprises. Are we taxing the right things? No, not always. • Income is taxed unevenly and therefore unfairly, advantaging the wealthier and penalising the lower income workers. • Income tax rates need changing and all sources of income should be included. • Capital gains on investment properties and shares should be taxed and the taxes be paid annually, not deferred. • Trusts, except for charitable trusts that don’t run businesses, need to pay tax at the same rate as income tax. • Polluters need to pay. Can tax make housing more affordable? It can help to. As noted above, we support a capital gains tax on investment properties, to be paid annually, not deferred. The tax could be equated to the Government bond rate. There may be a case for adjusting the tax for inflation. What tax issues matter most to you? Summary – more detail below • Using tax to help address inequality – through income tax reform • Aligning trust tax (except for charitable trusts not running businesses) with personal income tax. • Taxing capital gains from investment properties and shares. • Introducing a flat tax rate on financial transactions. • Combating foreign multi-nationals tax avoidance. • Introducing an entry tax on visitors to New Zealand. • Introducing a carbon tax. • Introducing a resource use levy for all water used industrially or commercially. • Through tax incentives, encouraging sustainable, clean, future-focused business enterprises. • Introducing a tax on sugar. The highest priority for us is to reform the tax system to help reduce inequality. The growing inequality in New Zealand has flow on effects across our society. We do better when we are more equal. The Spirit Level – Why more equal societies almost always do better by Richard Wilkinson and Kate Picket clearly demonstrated this. The authors showed that greater levels of inequality are positively correlated with higher rates of ill-health, lack of community life, violence, drug problems, obesity, mental health problems, long working hours, educational outcomes and big prison populations. We need to use tax reform to help address this major problem for our country. • We support higher top income tax rates for higher earners. Our top tax rate is very low when compared with the United Kingdom and Australia – both have a 45% top rate. Economists such as Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva have done modelling that shows that developed countries could increase top rates to as high as 80% before losses from avoidance and reduced effort would outweigh the revenue gains. Rates we support for current income tax bands: 0 - $14 000 — 0% $14,000 - $48,000 — 17.5% $48,000 - $70,000 — 30% $70,000 - $150,000 — 33% $150,000 - $1million — 39% $1million plus — 49% • Remove tax on invalid and sickness beneficiaries. Trusts • A corresponding adjustment of trust tax rates will need to be introduced to deal with tax avoidance of income earned. Rates we support for trust trustee income — as above with the same bands. • Tax on beneficiary income related to trusts to remain the same as current. • There is a need to investigate and address charitable trusts loopholes that allow charitable trusts to operate as businesses, e.g. Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, Ngai Tahu Holdings Corporation Ltd. It seems inherently unfair that charities are able to run businesses and not pay income tax. There is no level playing field when a company paying no income tax is competing with a similar business that has to. Tax other sources of income • It is inconsistent and unfair to tax only some sources of income. • As stated above, tax capital gains on investment properties and also shares, to be paid annually, not deferred. There may be a case for adjusting the tax for inflation. The tax could be equated to the Government bond rate. Properties • As said above, we support a capital gains on investment properties to be paid annually, not deferred. • Introduce a tax on residential properties unoccupied for longer than 4 months annually. This could be tracked through an annual property status declaration to be required of all property owners (as in Vancouver). Tax empty houses at 1% of the property’s assessed taxable value. • In tandem with this, legislation should be brought in that prevents foreign buyers from countries that do not allow New Zealanders to buy property in their country from buying property in New Zealand. These foreigners would be able to lease only, not purchase New Zealand property. A flat tax rate on financial transactions • Introduce @ 0.01% tax on all financial transactions over $1000, including cryptocurrency transactions. This would be easy to collect. Combating foreign multi-nationals’ tax avoidance • Introduce a revenue tax on foreign multi-nationals earning in New Zealand. For example, Australia is implementing a tax that will apply to foreign businesses that sell more than A$75,000 (NZ$80,000) of goods to Australians each year. They are also imposing tax on foreign businesses on all goods they sell to Australians that are worth less than A$1000. Another approach to goods bought online from foreign companies is to extend GST to include items NZ consumers buy from international websites. Other ways to tackle foreign multi-nationals’ tax avoidance: • Introduce a NZ company tax on their revenue earned in New Zealand. • Introduce a 6% revenue tax on digital multi-national companies with a turnover of more than $1.3 billion that depend on digital advertising and online marketing e.g. Facebook, Uber, Airbnb, Amazon, Google, Twitter. Taxing for the environment and climate • Introduce an entry tax on visitors to New Zealand to provide funding for the Dept of Conservation to help conserve our natural heritage and manage the unsustainably high visitor numbers in many places. We need a clear and simple system requiring those who pollute to pay. A carbon charge is a simple and transparent tax on pollution. • Introduce a carbon tax and phase out the Emissions Trading Scheme to steer people away from climate-hazardous activity in favour of cleaner enterprises. • Charge industrial polluters $25 per tonne on carbon emissions and charge dairy farms at $12.50 per tonne. • In tandem with the carbon tax, revenue raised from the tax could go back to households in the form of a tax cut and to businesses in the form of a company tax cut. • Introduce a resource use levy for all water used industrially or commercially, charged on the basis of volume used. Charging should be administered by a publicly-elected body such as a regional council and any profits should be used to better manage water and encourage sustainable practices. • Introduce tax credits for green enterprises, i.e. long term sustainable, clean, future-focused business enterprises. Taxing to improve health • Introduce a tax on sugar - at the very least some commonly used forms of sugar like sugar- filled drinks.

Submission to the Taw Working Group This is long. But so has been the arrival of the many social ills now clamouring on our doorstep. You wanted feedback. Here are some changes. Happy to hear back. Outline Section 1: Overview Section 2: Table of Tax - policies to implement Section 3: Work and Flexicurity Model APPENDIX: Rebuttal to the submission by the tax payers union. Overview What we are doing isn’t working. That’s why you’re here, reading this submission. But there will be many that trot out the same old tripe; “Government is inefficient and lower taxes would mean more efficient spending by the private sector” “We are taxed more than what can be justified. Individuals, families and businesses are best placed to decide how to spend or invest their money” “Taxes should not be used to change behaviours - consumers should be left to decide what is best for them.” Bull. Total rogernomics trickle-down lies that have failed. Repeatedly. Globally. Unregulated wealth accumulation and private distribution does not reward society. That’s a democracy that looks about as convincing as a certain comb-over on a windy day. Why the blindness to seeing the podium or pit where every baby will take their first step? Children are the focus of this submission as the future of tax will have a direct impact on the society they are born and raised in. As the current generation wears the consequences of previous reform so too will the coming generation benefit or suffer by the choices made today. Because in the face of those who cling to what they have(1) or others who seemingly reach for what is not theirs(2), I think we all agree that we want to leave our children a brighter future. (1) https://www.taxpayers.org.nz/send\_twg\_submission (2) http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO1804/S00258/closing-the-gap-submission-to- government-tax-working-group.htm We need to stop punishing people who are born not lesser, but with less. Stop entitling people to the delusion that they somehow ‘earnt’ a mansion by Lake Wanaka having worked not a day more nor harder than those who retire in state housing. Somehow more deserving of their wealth than a child of a meal and a roof over their head. Because when you’re accustomed to privilege, equality looks like oppression and you only really learn about empathy from someone who is like you - an impossibility in an inequal society. Tax is love. Tax is real social investment and how society moves forward constructively or destructively. The past 20 + years has seen growth at the expense of the environment, at the expense of public services, at the expense of the poor and at the expense of NZ being a respectable leader in the world. We should be aiming as a society to address our fundamental needs first and sustainably: (https://www.kateraworth.com/doughnut/) “People who hold a lot of their wealth in land will be taxed more than those who have wealth in other things, like gold or shares. These might not be the people we want to tax more.” (https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-fact-tax-issues.pdf) Currently, the main bases to the tax system, GST and income, target the poor. Should we tax them more? Privatise prisons that we can tax as they generate revenue from our poverty-driving policies? While we simultaneously struggle to treat the many problems poverty creates such as domestic abuse, addiction, crime, behavioural/learning difficulties, etc. Great! Oh wait... Also why don’t we treat housing like an investment opportunity instead of a basic human need? Great! Oh wait... Or water, like a limitless resource rather than vital to surviving more than 3 days? Great! Oh wait... Climate change and environmental damage disproportionately affects the poor. Over the past 40 years plus the rich have safely had their swimming pools while the once popular rivers and lakes became toxic. So it hurt a little to read the stupidity behind this one: “But sometimes it’s hard to work out what the cost of pollution is. What is the cost to society if one particular river is no good for swimming? What if it’s in an area where no one lives? Or in a popular tourist area?” (https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-fact-tax-issues.pdf) This is stupid indeed. Do you think pollution happens in isolation? Is that how the world has been shown to work? Every river, everywhere, counts. Pollution is nothing more than lazy problem- shunting from a business or individual into the environment and so onto the whole of society (and future generations/current). Pro-active planning of waste disposal at the very start of production should be considered as relevant as consumer demand in any modern business model or product development path. We need to have length and end-of-life of product a compulsory consideration to pre-empt pollution or this will continue to be a clean-up issue forever. Every river. For goodness sake. It’s as silly as fencing large streams only to prevent nutrients from smaller streams trickling into them...oh wait. All the water in the world is connected. Let alone thinking it isn’t within one country. This whole “THAT SOUNDS GOOD. BUT IT GETS COMPLICATED” spiel about addressing the disproportionate impact GST has on the poor vs the rich is also lazy problem-shunting. If exemption from GST is a problem because tax is complicated then subsidise? Anyway, this is a difficult task. No matter what you do people will not like you. But the worst, absolute worst, that you can do, is fail to make any difference at all. So some suggestions Section 2: Table of Tax - policies to implement Some policies are effective in addressing multiple problems and so repeated. Societal Problem Tax policy Reasons and relevant references GDP a failing metric and misleading guide – or rather, who does the market serve? If the economy is not beholden to the benefit of the future generation then what is it good for? For it will certainly not be for good. Policies and economic analysis must include alongside and prioritise above GDP the following elements of society currently not economically targeted: Social sustainability (not sustainable growth), health, infant mortality, morbidity, suicide rates, crime, poverty, environmental health/decay, life span of consumer durables and public infrastructure, family breakdown, loss of leisure time, cost of commuting to work, income gap (women/men; poor/wealthy). The OECD and UN are considering alternate metrics (https://sustainabledevelopment .un.org/content/documents/576 9Beyond%20GDP%20Indicators% 20to%20what%20end\_rev.pdf) Here is a working summary document of what existing metrics (GPI, FISH, UNHDI...) account for and others don’t (http://www.consultmcgregor.co m/documents/resources/GDP\_a nd\_GPI.pdf) This policy would serve to guide NZ to a better future where social inequality/instability is minimised Economic inequality Progressive tax and a capital gains tax are the most obvious and effective answers. Above $100,000 income should be taxed similar to Denmark rates, with added percentages every increase of $50,000 – the median wage of a NZer. Below the liveable income bracket a negative income tax should be applied so as sufficient to live on. All sources of wealth including long-term investments in property, all shares, inheritance, a stamp duty, family trusts, gifts, land, all property - including the family home - should be taxed. Currently the NZ tax system is distorted to draw most heavily on income and this is shown in our straining health system and high child poverty rates as this tax system is one where the generationally impoverished, without property, land, inheritance, etc, are shouldering more than they can sustain. While those already with wealth can employ wealth to hide and accumulate more wealth – wait, for what? It’s not like they can take it with them when they die. Oh, right – generational wealth acumulation The extension of a safety net for everyone in society (including for those who own property and suffer sudden job loss so they are asset-rich but cash income poor) is fair so long as all sources of wealth present in society contribute to the whole. Denmark is consistently one of the happiest countries because tax is understood to be the social investment necessary for any child to grow up without fear or neglect. (https://www.usnews.com/news /best-countries/articles/2016-01- 20/why-danes-happily-pay-high- rates-of-taxes) Above a certain threshold of income wealth does not increase quality of life so much as draw wealth for the sake of it, thus increasing inequality (http://www.pnas.org/content/1 07/38/16489.full) Unless generational wealth accumulation is explicitly targeted through tax, inequality will grow and society will destabilise, as is occurring globally (https://greatergood.berkeley.ed u/article/item/are\_the\_rich\_reall y\_less\_generous, https://www.theguardian.com/i nequality/2018/jan/22/inequalit y-gap-widens-as-42-people-hold- same-wealth-as-37bn-poorest, https://www.theguardian.com/c ommentisfree/2018/mar/04/geo rge-osborne-eliminating-current- deficit-austerity-terrible-cost- hubris) No accountability currently for wealth hoarding is driving public services to bust and children into poverty. These taxes would go towards addressing current and future job insecurity, formation of a dynamic workforce, reduction of child poverty and all associated ills (crime, addiction, abuse, etc) as well as generational wealth accumulation and growing inequality. Land coverage decreasing and value increasing land should be charged a percentage value annually and stamp duty reinstated Land value is guaranteed to increase as population increases. So also. Stamp taxes for transferral of land. If you have GST on commoditites being exchanged from one to another. Land is a big darn commodity. Not exactly easy to make more of and disappearing in this warming climate too. Housing prices This seems to cover all the bases: https://www.top.org.nz/what\_will\_top\_d o\_about\_negative\_gearing A roof over your head is a basic human necessity first. Not an opportunity to turn a buck If you own the house you live in you save $$/wk from the equation: (rent you don’t have to pay) – (council rates you have to pay). This is always a positive number. Seriously, TOP and Australia are all the info ya need to address this one Stealing from children to feed their grandparents aka, aging population and non-means based superannuation Reverse the system. Means-based assessment for access to full superannuation. Unconditional basic income/negative income tax for those early in life encountering climate change, stagnant wages, high job insecurity and exhausted health and public system. Early-life targeting is the best economic policy a government can take in fostering a stable, happy society and saving money from problems such as youth crime, poor mental health, etc. (http://www.occ.org.nz/assets/U ploads/EAG/Final-report/Final- report-Solutions-to-child- poverty-evidence-for-action.pdf) This tax would redirect funds from fluffing an already comfy retirement into poor homes or low-wage work such as in nursing and palliative care, with clear benefits for those wishing to enjoy autumnal years in a nice NZ with happy caring hands. Government bears the burden of rising unemployment while business profits from increased productivity. Robot tax - tax on any company engaging technology that replaces low-wage jobs so as to supplement a negative income tax for those who currently have very little to no job security. This should be clear under their listed assets such as ‘self-checkout machine’. Business growth does not sustain society when productivity is increasingly disconnected from the labour force. Automation is here. Right now the government is set to foot the bill for more of it -“According to our estimates, one more robot per thousand workers reduces the employment to population ratio by about 0.18-0.34 percentage points and wages by 0.25-0.5 percent” (https://economics.mit.edu/files /12763) This tax would go directly to support the current and future NZ workers being replaced and into upskilling work programmes as in Denmark Lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes Sugar Tax – tax on any processed sugar (i.e. not fresh fruit) or sugar derivatives such as corn syrup, similar to alcohol. If this non-nutritious, addictive and disease-causing substance was introduced into market today it would be highly regulated in food. Big Sugar is here, using the same tactics as Big Tobacco in historically suppressing studies to negative health effects (http://journals.plos.org/plosbiol ogy/article?id=10.1371/journal.p bio.2003460) NZ government is again, paying for someone else’s profit as lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes linked to high sugar intake are on the rise and the health system is groaning under the weight of it. (https://qz.com/1134313/sugar- health-effects-50-years-ago-the- sugar-industry-hid-evidence- from-the-public/, https://www.odt.co.nz/news/du nedin/health/disadvantaged- paying-poverty-their-teeth) This tax could be directly earmarked to lower dental costs in NZ and funding childhood obesity programs. Lifestyle diseases such as obesity and diabetes Subsidise fresh fruit and veges (since maintaining a consistent GST has benefits) This will decrease the proportion of the average low-wage income spent solely on food. Furthermore, this will assist a change in the average NZ household to a more plant-based diet required to sustain a growing global population without undue environmental cost. GST has hit the poorest the hardest and this is not helping child poverty, poor nutrition and obesity in NZ. (https://www.interest.co.nz/new s/89002/beneficiaries-and- lower-income-groups-have- been-hit-hardest- typical%C2%A0cost-rises-over- past) Fruit and veges need – and really logically should be - cheaper than processed foods such as chips. This would improve nutrition, reduce lifelong healthcare costs and damage the environment less. Tax evasion Harsher penalties for high-threshold tax evasion alongside a more transparent and friendly tax system. One can hope that with sufficient penalties in place they might just pay instead of take the risk. Also start measuring dynamic poverty statistics. Tax evasion is use and abuse of public good and the coming generation. In a country where 1 in 6 children are raised in poverty, these figures turn the stomach: • 193 New Zealanders own or control assets worth more than $50 million • 161 have filed tax returns for the 2012 financial year • 107 have declared their personal income is less than $70,000 http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/n ews/article.cfm?c\_id=1&objectid =10887756 This should generate some revenue from those that are morally bankrupt but can otherwise afford it The Panama Papers shame/John Key’s legacy NZ should be exceedingly proactive in cooperation with international governments to target global tax evasion given our previously willing enabling of http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/ PO1401/S00011/who-owns-nz- foreign-control-key-facts- updated.htm global economic thievery. As part of this we should close loopholes allowing loose investment in land as well as instituting accurate international measurements for wealth and what bonuses/tax freebies we give industries. Please gawd change whatever loopholes and tax is enabling this atrocity: https://interactives.stuff.co.nz/2 018/01/half-a-million-hectares- sold/#alpha-burn-station- VU5RNZyT0l This should make headway into restoring NZ image internationally in a way that is positive to the parts of society whose investment we should be courting/encouraging Climate change Subsidise green tech instead of a fuel tax that will disproportionately hurt the poor. If you need tax revenue that bad for improved road infrastructure/climate change policies - tax the truck/tanker companies that endanger the road and cause excessive wear – this might also encourage them to shift more cargo to rail, a more climate and socially conscious mode of product delivery. The poor already struggle with the cost of living, are less likely to be able to afford fuel-efficient cars and more likely to have a longer commute to work. A fuel tax will only drive the vulnerable deeper into poverty given the scarcity of usefully frequent public transport in NZ cities. Given the poor are already billed to pay for climate change the most it seems a little cold to ask for pre-payment. (https://www.stuff.co.nz/environ ment/80441421/Eating-the- shore-New-Zealands-shrinking- coastline, http://www.mfe.govt.nz/climate -change/how-climate-change- affects-nz/how-might-climate- change-affect-my-region/west- coast, (https://www.nature.com/article s/d41586-018-04854-2) Smart tax for smart changes, the poor can’t afford much more strain and incentivising implementation of green tech through tax subsidies is more likely to foster good businesses Climate change Tax on building site waste tax break on building sites implementing recycling of materials – this should remove some for the environmental tag of new housing. This could be incorporated under polluter pays and green incentive tax packages. This could also cover companies involved in energy-efficient/ green tech retrofitting of houses with cladding/insulation, greywater recycling and rainwater collection. Smart houses should be the standard in NZ, benefiting the environment, assuring against increasing water insecurity and providing a sustainable healthy home. This could also make a big difference economically: https://theconversation.com/want-the-economy-to- grow-its-time-to-look-at-cities-and-efficiency-54517 Energy consumption Tax breaks for companies that assist poor households to change to more energy- efficient lighting and whiteware This could be written in as ‘green charity’ by a business. One of the neglected parts in the balance of economy and environment is energy. Population increase demands that we change to a more energy efficient way of living. The poor can rarely afford this shift. Pollution Polluter pays tax for any business operating in NZ Polluter pays for any NZ business operating globally? Palm oil tax or similar on any products containing unethically/unsustainably sourced ingredients I suggest we start examining our global impact as a country too. Importing PKE is hardly climate friendly at the tonnage currently. It has been identified as a significant source of income in the palm oil industry. Pollution taxes should have a global outlook built into them for both problem and solution finding Not enough business Encourage small businesses by mitigating tax penalties for start-ups and making process more transparent. Maybe institute a progressive company tax Encourage entrepreneurship by removing job insecurity Not sure on this one. We’re not even taxing the profit off of selling businesses and they’re complaining of paying liveable wages in NZ – so why should the taxpayer subsidise them? Give people enough financial/income security with a negative income tax that they can seek out the opportunities to grow great ideas, create businesses and be productive. Benefit generations Additional low-income tax bracket. Remove second job tax if below certain threshold – I.e. making ends meet. Similar taxings on savings should be reduced or, in case of people on benefit, removed below certain threshold so room for ‘emergency fund’ allows better financial planning, budgeting and support as they move into employment. Currently, dangerous credit card debt is encouraged as benefit drastically slashed or halted if saving present for emergency such as car repair. No the poor are not lazy. They are not stupid. Yes they do know how to spend money. Or at the very least should be given the same ability to self-govern and make mistakes and learn as our banks have. With no doubt far more positive societal consequences. A UBI would give back dignity and self-autonomy. They belong and will be positively not punitively supported. Unconditional support with positive incentives to work such as ability to save would ease re-entry Underfunded/strained conservation Desperate need to address multiple endangered freshwater species Tourist tax It’s lovely and simple. No fee per national park, just upfront contribution at the airport for all non-NZers towards sustaining the (remaining) natural beauty of this country. Seriously, this is a premium destination and maintaining the environment is only going to get harder, not easier as our population and the tourism industry grows. DOC is chronically underfunded despite the importance of the tourism industry. We need this tax. Extensive water pollution and unsustainable water resource practices in the context of an approaching global water crisis Water Tax Accurate measurement of the quantity and health of this precious, vital, basic resource (not commodity!) (http://pureadvantage.org/news/2018/04 /24/lawa-gone-beyond-remit/) Taxing of water bottling companies exporting Cape Town ran out. Aquifer science isn’t clear on how long, or if, they can replenish or self- clean. We need to lockdown on this now before it is too late. Also can’t believe we’re subsidising plastic pollution and poor working conditions for what? Nothing almost (https://www.stuff.co.nz/busines s/99726885/Its-just-so- dangerous-Squalid-conditions- reported-at-water-bottling-plant) Water is taken far too much for granted in NZ. Dangerously so in the face of climate change. A tax is a great start to making people understand it is not for exploitative investment but a human need Prison population Close private prisons. Legalise drugs and tax them instead – earmarking that tax for addiction programs and combating established gangs as well as renovating prisons to be places of social rehabilitation instead of punishment. Institute UBI to target poverty and financial stress contributing to crime Prison populations are a societal burden and shame. Convictions based on drug addictions are like sentencing someone to death for attempted suicide. You are merely assisting them in their self-destruction through a tokenistic moral action that makes you feel better Drug addiction Legalise drugs and regulate prescription/access to them in medically supervised locations or mobile buses. “the individuals afflicted with substance addiction need medical help, not jail” https://www.huffingtonpost.com/myisha- cherry/our-biased- compassion\_b\_4739361.html Anne Case and Angus Deaton of Princeton University have chronicled the rise of “deaths of despair” and argue that opioid use in America in part reflects a long-term decline in well-paying jobs for those with a high school education or less https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists /mexico-should-legalize-drugs-and-so- should-chicago/ Addiction is a brain disorder not a moral failing, nor a disease, and needs to be treated as a health issue for effective recovery https://blogs.scientificamerican.c om/observations/what-does-it- mean-when-we-call-addiction-a- brain-disorder/ Portugal, non-punitive, rehabilitative https://71republic.com/2018/04 /08/portugal-winning-drugs/ Not in vacuum: https://www.leafly.com/news/p olitics/portugal-drug- decriminalization-statistics https://www.historyextra.com/p eriod/modern/1940-the-year- mexico-legalised-drugs/ Additionally alongside UBI: the economy growns and there is a robust social fabric and safety net, so fewer people self- medicate with drugs. https://www.independent.co.uk/ news/long\_reads/portugal-drug- laws-problems-abuse- decriminalised-results-success- study-cocaine-marijuana-heroin- a7996896.html Rising gang presence Legalise drugs Criminalization of drugs puts power in the hands of gangs to hassle harmless local growers and businesses. These gangs are homes of domestic abuse and they do not offer help to addicts because they have no incentive whatsoever to support that. “See, if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel. That's literally true.” — Milton Friedman \[100\] Legalisation of drugs also decreases corruption The creation of drug cartels\[edit\] Mass arrests of local growers of marijuana, for example, not only increase the price of local drugs, but lessens competition. Only major retailers that can handle massive shipments, have their own small fleet of aircraft, troops to defend the caravans and other sophisticated methods of eluding the police (such as lawyers), can survive by this regulation of the free market by the government ... it is because it's prohibited. Oh my look one policy that relieves so much suffering. It’s about time we stopped the hypocritical double standard where rich/famous drug addicts need rehab but poor need prison. https://www.huffingtonpost.com/myisha-cherry/our-biased-compassion\_b\_4739361.html Oh and also where it’s totally OK to change gambling laws for a casino with dodgy addict assistance in the past and institute private prisons it’s a little weird for NZ to be upset by having health officials be involved in drugs. It’s a health, not a moral issue. Same as prostitution and abortion. Intensive dairying damaging the environment Cow Tax If business capital is taxed cos it’s an asset, shouldn’t there be a tax/head on cows? No I don’t actually think this should go through except under polluter pays maybe, certainly it would help discourage the most environmentally damaging intensive agricultural practices. The problem being that farmers themselves can have vulnerable margins and are suffering from rising suicide rates. I think the farms could do with being broken up as done in the past to the benefit of NZ farmers. Monopolies aren’t good for sustainable practices. Poisoning of aquifers Canterbury region/other fragile regions Incentivise switch from dairy to better land use - Tax water used in irrigation - Tax fertilizer Switch to small-scale organic farming, this fits with clean green premium NZ product image as well as reducing environmental impact so as to make that claim ring at least a little true. We have one of the leading soil science centres in the world. Lets use this recent cull of overgrown herds in the South to offer tax breaks (short term and maybe conditional return upon profit being made – I mean hey, you make students pay ya back for investing in their future so why not businesses in their own profit?) to change to organic farming. Irrigation encourages intensive dairying that will ultimately result in a very big, dirty future bill (that we are only just starting to pay). Smart agriculture is actually more 1) productive, 2) sustainable, and 3) profitable as you’re not paying all the ecological or other costs. Up to 80 % reduction in fertiliser use! It’s time for NZ to think smart, not big. http://aseed.net/en/climate- smart-fertiliser-addiction- business-as-usual/ https://fcrn.org.uk/research- library/keywords/fertilizer-use Alongside water quality, soil health is also a rising global concern. In NZ they go together a lot. Slowing economy UBI and lower income tax bracket will put dollars in more pockets in the population that will spend them in NZ, not overseas or squirrelled into a trust fund or ‘family home’. This increased circulation also leads directly to a stronger economy through multiplier effects. “Someone on Wall Street getting another dollar adds 39 cents to the economy, whereas a low- income earner getting another dollar adds $1.21 to the economy. That’s three times better for the economy. So making sure everyone in the bottom 60% has money to spend into the economy makes a hell of a lot more sense than the top 20% being shoveled even more money.” https://medium.com/basic- income/its-time-for-technology- to-serve-all-humankind-with- unconditional-basic-income- e46329764d28 Seriously, a UBI system really isn’t a loser. You’re going to save money long-term (and probably short- term from simple streamlining effect) and you’re paying through the nose for welfare for little effect right now Low income Second job tax removal If someone is working two jobs to make ends meet that is a real struggle that many NZers are facing. This should be differentiated from a part-time consulting job contributing to $xxx,000 income. This tax would encourage work as more incentive since get more back in pocket. More back in pocket means more spent in the economy. I’m sorry I have only recommendations and links to submit and not hard numbers. But the growing international consensus on these policies is real. Section 3: Work and a Flexicurity Model Figure 1: This machine allows anyone to work for minimum wage for as long as they like. Turning the crank on the side releases one penny every 4.97 seconds, for a total of $7.25 per hour. This corresponds to minimum wage for a person in New York. This piece is brilliant on multiple levels, particularly as social commentary. Without a doubt, most people who started operating the machine for fun would quickly grow disheartened and stop when realizing just how little they’re earning by turning this mindless crank. A person would then conceivably realize that this is what nearly two million people in the United States do every day...at much harder jobs than turning a crank. This turns the piece into a simple, yet effective argument for raising the minimum wage. https://rwer.wordpress.com/2016/04/26/minimum-wage-machine/ “When I was young, security meant having a good, solid job. This was not very exciting—but in a way, it was very safe. This security disappeared as globalization emerged. Security is no longer to hold on desperately to the same job throughout your life. Security is to stay cool when you hear rumours of outsourcing from the boardroom. Because deep down you know that you have solid skills and that you will quickly be able to find a new job if the old one is relocated. Security is not to be able to stay on. Security is to be able to move. It is precisely this new security through training and education that we have now embarked on creating for every worker.” https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6cba/c76c83d526fa9f15c78f270365922b7466c1.pdf “If we look at the details of the last few decades of job creation and destruction, we're either going to make enough new low-skill jobs in numbers sufficient to keep unemployment numbers low enough to actually run a society... or we're not. Either way, consumer buying power is likely to steeply erode, even after we account for the effects technology has on lowering prices because the costs of basic needs like food and housing are the costs technology has had relatively little effect on this century. Meanwhile, if we can eliminate half of our jobs in just 20 years, do we really even want to create that many tens of millions of new ways to work for someone else? Why? There appears to be no happy ending to this story that doesn't involve universal basic income. So instead of continuing to ask if jobs are going to be automated in sufficient quantities to need basic income, let's instead start to increasingly ask if there's any job we can't automate so we're all more freed to live by it.” https://medium.com/basic-income/everything-you-think-you-know-about-the-history-and-future- of-jobs-is-likely-wrong-4f84e3a8945e You’ve heard of how reluctant businesses are to value human beings for what they’re worth and enable a life beyond meagre struggling. A UBI would - enable humans to feel financially secure and seek good employment - This would make the workforce more dynamic as less likely to want to be locked into job - Employers could feel safer hiring as can make dismissal laws laxer in this environment - Replace current benefit program with issues by an easily managed broad safety net for everyone unemployed - Lack of overhead costs can be put directly into programs targeting the poorest - The anti-emergency fund/pro-credit card debt set up is eliminated as people can have money for rent and work sufficient hours to build up emergency fund as long as below income threshold for negative income tax - As only income-tested not means it is a system less at odds with the flexi waged work economy where more people are experiencing unemployment more frequently and for longer - Lower suicide rate as derogative means-based testing eliminated and basic dignity given A negative income tax/universal basic income shows every sign of being a cost-effective answer to the bloated and culturally ugly current welfare system by starting from unconditional care that gives human lives the basic dignity of being able to determine how to live and work within a society that values them and their wellbeing. We are already paying for a support system that barely functions and has been so twisted by the mistaken government drive to simply ‘get people off it’ that it’s no surprise that our already horrific suicide rates have further increased (https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/96217175/national-suicide-numbers-rise-three-years-in-a- row). That is because “data shows unambiguously that the psychosocial quality of bad jobs is worse than unemployment”. Thus while being unemployed has a negative effect it makes more sense long-term to have the worker exposed to opportunities and enabled to self-motivate to find a good job than push them into a psychologically harmful job they will likely shortly quit in worse state than starting. (http://oem.bmj.com/content/early/2011/02/26/oem.2010.059030, https://mashable.com/2014/12/17/bad-jobs-mental-health/#gw1lXWvykkqp) Similar to drugs there has been much distortion on this matter with terrible moral slandering and condescension to the poor. People do not, on a whole, enjoy being unemployed. Studies, pilot trials and simply logic behind the UBI system shows that people will seek meaning in their lives and if enabled to find a way to contribute, most will actively and passionately do so. For those that don’t become productively employed in the workforce they frequently are productively employed in the invisible workforce of at home carers for the young, sick and elderly – exactly those who are most vulnerable in society and needing social support anyway. Those personalities that don’t contribute meaningfully to society are about as likely to be encountered in the offices of day-traders as in the homes of ‘dole-bludgers’. This would go a long way to helping with child poverty as simply living in constant financial anxiety contributes to a toxic home environment favouring all types of abuse, crime and escapist behaviours such as alcohol and drug addictions. In one simple policy you could address so many societal ills and prepare NZ for a brighter future. Children first. Further targeted welfare as packages (such as working for families) for those such as single parents, disabled, etc that need it could then be easily monitored for their effectiveness against the uniform backdrop of UBI. By the way – good call keeping evidence-based policy going with SIA. Denmark has a robust work force combining a social security net supporting those between jobs with easy dismissal and programs for workforce upskilling. This means that employers can hire more assuredly and fire rapidly. Employees can quit dissatisfying work and find productive employment. By enabling workers to feel financially secure in the face of unemployment they will work passionately instead of passively. The best fit for the best job from a dynamic workforce that will also be better suited to entrepeneurship and start-ups. http://valeryvalou.blogspot.co.nz/2011/11/denmark-globalization-and-welfare-state.html) https://www.bartleby.com/essay/Denmark-Globalization-and-the-Welfare-State-PKHMV4KTC http://www.netpublikationer.dk/um/6648/html/chapter01.htm By favouring not capital nor labour in where we invest but in tech we are more likely to have long- run economic growth and be bolstered against global recession. “For each country, per capita output growth is first broken down into the respective contributions from capital stock, labor inputs and technological advancements (represented by total factor productivity, or TFP)... The negative correlations suggest that countries with growth driven by capital or labor accumulation are less likely to do well in the future, especially during economic downturns. Our simple exercise also implies that the health of an economy depends on the source of growth instead of the growth itself. In addition to the role TFP plays in driving long-run growth, this simple exercise shows that a country with robust TFP-driven growth prior to the Great Recession tended to do well relative to other countries following the recession.” https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2015/june/what-drives-long-run-economic-growth “Do We Really Need Economic Growth? From one perspective, we don’t need economic growth. Economic growth will not solve the fundamental problems of human psychology/behaviour.  Growth will not alter the fact some will always feel much poorer than others. Many people base their well-being on the basis of comparing how they are doing to others. Economic growth can just increase this sense of inequality.  Growth will not reduce the incentives to cheat and steal.  Growth does not make people more charitable and good-natured. Furthermore, with environmental problems facing humanity, economic growth could exacerbate these issues and reduce living standards.” https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/6213/economics/do-we-need-economic-growth-in-a- modern-economy/ “None of the stuff we’re doing that’s destroying the biosphere is making us happy. By contrast, changing to a more sustainable way of living will also bring us greater happiness and general wellbeing. Seem too good to be true? That’s because we’ve all been so effectively sold the line that endless growth is essential to maintain and improve our quality of life. This couldn’t be further from the truth. Material prosperity has diminishing returns when it comes to happiness and wellbeing.

I think there’s a lot of fear in change. For some people, it is: “The system has worked for me, so what’s wrong with it? There can’t be anything wrong with it.” There’s an aspiration that people have that they are fair and unbiased and meritocratic, and when you start pointing out these differences, there’s this huge gap between who they aspire to be and who they really are and what they’re doing. It’s extremely uncomfortable, fear-inducing and disappointing to them. So I think they can’t acknowledge that gap. They have to push to make sure that the people criticising it are the problem." Below is the tax payers union submission with my comments in italics. A rebuttal to the Tax Payers Union: This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael has said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be upheld. This ignores the method of wealth distribution within a society and gives greater priority to private wealth distribution means than is justified. Studies have shown that the wealthy are less, not more, generous. And that this is only exacerbated in the presence of social inequality (https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/are\_the\_rich\_really\_less\_generous ) Trickle- down economics has been shown empirically to be a lie and part of a Government’s goals with taxation therefore should be wealth redistribution to mitigate generational wealth accumulation among a minority of the population. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. This treats tax as purely a chore/burden instead of the social investment required for the proper and stable continued functioning of business, government and all parts of civilisation. Some of the happiest countries of the world have exceedingly high taxes ( https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2016-01-20/why-danes-happily-pay- high-rates-of-taxes) This is in part because of the understanding of tax not as a burden but as a reinvestment into the society into which one is raised and a safeguarding of a stable social future for one’s children. Also the concept of revenue neutrality is a total joke when the wealth available to the rich in the form of inheritance, land, property and all (not just some) shares is not even taxed in NZ. A laughable, sad, and cold hypocrisy their revenue neutrality to any child born into poverty. \[1\] Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. This is a valid point placed alongside the global stagnation of wages. In many jobs people are earning less than they did a few years ago due to not just a lack of inflation adjustment but also a concurrent hike in the basic cost of living due to housing prices and GST increase. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low- investment, low-productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two- tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Progressive business tax may be an acceptable solution but should it be on profit of the business instead of the size? Also noting to close tax evasion loopholes that enable removal of profit overseas or sinking into non-taxed assets. I would also submit that any company not paying a livable wage is in fact not running a socially appropriate/sustainable business model that values workers and therefore should be taxed more heavily than socially minded businesses supportive of the average New Zealanders right to the bare minimum wage to live on. This could be substituted alternately as a tax break for businesses that incorporate an appropriate baseline wage in their company model. Low wages paid by businesses rely on social supplementation by taxpayers through government to puff profit margins. There is a big difference between a job and a good job. NZ should not be competing with the low-wage labour market available internationally. Due to the global economy this would put workers at constant risk of loss of job. Due to the growing implementation of technology this would certainly set NZ at odds with the changing make-up of modern business – those self-check-out counters are a forerunner of broader automation. On top of all this a globally competitive low wage workforce is simply inconsistent with our ethical stance on safe working environments and hours – although one wonders when conditions such as in foreign-owned bottling companies contravene laws on kiwi soil. (https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/99726885/Its-just-so-dangerous-Squalid- conditions-reported-at-water-bottling-plant) Therefore, NZ should be aiming to create a flexible, adaptively skilled workforce. This is a high value commodity on the international stage and more likely to stimulate entrepeneurship and small business creation and growth. Expensing of capital The Government must be committed to increasing New Zealand’s productivity and allowing for greater growth in incomes. I submit that the Working Group recommend allowing businesses full capital expensing within the first year of capital purchase. This would increase incentives for business to invest in capital (accelerating productivity growth) and increase wages (productivity growth is the most relevant factor in determining income growth). I question how fair this is to the average wage earner who never gets a similar dispense with tax for a year. Interesting hypocrisy on when they think taxpayers should be burdened or not. The danger with the correlation of productivity with income growth is that I’m not sure this accounts for the rise of technology in replacing jobs. Therefore, if there are now 10 high wage jobs aided by technology to increase productivity vs the 30 medium wage jobs that achieved lower productivity then yes, average productivity is higher and the average income increased but the government now shoulders the resulting rise in unemployment and the associated social burdens. It has been noted that expensing increasingly involves investing in tech gear in start-ups (https://www.investopedia.com/news/immediate-capital-expensing-increase-consumer- spending-real-corporate-tax-cut-benefit-charles-schwab/) Therefore, if taxpayers are to subsidise business expenses, a tax on technology that replaces jobs should be introduced as early as possible as already the more expensive mid-tier jobs have been targeted (https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Robots-Over-Roughnecks- Next-Drilling-Boom-Might-Not-Add-Many-Jobs.html, https://economics.mit.edu/files/12763, ) and implementation of check-out machines, fruit picking/packing technology is set to phase out low-wage jobs. This would otherwise burden the rest of society for the profit of the business. A robot tax would enable a universal basic income scheme and upskilling programs required for a mobile, skilled and secure workforce. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. Excepting those that are already advantaged? There is still much to do in wiping clean the shameful image of NZ as a Tax Haven. Foreign land buying at taxpayer expense is scary. NZ will cease to be racist when they no longer protest the language of this country spoken on its home soil. NZ will be a far better place when instead of being hurt by criticism and infant- like deny it we rise above our cognitive dissonance and ask to understand. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. The Tax could be monitored in a brief investigation to assess whether the policy is having the desired effect but by and large it is understood that people do spend money responsibly if they feel a social obligation. As Maori minority are still heavily represented in poverty statistics I would argue that the Maori companies will have a strong social compulsion to reinvest in their disadvantaged brethren, this is less money the government would otherwise have to spend in social aid in mitigating this generational poverty problem. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Charities fulfil an important role in society, covering gaps in social welfare. While some are harmful scams/cults that should be examined there are far more productive areas to target in removing tax exemptions from. For example Irrigation NZ in its contrary purpose of promoting agricultural intensification/inappropriate crop to land use at cost to the growing tourism industry, DOC, and the rising spectre of water scarcity in the face of climate change and pollution. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains would discourage investment, stifling wage growth and distorting the economy. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Economic growth and investment have done little to grow wages. It is inherently a distortion of the economy that assets that save money, such as not paying rent to have a roof over your head, are not taxed as all sources of income are. Lower wage earners are paying a significant portion of their income on simply the basics and this is stifling the economy more than a capital gains tax which is widely present internationally. The lack of taxation on assets has encouraged tax evasion and foreign investment at the cost of NZ taxpayer, locking us in to a path of rising inequality and instability as health services are now at breaking point. The rich have no problem paying their medical bills but complain mightily when they feel unsafe due to the presence of mentally ill poor in the streets. Capital gains tax/tax of all assets, on an annual basis should be instated. Along with a negative income tax that provides a safety net for all. I have known house owners who suffered sudden job loss, asset rich but cash poor they were denied welfare such as an unemployment benefit to avoid defaulting on their mortgage. I would argue it costs society less to have a safety net for all unemployed as they search for work. In Denmark it is well recognised that the security given to citizens through largely unconditional support during unemployment complements a relationship between employers and unions where dismissal is easy but financial security means both businesses and workers can be dynamic in employment, finding a good fit for both for optimal productivity. Instatement of a tax on all assets would enable services to be extended further. There are high achievers who have come far but not quite far enough to pay for expensive counselling. This fosters resentment and denies mental health services to a sector under significant stress. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via long term saving. Retirement funds and investment schemes are assets that yield a return and so should be taxed annually. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I submit that any taxes on water should operate in a similar way to water rights pricing and be sector neutral – politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. As an alternative to recommending specific environmental taxes, I submit that the Working Group develop an objective framework for future proposed environmental taxes to be measured against. Polluter pays but no targeting specific industries is a fallacy. There are objectively more polluting industries from a solid, scientific and entirely non-political standpoint. Their impact on the environment, and so the shuffling of the real price tag of their profit onto the wider public and future society should be taxed accordingly and even, dare I say, retroactively for the duration of spin and deliberate obfuscation carried out by polluters. Imagine how the health system would have benefited from implementing an anti-tobacco stance when the very first results came in linking smoking to lung cancer. This is not dissimilar to the case of dairy pollution to rivers. Which even now faces reluctance to take on metrics that genuinely measure the impact. As if by not looking the problem doesn’t exist. We should be adopting agricultural practices that make the most of the land sustainably, not selfishly the most profit short-term with the future generation footing the environmental bill. Lifestyle taxes I submit that the Working Group recommend against the expansion of behavioural taxes, and instead outline the regressive financial damage they inflict on our most vulnerable communities. Specifically: I oppose the introduction of a sugar tax, a fat tax, or any other form of additional tax on food products. I oppose varying GST for different products. I oppose increases to tobacco excise. Behavioural taxes will hit the poor but then so will the absence of them. At least by taxing highly processed foods the implementation of healthy eating programmes and subsidisation of the health system to deal with the rising obesity and diabetes epidemic will be achieved. However, as a savings on the tax complication side, it would be far easier and immediate to subsidise fresh fruit and veges as a tax break for the poor. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, (An outdated fiscal dinosaur desiring to share a similar extinction from an asteroid of their own making) ------------------------------------------------------------ A comment on the submission to government by the Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc - Closing the Gap: I fully support their submission. I think unless NZ wants the problems of Trump and Brexit on home soil we should carefully consider our way forward, together, as a society that prioritises inequality reduction on the understanding that humans are born with less but never lesser. And that a world filled with people that seek only to protect ‘their own’ is bound to end in fire.

Submission by Ian Kuperus to the Tax Working Group Capital gains tax 2. Proposal to allow CGT deposits Executive summary This proposal is that taxpayers and intermediaries be allowed to make non-refundable CGT tax deposits The benefits of allowing CGT deposits are – - it would enable taxpayers to essentially opt in to paying tax on an accrual basis there by mitigating the rise in CGT rate - it would provide the government with significantly advanced revenue- possibly in the order of $5 to $10billiion in the first 10 years. The key features of CGT deposits are – - They would be non-refundable - They would be tradable in a similar way to tax pooling deposits - They would be date stamped and accrue a non-assessable interest up to the time that they are applied against a CGT liability. I suggest a 4% rate but this is open to review. - Increased Revenue For The Government A key advantage of making the CGT deposits non-refundable is that all deposits can be counted immediately as revenue to the government. The combination of the variable CGT rate and CGT Deposits mean that taxpayers and intermediaries will be incentivised to pay CGT earlier. Specific motivations that will advance Government revenue are – - No rollover relief provisions that might otherwise be introduced – if not initially then further down the track - Virtual elimination of the lock in effect that would defer realisations and therefore defer the collection of revenue - Incentive for voluntary CGT assessments - An incentive for taxpayers that have latent CGT liabilities to use CGT deposits to mitigate CGT liability. Fund managers and financial institutions are likely to be in this category. - Incentive for intermediaries to arrange deposits on behalf of others. The Victoria University tax Working Group estimated revenue from a full accrual CGT regime at $4.5 billion per annum. It is difficult to surmise how CGT revenue might grow. But if – - Full accrual liability was $4.5bn per annum - Assets were held on average 10 years - Then it would be year 10 before the Government was collecting $4.5bn pa and over the first 10 years would have collected a total of around $22bn with a further $22bn being unrealised. - My view is that up to half of the unrealised CGT liability might be paid early by taxpayers or intermediaries. This could increase government revenue in the order of $5 to$10 billion over the first 10 years. The following categories of taxpayers would be incentivised to make CGT deposits. - Larger tax payers with accrued capital gains that have a marginal borrowing or investment rate that is less than the inferred 4% non-assessable compounding CGT interest rate. - Other smaller taxpayers that wish to take a conservative approach and mitigate the cost of Future CGT liabilities. - Financial intermediaries that wish to make CGT deposits either for their own exposures or to sell off at a future time. Example A fund manager makes an unrealised capital gain in 2021 of $100m . Its cash deposit interest rate is 4% -taxable. The Fund Manager therefore finds the 4% non-taxable return on CGT deposits attractive and makes a $25m CGT deposit. In 2026 when that gain is realised the tax rate on the 5 year asset is 27% giving a liability of $27m. The CGT deposit has accrued interest at 4%pa and is now worth $27m providing the required amount to settle the liability. The Government has had an increase in revenue of $25m five years earlier. Tax treatment of the funding and sale of CGT deposits It is proposed that the interest accrued on CGT deposits be treated as a non-taxable income. This treatment would mean an equivalent taxable interest rate of around 6%. An interest rate at that level should mean these deposits are attractive to a significant portion of taxpayers. Any CGT deposits that are not required can be sold on the secondary market. Any gain on sale should also be non-taxable. On the other hand interest incurred in funding deposits be should be deductible as a cost of funding business. Reporting on CGT deposits I propose that the government report regularly on the amount of CGT deposits and CGT assessments to allow the market to make informed investment decisions about the level of CGT deposits. International Precedent I am not aware of any direct parallels to this proposal but in the 1980’S the UK had Transferable Certificates of Deposit (TCD’s). These were government bonds that could be converted to tax payments at the date of deposit foregoing the interest that would otherwise be payable on the bond. CGT deposits also have parallel with tax deposits can be made under the tax pooling regime. The flexibility provided by the tax pooling regime has proved popular with business and, dependent on the implied interest rate I would expect that there would be positive uptake to such flexibility with a CGT regime. Issues that Warrant Further Consideration - The Interest rate payable on the CGT deposits. I have suggested a 4% interest rate that aligns with the proposed interest rate used to calculate the increase in CGT rates. This would allow a taxpayer with perfect knowledge to pay on an accrual basis and always pay the minimum CGT rate. However these rates need not be the same and it may be that varying these rates will produce a better outcome. - The trading mechanism – the tax pooling regime provides a starting point to consider but other frameworks should be considered. With all CGT deposits having a current value being interchangeable it is likely that the trading mechanism will be a lot simpler and transaction costs less than the tax pooling regime. - Interface with the tax pooling regime my initial view is that tax pool deposits should only be available after a CGT assessment has been made.

Submission by Ian Kuperus to the Tax Working Group Capital gains tax 1. Proposal for a Variable CGT rate Executive summary This proposal is that the capital gains tax rate varies according to the length of time that the asset has been held. An asset held for one year would be subject to the “base CGT rate” while assets held for longer periods would be taxed at a proportionately higher rate. For example if the “base rate” is set at 25% an asset sold after 5 years may be taxed at 27%. The benefits of a variable CGT rate are improved economic efficiency, fairness and increased revenue. Specifically - 1. It virtually eliminates the “lock- in” incentive of the typical realisation based CGT 2. It removes the pressure to put in place rollover relief provisions which in essence only exacerbate the lock-in effect and make the CGT more complicated 3. It makes the capital gains tax fairer when compared to other income types which pay tax on a regular basis. 4. It will facilitate “capital gains tax deposits” that are the subject of a second submission. Capital gains tax deposits will allow taxpayers to manage their CGT exposure on an accrual basis and will provide the government with significantly advanced revenue. Setting the Variable CGT Rate The intent of a variable CGT rate is to substantially eliminate the lock in incentive that is a drawback of a realisation based CGT regime. With a variable rate the benefit from deferring CGT under a realisation based scheme is offset by an increasing tax rate. Appendix 1 sets out a suggested tax rate structure based on an underlying 4% compounding interest rate and a starting base rate of 20% or 25%. Appendix 1 calculates the rates for 1 year to 40 years. The table below summarises the CGT rates for 1, 5 10, 20 and 40 year holdings. Years Asset Held For CGT Rate –( Base Rate 20%) CGT Rate –(Base Rate 25%) 1 20%25% 5 22%27% 10 24%30% 20 30%37% 40 48%59% There are a number of reasons to consider a CGT rate base rate less than the top marginal tax rate eg an allowance for inflation and the potential exposure to double taxation through company structures. Setting a base CGT rate at say 20% or 25% would make a variable rate easier to sell politically. Eliminating the Need for Rollover Relief The pressure for rollover relief comes from selling and buying similar assets and the argument that the imposition of capital gains tax is unfair when compared with someone that continues to hold the same asset. Rollover relief significantly complicates a CGT regime and there is significant benefit in removing the pressure for rollover relief. A variable CGT rate makes the regime fairer Being able to defer tax on economic gains is unfair when compared with taxpayers who pay on an annual basis. Salary and wage earners for instance would jump at the chance to defer their tax payments for 20 years and have those funds earn income in a KiwiSaver or similar scheme. Capital gains tax deposits The benefits of a capital gains tax deposit scheme depends upon a variable CGT rate. Full benefits of a CGT deposit scheme are outlined in a further submission. Issues That Warrant Further Consideration The following issues warrant further consideration. • Rate Setting- both the base rate and the inherent interest rate. The higher the inherent interest rate the more Government revenue will be advanced – see CGT Deposits paper. On the flip side the higher the inherent interest rate the more difficult the political sell will be. Very long dated assets will pose a political sell problem but these will be rare. It may be that an outright cap in the rate at say 49% may be appropriate. • Changing the Inherent Interest rate with changes in market rates. • Allowing voluntary assessments – Taxpayers could elect to voluntarily assess and pay CGT on a valuation basis to “restart the number of years” calculation. This may be attractive if there is a sudden spike in value. There should be no problem with allowing a voluntary assessment to be retrospective for a year or so • Increased Calculation- requirement for Number of Years – Each asset sold would require a number of years ownership to be allocated. Given that most will be business assets and a starting value will be required in any event I do not think that this should be a major problem. I would be happy to engage with officials on these points if the TWG considered the proposal warranted further analysis.

Tax Working Group - Future of Tax Set out below is my submission on the five key questions about which you have sought submissions. Question one What does the future of tax look like to you? A taxation system which: • is fair and equitable, meaning it takes into account a person’s ability to pay and applies equally to all income earning investment activity • is not so burdensome as to discourage savings and investment • minimises the possibilities for tax evasion (as distinct from avoidance where eg a business expense can be offset against taxable income) • encourages risk taking in the investment in and free flow of capital within an economy by helping to minimise risk taking in capital formation. Question two What is the purpose of tax? The purpose of tax: • is to raise revenue for government to invest in the building of a productive and harmonious society • should not be to raise revenue for government spending at the risk of actively discouraging savings and investment. Question three Are we taxing the right things? We are taxing the wrong things if: These taxes are: • punitive, ie a tax that singles out a certain segment of society for taxation and which has the effect of placing an unreasonable burden on that segment for meeting everyday household needs such as housing, health, food, education, transport and power needs • they target a social practice that derives no overall benefit to society. Question four Can tax make housing more affordable? A tax can have that effect if: • personal taxes are not so high as to inhibit the borrowing of money from a bank for the purpose of buying a first home at current interest rates • it does not discourage investment and the free flow of capital which are essential for the growth of income and employment • it does not hinder the growth in capital stock and so give rise to an increase in interest rates. Note: Capital Gains Tax (CGTs) have not proven to be effective in suppressing property price rises in countries where CGT’s are in operation, notably Australia. Question five What tax issues matter most to you? The tax issue which matters most to me is: • A taxation policy that hinders capital formation. Capital formation and its appreciation in value is the fundamental driving force behind economic growth in a society based on such principles, as is New Zealand’s. Capital appreciation is the basis of returns on shares, interest earning bank or other forms of cash deposits and corporate dividend yields. Of particular concern therefore would be a Capital Gains Tax on any form of capital formation for the following reasons: • it’s manifestly unfair in that it’s a form of double taxation; income earned to buy the asset has already been taxed • it will stymie investment in productive assets in that by taxing capital gain it increases the risk in investment activity • consumer confidence and a readiness to spend, the so called “wealth effect”, that results from rising property values, would be adversely affected, an effect that has been acknowledged as an important contributor to New Zealand’s survival and recovery during the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 and earthquakes of recent times. Economic research has been done on the economic costs of capital gains taxes. David J Daniel writing for the “Tableau" on November 2014 describes what he calls “the destructive” economic effects of Capital Gains taxes and refers to the work of Jason Clemens, Charles Lammam, and Matthew Lo who produced a study for the Fraser Institute about the economic impact of capital gains taxation. Says Daniel, their study focuses on Canada, but their arguments apply to every nation, as follows: “...Capital gains taxes, of course, raise revenues for government but they do so with considerable economic costs. Capital gains taxes impose costs on the economy because they reduce returns on investment and thereby distort decision making by individuals and businesses. This can have a substantial impact on the reallocation of capital, the available stock of capital, and the level of entrepreneurship.” The three researchers also explain the "lock-in effect.” “Capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis. This means that the tax is only imposed when an investor opts to withdraw his or her investment from the market and realise the capital gain. One of the most significant economic effects is the incentive this creates for owners of capital to retain their current investments even if more profitable and productive opportunities are available. ....Capital that is locked into suboptimal investments and not reallocated to more profitable opportunities hinders economic output. ...” Daniel goes on to say: “Peter Kugler and Carlos Lenz (2001)...examined the experience of regional governments ("cantons") in Switzerland that eliminated their capital gains taxes. The authors’ statistical analysis showed that the elimination of capital gains taxes had a positive and economically significant effect on the long-term level of real income in seven of the eight cantons studied. Specifically, the increase in the long-term level of real income ranged between 1.1 percent and 3.0 percent, meaning that the size of the economy was 1 percent to 3 percent larger due to the elimination of capital gains taxes.” Jason Clemens, Charles Lammam, and Matthew Lo then analysed the impact of capital gains taxes on the "user cost" of capital investment: “Capital gains taxes make capital investments more expensive and therefore less investment occurs. ...Several studies have investigated the link between the supply and cost of venture capital financing and capital gains taxation, and found theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting a direct causality between a lower tax rate and a greater supply of venture capital. ...Kevin Milligan, Jack Mintz, and Thomas Wilson (1999) sought to estimate the sensitivity of investment to changes in the user cost of capital...and found that decreasing capital gains taxes by 4.0 percentage points leads to a 1.0 to 2.0 percent increase in investment.” Next, they investigated the impact on entrepreneurship: “Capital gains taxes reduce the return that entrepreneurs and investors receive from the sale of a business. This diminishes the reward for entrepreneurial risk-taking and reduces the number of entrepreneurs and the investors that support them. The result is lower levels of economic growth and job creation. ...Analysing the stock of venture capital and tax rates on capital gains from 1972 to 1994, Gompers and Lerner found that a one percentage point increase in the rate of the capital gains tax was associated with a 3.8 percent reduction in venture capital funding.” The authors also discussed the impact of capital gains taxation on compliance costs, administrative costs, and tax avoidance. They also looked at the marginal efficiency cost of capital gains taxation and report on some of the research in that area. They report: “Dale Jorgensen and Kun-Young Yun (1991)...estimate the marginal efficiency costs of select US taxes and find that capital-based taxes (such as capital gains taxes) impose a marginal cost of $0.92 for one additional dollar of revenue compared to $0.26 for consumption taxes. ...Baylor and Beausejour find that a $1 decrease in personal income taxes on capital (such as capital gains, dividends, and interest income) increases society’s well-being by $1.30; by comparison, a similar decrease in consumption taxes only produces a $0.10 benefit. ...the Quebec government’s Ministry of Finance...found that a reduction in capital gains taxes yields more economic benefits than a reduction in other types of taxes such as sales taxes. Reducing the capital gains tax by $1 would yield a $1.21 increase in the GDP.” Daniel goes on to say, that politicians, by opting for a capital Gains tax are undermining economic performance with senseless ‘class-warfare taxation’. Mathieu Bédard, an economist at the Montreal Economic Institute, writing for the Financial Post concluded that: A) “Canada’s investment levels are low relative to comparable countries. But with the boom now long gone, it’s becoming obvious that policies with a negative effect on investment are holding Canada back. The capital gains tax, in particular, is affecting investment levels, while bringing in negligible revenues for the federal government. As some other countries have done, we should either substantially reduce it or simply abolish it.” B) “Just as taxes on tobacco and alcohol reduce their consumption, the capital gains tax hinders capital formation, which is one of the basic foundations of all economic growth. Reducing the supply of capital affects job creation and wages throughout the economy, as one of the functions of capital is to make workers more productive through technological and other improvements, which is a prerequisite for wage increases.” C) “...one study looked at the case of Switzerland, where in addition to the central government, some districts (or cantons) eliminated the capital gains tax. It found that elimination increased the size of the economy by between one and three per cent. “Another study, this one of Hong Kong, found that thanks to the absence of a capital gains tax, the territory’s savings rate is well above that of similar industrialised economies.” D) “In the case of New Zealand, the elimination of the capital gains tax was part of the sweeping reforms that started in the 1980s and shifted from taxing capital and savings to taxing consumption, which has less deleterious effects on economic growth. These reforms were important in improving the economic situation of the country relative to its neighbours.” To conclude with a quote from Nobel laureate Robert Lucas: “Almost all economists agree—or at least used to agree—that keeping taxes low on investment is critical to economic growth, rising wages and job creation.” Jim Collins April 30, 2018

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Tax Working Group Submission from John Grigg Members, The main area that I would like to submit on is the Business taxes especially in regard to small Businesses. 1. The first issue needs to be the underlying principle of all business taxes. Keep compliance costs to a minimum. The introduction of GST increased costs significantly and has only been getting steadily worse. Not just in the Tax area but in all regulation. Each area says it is only a little bit extra compliance. But when you add the sum of all areas it become significant. Therefore, this principle must be considered in all regulation. E.g. A local young Builder has recently shut his Business down due to all the compliance costs and gone to work for another Builder. That Builder is nearing retirement and said to me that if he wasn’t close to retirement he too would have shut his business down. 2. I have a new idea regarding Provisional Tax. I believe that Provisional Tax should be calculated on the average of the last three years submitted accounts. For a Business starting up they would need to have their return submitted 120 days after the end of the financial year and the Provisional tax would be 50% of the first years result spread over the next year. Second year has the same date for submitting, but 75% of average of two years and then on to the three-year average. The terminal tax conditions stay the same. This method would give the Government more certainty on revenue and smooth out the tax take. It reduces the compliance costs associated with income equalisation. It minimises the double hit that a business can take if there is a fluctuation in income which can severely affect the cash flow. Also removing the guessing of future income. Which is extremely difficult especially in rural businesses dependent on the weather as well as market conditions. Reducing the risk of less tax take due to refunds when economic conditions drop. 3. Land Tax. I believe we already have a Land tax in the form of Local and Regional Council rates. Further land taxes from Central Government will counter the good work that these Councils are doing. A lot of businesses contribute significantly to this process. A Land Tax will also harm any hope of increasing Environmental outcomes. Land next to Towns and Cities becomes uneconomic to farm due to the high Rates and Land taxes. So the choices become; a. Move to the highest return business (Dairy) b. Subdivide and sell for houses or worse lifestyle blocks. c. Sell to Foreign buyers d. Borrow to pay taxes and gradually go broke, and no money to put into any Environmental enhancements. The recent report that said we are losing productive land is correct and will continue at a greater rate if Land and Wealth Taxes are imposed. Losing this land is Environmentally and Economically unstainable for this Country. 4. Wealth Tax This tax will again have the result mentioned above. It will also reduce the incentive to save and will hit hardest those business that are asset rich and cash poor. It will also be a disincentive for innovation. Eg. Zero, a business that has put a lot into development without any major profitable return but are now a business exporting their product overseas. With wealth taxes on their share price they may not have been able to build the business to the level they are now at. This tax will again mean that the very wealthy will either leave or use expensive Lawyers and Accountants to reduce their exposure. It is likely to also reduce the amount of philanthropy in this Country. This just leaves the middle of New Zealand to be hit again. It also hits those who have taken a long term intergenerational approach to saving and building assets. This means that the highest return per Capital becomes the only option, when at present other factors are able to be considered. In the towns and Cities rents would have to increase to pay for this tax. This will hit the low and middle-income earners harder. I was recently talking to a Rest Home owner who admitted that he was able to return 15 to18 % on his capital. Most of this was from Government payments. Unfortunately, the Export sector is only able earn what the oversea market dictates. A wealth tax is really a tax on the export capacity of this Country, and as this country lives on what its Exporters brings in. I feel this another disincentive to be in that sector. Will Iwi be included in this wealth tax? 5. Capital Gains Tax This is already in process for those with foreign shares. It is costly to comply with, especially for smaller holdings. Again, the middle get hit. It also means that Savings schemes have a reduced ability to spread their portfolio risks overseas. This is probably why Kiwisaver schemes are such a large investor in our small economy. This not only distorts our investment base but could have severe issues if our economy falters. Your report says that this tax is costly to comply with and doesn’t result in a significant tax take. 6. Environmental Taxes. These taxes may be thought of with good intent but are not without consequences. People have different views about Environmental out comes relevant to the position they are looking from. Whether it is from memories of what they did as children or from Television programs. From the purest views, cities are totally unsustainable. I could list numerous issues such as heavy metal contamination, waste, sewage and plastic pollution that need to be improved. The other side is the view from the city that says Farmers and especially Dairy farmers are polluting the land and water ways. For this country to improve Environmental outcomes, it needs to be a balanced approach, as all are involved. Targeting particular groups will only lead to bad outcomes and acrimony. I believe that any Environmental spending should come from a combination of Central and Regional Government such as is done with Roading. Summary I believe the current tax system is complicated enough. The Government has enough tools to be able to run a successful society. Minor manipulation of the rates within these tools and careful management of the expenditure side is all that is needed. Some sections of Society will always want more, but we are a trading nation and we must also live within our means. John Grigg \[1\]

Kidscan social network of persons and organisations combined lxxi v Summary This report examines the development and delivery of state schooling policy in Aotearoa New Zealand at present. The main purpose of the report is to prepare a preliminary sketch map and understanding of what is occurring within a rapidly changing policy landscape. The analysis in this report documents how an increased presence of private sector actors is reshaping the ways in which state schooling policy is developed and enacted in classrooms, staffrooms, schools and local communities. It seems fair to suggest that the substance and magnitude of these changes remain largely unremarked in the media and their consequential effects not widely appreciated across civil society. Of particular interest in this report is the role played by not-for-profit, charitable entities in state schooling. State schooling has commonly been regarded in social- democratic systems like New Zealand as a public or social good. Historically, education has also been a principal objective of charitable activity on the basis that it provides a significant public benefit. Charity or philanthropy enjoys a privileged position in contemporary New Zealand society, which itself places great importance on the altruistic acts of ‘giving’. It is therefore timely to assess the extent to which these emergent state schooling philanthropic actors appear to be motivated by considerations of public good, public benefit and altruism. Since 2008, National-led governments have actively encouraged a diverse array of for-profit, not-for-profit and hybrid private sector actors, and facilitated their entry into the managed marketplace of New Zealand state schooling. This represents a rapid local acceleration of the privatisation of state schooling trends that have been emergent globally since the 1980s. In New Zealand, as elsewhere, privatisation of state schooling takes two main forms: making schools run more like businesses; and bringing the private sector into state schooling. Before the last decade or so, these privatisations could mostly be seen in the use of sole trader consultants, corporate professional services, or infrastructure trades and technology services, generally operating at arms’ length from politicians and public servants. Today, the private sector comprises all these entities in for-profit, not-for- profit and Public Private Partnership (PPP) consortia forms, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs), private foundations, publicly registered charitable trusts, vi individual entrepreneurs, and community groups and organisations including iwi, rūnanga and Urban Māori Authorities (UMAs). Many of these entities no longer simply deliver schooling services on behalf of the state, however, but are also energetically involved in their conception, articulation and development in policy texts. Some public policy activities clearly continue to take place in and are mediated by the public sphere, but some others may not. Hence there is need for transparency and debate about the substance and style of state school policy governance to try and ensure its sustainability as a public good. At the heart of the recent efforts to ‘modernise’ state schooling in New Zealand, lie networks of actors, organisations and their relations of mutual interest. For the purposes of this report it is suggested that these efforts may be understood theoretically as the displacement of traditional ‘classic market’ and ‘bureaucratic’ forms of state schooling governance, by newer professional and philanthropic ‘networks’ and ‘clans’ (e.g. iwi). In the education policy literature, the emergent patterns of dispositions and practices that embody these are sometimes known as ‘network governance’. Examples of the newer network governance approach to state schooling in New Zealand include: (i) mandatory consideration of PPP as an alternative to conventional procurement for the design, build, finance and maintenance of school buildings; (ii) approval of private sector sponsors to operate multiple Partnership School Kura Hourua; (iii) increasing monetary subsidisation by households of nominally free state schooling, accompanied by the growing presence of private sector supplementary tutoring franchises; and (iv) tactical commercial partnerships between local not-for- profit Educational Management Organisations (EMOs) and for-profit, offshore education services ‘brands’ to deliver schooling products and services in New Zealand and overseas. These examples are illustrative of a growing preference by the government to contract out state schooling services to the private corporate, NGO and philanthropic sectors. Charities law in New Zealand is accommodating of not-for-profit charities that establish a for-profit subsidiary, which then both competes against and collaborates with public sector entities in fluid tactical alliances that seek to win government contracts. These trends seriously blur the conceptual and practical distinctions between public and private participation in state schooling. vii The current government has also adopted a policy vocabulary that signals a conscious withdrawal from traditional post WWII commitments to welfarism. Phrases like ‘government subsidy’ have now largely replaced references to ‘government funding and provision’ of state schooling. The policy shift by the state from a universalist approach to state schooling provision to a targeted social investment approach clearly has the potential to alleviate some inequalities of access to education for those who benefit from targeting, while at the same time exacerbating them for those who do not. Historically, philanthropists have worked to address gaps in public services provision. The peak body Philanthropy New Zealand currently has over 130 grant awarding members and 110 recipient community organisations. Newer approaches to ‘venture philanthropy’ from the larger institutional trusts and private foundations now also commonly adopt ‘investment’, rather than ‘granting’ or ‘seeding’ approaches. These investments tend to be strategic in scope, larger in-scale, multi-year in enactment, and their outcomes explicitly evaluated in terms of returns on economic and/or social investment. In contrast, not-for-profit educational management organisations may regard their portfolio of routine activities as inherently charitable in purpose, which therefore mitigate or remove the obligation to make significant additional charitable donations from operating surpluses. In Aotearoa, iwi, rūnanga and UMAs typically enjoy charitable trust status and undertake increasingly influential roles in the state schooling network governance, thanks in no small part to historic Treaty of Waitangi settlements, which are estimated eventually to be worth $2.6 billion. At the time of writing, there are approximately 17,000 registered charities in New Zealand, over a third of which are education charities. In 2010, the total gross income for the sector was reportedly $10.5 billion. The main reported sources of income were $3.6 billion government grants, $0.7 billion donations and $4.1 billion services provision. New Zealand ranks third in the Charities Aid Foundation 2015 World Giving Index. Total giving in 2014 was estimated to be $2.8 billion, or 1.17% of GDP. Personal giving comprised 55%, trusts and foundations 42% and business 3%. Of donated money, 9.9% was to education. An estimated 12.3 million volunteer hours were also given to education. To get an overview of what educational charities do, how they are funded, and what they fund, an analysis of the New Zealand Charities Services database was undertaken for this study. Among the 6,059 registered educational charities, a third viii reported education, training and research as their main sector of operation. Over half reported children and young people as their main beneficiary, 16% the general public, 6% family and whānau, and 2.1% older people. The most frequently reported main activities were services provision (20.7%), grants to other organisations (17%), information, advice and advocacy (15%), and grants and loans to individuals (12.9%). Just over half are mainly funded through non-government grants and sponsorships, and a quarter through a combination of bequests, donations and koha. Only 4.5% relied mainly on government grants and contracts and 3.9% on income from services and trading provision. In order also to gain a sense of the scale of their financial activity, an analysis of 2014 gross income, expenditure and total assets was undertaken using the Charities Services financial database. The analysis was limited to the approximately 3,250 charities in the database whose main reported source of income was grants, contracts and sponsorship. Fifty-one educational charities reported total annual income, annual expenditure and total assets in excess of $10 million. These included 17 private schools, the eight public universities, a variety of Institutes of Technology and Polytechnics, Private Training Establishments, professional and peak body trusts, and four kindergarten associations. There were also 174 charitable educational trusts with income between $1 million and $10 million. Schooling policy networks come into being and flourish due to the interactions of the entrepreneurial policy actors who navigate them. These actors collaborate and network in order to materially influence state schooling policy development and services delivery. Actors may operate as individuals, groups or organisations. In New Zealand, the consummate schooling policy actor since the late 1990s has been Professor John Hattie, formerly at the University of Auckland. Hattie’s now global social networking approach might reasonably be described as a seamless fabrication of his public-good, not-for-profit and for-profit policy entrepreneurship and advocacy. His original scholarly work in the university setting has since been packaged, branded and monetised through the Visible Learning book series and Visible Learning Plus programme of teacher workshops and associated school certification offered internationally under licence to various commercial partners by Cognition Education; and most recently through the Visible Classroom App which has been commercialised in ix Australia, the UK and the USA via a partnership between the University of Melbourne and Ai-Media. New Zealand examples of policy networks include the libertarian think tank, the New Zealand Initiative (NZI), and Teach First New Zealand Ako Mātātupu (TFNZ). Since 2012, NZI has rebranded to position itself as a research organisation that aims to contribute to the public good by bringing a pro market perspective to public policy debate. Its membership is drawn largely from the corporate business sector in New Zealand but includes St Cuthbert’s College and the University of Auckland from the education sector. TFNZ offers a locally contextualised, boutique leadership development programme for high performing graduates in the form of a classroom-based initial teacher education programme. It is financially supported by a diverse range of local and offshore venture philanthropy groups, corporates, charitable trusts and education sector NGOs. TFNZ’s official programme partners are University of Auckland, the Ministry of Education and Teach for All. Teach for All is a USA-based global member organisation of similar programmes. It enjoys significant school-choice and school- reform oriented philanthropic funding streams and global corporation contributions to its governance. Six case organisations were selected to illustrate the diversity of contemporary state schooling policy entrepreneurship and advocacy, and to map their social networks. The cases are: Pearson, the world’s largest educational organisation; Cognition Education Group and CORE Education Group, the two largest educational management organisations (EMOs) in New Zealand, both of which operate for-profit, wholly-owned subsidiaries of their respective not-for-profit charitable trusts; Foundation North, a Public Benefit Entity and the biggest philanthropic organisation in Australasia, which operates throughout Auckland and Northland, has net assets of over $1 billion and distributes tens of millions of dollars annually in community grants and social investment projects; Community Education Trust Auckland (COMET), which operates as a deliberately small charitable trust and Council Controlled Organisation, providing thought leadership, research and project development services throughout the Auckland Council area; and Kidscan, the purposes of which are to fund, source and distribute goods and services to meet the material needs of children affected by poverty, and which has grown its equity from $0 in 2007 to $4.5 million in 2015. Together, these x six cases demonstrate something of the variety of private sector participation in and around state schooling policy today. There are three EMOs in the study: the global corporation Pearson, Cognition Education Limited (based in Auckland) and CORE Education Limited (based in Christchurch). Pearson has a negligible visible presence in New Zealand schooling, yet in Australia, which is one of its major strategic areas of operation, it has a significant share of the national school testing market. Overall it has 40,000 employees in over 70 countries and in 2015 its sales were approximately £4.5 billion. Pearson is an education services, thought leadership and venture capital brand. Its stated aim is to meet a global demand for education through: increasing access to high quality schooling and postsecondary education; enhancing literacy, numeracy, knowledge and skills; and linking education to professional career appointment and advancement. Pearson consistently uses the socially responsible language of making education more accessible and affordable, and applying educational products and services to scale to help governments meet their system goals. Pearson’s Chief Education Adviser is Sir Michael Barber, with responsibility for Pearson’s new initiatives on ‘Efficacy’, ‘Pearson Affordable Learning Fund’ and ‘The Learning Curve’. The first is a commitment to measuring the impact on student learning outcomes of all Pearson’s products and services, the second a venture capital initiative to provide ‘low-cost’ private schooling in developing countries, and the third is Pearson’s attempt to shape the schooling policy discourse around the use of data analytics to make judgments about the performance of state and national school systems worldwide. Cognition Education began as the charitable Multi Serve Education Trust, which was established at the outset of the Tomorrow’s Schools administrative reforms to provide payroll, transport and financial administration services to schools in New Zealand. In the 2000s it underwent a series of structure and name changes including creation of the for-profit, wholly-owned subsidiary now known as Cognition Education Limited, the largest EMO in New Zealand. Being wholly-owned by the Trust confers domestic financial and reputational advantages associated with charitable status. These changes also enabled Cognition Education Limited to grow its export education services to the high point where in 2010 its annual income was $69 million, yet by 2015 this had more than halved to $28 million. Cognition Education Limited appointed its first CEO from overseas in 2016, with entrepreneurial expertise in a range of for-profit and not- xi for-profit educational services providers. Since the mid-2000s Cognition Education Limited has invested heavily in commercialising the intellectual property of John Hattie through the Visible Learning plus series of sixteen workshops for teachers and associated whole school certification. These are now offered in New Zealand and, under licensing arrangements with key private sector partners, in Australia, Europe and North America. The Cognition Education Trust’s equity has varied over the years but in 2015 was $18.2 million. From a high point of $654,000 in 2010, the Trust’s annual charitable grants had reduced in value to $251,000 in 2015. CORE Education Group is the second largest EMO in New Zealand and, like Cognition, is configured as both a for-profit, wholly-owned limited company and a not- for-profit charitable trust. Since its establishment in the late 1990s, CORE Education’s work has consistently focused on learning technologies and environments, and research and professional development services associated with these. Approximately 85% of CORE Education Limited’s annual income in 2014 and 2015 came from contracts, most of these with the Ministry of Education. The financial statements suggest that it has benefited considerably from the MoE’s decision to make the former universities-based school support services contestable from 2011. CORE Education Limited’s annual income in 2010 was $7.8 million. By 2015, this had grown to $22.7 million, and the number of employees from 55 to 180. CORE Education Limited does not have proprietary, high-profile, former public good intellectual property comparable to the Visible Learning plus and Culture Counts plus brands that are sold by Cognition Education Limited. However, it does offer numerous online and face-to-face professional learning modules explicitly linked to various MOE schooling priorities, throughout New Zealand. In one or two cases CORE Education has an agreement through which successful module completion also gives free course credit towards a postgraduate certificate qualification at Unitec. CORE Education also has an agreement with New Pedagogies for Deep Learning (NPDL) Global, based on the work of educational thought leader Michael Fullan from Canada, to offer the NPDL proprietary teacher learning programme across a cluster of up to 100 Australian and New Zealand schools and early childhood centres. As part of its portfolio it also engages in research, consultancy, learning and learning management development services, publishing, event management, thought leadership and educational tour services. CORE Education argues that its educational services are inherently charitable and of public benefit and that, consequently, it is not obligated to xii distribute additional grants from surpluses beyond its day-to-day work. For the period 2010-2015, the total value of grants reported in annual statements is net $1,011,326, averaging $168,554 each year. In addition, the Limited Company has donated $702,775 to the Trust since formal separation of the two reporting entities in 2013 (most of this a one-off donation of $600,000 in 2014). Foundation North, COMET and Kidscan may be said to have different charitable purposes and goals to the three EMOs. The EMO activities are focused directly on the provision of schooling products and services, and on the delivery of government objectives or the improvement of officially mandated student learning outcomes, directly or indirectly. Foundation North, COMET and Kidscan operate both inside and outside the official curriculum and the compulsory schooling sector. The language they use tends to view schooling not in isolation, but as one of several vehicles for promoting greater social and economic well-being at individual, family and community levels. While they may sometimes adopt the official schooling discourse criterion of improved student learning outcomes to justify their activities, their charitable grants and projects in the domain of education often appear to meld classroom, family and community contexts for learning, and to promote a blend of cognitive, affective, cultural and relational outcomes of learning. The Foundation North Group, formerly the ASB Community Trust, was established as a community trust in 1988 to provide goods and services for community or social benefit. Also a Public Benefit Entity, its trustees are appointed by the Minister of Finance. Initially the Trust’s mandate was delivered in the form of buildings, land and regional infrastructure. In 2006, the Trust announced that it would in future focus on community grants and helping community organisations become sustainable through multi-year projects – what it now calls its venture philanthropy approach. The Trust makes financial investments of several hundred million dollars each year in managed funds to grow its equity in perpetuity and distributes a minority of the return on investments as grants. Between 2010 and 2015, the Foundation North Group generated annual investment income that varied greatly from year to year but nevertheless totaled $632.3 million and averaged $105.4 million annually over the period. In 2015, the Group’s grant awarding subsidiary Foundation North Grants Limited distributed $38.7 million from Group income of $137.6 million. Between 2010 and 2015 grants totaled $147.8 million, averaging $24.6 million each year. In the same period, Group equity xiii increased from $1 billion to $1.2 billion. On average, 23.3% of the investment income returns received by the group was distributed in grants each year. In 2009 the Trust announced its Māori and Pasifika Education Initiative (MPEI) with an investment of $20 million over five years. Seven projects were selected from proposals put forward by the community. In a second phase, the Trust identified a further four established projects from its networks, and in 2015 selected its final MPEI project, a leadership programme for young Māori women. In 2014, the Trust launched the Centre for Social Impact New Zealand with the dual purpose of supporting both its own venture philanthropy, and major initiatives by other philanthropic trusts, and government and corporate funders. COMET was settled by former mayor Sir Barry Curtis as the City of Manukau Education Trust in 1999 to act as an information and advocacy hub and work with local stakeholders to advance educational opportunities in the Manukau community. A major purpose of the Trust was to use the financial investment made in it each year by the council to leverage external national government and philanthropic funds for local educational needs and projects. In 2012, it was re-launched by ‘super city’ mayor Len Brown as Community Education Trust Auckland. COMET is both a charitable trust and a Council Controlled Organisation, which means that the Council appoints the trustees and contracts with the Trust for some of its work. Between 2008 and 2015, COMET’s annual income declined from $1.18 million to $0.89 million. In the same period its staffing establishment has reduced from a high point of 11FTE in 2007 to 7FTE in 2015, while the average salary per staff member has reduced in real terms by approximately 30% to $66,834. Equity has remained broadly static, being $0.39 million in 2008 and $0.34 in 2015. COMET’s 2015-2018 Statement of Intent summarises the scope of its work as advocacy (reports and data, strategic plans, policy), innovation (pilot programes), and sector leadership (provide expertise, lead/form coalitions and networks, forums). Its priority areas include education and skills; language, literacy and numeracy; facilitating skills and outcomes for Māori and Pacific Peoples, supporting sustainable development of Māori outcomes, raising youth employability, strong family attachment and learning, and the Independent Māori Statutory Board Plan. It also provides ‘backbone support’ for the pan-Auckland, cross-sector Learning Auckland ‘collective impact partnership’. Kidscan was co-founded in 2005 by current CEO Julie Chapman, with the support of a $40,000 grant from New Zealand Guardian Trust. Its purposes are to promote xiv education and the relief of child poverty nationally, to meet children’s physical, nutritional and emotional needs by providing clothing, food and medical supplies, and to operate programmes, activities and events that support the charitable purposes. By 2014 Kidscan reported that it was operating in 447 schools in 14 regions and supporting 90,000 children. Kidscan distributes mainly goods through a series of named programmes such as Raincoats for Kids, Food for Kids, Health for Kids and a pilot head lice programme in partnership with Hawke’s Bay District Health Board and the Ministry of Health. It describes its approach as ‘fund, source and distribute’. In 2014, Kidscan acknowledged over 90 sponsors and supporters, and more than 25 trust and foundation partners including Meridian Energy, Trillian Trust Inc., McDonnell Dowell Creative Construction and the Ministry of Social Development. Kidscan’s income in 2007 was $0.98 million, it had a negative surplus and nil equity, and employed 7FTE staff. In 2015, its income was $12.5 million, its surplus $0.86 million and its equity $4.5 million, while it employed 58 full- and part-time staff who earned an average of $43,760 each. In 2015 Kidscan’s sources of income in excess of $1 million were in-kind gifts and donated goods ($5.2 million), campaigns ($2.36 million), trusts and gaming trusts ($1.5 million), government grants ($1.4 million), and donations ($1.15 million). In 2016, there is a diversity of private sector policy actors who participate in New Zealand state schooling. Policy actors may be individuals, groups or organisations. They may be either entrepreneurial or philanthropic in orientation, or a mixture of the two, and act according to a complex mixture of public good, not-for-profit and for-profit motivations. Some work largely or exclusively in the area of schooling products and services, while for others schooling is one among several areas of activity. The increased presence of these policy entrepreneurs and advocates in the managed state schooling marketplace appears to have been actively encouraged and facilitated by National-led governments since 2008. Government public sector rhetoric and policy texts now commonly refer to partial subsidies on behalf of taxpayers, PPPs and social investment approaches. These create opportunities and expectations for business and the third sector, including charities, iwi, rūnanga and UMAs, to share the responsibilities of delivering government services, along with greater user pays by households and families. This constitutes a considerable challenge for proponents of the state schooling sector, which by law is both compulsory and free. Those who oppose the privatisation of state schooling on xv principle, on the grounds that it is a public good and thereby a foundational element of government’s social contract with civil society, face something of a dilemma because the current administration is apparently adamant that it will not increase overall government funding to state schooling in real terms. The gradual withdrawal of government enables private sector participation and with participation come expectations of decision-making and property rights. These may range from a return on commercial or social investment in product and services provision, to a role in determining policy for mutual benefit. The prospect of greater private sector participation in creating policy and deciding policy settings raises fundamental questions about public versus private benefit in the delivery of state schooling. In the case of the five charitable trusts used as cases in this report, the amount and quality of information on their personnel, activities and finances are both limited and inconsistent. In both their for-profit and not-for-profit forms, charities claim to be contributing to the public good but there is insufficient standard information for disinterested observers to establish whether and to what extent claimed public benefits outweigh private benefits to individuals, whether charitable distributions are a reasonable proportion of annual income over time, and whether any harm is being done to existing state schooling services and the public sector as a result of greater private sector participation. Gradual withdrawal of government from the funding and provision of state schooling, while at the same time increasing its control over the standards and accountabilities of system performance, radically changes the logics and dynamics of the public education system. It places proportionately greater emphasis on private sector networking and contracts and proportionately less on social democratic, participatory approaches to decisions around public policy development and services delivery. These newer state schooling relations of PPP, contracting out, venture philanthropy and charity need to be understood in much greater depth in terms of the political strategies and tactics being pursued by private sector actors, the degrees of influence they have over politicians and officials, and the material effects their activities have on children, teachers, schools and local communities. Government has an unambiguous legislative responsibility to ensure that all children receive free compulsory schooling yet the current administration appears to have unilaterally set practical limits or qualifications on this responsibility: by way of xvi partial subsidies, user pays, guaranteed return on investment for private sector actors, and an expectation that major innovation in state schooling will be funded philanthropically. Arguably, each of these is to a greater or lesser extent inimical with the social contract that government has with communities, families and children. It is likely that the entry of private sector actors who bring a variety of financial, knowledge, cultural and social capital resources to an over-stretched state schooling system creates tangible benefits by ensuring the presence of educational interventions, products and services that would not otherwise be made available by central government though Vote Education appropriations. This may reasonably be asserted to be the case with organisations like Foundation North, COMET and Kidscan. Their scopes of activity demonstrate, respectively, the need to: (i) fund proof of concept innovation in schooling which can then be scaled-up across the state system as a whole; (ii) increase the community brokerage role played by local government, in order to create more seamless education pathways for children between the home and school, and between the school and workplace; and (iii) to simply put more money into the state schooling system to address children’s basic needs so that they do not act as perfectly avoidable barriers to learning. It may possibly be more difficult to assert that organisations like Pearson, Cognition Education Limited, and CORE Education Limited provide interventions, products and services that would not otherwise be available. It could be claimed that in comparison with the three philanthropic actors above, EMOs, whether for-profit or not- for-profit, take more money out of the state schooling system than they return in terms of contracted-out services and genuine charitable grants. No doubt central government would argue that with their lower overheads and closely specified service contracts, smaller and more nimble private sector charities offer better value-for-money state schooling support than larger public sector organisations. However, that too needs to be the subject of debate and analysis. This report has provided a preliminary sketch map to identify some of the emergent strategies, tactics, dispositions and behaviours of the range of private sector policy entrepreneurs and advocates who are active in New Zealand state schooling today. It raises important questions about the potential benefits and harms of increased private sector participation. It also provides a starting point for a necessary public debate about the purpose, nature and forms of free, compulsory state schooling and xvii how these can be realised in a context where government no longer fully accepts its statutory responsibility to provide for all children a high quality state schooling experience that is free at the point of use.

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. To The Tax Advisory Group My name is John Whyte, I have been self employed for the past nine years. I have for the past two years done some contracting work for a small local accountant who has enough work for one and a quarter people. I want to offer a submission from the ‘coal face’ as it were, in terms of experience of myself, my friends, and my clients, within New Zealand’s tax regime. Simplicity New Zealand’s tax system is fantastic for its simplicity. In my experience most small business owners, if they are prepared to put the time into it, can complete their own tax affairs. This is not to say that everyone wants to, or that everyone should. Not everyone wants to be involved in the creation of their own website, or the changing of the air filter on their vehicle, or setting up an auto response on their own emails. But these are all topics that with some google searching, and the application of some study, a person is able to do. Taxes should be in this category as well. Whether it be GST, Income Tax, Company Tax, or any other sort of tax. One of the reasons I am very keen to mention simplicity is that a lot of clients I see, with my work in accounting, are not spectacularly successful. There are part time business owners. There are mums who do a bit on the side. These businesses often profit less than $20,000 per annum. The cost of their job is usually $1,000-$1,500. As a percentage of their take home income their compliance costs are large. A successful small business is returning $100,000-$120,000 per annum, and this size of job frequently costs $2,000-$2,500 their compliance costs constitute 2% of their income. Adding complexity to the tax system will only increase the regulatory cost to these operators. I want to talk specifically about a friend who runs a small business making cakes, slices, and energy bars. He has two main lines, supplying a gym energy bars, and creating birthday cakes. His profit is about $5,000 per annum which he pays tax on as well as paying PAYE through his day job. The complications inherent in trying to tax unhealthy food will impact people like him and many others. Adding complication, particularly by trying to change behaviour, will have a large impact on those least able to afford it. In addition I believe increasing the complexity of the tax system will increase errors by tax filers. The area where I see the most errors in returns clients have prepared are where there are exceptions. Claiming GST on financial transactions is a common mistake. Claiming entertainment expenses incorrectly is another common mistake as this class of expenses has its own rules regarding deductibility. Recommendation: I strongly urge the working group to consider the simplicity of the tax system as a whole when making recommendations. The simplicity of New Zealand’s tax system is a great strength. Capital Gains and how they link with our current system Whilst in general I am in favour of taxing capital, I am very nervous about their implementation and the prospect of them becoming capital losses. If capital gains are to be taxed before they are realised there will become a cottage industry of revaluation of houses in order to produce a loss to offset against other income. We will also see distortions; one that I can think of is a horde of business owners will agree to renovate the bach, wanting to get the work started in March as this will produce a claimable expense. If capital gains are taxed at realisation, then we will have to have a complex set of rules about associated persons for the loss. Otherwise there is a real potential to ‘sell at a loss’ to a trusted family member. Likewise the prospect of holding property in a company and/or a trust and selling the controlling entity to avoid producing a capital gain becomes real. There are also perception issues with capital losses. Our tax system is built on a system that all profits and losses are joined together at the end of the financial year. All losses roll forward. It makes life simple. A capital gains tax could easily result in a situation where persons like Rod Petricevic, or Mark Byres, do not have to pay any tax for many years because their shareholding in their companies went from a large value, to zero. Recommendation : I encourage the tax working group to consider the difficulties of capital losses and how they are likely to introduce complexity into the tax system. Perceptions There is a general perception with the clients I deal with that they pay too much tax. These clients are almost always self-employed in labour intensive fields, such as subcontracting electricians, or consultants. From their perspective they pay over 50% in tax, (15% in GST and 33%/39% in income tax). These clients often justify their (unjustifiable) tax positions as ‘the tax man takes too much’. They make extra claims relating to their partner’s motor vehicle. They miscalculate their use of home percentage. They claim restaurant invoices as entertainment. I suspect that if their direct tax burden was reduced (either through a reduction in the personal tax rate, or GST) they would me more inclined to engage correctly with the tax system. Recommendation : That the tax working group attempt to determine if a reduction in the tax burden for small self-employed businesses would see compliance raised within this category. Perceived Weakness in the Tax Environment The biggest weakness I see in the tax environment is persons bypassing the tax system entirely. One large threat here is Paypal. People and businesses sell items online, and across borders, take the payment in Paypal, spend the money on their account, and have access to banking facilities outside the bank system, and the IRD oversight. The entire process is too easy to do. I would urge you to consider a currency conversion tax. Such a tax could collect upon multinationals moving funds off shore, persons making purchases elsewhere and evading GST, as well as those exporting funds to a Paypal account. The burden of collecting a tax could be placed with institutions with resources to collect it. For ease of use I would suggest placing this tax rate at an amount equal to the GST rate, and allowing importers to offset any currency conversion tax paid against any GST payable. This could also solve the issue of collecting GST on small payments offshort. Recommendation : That the tax working group investigate a tax upon currency conversions. Thank you for taking the time to read my submission. \[1\] \[1\]

Economic Tools to Influence Effective Waste Reduction. Karl Henderson Research Paper: Advanced Waste Management 188.751 Massey University \[1\] RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 2 Abstract In 1972 the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment convened to introduce and discuss the ‘massive and irreversible harm to the earthly environment on which our life and well-being depend’ (UN Conference on the Human Environment, 1972) as posed by the creation and disposal of waste. As the risk posed by our existing lineal consumption model to humanity is significant, it would be reasonable to view the generation and disposal of products and materials from a simplistic risk-based perspective with the questions being: 1. If products were required to enter a zero waste ecological or technical recovery cycle and future scientific evidence indicates that we were wrong about the potential outcome being ‘massive and irreversible harm’ to the environment, what is the outcome to society if the zero waste approach to waste was enforced and is this acceptable? 2. If we did nothing about our consumption and maintained the existing lineal economic model (the ‘status-quo’) and we were wrong with the outcome being actual ‘massive and irreversible harm’ to the environment (along with our extinction), is this acceptable? This paper will argue that looking at lineal waste generation from the above risk perspective, maintaining the status-quo with the significant risk that the majority of life on Earth (including humans) could reasonably be considered at risk of extinction; is unacceptable and as such governments must move away from the current and ineffective ‘incremental-change’ approach and achieve meaningful change via the establishment of comprehensive economic ‘producer focussed’ incentives to fundamentally change the behaviour of consumers. It will also discuss why the zero harm approach to waste management via the use of technical and ecological cycles must be employed to change New Zealand’s existing and unsustainable lineal ‘consume and dispose’ economy to one of ‘consume and re-use it all’. This paper will also briefly explore the societal, ecological and financial benefits associated with establishing effective producer focussed economic incentives for change. It will look at existing producer focussed economic incentives in use and discusses the benefits and limitations of these ‘front-end’ economic instruments. Finally it will provide thought on an alternative producer/importer focussed economic instrument, a tiered waste taxation system similar to the Goods and Services Taxation model that can be reduced as zero waste outcomes are achieved. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 3 The Use of Economic Tools to Effect Meaningful Waste Reduction It is well established that mankind’s consumption behaviours are negatively impacting on the environment. It is critical to the very survival of humans and a significant number, if not all, of Earth’s species, that we manage our consumption generated waste in such a manner as to produce zero wastage (Phillips, et al, 2011). We are consuming Spaceship Earth’s supplies at such an alarming rate it is as if we have multiple earth-like planets to exploit (Connett, 2013) or that we will be able to live in space while robots clean up our waste here on Earth for our pending return as portrayed by the animated Disney/Pixar movie WALL E (Stanton, 2008). It is arguable that until we manage our resources within the zero-waste framework of technical and ecological cycles, we cannot expect to effectively manage other environmental initiatives such as global warming and species protection. As it stands the existing societal viewpoints of waste and the subsequent waste management practices are inappropriate for sustainability to occur (Green Alliance, 2014). Without sustainability there is no future for our species, as currently humans are playing the ‘short-sighted’ and ultimately tragic lineal consumption model to achieve economic wealth. The pursuit of comprehensive sustainability requires a cohesive society with a strong government led focus on zero waste methodologies, a government who is willing to resist those persons with the majority of the worlds financial wealth; a wealth that is derived almost entirely from lineal, unsustainable human consumption. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 4 From a waste generation and management perspective, New Zealand’s claims of being clean & green or ‘100% pure’ is in effect an abhorrently false marketing campaign that betrays New Zealand’s long-term future. Successive New Zealand governments have maintained the wasteful lineal consumption model and have instead been relying on the ineffective incremental approach to managing wasteful and harmful industry practices within New Zealand as exemplified by the Waste Minimisation Act (2008) which focuses on the application of an ineffective ‘end-of- pipe’ economic tool and a yet unapplied ‘priority product’ stewardship scheme (currently there are no priority products identified). As the incremental approach to waste management have proven to be ineffective in managing waste generation, significant and comprehensive economic tools are recommended to be applied for the effective management of waste as economic tools have been proven to be the most effective influencer on reducing waste streams and waste management (Greyson, 2007) (United Nations, 1992) (Agenda 21 (UN), 1992) and that we must as a society, work cooperatively to achieve a sustainable and desirable quality of life (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) (Agenda 21 (UN), 1992). It will discuss how ideally governments would be aiming to move from an incremental approach to a preventative approach to reducing wastage, which, as stated by James Greyson (2007), “Less Bad is not good enough”. It will be argued within this paper that a preventative approach requires the introduction of innovative, flexible and gradated taxation systems that employ two of the most powerful tools to effect behavioural change – Taxation and subsidies (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006). RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 5 Over the last century, western societies have sometimes intentionally or unintentionally removed informal re-use and recycling systems without a formalised and systematic process in place to replace it. This process had been responsible for returning technical and ecological materials into the material stream and with its removal has resulted in the disappearance of jobs and an increased dependency on landfills that has recently resulted in a flurry of activity by governments to rectify (Wilson, Velis, & Cheeseman, 2006). In less developed economies the informal recycling industry is critical to the survival of large numbers of people with studies estimating that approximately 2% of the urban population across Asia and Latin America are involved within the informal reprocessing of waste materials (Wilson, et al, 2009). Apart from informal employment opportunities, there are many societal and economical advantages associated with achieving a zero waste economy that should elicit a government led divergence from the existing and unsustainable lineal consumerism to the sustainable model of cyclical consumerism. Boulding (1966) assesses and compares the lineal economy (one where resources are consumed as if they are unlimited) against the zero waste cyclical economy and notes that there are both environmental and societal impacts associated with lineal consumerism, where pollution, exploitation and violence repetitively occur. Greyson (2007) further expands on Boulding’s assertions by attributing the significantly detrimental outcomes to the modern lineal consumption economy. These negative outcomes include; extreme inequalities, population expansion, urban sprawl, disease pandemics, public and personal debts, psychological stress and depression, overeating, overworking, unemployment, overuse of alcohol, tobacco and other RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 6 drugs, suicides, failing pension systems, rising taxes, over-regulation, materialism, alienation, distrust, refugees, erosion of civil liberties, military occupations and terrorism. It is reasonable to conclude that positive benefits associated with a change in consumerism models could reasonably be expected to result in achieving the opposite of Boulding’s (1996) identified lineal consumption outcomes. These benefits would also include a significant increase in formalised employment opportunities within industries that include Research & Development, material collection & processing, education & industry training and verification. As a result employment could reasonably be expected to significantly increase within the waste management sector, especially if existing waste generating disposal methodologies such as landfills were no longer an option (Green Alliance, 2014). Other identified benefits include; the reduction of poverty (Wilson, Velis, & Cheeseman, 2006) (Hawken, Lovins, & Hunter Lovins, 1999), the redistribution of wealth across a greater percentage of the worlds population including those from lower socio-economic levels of society (Gutberlet, 2010), reduced drain on resources resulting in lower prices for products and improved public health (Levitzke, 2012), increased availability of technical materials and independence from resource rich countries. Other financial benefits to governments include an increase in income tax (more people employed = more income tax), an increase in GST revenue as more attain financial independence, Increased business tax revenue as more businesses are created to meet the demands of existing industries/producers, and of course the wastage tax with the revenue generated being redirected into zero-waste research and development programmes, infrastructure, consultants, auditors, etc. to support all industries. It could also be RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 7 expected that there would be a reduction in the draw from welfare as more people become employed, there would be less draw on the public health & policing systems as the populous becomes happier and healthier from significant improvements to urban environments such as zero exhaust fumes and pollution in their environment and an increasing positivity regarding the future. A significant question that we as a society should consider is; If we knew that the world was going to end in 10 days time due to a giant asteroid being on a collision course with Earth, would we as a society continue to function? Would we go to work, look for a jobs, build houses, etc., or would society fall into disarray as individuals either removed themselves from society to seek spiritual solace or break societies rules (looting, killing, suicide, etc.) before the asteroid struck? This question is posed as without hope there is a reduced desire for individuals to participate fully in society and todays existing ‘lineal consumption’ is arguably removing that hope, with the symptoms identified by Boulding (1966) becoming increasingly visible around the globe. On a national ‘financial security’ level, one of the key drivers for a zero-waste economy is one that should be very attractive to governments around the world as it manages the significant risk associated with national resource limitations experienced by all countries that have to import raw ‘technical’ materials such as minerals, metals, oils, plastics, etc., This significant risk could be effectively mitigated via the application of zero waste methodologies (Greyson, 2007), as such materials when managed appropriately throughout their lifecycles (from product design through to product ‘end-of-life’) could remain within a technical cycle while maintaining their RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 8 original properties to ensure that the quality of the technical product is not diminished, for example, high quality stainless steel is not degraded by being remelted with lower quality stainless steel. It is important that governments understand the societal and subsequent financial benefits associated with making the transition from a lineal consumption economy to a Zero-waste cyclical consumption economy as government support is critical to the success of effective zero waste management practices (Wilson, et al, 2009) (Gutberlet, 2010) and without this support governments can actually create barriers that greatly reduce the likelihood of success (Gutberlet, 2010), with these barriers either being generated by intentional or unintentional means (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006). An example of an intentional barrier would be the under-financing of research into alternative fuels and their production as “lucrative tax revenues from fossil fuel dependence undermine\[s\] leadership by governments, and rising fuel prices generate short-term profits rather than long-term investment in substitute fuels that do not become wastes” (Greyson, 2007). Sadly this could also be applied to other significant industries within New Zealand such as the agricultural sector. Only governments can create an environment where producers who embrace zero- waste processes are not unduly penalised against those producers who do not. The best way to achieve this ‘level playing field’ is via the introduction of appropriate and consistently applied economic instruments as evidence has shown that economic instruments such as taxation, the application of subsidies and levies etc. are very effective behavioural influencers in the reduction of wastage if applied appropriately RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 9 throughout a products lifecycle (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) to the correct stakeholders who are responsible for the generation of the waste in the first place . It could be argued that globally, from an environmental and societal standpoint, the existing free market policies as practiced, is exactly that for the producers of the waste. It is effectively free of fees and or costs for the manufacturers of the waste associated with their products and packaging materials. As it currently exists a producer makes a product, sells it and pays taxes on profits; everything else becomes an operating cost and subsequently claimed on or passed on to the end consumer within the purchase cost. As it would be reasonable to suggest that environmental altruism is not the strongest behavioural modifier to effect change (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) sustainability cannot be achieved without rectifying this market failure and subsequently creating a level playing field for those producers wishing to become zero-waste organisations to ensure that they are not unfairly compromised (Greyson, 2007). As stated above economic tools are critical for improving waste management practices and have been identified as being essential for modifying our waste generating behaviours, however they must be applied consistently and continually to prevent these behaviours returning to how they were prior to the incentive being initiated (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) and unless they are applied, alternative ecologically sound waste treatment practices will struggle to compete against those established within the dominant lineal consumption model. The following paragraphs explore some of these economic tool groupings that are currently or could potentially be utilised to both rectify the financial disparity between producers operating within RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 10 the zero-waste model & those producers who are not, and to financially incentivise a transition from the lineal to cyclical economic model. The majority of economic tools used to influence behavioural change need to be durable and reliable (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) and fall into the following categories; Mandated stewardship programmes & legislative regulations that are enforced by government agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, Tradeable credits/permits associated with producer/consumer waste generation & impact profiles, deposit schemes, direct subsidies, recycling insurance - managed and enforced by insurance providers and taxation & levies. There are many provinces, states and nations within the OECD that are committed to the zero waste ethos and as such have supported the introduction of economic instruments such as stewardship programmes that are primarily developed by organisations and industries, such as the tyre manufacturing and distribution industry, wishing to minimise their impact on the environment and improve their image regarding their waste profile. However there is an exhibited unwillingness of some OECD governments, as exemplified by New Zealand, to apply mandated stewardship programmes to individual products/industries and as such the focus is on voluntary, industry funded, development of product stewardship schemes. Fortunately there are also an increasing number of large international organisations and industry bodies committing to zero waste product stewardship. However it should be noted that with the New Zealand context, government strategy is heavily reliant on voluntary approaches to product stewardship programmes. With this approach comes the inability or unwillingness of businesses, RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 11 particularly those small to medium in size, to become engaged in effective product stewardship as it is reasonably likely that it is viewed as somebody else’s problem or believed that such programmes are only within the realm of larger organisations and/or governments. The reluctance of governments, including New Zealand, to legislate further product stewardship requirements is exacerbated by the existing complexity associated with existing and conflicting legislative requirements such as environmental laws, regulations and fee application structures that as they exist are predominantly biased towards producers and end-of-pipe waste management solutions. This complexity and bias results in the financial burden associated with waste being allocated to the end consumer and society as a whole, rather than on the producer who’s product/packaging generated the waste in the first place. The result is that the majority of product stewardship programmes in existence globally are limited to voluntary uptake models rather than in a required & enforceable manner. The creation of regulations to manage issues is arguably the most commonly practiced governance influencer applied by governments around the world, as they are easier to develop, implement and maintain with regulations usually being enforced by a singular governmental authority or agency. This approach although common has limitations that includes; they are usually inflexible & cumbersome and as such do not allow for variances across industries and sectors, they are difficult to police in a proactive manner due to resource issues & limitations within the appropriate government agency and that from a behaviour modification perspective the outcomes are negative in nature, uncertain and not immediate resulting in the worst level of behaviour modifier (Keil Centre, 2016). RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 12 The use of tradeable credits/permits (i.e. carbon credits) effectively requires producers to introduce effective waste management practices to be credited with them. The intent is that these credits can be bought & sold in a manner similar to shares and would be traded when there is a return on the initial investment. An advantage of a tradeable credit system to modify behaviours regarding waste management is that it can influence change at a global level as exhibited by the international exchange of stocks/shares. Barriers to the success of such a set up includes; poor performers with significant capital, purchasing credits and also include the issue that the sale price on the alternative market for the credits is not guaranteed to achieve a positive financial return, with the outcome being that the costs associated with gaining the credits in the first place outweighs the return, resulting in uncertainty. Greyson (2007) explores the application of insurance levies with a focus on managing the waste into recycling streams prior to a products manufacture or ‘precycling’. This concept allows for producers to pay premiums for the effective management of their product’s associated waste without arranging their own re- use/recycling system or processes. Greyson identifies significant positives associated with the introduction of a precycling insurance system that includes; the addition of economic vitality and providing an investment stimulus, reducing product prices via the sharing of costs associated with recycling, flexibility in its application across various industries, fair and equitable, reduction of a financial burden on companies, the reduction of regulation numbers and prescriptiveness, a reduction in compliance costs and insurers will audit to ensure that their exposures are managed effectively. Precycling insurance RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 13 also allows for; the impact of ‘hybrid’ products, where ecological and technical materials are used for the one product, are accurately costed with the applicable cost of the waste allocated to the producer prior to production of said product occurs. A significant benefit to the precycling insurance model is that producers of products that are lineal in nature and as such are un-recyclable would pay higher premiums whereas those that have a negligible ecological impact via waste generation would be expected to attract negligible premiums. However the following issues that could impact on the effectiveness and uptake of a ‘precycling’ scheme includes; the reduction in a governments ability to create a revenue stream to support those impacted by the associated price increases and zero waste research and development is reduced, significant revenue leaves the country with insurers likely to be foreign owned, insurers will have the ability to dictate insurance premiums based on their own industry objectives and subsequently will be driven by non-waste management market factors. Other risks include; the potential for insurance companies to delay or oppose paying out via court rulings or that they could collapse leaving waste unmanaged with the costs ultimately being funded by the end- user. Also as indicated by Greyson (2007), there would have to be a legislated requirement for businesses to have precycling insurance in a manner similar to the compulsory 3 rd Party vehicle insurance required to register a vehicle in Australia. Other identified risks include: the potential for variances in the required elements and the application of the precycling insurance between insurers, with further variances in levels of risk acceptance between insurers. Finally, a rather significant risk is that it is reasonable to expect significant limitations in its application to imported products from foreign countries where RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 14 precycling insurance is not mandated and as such gives foreign companies an unfair competitive advantage. Traditional taxation methods as economic instruments to incentivise waste management have the potential to be effective change merchants, as they incentivise via the application of direct monetary inducement benefits as they are; non-optional, can reasonably be expected to deliver desired results quicker and the greater part of the required resources already exists within taxation departments. However they are more likely to be ineffective due to; associated complexity (Greyson, 2007), usually allow for loopholes, potentially increases the likelihood of inappropriate and illegal dumping of wastes (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) if not applied appropriately. Another significant barrier associated with traditional taxation formats as applied to waste management, is that they are usually inflexible in nature which subsequently results in unfairly punishing those industries / organisations that generate negligible or nil waste. Traditional tools designed to address taxation inequality have been complex and cumbersome (i.e. submission of tax returns, etc.). Taxation is also likely to be seen as revenue gathering by the public if it is not visibly re-invested into improved waste management processes, research and development initiatives and impact support initiatives for those members of society affected by the applied tax. Alternatively another format of economic tool that should be investigated further is one that combines producer taxation with that of the precycling insurance model. It is envisioned that such a tax would be similar to that of a goods and services tax in form and application (i.e. paid when a product is purchased), however it would be producer/importer focussed and tiered in such a manner as to be reducible as critical RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 15 elements of the zero waste technical and ecological cycles are achieved - resulting in taxation being applied in a manner that better reflects a producers waste profile. For example if a product has either only ecological or technical component(s) then the tax would be reduced by 50% and can be reduced further with the introduction of further waste minimisation and product stewardship initiatives. A producer waste generation tax (WGT) in effect combines the power of legislated taxation systems with the flexibility and fairness of the precycling insurance concept, which therefore allows for industries and producers to have the flexibility to design their product appropriate processes to minimise waste and subsequently the WGT component. Other benefits associated with a WGT model include:  the requirement for and provision of accurate data to assist with determining a comprehensive analysis of waste profiles at provincial, state, national and potentially global levels.  improved consumer understanding as the WGT associated with a product being displayed on receipts educates consumers on the ecological cost associated with their product when it becomes waste and subsequently allows consumers to effect greater change via modifying their buying habits.  the provision of appropriate subsidies to those industries and producers that currently generate zero or negligible waste by significantly reducing or removing the WGT to be applied; whilst encouraging those producers (and RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 16 importers) who do not meet the requirements of the WGT to instigate / improve their product stewardship to be able to maintain market competiveness.  the potential to stimulate economic growth rather than inhibit it with an increase in ‘industry supporting’ businesses such as consultancy firms, research and development organisations, material collection businesses and an increase in resources associated with compliance and performance auditing; resulting in more skilled and unskilled employment opportunities, etc.  limits the financial impact associated with the introduction of an economic tool via the requirement for businesses to remain competitive and the WTG being non-cumulative in nature as producers and importers pay tax on the waste associated with their products not the retailers. Costs to meet the outcomes of each zero-waste element by producers, which could reasonably be expected to be offset by the reduction in the associated WGT with significant long-term financial returns.  as per existing goods and services taxation models, it includes imported products. Which in turn should influence change within countries exporting products with high waste profiles. It would be reasonable to suggest that as the uptake of a WGT taxation model expands across boarders the influence on change on producers worldwide would exponentially grow. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 17  supports the economy by encouraging research & development, up-skilling & training and compliance & assurance industries to grow in number and size via the inherent desire of businesses and industries to improve their competitiveness within the market.  illegal dumping of wastes could reasonably be expected to reduce significantly as the amounts of waste materials produced will reduce until they cease entirely as producers reduce their product’s waste profiles.  recycled materials will be able to be competitive against virgin materials as they would cost more to acquire under the WGT model.  a positive tension occurs between a governments desire to maximise the associated revenue intake and the producers desire to reduce production costs.  there should be no requirement for the establishment of new, or the manipulation of existing international conventions or agreements as required under other strategies.  Reduces the complexity associated with existing ‘incremental’ approaches and piecemeal legislation. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 18 Identified challenges to the implementation of a WGT styled taxation model include:  a possible conflict with free trade agreements. Although this risk would be minimised due to the retained ability of nations to apply a comprehensive non-import specific taxation model, as exemplified by the goods and services taxation model. Preferably a waste generation taxation model would be introduced at an OECD level to maximise the influence on non- OECD countries.  as the uptake of a WGT model occurs there will be a requirement for the development of an international standard and monitoring methodology. However as the elements are outcome based, as opposed to process based, and based on the elements of the zero-waste model of technical and ecological cycles, comparatively speaking this should enhance the likelihood for agreement to occur succinctly.  it would be reasonable to conclude that it will initially drive up prices for industries and producers of materials that cannot be modified due to technical constraints, materials that would fall into this category would include radioactive materials used in medical procedures or non-destructive testing activities. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 19  it would take a considerable amount of public education and consultation to prepare society for the transition.  payment of a higher percentage WTG by an industry or producer could be construed as purchasing a “right to pollute” (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006). This may be mitigated by government monitoring, the application of fines (on top of the WTG) and potential prosecutions where proven waste reduction methodologies are not introduced due to anti-competitive behaviours such as industry wide collusion.  the WTG would have to be set at a level that modifies consumption and waste generation without applying undue hardship to elements of society such as low-income earners or beneficiaries. This barrier could potentially be offset by an initial increase in government support for those on low incomes funded via the collected WGT. As the WGT intake decreases so does the financial support.  there is the possibility that the application of a WGT styled model would be complicated for producers of significant numbers of products. This issue could be mitigated via the bracketing of similar products and applying the WGT for the highest impacting product within that bracketed group.  a significant increase in appropriately skilled resources with zero waste management knowledge would be required within the taxation department to police / manage the taxation process. This is potentially a positive as it RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 20 would require the employment of people resulting in the societal and financial benefits discussed earlier in this paper.  disposal levies would have to remain to influence consumers ‘post-use’ behaviours until zero-waste has being fully realised. Within the New Zealand context there are significant barriers to the application of economic instruments with the Parliamentary commissioner for the Environment stating in 2006 that there are barriers “that prevent central and local governments using them. Some barriers are unintentional and some are deliberate policy choices”. These barriers include; insufficient guidance from central government to regional authorities regarding the application of economic instruments for waste management (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006), an unjustified focus on gross domestic productivity (GDP) as the ‘crude’ definer of a countries wealth in conjunction with a society that is very much focused on consumption driven economic growth (Levitzke, 2012). It could reasonably be argued that past and current New Zealand governments have pushed towards incremental changes to reducing the levels of wastage within New Zealand. This approach is exemplified by the introduction of the Waste Minimisation Act 2008 where waste tariffs have been applied at the point of disposal or ‘end-of- pipe’ and are ultimately paid for by the end-consumer (not the producer of the waste) and further evidenced by the current governments focus on voluntary producer/importer focused initiatives such as the voluntary glass levy and other product stewardship schemes. This piecemeal & altruistic approach to change is further exemplified by the minister for the environment, the honourable Dr Nick RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 21 Smith (2010), writing within the 2010 New Zealand Waste Strategy foreword. “encouraging businesses to develop product stewardship schemes, particularly for products that may have a harmful effect on the environment “(Smith, 2010) and further exemplified by the ‘non-prioritisation’ of identifying and establishing of economic instruments by the Ministry for the Environment (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006). Within New Zealand, the introduction of the waste disposal levy has ultimately contributed to an increase in the cost of waste disposal for the consumer, which according to the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment , (2010) “may encourage more recycling and other waste minimisation activities”. As the term ‘may’ is not exactly definitive, it would be reasonable to interpret that the Ministry does not believe that any significant impact on waste generation will occur or that there is a significant lack of intent to effect meaningful change within the Ministry’s leadership group. At this point it is important to note that the use of waste disposal levies is back- end thinking or using a cup to prevent the bath from overflowing rather than tuning the tap off (Connett, 2013). Such an approach to reducing waste is fundementally flawed as it does not address the underlying issue of the poorly regulated production and importation of wastful materials and is instead only focused on modifying the consumers disposal behaviour, which could reasonably be argued potentially encourages illegal dumping of waste by consumers due to the increase in disposal costs. ‘Front-end” thinking would entail producer driven initiatives for change with the New Zealand Government modifying consumers waste generating behaviours by enforcing required behaviours of designers/producers to effect a significant reduction in waste generation. RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 22 As identified within the above paragraphs, it is reasonable to state that the New Zealand Government has and for the foreseeable future, will continue to, subscribe to the ‘incremental’ rather than the ‘preventive’ approach to manage waste generation and waste management. This is disappointing 45 years of application suggests that the incremental approach is significantly flawed and is obviously not working (Greyson, 2007) and as such it has resulted in significant complexity and un-workability. The waste management industry’s successful challenge of the application of waste levies by councils under section 544 of the Local Government Act 1974 (Dr. J. Morgan Williams, 2006) as the ability of an industry body to successfully challenge legislation when it is applied highlights the limitations and flaws generated by the ‘incrementally induced’ complexity and disjointed nature of New Zealand environmental legislation. As the ‘piecemeal’, end-of-pipe approach is obviously insufficient to achieve meaningful change regarding waste, it is argued at this point that a comprehensive ‘holistic’, producer inclusive approach is required to ensure that effective change occurs throughout a products ‘lifecycle’ to prevent waste occurring. To conclude, we all know that taxation, rates, etc. are essential for ensuring the effective functioning of the nation, state & regional authority and is generally considered as ‘paying our way’. However if these taxes and rates were voluntary would we still give away a significant portion of our pay packet each week? Would a piecemeal/voluntary approach to paying taxes gather the same amount of revenue? It would be reasonable to suggest that such an approach would not result in an appropriate revenue stream for governments – hence, with few exceptions, taxation on incomes or purchases is compulsory in the majority of countries. Subsequently the RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 23 following question needs to be asked? Is the long-term survival of our species (and many others) more important than the short-term revenue gained from existing taxation methodologies? How can we tax goods and services (GST) when society is no longer able to consume products? As a society we need to ask such questions and subsequently reset our goals. We need to be prepared to pay for our waste at all stages of a products lifecycle and design our products with zero waste cycles in mind, just as the New Zealand Health and Safety at Work Act 2015 requires producers to understand the impact of a products design on safety (New Zealand Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, 2015). We must renew our mindsets around waste generation, provide existing and future generations with a sense that things are not hopeless and empower & encourage our youth to engage in society and the creation of solutions. As stated by the American 16-year-old climate change activist Xiuhtezcatl Martinez (Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABC) , 2017) "Young people have a huge responsibility to be a part of creating \[environmental\] solutions. If we look at just the problems it's going to disempower people and make them hopeless". An as a society we must ensure that our youth have hope, as a society we need to understand, and pay for, the ecological and societal costs associated with consumption. As a society we need to educate ourselves about the zero waste cycles and how a products design impacts on the waste generated by a product. As a society we need to understand that producers are not paying for the waste they generate and that the subsequent ecological harm they are creating, both societally and ecologically, will impact on us all. Revamping our societal goals “invite\[s\] renewed mindsets and world views, which are the strongest possible interventions in complex systems” (Greyson, 2007). RESEARCH PAPER 188.751 – KARL HENDERSON 24 New Zealand as a society has some significant examples of leading global change. Examples include the emancipation of women and the introduction of the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act (1987), which courageously led the banning of all nuclear warships and weapons (including those of our most powerful ally). This societal driven change occurred because statistically 52% of New Zealanders were supportive of the Act. (Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 2015). As established, society must change its consumption behaviours from the lineal model currently in existence to the cyclical consumption models proposed within the zero waste frameworks. This change has to occur not only for improved societal benefits and for our species very survival. For this change to occur it is critically important to understand that the existing ‘altruistic consumer’ and ‘incremental change’ focussed approaches are ineffective and add additional societal and legislative confusion and application inconsistencies. It is also important to understand that a traditional taxation framework dose not allow for the required flexibility as the ‘one size fits all’ approach is not likely to be appropriate to allow for industries and organisations to appropriately tailor their methodologies against their waste profile. Compulsory ‘outcome based’ taxation frameworks such as the proposed producer waste generation tax introduces a flexible economic tool that could reasonably be expected to address the two behaviour modifying missing ingredients of taxation and subsidies that are required to effect significant change (Greyson, 2007) by providing incremental tax reductions, that is effectively a form of subsidisation for those producers who are working towards achieving the sustainable zero waste cyclical consumption model.

Dear Sir Michael and members of the Tax Working Group, This is a submission on the future of tax in New Zealand, with particular reference to the proposals and questions set out in the Working Group’s Background Paper. Sir Michael you have said that the Tax Working Group is not about how to raise more revenue for the Government. I submit that this promise should be kept. Revenue neutrality Where new taxes and tax hikes are recommended by the Working Group, I submit that the Working Group should identify other areas where the burden can be reduced to compensate taxpayers. This is not only about compensation of taxpayers notwithstanding its importance. It’s also about limiting the size of government. “We are from the government and we are here to help”. Ronald Reagan got it right – governments are a dead hand on the economy. The only money they have they must take from their people and in any taxation ‘reform’ this must be the guiding principle. Bracket creep / fiscal drag The effect of inflation pushing taxpayers into higher income tax brackets is a dishonest policy that allows politicians to tax New Zealanders harder, without ever having campaigned on it. I submit that the Working Group recommend legislating annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to changes in average earnings, or, at minimum, inflation. I note that many government benefits and entitlements are indexed — income tax thresholds should be no different. Company taxation New Zealand has one of the highest company tax rates in the OECD. The result is a low- investment, low-productivity economy. I submit that if the Government is interested in encouraging greater investment and growth in our productive sector, it should cut the headline business rate. This is preferable to the Background Paper’s proposal of just cutting rates just for smaller businesses, creating a two-tier business tax regime with the associated complexities and incentives for business to stay small. Cutting rates for small business makes no sense. A small business which survives the first 7 years (which few do) certainly contributes to growth and employment but so do large busineses. A two tier system with internal brackets would be a nightmare. The amount of legislation about tax is already swamping the business. Maori Authorities and charities New Zealand’s company tax system should not include loopholes that give certain groups competitive advantages. I submit that the 17.5% income tax rate for Maori Authorities should be abolished – so that Maori Authorities are not provided with a cash flow advantage over non-Maori competitors. I submit that companies owned by charities should only be allowed to have the charitable tax deduction for profits actually distributed back to the parent charity, or specifically applied to the charitable purpose of the parent. Where such charities are Maori authorities then the proposed charitable rules should apply to the extent of their charitable activities. Capital gains tax A tax on capital gains may discourage investment, stifle wage growth and distort the economy. The point is that no one knows what the consequences would be – intended or otherwise. It would also cause a ‘lock-in’ effect, meaning investors would be discouraged from shifting capital out of unproductive investments. You would be amazed at how often investors won’t sell an investment dog because of the loss against purchase price. However, there is no capital gain on bonds or cash, so any CGT would target equity. The expected return on real estate/houses/buildings is about midway between bonds and shares so in the extreme shares must be the target. On average and over time the expected return on a portfolio of world shares is about 7% (after inflation of 2%). Within this 9% the dividend yield will be about 2%. So, the inflation adjusted expected gain on world shares is about 7% pa.. However, the volatility of the world index is about 14%. This means that over time and on average the expected return will move between -7% and +21%. With a potential return range this wide a government would have a very unreliable income stream and investors would be subject to unreasonable reporting costs. The implementation of such a system makes my head ache. I submit that the Government should not implement such a tax. Taxes on savings We should not allow the tax system to discourage saving. Savers (namely those with retirement funds and investment schemes) currently pay tax on ‘interest’ that, in practice, partially just reflects the effects of inflation. I submit that we should allow taxpayers to deduct inflation from taxable income earned via saving. Environmental taxes I submit that any proposed environmental taxes should come with recommendations which make them revenue neutral. I am inclined to think that tradable rights for water would establish both a market price and direct water to its most/profitable/beneficial use. We will never know the demand for a water fountain until citizens are required to pay for it. Sheep farmers in Marlborough will never change their land use until the real cost of their farming is known. Certainly ‘mother knows best’ politicians should avoid targeting specific industries or uses of water. This matter is too complex and its widespread interests are too varied. The Working Group should recommend a special study bringing together the various interest groups to propose the ways forward. At this stage the Working Group might confine itself to proposing an objective framework for future water uses/rights so that these and environmental objectives can be measured and analyzed. Lifestyle taxes A feature of a democratic society is that individuals are encouraged to take responsibility for themselves. For the less able there needs to be assistance and society seems to accept this. However, there is a point at which the state crosses the boundary in seeking to take away from individuals their right to determine their own future. “We are from the government and we are here to help.’ Ronald Reagan was spot on. Governments are a drag on society. Basically, the message to government is “Get out of the way and I will feed Paris !!”(Bastiat). On another note ever since its introduction special interest groups have clamored for adjustments to GST – to make fruit more affordable, to make fuel more affordable, for various sanitary products. The NZ GST system is the envy of the world because it is comprehensive. Any compromise here is likely to increase the economic cost to all NZers without achieving the sought-after benefits. (Do we remember increasing the accommodation allowance oinly to landlords increase rents?). Change GST from its present and watch for the unintended consequences and the failure to achieve whatever was intended. Beyond the points made above, I endorse the broader submission made by the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Laurenson

Page 1 of 2 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Submission on the Tax Working Group’s review 1. Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback; 2. I do not wish to speak to this submission if the opportunity arises. I support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fair tax system that will have a positive impact on the wellness and wellbeing of all New Zealanders, and works to improve health outcomes and reduce harmful behaviours in New Zealand society. Background Alcohol causes more harm than any other drug available, including nicotine, cannabis and methamphetamine. The pattern of use and related-harms of alcohol continue to have huge implications on the health, social and economic burdens in New Zealand. Hazardous alcohol consumption and related-harms are key drivers of inequities affecting individuals, families and communities, touching most services within the health system and external sectors. Alcohol-related harms are key contributors to poor health outcomes, and inequities on men, Maaori, young persons, and to people and whaanau living in more socially deprived areas. Since 2011, drinking has increased in every group across age, ethnicity and sex, with the greatest increase seen in women. 1 In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers than in 2012. 2 We need to do more to enable and equip people to make healthier decisions around alcohol and to minimise the harm alcohol causes. Alcohol is too available, accessible and affordable in New Zealand. Currently the government receives approximately $1 billion (in 2017) annually from alcohol excise tax. However, this does not nearly cover the annual cost to individuals, families and communities; in 2005-2006, there was $5 billion worth of alcohol-related harm in our nation, amongst our people, in our communities. 3 The current excise tax system is archaic and inconsistent. The overarching concerns are that: 1. some alcoholic beverages are taxed by volume and some are taxed by alcohol content; 2. the excise tax on wine has not changed in decades; wine is taxed equivalent to 10% alcohol strength. However, wine typically contains 12-14% alcohol strength. This means that taxpayers are losing out on this revenue that could be used to fund essential social services; 3. 20% of New Zealanders do not drink therefore people who fall under low-risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. Alcohol Excise Tax I believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to our people in New Zealand. In order to improve health outcomes, reduce inequities and to value a fair system that acts fairly on society, I recommend the following: 1. increase alcohol excise rates by a minimum of 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% 2. annually adjust the excise rates to account for inflation 1 Ministry of Health (2015, 2016). New Zealand Health Survey 2 Ministry of Health (2012, 2016). New Zealand Health Survey 3 Stack, A. & Business and Economic research Limited (BERL). (2009). Costs of harm alcohol and other drug use. BERL economics. \[ Page 2 of 2 3. annually adjust the excise rates to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers 4. all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume. If it is not possible to determine the exact alcohol content in a product, then the excise tax on wine should be increased from alcohol strength 10% to 14%. 5. all alcohol products should be taxed by the exact amount of alcohol they contain 6. that a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy is implemented to address the availability of cheap alcoholic beverages. This will target heavy drinkers and significantly reduce inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Background Diet, High BMII, and alcohol use are huge contributors to the burden of disease or health loss in New Zealand. Excise Tax on sugar-sweetened beverages Strategic planning and effort needs to be made to reduce obesity, tooth decay, diabetes and other chronic health conditions by reducing the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). The definition of SSBs used here, includes all water-based non-alcoholic beverages with added sugar including soft drinks, energy drinks, fruit drink, sports drink, cordial and beverages containing non- nutritive sweetener. I recommend that: 1. an excise tax is made on SSBs based on sugar content 2. an excise tax is made on SSBs seeing a price increase of at least 20% 3. annually adjust the excise rates to account for inflation 4. annually adjust the excise rates to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers 5. Use the revenue generated by tax into initiatives aimed to improve nutrition, and reduce obesity and other related health issues for the people of New Zealand. Thank you for receiving and considering my feedback and recommendations.

A continuation of the present broad-based low rate taxes; 2. A review of the land gain provisions 3. A review of the provisions for the taxing of gains from the disposal of other property 4. The establishment of a Tax Commission or similar body to provide a means for a more systematic review of the implementation of new tax rules I make comments on the possible design features of a general capital gains tax (CGT) although I am ambivalent about the desirability of such a tax. Submission Background This is a personal submission that is not made on behalf of any clients. It is, however, one made with the benefit of 35 years of tax law experience that has covered a very wide range of entities and transactions. I have litigated a moderate number of tax cases, and I have resolved many more tax disputes. I studied tax in 1976 and 1980 (in NZ) and in 1981-82 (in USA). I have written and lectured on many tax topics, as well as having created a lot of tax training resources (for Inland Revenue). I also have seven years of government tax panel experience – Rewrite Advisory Panel (as independent Chair) and GST Advisory Panel. I have also appeared before the Finance and Expenditure Committee as a submitter on numerous occasions (from 1985 onwards) and have been a Specialist Advisor to that Committee. My submission is also made with the benefit of a few years of living (by deliberate choice) in a Deprivation-10 suburb (also classified as Decile-One for educational purposes) in order to provide support to disadvantaged members of our society, including ex-prisoners. Affordable housing is a problem within New Zealand. \[1\] A. Future of Tax In my view, New Zealand ought to have a tax system with the following features: • Broad-based low rate taxes, but with a progressive rate structure for individuals; • GST and income tax of a similar nature to the present rules; • No death duties or stamp duties; • Better correlation to international norms, e.g. superannuation and employee share schemes taxed in a manner that do not create distortions when individuals migrate; • Simplification of the process for individuals and SMEs for tax disputes; • Appraisal of some historic tax rules such as land gain rules that are lack consistency and do not reflect the current environment (with the Resource Management Act) and have adverse consequences in encouraging “land-banking”; • A Tax Commission or similar body to provide a means for a more systematic review of the implementation of new tax rules, and for the review of older provisions, and as a more public/transparent way of keeping tax policy requests and submissions in the “public square”. A.1 Capital Gains Tax I am ambivalent about the possible introduction of a Capital Gains Tax. On the one hand, the lack of a general capital gains tax is a gap in the New Zealand tax system and one that creates a degree of unfairness and some lack of horizontal equity. On the other hand, implementation of a CGT without a systematic review of the Income Tax Act provisions relating to dispositions of land and of personal property (like shares) will result in problems and disputes for years. It is not possible or realistic to simply add CGT to the tax system. A CGT ought not, in my submission, to be imposed as a full rate income tax. Rather there ought to be some differential rate. However, the adding-on of a CGT to the ITA in its current form would be a simplistic approach and one that would cause problems in implementation. Simply put, there would be many winners and many losers if there were no review of the existing provisions of the ITA so that there would be appropriate synchronising of CGT and other taxing provisions in the ITA. I refer to Appendix 1 where I highlight a number of problems with the land gain provisions. A.2 Challenges and Risks The recent high rate of success of Inland Revenue in litigating tax cases creates a challenge to public perceptions of fairness of the tax system. A high rate of success would seem to be appropriate where there is a “perfect tax system”, but that is an unattainable goal. There are compromises that are made in the development of tax policy, but these do not now receive appropriate testing through the courts. Tax policy judgments made by tax policy officials, with the benefit of submissions by specialist advocates, may provide the best answer, but there is not much opportunity to test the appropriateness of those judgments. The Select Committee process does not get many “grass roots” submitters. I am not criticising the GTPP itself, but I wish to note that it was developed at a time when tax disputes were easier and cheaper to resolve. If there is no economically viable way for difficulties in the tax system to be explored, then the tax system will get trapped in a form of time warp so that it will not reflect our society and economy. An example that I proffer to the Working Group are the land gain provisions (partly considered in Appendix 1) – there have been few cases in the past 20 years. One aspect is the “work of a minor nature” exclusion was effectively eliminated by the enactment of the Resource Management Act so that subdivision processes are never “minor”. A second aspect was the widespread practice of house renovations undertaken for the purpose of deriving profits, with the corollary of inflating house prices thereby removing (or at least impeding) affordability. It is not yet clear whether the bright line test (of 2 years of ownership) created greater availability of affordable housing, while my speculation is that the 5-year bright line test will simply encourage land-banking. A third aspect is that a small number of local authorities have been changing their district plans in order to permit intensification, but there are potential adverse tax consequences for existing landowners through the operation of section CB 14 of the ITA so that a well-advised owner will not release land for intensification until the expiry of the 10-year period of ownership. Another aspect is that some tax advisers take the view that section CB 14 can apply to virtually every property where a resource consent is or might be granted under the RMA. There is no longer much development of tax provisions through tax disputes identifying weaknesses in the tax system so that there can be measured and balanced reform. The detailed and elongated tax disputes process detracts from taxes being fashioned so as to suit societal and business developments. Instead, the focus on new tax provisions for larger taxpayers means that smaller taxpayers are becoming increasingly frustrated with tax rules that do not seem to make sense. B. Purpose of Tax In my view, the tax system is a mechanism for the fair and equitable raising of Government revenues. Although the large-scale processing capabilities of Inland Revenue have been used to implement other collections, such as Student Loans and Child Support, I am of the view that any similar enlarging of the tax collection functions will be counter-productive. In my view, the non-tax functions of Inland Revenue create a lack of specialisation. Tax provisions should be evaluated against their impacts on our society and our economy. And they should all be evaluated by way of post-implementation reviews. I do not favour a tax system that creates incentives for taxpayers. It may appear cheaper to administer incentives through the tax system, but this comes to taxpayers with the potential cost of tax disputes. C. Are We Taxing the Right Things? The tax rules relating to the taxation of the disposal of shares are, like the land gain rules, worthy of re-appraisal. The rules contained in sections CB 1, CB 4 and CB 3 are difficult to apply. They were developed before the development of modern approaches to investing – they encourage a laissez-faire approach to the management of investments by trusts and other entities, as well as by individuals. The development of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and of tracker funds with favourable tax rulings means that the tax system indirectly affects the investment choices of individuals. It is risky from a tax perspective to undertake direct investment. But did any Parliament decide that it was desirable to have tax advantages for these funds over individuals and other entities making their own investments? I have made a number of comments on the land gain rules in this submission. I acknowledge that my concerns with the existing provisions could be construed (or actually misconstrued) as support for a general CGT. My overall position is that I am ambivalent about a general CGT. However, I do wish to state my view of the appropriate design features: • There should still be some taxation of gains as income gains. In the USA, short-term capital gains being disposals within 12 months are effectively treated as ordinary income; • There should be a differential tax rate so that the rate of CGT is less than the ordinary income tax rates; • All assets held on the commencement date ought to be within the taxing provisions (but on the assumption that there is a differential tax rate for CGT); • There should be simplified rules for the determination of commencement date opening values of assets; • There needs to be an implementation programme comparable to that used in 2010 for the rate change for GST, because there is every likelihood that the implementation of a CGT will result in the need for some special rules to be enacted; • Appendix 1: Land Gain Provisions The land gain provisions are poorly understood by most persons who acquire land. In particular, I note that the widely stated adage that “there is no CGT in New Zealand” leads many immigrants into problems. The land gain provisions reflect the horizontal expansion of New Zealand in the post-WWII period when rural land was developed into urban housing (often with the then common quarter-acre section). There have been reforms of the operation of the associated persons rules. However, there still remains the intricate overlay of rules covering (a) purposes and intentions, (b) “tainted” businesses, (c) subdivision and development, and (d) zoning changes, together with the different exclusions. They are best described as trying to drop a ping-pong ball through a log jam. In my submission, the lack of policy coherence in the land gain rules necessitates a review, rather than a simplistic replacement of the rules with a CGT. I have recently become aware of a small number of local authorities proposing district plan changes that will enable intensification. This will enable areas of vertical expansion. When the language of section CB 14 is examined, it is apparent that the tax rule will (if correctly applied) impede intensification and the provision of more affordable housing. The provision applies where there is a district plan change (or the likelihood of such a change) and there is a 20 percent change in value of the land. The provision applies where the land has been owned for less than 10 years. This suggests that any owner of rezoned land needs to get a valuation in order to determine whether they are able to sell their land. I note that there is an exclusion for owner-occupied land, but not for rental properties. Appendix 2: GTTP The lack of reference to the generic tax policy process (GTPP) in the discussion paper leads me to reflect on the importance of a fair process for the development and maintenance of tax policy. The lack of a mechanism for review of existing tax provisions is a problem within the New Zealand tax system. Although the GTPP stipulates that there will be post-implementation review is, my experience is that any such reviews often lack public consultation and do not involve an evaluation at an appropriate time. Evaluation two years after implementation is usually too soon especially if only Inland Revenue officers are consulted with. The following list is of a number of provisions on which I have been a party to submissions seeking reviews, or where there is an apparent need to reconsider specific tax provisions. This list focuses on somewhat smaller provisions that are usually reviewed but some of these become larger issues over time. For example, I recall (to a limited extent) making submissions to the Minister of Customs about problems about Customs exemptions for small-value items that favoured overseas wholesalers over New Zealand wholesalers of books - this submission was made in the 1984 to 1986 period but it is likely that the implementation of GST took precedence. The problem has now evolved into the so-called “Amazon problem” under which imported goods escape the application of GST. The list is: • The refundability of imputation credits to tax-exempt charitable entities, where the non- refundability is inconsistent with the policy underpinning the imputation system; • The restriction of eligibility to Māori tax authority tax status to entities that receive Treaty settlement assets and fisheries entities, where the policy basis for the restriction is hard to discern; • The need for an evaluation of the large number of different Third Sector entity types and their tax status, as discussed with a member of the (McLeod) Tax Review in 2000-01 but where the Review had insufficient time to commence such a review; • The tax exemption for veterinary clubs, given the potential anti-competitive effects; • The tax exemption for Lloyds memberships given that the regulatory requirements in the UK now seem to preclude individual memberships; • The operation of the non-profit society “exemption” which applies by way of a deduction (under section DV 8) so that the “exemption” applies to income of less than $1000, because the provision technically requires the filing of tax returns; • The treatment of hedging versus speculation in derivatives, where the suggestion (made in the late 1990s) of a form of electronic drop-box for pre-notifications of tax treatments was seen as being too expensive for Inland Revenue to undertake. In addition, I note that the work of the GST Advisory Panel in 2010 dealt with many, but probably not all, the issues that were latent in the GST system. In my view, there are still many issues in the GST sphere that need to be addressed. I acknowledge that there may be adequate reasons for these suggested areas of reform not being considered. However, I do believe that the large resources used in developing large reforms means that there is insufficient resourcing of so-called smaller issues, which have greater societal impacts. I submit that there is a need for a Tax Commission, or similar body, that has responsibility for maintaining the tax system. I note that the Tax Rewrite Panel came to provide such a forum, although my appointment in 2008 as its Chair was always seen as a sunset appointment for that body. It provided a forum for a focus on technical issues between the tax advisory professions and policy officials. In the absence of such a body, resource issues will always result in new taxes being prioritised over maintenance issues. In my submission, an omission to review all taxes creates the risk that the tax system is not fit for purpose.

Not being a policy analyst I have found the process of contributing to this important discussion a challenge. I believe the experience of people is very important. Yet, how many people are excluded from this process by the dialogue and the way’s in which they are meant to respond. I’ve done my best. The Future environment The main risks and challenges and opportunities for the tax system The tax system effects and should matter to everybody. Unfortunately the current system is punitive towards the most vulnerable and the poor, and too easily exploited by the wealthy to have any integrity of purpose. People will do anything to avoid whatever taxes they can when their incomes are being skewed by low wages, or falling returns. Largely; because, the system failing too many people. Dealing with inequality is the biggest challenge as there is no virtue in poverty. We have become mean spirited, and we need to re-educate our population concnering the benefits of taxation and what it means. A future focused tax system needs to first value peoples contributions paid and unpaid. Hence, a Universal Basic Income is going to become a reality we can’t ignore. The principles of Tikanga Maori would help create a more future- focused tax system for everyone because it is more people focused. Purposes and principles of a good tax system collective provision of vital public services The collective provision is the most effective way of looking after people. The collection of tax shouldn’t be a burden on households. It is important there is a sense of fairness and equity. Where a situation arises where there are anomalies there should be tax credits. The system we have is so miserly and punitive one dare not make a mistake when filing tax returns. Secondary tax is outdated and needs to be gone. Too many households, couple or single, with or without children, are dependent on two income sources to survive. Often this will result in paying secondary tax. For beneficiaries/job seekers the situation is worse should they earn over the set amount of $80 their benefit is deducted and then they pay secondary tax on what was earned. In some cases this results in less money before any money has been earned. Once again, it is punitive and all quite ridiculous. The current tax system Is not the best approach, a simple progressive tax system with exemptions at the bottom are needed. Your first 10,000 could be tax free. You would find a healthier attitude towards tax if people felt everyone was sharing the responsibility. Small business should be given the same consideration. There should be a working group established which asks people to come talk about their experience of tax. To much is put down on paper and not enough is spent dealing with and talking to the people decisions on taxation affect. Figures alone will never give a true picture. Higher income people have more discretionary spending. Low income people struggle to meet the basics. Fairness and balance The productive money, i,e., money which creates infrastructure and jobs should be treated differently from unproductive money used in financial speculation. Thus, we need a financial transactions tax which would help curb dead money speculations. Specific challenges Multi-national companies like Facebook, and so on need to pay tax. An overseas transaction tax needs to be applied to purchases made online to non-NZ sources. However, GST should be removed from healthy protein sources and vegetables. For example, soft drink manufacturers could be taxed at production level rather than the cost being passed on to the consumer. Housing affordability Housing affordability is affected by uncontrolled speculation in the housing market. Family homes should be exempt from taxes, but sales of properties other than the family home should be taxed at a flat rate when sold. We need to come down harder on the speculative buyers. These are not producing productive, affordable, housing for New Zealanders.

I am a Professor of Law at the University of Auckland Law School. My principal field of expertise is tax law and tax policy. I have published extensively in these areas both in New Zealand and in other countries. I am a fulltime academic but I have also from time to time provided advice to individuals, business interests and the governments of several countries. I make these submissions in my personal capacity. 2. On 14 March 2018 the Tax Working Group recently established by the government published a paper called Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper. The Working Group (at page 46) called for submissions addressing six main questions. It also asked a number of other questions, most importantly a series of more specific questions relating to the design of a possible capital gains tax (CGT). 3. These submissions are arranged as follows. This Introduction is followed by a Summary of key points. The Summary, in turn, is followed by submissions addressing the Working Group’s six main questions and the specific questions about a CGT. Finally, the submissions discuss the possibility of introducing a tax on sugary drinks. 4. I would be happy to answer any questions and to discuss any aspect of the Working Group’s work with the Group or its secretariat. \[1\] 2 SUMMARY 5. The principal points made in these submissions are as follows. First, the current non-taxation of capital gains is both inequitable and inefficient. The optimal course for the government to take, however, would be not to introduce a general CGT but, rather, to introduce specific CGTs on two of the more important classes of capital gains (namely gains made by companies and gains made on listed shares and other listed securities), supplemented by an annual land tax (chargeable on all land other than the family home and, perhaps, Māori land). 6. The overall result would be broadly similar to a general CGT, but the legislation would be incomparably simpler and the costs of compliance and administration would be far less. In particular, the two specific CGTs could be established by simply extending the definition of income, for income tax purposes, so as generally to include (a) gains made by companies and (b) gains made on listed shares and other listed securities; and the annual land tax could be established on the same basis as the existing system of local government rates. 7. Reform of this nature (specific CGTs on capital gains made by companies and gains made on listed securities, plus a land tax) would leave important classes of capital gains generally untaxed, as at present – in particular, gains made on shares in unlisted companies, gains made on interests in unincorporated businesses, and gains made on collectibles (works of art, antiques, etc). But taxing gains of these sorts raises difficult questions of policy and entails considerable complexity. Indeed, most of the complexity of most countries’ CGTs seems to be the result of including gains of these kinds within the scope of the tax. Moreover, in most countries the revenue derived from taxing gains on small businesses is substantially less than it would otherwise be because of the various reliefs offered. Further, such reliefs usually seem to aggravate the complexity and to be susceptible to abuse. Another reason for leaving shares in unlisted companies and interests in unincorporated businesses outside the tax net is that it would be an effective method of encouraging entrepreneurialism and supporting small businesses (and would obviate the need for other preferences, such as a progressive company tax). As for taxing gains made on collectibles, it seems unlikely that that would generate significant revenue, especially given the ease with which most collectibles could be removed from the jurisdiction. 8. Because of the peculiar nature of the market in agricultural and horticultural land, it is possible that imposing a tax on those kinds of land would be problematic. If so, that problem could be solved by offering the owners of agricultural and horticultural land the choice of either paying the land tax or paying income tax on any gain made on sale of the land. 9. The government should also investigate further the possibility of an emissions tax based on the destination principle – that is, applicable to goods and services consumed in New Zealand, but not on exports. It should also increase the tax on cars, but with an exemption for electric cars and cars that use relatively little petrol or diesel. 10. It would be a mistake for the government to exclude from GST anything at all that is not currently excluded. 11. The grounds upon which these points are based are set out below. 3 QUESTION 1 How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? 12. The cost of housing, measured against incomes, appears to be higher in New Zealand than almost anywhere else in the world. It seems probable that this is mainly due to factors other than tax. It is possible, however, that the tax system has exacerbated the problem because under the current law (a) landlords are permitted to set off operating losses on investment properties against other income and (b) capital gains are generally not taxed. The consequence of these two factors is that landlords are commonly prepared to operate their investment properties at a loss (mainly as a result of interest deductions) with a view to later making a tax-free capital gain; and that, in turn, means that they are presumably prepared to pay more for houses than they otherwise would – thus pushing up prices. In other words, the tax system, as currently structured, effectively subsidises landlords. 13. It would be possible to substantially reduce the subsidy referred to above by any one of three means (or by any combination of them), namely (a) ring-fencing losses and/or (b) introducing a CGT and/or (c) introducing a land tax. As is explained below, a general CGT would be quite seriously problematic, whereas a land tax (meaning a tax on all land, excluding only the family home and perhaps Māori land) would deal directly with the problem and would also be simple, similar in its economic effect to a tax on capital gains made on land, and much cheaper to administer. The best course to take, therefore, would be to introduce a land tax (in conjunction with the two specific CGTs proposed above). Ring-fencing of losses would be at best a partial solution and it would also be problematic in several respects. In particular, it would be inequitable, complex and susceptible to avoidance. But even so, it might be a useful adjunct to a land tax. Ring-fencing Losses 14. One aspect of the problem is that under the current law, landlords can not only deduct their operating expenses but also set off their operating losses against their other income. Many landlords take advantage of this by what they call “negative gearing”. That is, they finance their acquisitions of houses by borrowing heavily – quite commonly up to 100 per cent of the cost of the house (which they can often do, despite the banks’ lending restrictions, because they have other assets that they can use as security). Consequently, the interest paid to the lender (usually but not always a bank) exceeds the rent received from the tenant, so the landlord operates at a loss. Landlords usually also incur expenditure on rates, repairs and insurance, and these costs are deductible also. 15. A landlord suffering such a loss is permitted, under the current law, to set it off against his other income – meaning that he pays less tax on his other income than he otherwise would. For example, if he derives income from employment, he will be entitled to a refund of some of the PAYE withheld by his employer; and if he is self-employed, he will pay less tax on the income generated by his business. The losses suffered by heavily leveraged landlords are real, not artificial. That is, the landlord is genuinely suffering a loss, as a result of the large interest payments he is making to the lender. But landlords are commonly happy to put themselves in 4 this loss-making position, because the property market usually rises; and when it does, they will make a tax-free capital gain. 16. One way of dealing with this problem would be to amend the income tax legislation (currently the Income Tax Act 2007) so as to ring-fence landlords’ operating losses. That is, landlords would still be able to deduct their operating expenses (interest, rates, repairs and insurance); but a landlord operating at a loss (because his total expenditure on interest, rates, repairs and insurance exceeded the rents received) would not be permitted to set it off against his other income. For example, he would not be entitled to a refund of PAYE. This would significantly reduce the degree to which the tax system currently subsidises investment in housing. 17. If a ring-fencing rule were to be introduced, it should permit the landlord to carry forward unused losses and set them off against future rental income. What often happens is that, over a period of years, the landlord’s rental income goes up (because of inflation) while his interest payments remain unchanged (and go down, if he pays off principal). Consequently, he finds himself eventually operating at a profit; and at that point, he should be permitted to set off his accumulated losses (that is, the total amount of losses suffered in previous years, while he was operating at a loss) against his rental income. It would be possible to enact a rule not allowing the landlord to carry his losses forward, but it would be undesirable to do so for two reasons. First, it would be inequitable, in that any ring-fencing rule would disadvantage investment in housing as against other forms of investment; and to disallow the carry-forward of losses would be even more so. Secondly, it would be unnecessary. The problem is that landlords can currently offset their operating losses against other current income; there is no need to deprive them of their losses altogether. 18. Although ring-fencing landlords’ losses would substantially redress the way in which the tax system currently subsidises landlords, it would be only a partial solution. The main reason for this is that capital gains would remain untaxed. Another problem, however, is that some landlords would attempt to get around the ring-fencing rule. Specifically, they would adopt arrangements aimed at in effect enabling them to set off their interest deductions against rental income, despite the rule. For example, an investor might own both a property portfolio and a share portfolio. Under the current law, he would typically use his own funds to buy shares and borrowed funds to buy houses. That way, under the current law, he could set his operating loss off against his other income. If a ring-fencing rule were to be introduced, he would use borrowed funds to buy houses only to the extent that the interest would be deductible – that is, the interest, plus the other expenses, would not exceed the rental income. But he could maintain the same level of debt as before, by using the surplus to buy shares. The result might be that he would now be operating his share portfolio at a loss; but the ring-fencing rule would not apply to share portfolios, so he would effectively be in the same position as before the rule was introduced. 19. In order to combat such arrangements, the ring-fencing rule would inevitably be complex and consequently expensive for the Inland Revenue to administer. Moreover, despite the complexity, it would still be far less than 100 per cent effective. Worse, it would generally be effective against less affluent investors (those owning only a small number of houses and without substantial other investments), most of whom would not be in a position to adopt arrangements such 5 as those described above; but it would be ineffective against richer and more sophisticated investors (who would be able to use arrangements such as those described above). In other words, it would be not only costly and ineffective, but inequitable and consequently perhaps politically problematic. Land Tax and/or Capital Gains Tax 20. The Working Group has asked whether New Zealand should introduce either a CGT or a land tax (questions 2 and 3). The best course would be to introduce a land tax (plus specific CGTs, as indicated above) because that would be the best way of redressing the inequity and inefficiency built into the current tax system. A general CGT might also ameliorate the inequity and inefficiency, but a land tax (together with specific CGTs) would be better. The reasons are set out below, in the answers to questions 2 and 3. 21. The main benefits of a general CGT or a land tax would not include that it would make housing any more affordable, though it is possible that, at the margins, it would have that effect. The reason is that a CGT or a land tax would tend to deter investors from buying houses; it might consequently reduce demand for houses; and so the price of houses might fall. It is also possible, however, that a CGT or a land tax (or any other tax on developers or landlords) would deter investors from building houses – in which case the tax, far from ameliorating the problem, might aggravate it. 22. It is necessary to note also that any measure that deters investors from buying houses, although it might make houses somewhat cheaper to buy, might also drive up rents. The reason is that, if fewer investors buy houses, there will be fewer houses available to rent, so rents would be likely to rise. Foreigners Buying Houses 23. It is widely thought that one of the reasons for the very high cost of housing is that a significant number of foreigners (that is, persons who are neither New Zealand citizens nor permanent residents) have bought houses here; and it has been proposed that the law should be changed to prevent them doing that. A better solution, however, would be to permit foreigners to buy houses but to tax them heavily if they do so. An example of a jurisdiction operating such a system is Hong Kong. There, a foreigner can buy a house (or, as is more common in Hong Kong, an apartment), but only on payment of a tax (called stamp duty) charged at 15 per cent of the purchase price: see Stamp Duty Ordinance 1981 (Hong Kong). The advantages of this system are that (a) it is not as inflexible as a total ban; (b) it presumably acts as an effective deterrent in most cases; and (c) in the relatively small number of instances where a foreigner buys a house (or an apartment), they are obliged to make a significant contribution to the public finances in the form of the tax. The tax is easy and cheap to administer and difficult to avoid or evade. 24. Hong Kong also generally does not permit non-residents to deduct interest incurred on funds used to purchase houses (or apartments): see Inland Revenue Ordinance 1947 (Hong Kong). Consequently, non-resident landlords are almost invariably liable for tax on rental income, irrespective of their level of debt. This rule, too, might be worth considering. 6 QUESTION 2 Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 25. There are strong arguments in favour of introducing a CGT, namely (a) equity and (b) efficiency. The equity argument is that equity requires that a person’s liability to tax should be a function of his or her ability to pay; and that, all else being equal, a person who has made a capital gain is more able to pay tax than one who has not (assuming their incomes are otherwise equal). As one commentator observed, “A buck is a buck is a buck” – and it is irrelevant whether the buck is a capital gain or some other form of income: it should be taxed in the same way and at the same rate. The efficiency argument is that not taxing capital gains results in harmful distortions. Specifically, it incentivises people to arrange their affairs so as to produce tax-free capital gains rather than taxable income. More particularly still, it incentivises people to invest in land (mainly houses and apartments), rather than in something more productive, such as a business. 26. The better course of action, however, would be for New Zealand not to introduce a general CGT, but instead to introduce two specific CGTs (one on gains made by companies and the other on gains made on listed securities), plus a land tax. A general CGT might be better than nothing, but specific CGTs plus a land tax would be better still. The reason is that it is virtually inevitable that any general CGT would be seriously flawed. Problems with a Capital Gains Tax 27. The first flaw is that it is probable that any general CGT would be charged at a lower rate than the income tax. In almost every country where there is a CGT, it is charged at a lower rate than the income tax. Usually, it is charged at about half the rate of the income tax: see Michael Littlewood and Craig Elliffe, eds, Capital Gains Taxation: A Comparative Analysis of Key Issues, Edward Elgar, Cheltenham, 2017. Similarly, when the Labour Party last proposed a CGT, the proposal was that it should be charged at 15 per cent. Such a tax (that is, a CGT charged at a lower rate than the income tax) might be better than nothing but it would be a long way short of ideal because it would leave both the equity problem and the efficiency problem largely unresolved. 28. Most importantly, taxpayers would still be incentivised to arrange their affairs so as to make capital gains (taxed at, say, 15 per cent) rather than ordinary income (taxed at 33 per cent, above a relatively modest threshold). The justification usually offered for taxing capital gains at a lower rate than other income is that it is a simple method of allowing for inflation. This line of reasoning is regarded by most economists as unsound, but by almost everyone else as unanswerable. It is one of the few strengths of New Zealand’s current tax treatment of capital gains that, in the circumstances in which they are taxed, they are taxed at the same rate as the taxpayer’s other income – that is, usually, 33 per cent (or 28 per cent in the case of companies); but it is unlikely that a general CGT would be imposed at 33 per cent. In contrast, it would seem to be both politically and technically feasible to introduce the two specific CGTs proposed here and to charge them at the same rates as the income tax. Similarly, an annual land tax could be set at a level that would result in approximately the same burden as the income tax, thus effectively redressing both 7 the inequity and the inefficiency of the current system. This is explained further below. 29. Secondly, the apparently universal experience of other countries is that CGTs are highly complex, so they entail much higher administration and compliance costs (per dollar of tax collected) than taxes on ordinary income. One reason for this seems to be that, in the nature of things, ordinary income tends to relatively regular, so administration and compliance are more or less routine. Capital gains, in contrast, are by their nature spasmodic and large. Consequently, the sale of a capital asset commonly gives rise to one-off difficulties and a powerful incentive to escape or minimise liability. There are also particular difficulties in calculating liability in the case of sales of shares in unlisted companies and interests in unincorporated businesses, and in the case of sales of land where improvements have been effected gradually over a period of years. 30. Thirdly, taxing a capital gain made on the sale of an asset situated in New Zealand is relatively straightforward where the seller is resident in New Zealand; but where the seller is not resident in New Zealand, it is often difficult and commonly impossible. For example, a non-resident might use a company incorporated in a country other than New Zealand to buy an asset (land or shares or almost any other kind of asset); and then, instead of selling the asset, he might sell the shares in the company (and so effectively transfer control of the asset to whoever buys the shares). If the tax were to be imposed on gains made on the sale of assets (which is the principal basis upon which most CGTs operate), no liability would arise. It is possible to legislate against such devices, but doing so is complex and inevitably only partially effective. Consequently, any CGT is likely to operate in practice as a tax on capital gains made by New Zealand residents; gains made on the disposal by foreigners of assets situated in New Zealand are likely to escape the tax. It is likely, too, that affluent and sophisticated New Zealand residents would be able to escape liability by entering into arrangements with non-residents. All this would be unsatisfactory in principle and presumably politically problematic. 31. Fourthly, the yield of a CGT is likely to be low, volatile and unpredictable. In itself that is a minor problem, given that the principal aims of a CGT would presumably be not to raise revenue but to correct inequity and inefficiency. (If the government were to introduce a CGT with the aim of substantially increasing revenue, it would probably be disappointed.) But even so, all else being equal, a reliable revenue stream would be an advantage. A land tax that exempted the family home should not produce any more revenue than a CGT (the land tax should be set at a rate calculated to produce roughly the same revenue as would be produced by a CGT); but what revenue it did produce would be stable and predictable. 32. Fifthly, it appears that the New Zealand economy differs from most points of comparison (for example, the Australian, British and US economies) in that (a) land constitutes a larger proportion of the New Zealand economy and (b) there are relatively more small landlords in New Zealand. For this reason, the compliance and administration burden (and probably also the political cost) of a general CGT would be higher in New Zealand than elsewhere. Taxing Capital Gains Made on Sales of Listed Securities 33. Although CGTs are generally complicated, there is one category of capital gain that could be taxed quite simply: namely, gains made on disposals of listed shares and 8 other listed securities. That could be done by extending the definition of income (as provided for by the income tax legislation) to include such gains. Alternatively, it would be feasible to tax such gains on an accruals basis, though doing so would probably be more trouble than it would be worth. 34. It might be said that if capital gains made on the sale of listed securities are to be taxed, then all capital gains should be taxed; or, alternatively, that, if capital gains are generally not taxed, there is no reason for taxing capital gains made on the sale of listed securities. There are, however, strong reasons for singling out gains made on the disposal of listed securities for particular treatment. First, taxing such gains would be simple. Almost all of the complications from which existing CGTs suffer are due to rules dealing with other sorts of property – in particular, shares in unlisted companies, unincorporated businesses and land. Secondly, an important reason for not taxing gains made on sales of shares in unlisted companies (and sales of interests in unincorporated businesses) is that such an exemption can be justified as encouraging entrepreneurialism and small businesses. But that rationale obviously does not apply to listed securities. 35. If gains made on sales of listed securities were to be taxed, it would be appropriate for that to be subject to a de minimis exemption. The reason is that most New Zealand residents (including many of those who own shares in listed companies) are not currently obliged to file a tax return (because all the tax for which they are liable, including the tax on dividends, is collected by means of withholding); and to require persons making a small gain on the sale of shares to file one would entail a heavy burden in terms of compliance and administration. Taxing Capital Gains Made by Companies 36. Similarly, taxing capital gains made by companies would be advantageous in principle (on the basis that capital gains ought generally to be taxed, unless there is some compelling reason not to tax them) and relatively straightforward in practice. Again, it would be feasible to tax such gains on an accruals basis, though, again, doing so would probably be more trouble than it would be worth. The Working Group’s More Specific Questions about Capital Gains Tax 37. In addition to asking the general question (Should New Zealand introduce a CGT and, if so, how should it work?), the Working Group asked a series of more specific questions about the design of a CGT (at page 55). These questions closely resemble those that Professor Elliffe and I put to the experts contributing to our recent book on CGTs (cited above). Consequently the book contains much information as to how other countries have answered more or less the same questions; and it can therefore be read as a guide on how to structure a CGT. The answers to the questions also seem to show, however, that a general CGT would be inescapably problematic – so the book can also be read as an account of the reasons for not introducing such a tax (and for introducing specific CGTs instead, as proposed above). In any event, the answers to the questions are as follows. 38. Separate Tax or Part of Income Tax? If the government were to introduce a CGT at all, it should be part of the income tax rather than a separate tax. The reason is that whichever form the tax takes, it would have to operate in conjunction with the income tax and that would be less troublesome if it were part of the income tax. 9 This is, however, ultimately a matter of mere labelling, rather than substance, and unimportant. 39. Realisation or Accruals? If the government were to introduce a general CGT, it should be based on realisation rather than accruals. The reason is that, whatever the conceptual attractions of an accruals-based tax, the practical difficulties would outweigh them. In particular, an accruals-based CGT would present heavy administrative and compliance burdens in the case of (a) small landlords, (b) shares in unlisted companies, and (c) interests in unincorporated businesses. 40. That said, it is necessary to add (a) that an accruals-based tax on gains on listed securities would be feasible; (b) an accruals-based tax on gains made by companies would probably be feasible; and (c) an annual land tax would operate as a very approximate proxy for an accruals-based CGT. In other words, the approach recommended here could be implemented in such a manner as to operate in effect as an accruals-based CGT – that is, no general CGT but an accruals-based CGT on gains made by companies and on gains made on listed securities, plus a land tax. 41. Death? If the government were to introduce a CGT, the best course would be for death to be treated as a disposal of the deceased’s assets at market value. Alternatively, liability could be postponed until the person inheriting disposed of the asset (but using the deceased’s basis to calculate liability). The US approach (simply exempting assets held at death from the tax) is obviously unsound in principle and highly problematic in practice. 42. Relationship Property? Conversely, in the case of a relationship property settlement, liability should be deferred until the asset is disposed of by the person taking it under the settlement. The difference is that death is usually a relatively convenient time to pay a tax; divorce etc is not. 43. Scope? The Working Group asks, if the government were to introduce a CGT, “\[s\]hould it cover just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars?” This question is curiously worded. New Zealanders commonly use the term “rental property” to mean residential property, but a general CGT would also ordinarily cover other sorts of real estate (commercial, industrial, retail, agricultural, horticultural, etc), whether rented out or not, and also holiday homes. Equally, whilst such a tax would ordinarily cover shares, it would also cover securities other than shares (debt instruments, derivatives, etc) and interests in unincorporated businesses. It would also cover collectibles. It is also usual and necessary for a CGT to incorporate provisions precluding taxpayers from using losses suffered on private use assets such as yachts and cars, which generally fall in value. 44. Savings Schemes? Consistency with the “broad based low rate” principle would require that savings schemes should be taxed, but an exemption might be desirable as an incentive to saving. 45. Double Tax? It would be obviously inappropriate to subject any particular gain to both income tax and CGT. Therefore, gains subject to income tax should be exempt from CGT. Dividends and capital gains made on shares are both forms of income; both should therefore, in principle, be taxed (subject to a preference for unlisted shares, as a means of supporting small businesses). There is no reason, therefore, why the introduction of a CGT should entail any change to the current imputation system. The introduction of a CGT might, however, require an adjustment to the FDR rules, so as to preclude double taxation. 10 46. Non-Residents? In principle, the jurisdictional scope of a CGT should be the same as that of the income tax – that is, residence and source, supplemented by CFC/FIF rules. In practice, taxation of non-residents would prove problematic (which is one of the reasons for not introducing a general CGT). 47. Losses? It would presumably be necessary to ring-fence capital losses, especially if the CGT were to be imposed at any rate less than the maximum rate of income tax and perhaps in any event. 48. Roll-Over Relief? If a general CGT were to be introduced, it would be highly problematic not to incorporate in it some form of roll-over relief (as illustrated by the Working Group’s example of a farmer selling a farm and buying another). But other countries’ experiences indicate that roll-over preferences tend to be excessively complex, inequitable and subject to abuse. The problems are so severe that they constitute one of the reasons for not introducing a CGT, but, instead, taxing specific classes of capital gains (gains made by companies and gains made on listed securities), and introducing a land tax. 49. Death, Emigration, Immigration? As indicated above, death should be treated as a taxable event, and likewise emigration. Similarly, immigration should be treated as establishing a basis where appropriate (in particular, in respect of assets situated outside New Zealand). 50. Gifts and Gambling? Similarly, it is obvious that gifts should be treated as a sale at market value (though perhaps with liability deferred until disposal by the donee). Not to have such a rule would leave the tax open to avoidance on a very large scale. It seems likely that the government is already deriving as much revenue as it can from some forms of gambling (for example, the TAB). To the extent that gambling winnings made by persons resident in New Zealand are not already subject to some appropriate tax, they should be subject to income tax (not CGT). Gamblers should not, however, be permitted to set off their losses against other forms of income. 51. Rate of Tax and Inflation? As indicated above, setting the rate (or rates) of a CGT is a conundrum. If the rate is set at anything less than the maximum rate of income tax, the CGT will fail to achieve its objectives of equity and efficiency. In particular, taxpayers would still be strongly incentivised to adopt arrangements designed to produce capital gains (taxable at a lower rate) rather than income (taxable at a higher rate). On the other hand, it is very widely believed that to charge the tax at the same rate as income tax would be grossly inequitable, unless some allowance is made for inflation. But no one has yet devised a satisfactory method of indexing a CGT for inflation. Again, this problem is one of the reasons it would be better not to introduce a general CGT but instead to tax certain classes of capital gains (those made by companies and on listed securities), and to introduce a land tax. 52. If a general CGT were to be introduced, however, a flat rate of about half the maximum rate of income tax might be the least problematic option – for example, 15 per cent. It would probably also be desirable to distinguish between short-term capital gains (taxable at the same rate or rates as ordinary income) and long-term capital gains (taxable at some lower rate, such as 15 per cent). Various countries do that; and they usually define “short-term capital gain” as meaning a capital gain made on the sale of a capital asset within 12 months of its acquisition. That seems, however, an unnecessarily narrow definition; it might be better (more equitable, 11 more efficient and less susceptible to abuse) to define “short-term capital gain” by reference to some longer period, such as five years rather than one. 53. It is unlikely that the government will find it politically palatable to impose a general CGT (other than on short-term capital gains) at the same rate as income tax. Rather, it would probably charge the tax at some lower rate. That in itself would constitute adequate allowance for inflation. The experience of other countries seems to be that there is no satisfactory method of indexing a CGT to actual inflation rates. 54. De Minimis? It might be advantageous to incorporate a de minimus rule in respect of both (a) small capital gains of all kinds made by non-filing taxpayers and (b) small capital gains made on collectibles by all taxpayers (that is, both filing and non-filing), other than companies. 55. Administration? The administrative and compliance costs of a general CGT would be substantial and, again, one of the reasons it would be better not to introduce such a tax. As alluded to above, the administrative and compliance burdens would probably be greater, proportionately, in New Zealand than elsewhere. 56. Transition? As regards the transitional arrangements on the introduction of a CGT, it is obvious that a general CGT should apply to all assets within the scope of the tax, whenever acquired; and it is also obvious that, in the case of assets held on the day the tax is introduced, the basis should be the value of the asset on that day. That is, the taxpayer should pay tax on the basis of the proceeds realised on disposal of the asset, less either (a) the cost of the asset (if it was acquired after the tax was introduced) or (b) the value of the asset on the day the tax was introduced (if the taxpayer acquired the asset before that day). Other relevant expenditure should be deductible also (for example, the cost of improvements). 57. The so-called Australian rule (that gains made on assets held on the day the tax was introduced are exempt, irrespective of when they are realised) is inequitable, inefficient (because persons holding such assets tend to retain them until they die) and complicated (because of difficulties caused by improvements made to such assets; and because of problems presented by schemes involving assets held by companies). The rule is, however, a good example of how the political process tends to produce seriously flawed CGTs. 58. Trusts? If the government were to introduce a general CGT, it should treat trustees in the same manner as other taxpayers – that is, disposals of capital assets by trustees (including disposals to beneficiaries) should be treated as a taxable event. It might also be necessary to enact rules dealing with the use of trusts to escape liability. Conceptual Elegance versus Practicality 59. Some years ago, Chye-Ching Huang (a graduate of the Auckland University Law School and Columbia Law School, now working at a tax-oriented think-tank in Washington DC) and Professor Elliffe published an article arguing that the New Zealand government should introduce a general CGT unless it could be shown either (a) that there was something distinctive about the New Zealand economy (in which case the reasons CGTs were introduced in other countries might not apply in this one) or (b) that the countries that have introduced CGTs have all made a mistake: see Chye-Ching Huang and Craig Elliffe “Is New Zealand Smarter than Other Countries or Simply Special? Reconsidering a Realisation-based Capital 12 Gains Tax in the Light of South Africa’s Experience” (2010) 16 New Zealand Journal of Taxation Law and Policy 269-305. 60. The answer to the question posed in the title to their article is, “Both”. That is, first, New Zealand is “special” or, at least, different, in that (a) land plays a larger role in the economy than in some other countries; and (b) there is a larger number, proportionately, of small landlords than in some other countries; and (c) the stock market plays a smaller role in the economy than in some other countries; and (d) there is perhaps a stronger case in New Zealand than elsewhere for incentivising entrepreneurialism. 61. Secondly, it may be that the governments of other countries were seduced by the conceptual elegance of the Haig-Simons concept of income; and that they failed to fully appreciate the difficulties that would arise in connection with their attempts to tax capital gains made on (a) unlisted securities, (b) interests in unincorporated businesses and (c) houses; and that they failed also to appreciate the difficulties and complexities that would result from the interactions between (a) their attempts to tax capital gains of these kinds and (b) their desire to provide for roll-over relief and incentives for small businesses and (c) political pressures and compromises. 62. In conclusion, the supposed elegance of general CGTs based on the Haig-Simons model has in most countries turned out to be largely illusory – mainly because of the difficulties encountered in connection with family businesses (both incorporated and unincorporated), farms and houses. The approach suggested here – specific CGTs on capital gains made by companies and on gains made on listed securities, plus a land tax – might be less conceptually appealing; but it would be much simpler and it would ultimately achieve much the same result. It would also have the advantage that the two specific CGTs could be charged on an accruals basis; and the land tax would similarly be charged annually. QUESTION 3 Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 63. For the reasons outlined above, a general CGT, although probably better than nothing, would be problematic. A land tax (together with specific CGTs, as outlined above) would be better. It would, if correctly designed and set at an appropriate rate, largely eliminate both the inequity and the inefficiency of the current system. It would also be straightforward and inexpensive to administer; it would be inexpensive for taxpayers to comply with it; and it would be difficult to avoid or evade. The simplest way for such a tax to work would be for the central government to impose a tax on top of local government rates, using the same valuations as are used for rates, but exempting “the family home”. That is, the tax would be imposed on all owners of land and buildings, but every family would be entitled to an exemption in respect of its “family home”. In other words, the family home would be exempt but the tax would otherwise be payable on real estate of all kinds (residential, commercial, industrial, retail, agricultural, horticultural, etc) and also on holiday homes (except where the holiday home was the owner’s only home). It might also be appropriate to exempt Māori land, or some classes of Māori land. 13 64. One of the disadvantages of a general CGT is that it would require both (a) the keeping and verifying of records over very long periods of time and (b) the undertaking of retrospective valuations of assets, in some circumstances long after the event. A land tax would present no such difficulties, because it would be based simply on current valuations (which are maintained already, for local body rating purposes). The Rate of Tax 65. At what rate, then, should a land tax be charged? That is a difficult question, but the objective should be to set the tax at a rate that would neither advantage nor disadvantage investment in real estate. For example, an appropriate rate might be 0.25 per cent. Thus, the tax on a house worth $1 million (including the land on which it was built) would be $2,500 per year. That might seem too low, especially in light of the very large capital gains made on residential real estate in the last few years. But the land tax would be payable every year; it would be payable in addition to the income tax imposed on the rental income (if any) derived from the land; and it would be payable even if both (a) the property market was flat or in recession (in either of which cases the owner would not be accruing any capital gain) and (b) the owner was operating the property at a loss (because of interest deductions). 66. It is possible that the introduction of a land tax, even at a low-seeming rate such as 0.25 per cent, would cause a substantial fall in the property market. In other words, it is possible that a large part, or even the whole, of the burden of the tax would in effect be borne by those owning property at the date the tax comes into force. For this reason, it is possible that it would be preferable to introduce such a tax by degrees – that is, to introduce it at a very low rate (say 0.1 per cent) and to raise the rate gradually over time. 67. It would be possible to provide either for the land tax (if one were to be introduced) to be deductible for income tax purposes or not deductible. If it were to be deductible, it should be charged at a higher rate so that, in either case, the burden would be roughly the same as would result from taxing the capital gain. Farming and Horticulture 68. It is possible that the objective (neither advantaging nor disadvantaging investment in land) would be best achieved by providing for different rates of tax for different kinds of land. In particular, the appropriate rate for commercial, industrial and residential land might be unduly burdensome for agricultural and horticultural land, in which case such land should be taxed at some lower rate. The objective, however, should remain the same – that is, investment in farmland should be neither advantaged nor disadvantaged, as against other forms of investment and income. 69. It is possible also that some farmers would object vehemently to a land tax at any sensible rate. One solution to that problem would be for the law to give them a choice: either pay the land tax, or pay income tax on the gain made on sale. Māori Land 70. Imposing a tax on Māori land would seem to be both problematic as a matter of policy and technically difficult. The best solution might be simply to exempt Māori land (or some classes of Māori land) from the tax. 14 QUESTION 4 What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? 71. There are two main opportunities for effective environmental taxation in New Zealand, namely (a) a tax on emissions and (b) a tax on cars (but with an exemption for small cars). Taxing Emissions 72. It seems reasonably plain that emissions trading schemes, including the one currently in force in this country, are ineffective and susceptible to abuse. It is probable, therefore, that a better approach would be to tax emissions, including those produced by farming. It is crucial, however, that, if an emissions tax were to be introduced, it should exempt exports because (a) in principle the tax should be borne by consumers, not producers and (b) to tax exports would be to impose a competitive disadvantage on the New Zealand economy. An emissions tax would, therefore, have to incorporate some kind of border adjustment mechanism. It is currently unclear how such a mechanism might best work; further research is therefore required. Taxing Cars 73. A large part of New Zealand’s contribution to climate change comes from motor vehicles, particularly cars. The best way to mitigate this problem would be to tax them heavily. Given, however, the parlous state of public transport in most parts of the country, a car is for most families a practical necessity. A heavy, general tax on cars would therefore be unacceptably regressive. Many people, however, have cars which are much larger and which use far more fuel than necessity requires. The appropriate course, therefore, would be to impose a heavy tax on cars, but subject to an exemption for electric cars and cars that use relatively little petrol or diesel. 74. Various other jurisdictions, such as Singapore and Hong Kong, have used taxes of this sort with considerable success. They persuade many people to buy small, fuel- efficient cars, and they derive a more appropriate level of revenue from those who are prepared to pay the tax to drive large, inefficient vehicles. QUESTION 5 Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? 75. It is arguable that the profits of small businesses should be taxed less heavily than other forms of income, so as to encourage entrepreneurialism. The existing tax system already taxes small business less heavily than salaries and wages, in that there is no general CGT. Consequently, if an entrepreneur builds up a business and then sells it, the gain is usually tax-free. If a general CGT were to be introduced, that would no longer be the case – assuming the CGT would be so structured as to catch such gains (some CGTs provide for relief in such circumstances). But if the government were to take the approach proposed here (introducing specific CGTs on gains made by companies and gains made on listed securities, plus a land tax, rather than a general CGT), capital gains realised on the sale of a business would 15 remain generally untaxed, as under the current system – which is another reason why the approach proposed would be better than a general CGT. This system would in itself provide sufficient support for small businesses, so nothing further (such as a progressive company tax) would be needed. 76. To this it might be added that the tax on small businesses is, in effect, progressive already, because a company carrying on a small business usually employs some of the members of the family that owns it; the company is entitled to deduct the salaries and wages paid; and the salaries and wages are taxed at progressive rates. Consequently, for practical purposes, the existing system in most cases already taxes the profits of small businesses at the same progressive rates as are applied to other forms of income (such as salaries and wages). 77. Moreover, the profits of small businesses are already in effect taxed less heavily than salaries and wages, in that (a) the current law does not permit the deduction of expenditure incurred in connection with employment income, and (b) the tax treatment of perks under the present system is not watertight. That is, the owners of family companies and other small business are often able, quite legitimately, to deduct the cost of expenditure on items conferring an element of personal benefit, without giving rise to any liability to personal income tax or fringe benefit tax. Wage and salary earners do not have that advantage. QUESTION 6 Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? 78. It would be a serious mistake to exclude any goods or services from GST (other than those already excluded). The reason is that New Zealand’s GST is currently the best value-added tax in the world; and what makes it better than any of the others is precisely that it currently has very few exclusions. Any added exclusions would make it a worse tax than it currently is because (a) they would fail to achieve their intended objectives and (b) they would introduce a wholly disproportionate degree of complexity to the legislation and to the administration of the tax; and (c) they would incentivise a range of undesirable behaviours on the part of suppliers of goods and services. 79. Most other countries’ value-added taxes have what might be called “policy-driven” preferences. For example, they have exclusions for basic foodstuffs, basic medical treatments and basic educational goods and services. The New Zealand GST system, in contrast, has no such exclusions. Rather, the only exclusions in the New Zealand system are there for purely technical reasons. In particular, residential rent and financial services are exempt. The reason for these exemptions, however, is not to give preferential treatment to housing or financial services. Rather, the only reason for them is that it would be technically difficult to tax them. 80. It is appalling that many people in New Zealand cannot afford to eat healthily, to obtain basic medical services and to educate their children properly; and it may well be that the government should take steps to address such problems. It does not follow, however, that excluding goods and services of these kinds from GST would be desirable. There are four main reasons. 16 81. First, excluding these goods and services from GST would make only a small difference to their affordability, so would be unlikely to solve the problem. 82. Secondly, the largest savings in tax would go not to those who cannot afford the goods and services in question, but to those who spend most on them. In other words, such preferences would mainly go to people broadly classifiable as upper middle class or rich. 83. Thirdly, even if it were to be accepted that it would be desirable to in principle to provide preferential treatment for certain classes of goods or services from GST, it would be difficult to define the scope of the preference. For instance, it has been suggested that fresh fruit and vegetables should be excluded from GST. It appears, however, that frozen and canned vegetables are at least as nutritious as fresh ones, and typically cheaper. Thus, the call for a tax preference for fresh fruit and vegetables seems less like a policy aimed at helping the poor and more like a subsidy for the middle class and the rich, who mostly prefer fresh vegetables to canned and frozen ones. 84. Fourthly, excluding specified classes of goods and services from GST would encourage gaming of the system by some suppliers of goods and services. For example, the GST system could be modified so as to exempt (or zero-rate) supplies of bread, whilst still taxing supplies of cake. The consequences would likely include that manufacturers of some border-line products (croissants, brioche, etc) would modify their recipes, so as to have them classified as bread (and thus escape the tax). See, for example, Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Procter & Gamble \[2009\] EWCA 407, in which the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that pringles (a kind of synthetic potato chip) were not entitled to a VAT preference intended for basic foodstuffs. 85. If the government were to decide to take steps to ameliorate the unaffordability of certain classes of goods and services (such as basic foodstuffs, basic medical goods and services and basic educational goods and services), it would be much better for that to be done by means of a subsidy, rather than by excluding such goods and services from GST. The reason is that it would be both cheaper and more effective. 86. It is widely thought that granting a tax concession (such as excluding fresh fruit and vegetables from GST) would cost the government less than a subsidy. This is, however, incorrect. The reason is that a subsidy could be directed to those who need it – that is, people whose incomes are too small to allow them to feed themselves adequately. That could be done by any measure that would raise small incomes generally or by more specific measures, such as, for example, issuing vouchers redeemable for vegetables. The benefit of a GST preference, conversely, would be unavoidably available to everyone, and would mostly go to people who did not need it. Moreover, if the government were to subsidise vegetables for people on small incomes, it could control the amount of its spending, whereas the revenue loss resulting from a GST preference would be beyond the government’s control. 87. It might be said that for the government to give vegetable vouchers to poor people is unduly paternalistic; and that poor people, like everyone else, should be allowed to spend their money on whatever they like. There is much force in this argument, but to issue vouchers for vegetables is no more paternalistic than to grant a GST exclusion. 17 88. It is possible that GST is regressive (though the question seems to be under- researched; it is also possible that the non-taxation of residential rent and interest substantially mitigate the tax’s regressive effect). But even if it is regressive, it would be a mistake to attempt to solve that problem by means of exemptions. A better solution would be to accept that GST is regressive and to increase the overall progressivity of the tax system by reducing the income tax burden on small incomes (and, if necessary, raising transfers). That way, although GST would remain regressive, the overall progressivity of the tax (and transfer) system could be set at whatever level the government thought appropriate. SUGARY DRINKS TAX 89. The Working Group has asked whether the tax system should be used to encourage desirable behaviours or discourage undesirable ones. The answer is that it should. In particular, it would be advantageous to tax sugary drinks (so as to discourage their consumption), both as a health measure and to reduce the extent to which consumers of excessive quantities of such drinks impose a burden, through the publicly funded health system, on other taxpayers: see generally Michael Littlewood “Taxing sugary drinks” 2016(11) New Zealand Law Journal, 422-424. There are four main arguments against such a tax but none of them is sound. The four arguments and the flaws in them are as follows. 90. The first argument is that a tax on sugary drinks would constitute an inappropriate interference with individual freedom of choice. In other words, people should be free to make their own choices, without the state acting as nanny. But we already have a nanny state and no one sensible suggests that the state should stop nannying us. For example, we have a law banning you from riding a motorcycle without a helmet; a law requiring you to wear a seatbelt in a car; and laws requiring you to wear various kinds of protective clothing in various kinds of dangerous workplace. These are nanny-state laws, but very few people seem to think it would be a good idea to repeal them. The real question, then, is, not whether the state should act as a nanny, but when (that is, according to what criteria?) and how (that is, by what means?). 91. The answer to the first question (when should the state intervene?) is that the state, in determining whether to protect us from ourselves, should consider two criteria. First, how harmful is the product or activity to the person who uses it? Second, how expensive are the consequences of the product or activity for the rest of us? For example, the taxes on liquor and tobacco can be justified on the basis that these products are harmful to those who use them; and that the revenues generated by the taxes go some way towards meeting the costs of medical care borne by the state (and, perhaps, other expenses). Similarly, the requirement that you use a helmet and a safety belt are justified on the basis that not using a helmet and a safety belt is dangerous for the individual and expensive for the state. The answer to the second question (if intervention is called for, should it come in the form of a tax or some other measure?) is that the intervention should take whatever form is most likely to work and to produce least undesirable side-effects. 92. Judging by these criteria, a tax on sugary drinks is easy to justify. First, the harm to the individual resulting from excessive consumption of sugary drinks seems comparable to the harm resulting from excessive consumption of liquor or tobacco. 18 Secondly, the cost to the taxpayer attributable to excessive consumption of sugary drinks is also comparable to the cost attributable to excessive consumption of liquor or tobacco. In fact, the cost of sugary drinks seems to be greater than the cost of liquor or tobacco. 93. The second argument against a tax on sugary drinks is that it would fail to achieve its objective. It might be the case that some other countries’ sugary drinks taxes have had little effect but, if so, that is because they have not been charged at a high enough rate. An appropriate rate might be, for example, a dollar per litre (on drinks containing more than a threshold quantity of sugar per litre). 94. The third argument against a tax on sugary drinks is that it would be inappropriately regressive. But that is not so, because the tax would incentivise manufacturers to produce a wider range of drinks containing other (untaxed) sweeteners (which, according to most medical opinion, are less hazardous to health than sugar). In fact, some manufacturers already produce such drinks (for various reasons, including the possible introduction of a tax). Consequently, the tax would be effectively optional: anyone not wanting to pay could avoid doing so by buying drinks sweetened with ingredients other than sugar. 95. The fourth argument is the blanket assertion that taxes should not be used to encourage desirable behaviours or to discourage undesirable ones; and that the government, if it wishes to encourage or discourage, should uses means other than taxes – such as education or regulation. This however is not really an argument but an ideology; whether a tax should be used as an incentive or a disincentive in any particular case should be assessed by reference to factors relevant to that case, not by mere assertion. \*\*\*\*\*\*\* 10 July 2018

Email address I would be happy to discuss this policy suggestion Po licy Suggestion A once a year $100 tax be placed on all tourists who visit New Zealand, other than Pacifica people who in recognition of their relationship to New Zealand should be charged a nominal sum or nothing. The revenue of approximately $400 million dollars 1 should go to environmental protection of the very attributes that attracts tourist to New Zealand and which they currently pay very little for. So extra funding for Department of Conservation and strong tax reduction incentives such as for farmers and others to clean up water ways. Benefits This policy would overcome the current free-riding on the New Zealand Tax system by tourists. Natural attractions such as our clean air, open spaces, mountains and wildlife reserves generally do not or cannot be charged for. In other countries major attractions that are tourists draw cards are charged for. For example, the Tower of London charges £22.35 and the Eiffel Tower €25. The tax would be small in comparison to the average expenditure by a tourist of $3,190 2 in New Zealand or $4690 if $1500 is added for a return fare. The net effect on tourist numbers would be easily made up by promotion as the broadly accepted Demand/Price elasticity rate of -0.7 3 would lead to a reduction of only 1.1% in tourist numbers. The extent of free-riding is seen in the small contribution that tourists make via GST of $1.66 Billion (on estimated Tourist Expenditure per Year of $12.7 Billion) of 2.2% of the total tax revenue for New Zealand 4 . For their small contribution tourists get many benefits paid for by New Zealand residents: A clean and non-polluted safe environment care of the Police and other Government agencies, ACC coverage for accidents, helicopter services etc. And of course, the physical environment we support via taxes through agencies such as the Department of Conservation as well as policies adopted over the years which also have a cost e.g. control of the Lake Manapouri water levels. The extra income would be used to preserve and develop the very environment attributes tourist come to see: clean air and water, native forests, rare and endangered species of both flora and fauna. Money could be applied to accelerating research into biological controls of pest species, reforestation with native flora, additional physical control programmes of pest species etc. It could also be used for accelerated subsidies and tax benefits for individuals and companies environmental projects. Policy Implications This recommendation is in line with one of the “Specific challenges” listed (Page 7) in the Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper, namely; “Is there a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base?” 1 International tourism forecasts, 2017 – 2023, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 2 Key Tourism Statistics, Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 3 Price Elasticities in International Tourism, Geoffrey I.

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 27 April 2018 Submission on Tax Working Group Questions The future environment: What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? How the Govt gets money or credit to trade or pay for governance costs needs to change - primarily the Govt needs to reduce the tax take. Taxes (including all the capital sourced via whatever terms are used such as levy, tax, duty, GST, Council fees and rates; and in some instances - fines) are disproportionately gathered from the lowest and middle-class groups in society relative to their income. One of the biggest risks are special interest groups trying to co-opt the tax system to serve their ideological agenda, for example, public health academics, environmental lobbyists, and poverty lobbyists. The Government needs to reduce their expenditure by reducing the amount of services and projects they are running and funding. How to reduce cost: 1) reduce fraud, corruption and misspending within and by Government and Crown agencies. For example, Universities currently spend millions of dollars on legal fees and settlements in their fights against staff. This is just one example of an enormous misuse of taxpayer dollars in just one Crown sector. 2) prevent loss through tax avoidance. New technology could be required to be used to ensure that less and less transactions are cash based and that business transactions are ‘processed’. There would be huge implications for New Zealand businesses and most likely widespread voluntary closure and failure of small cash businesses if they actually had to pay tax on their real income. Tax returns from cash businesses should be subject to heavier requirements for auditing to prevent personal (food, clothing and accommodation) expenses of the owners being run through the business. Along the same lines, Local Councils need to put more energy into monitoring unconsented building and ensuring consent and inspection fees are collected. Unconsented building work is contributing to the inflation in housing costs, as these ‘flippers’ are able to renovate below actual cost at a faster pace, resulting in a greater profit and advantaging them as buyers in the housing market. The Council fees would be able to be reduced across the board if home renovators/flippers and developers were all paying the fees. This would help reduce the cost of housing. I once put in an official information request to the Auckland City for an account of unconsented building works. I never got a written response. I got a phone call saying it was too hard to pull the figures together and that they were overwhelmed and under-funded – they couldn’t follow up on all the complaints. Don’t increase taxes – this will hurt honest law-abiding tax-paying people and their businesses. Do more to reduce tax avoidance and tax fraud. The business environment and economic growth will be all the better for the removal of dishonest and corrupt dealers. \[1\] 2 3) reduce the size of Parliament and the size and number of Government agencies. New Zealand is a small highly advanced nation. The political system needs to be reviewed, partly because it enables representatives of the people to make spending and funding decisions about matters they have no knowledge or experience of. The analysis and recommendations of qualified independent bipartisan experts should hold more weight in the policy analysis process. Politicians treat taxpayers’ money as if it is their personal pocket money to spend on travelling around the world, funding their pet causes and charities. The NZ Government should be reduced to governing essentials. The Government currently wastes millions of dollars funding services that underperform or are just wholly ineffective. A perfect example, is The Quit Group – established as a charitable trust. When it lost its Ministry of Health contract for services, it had about $3 million ‘saved’ - $3 million held back from delivering on their contracts! The Ministry of Health did not take the money back even though the group was redundant! The four Board members were paying themselves collectively over $100,000 a year. The money should have been paid back to the Ministry of Health. An essential pillar of work conducted by Government funded public health workers is advocating and lobbying for an ever increasing allocation of funding. This is despite State Services laws that say that Government funded public servants are not to use taxpayers’ money to conduct “advocacy” – another ‘waste’ of tax that could be rerouted to cover essentials. Several taxes, implemented at the demand of public health, deserve to be reviewed due to the poor quality of the ‘evidence’ that was fed to politicians supporting these taxes and levy’s. Sugar tax is the latest example, but the perverse effects of excise tax on tobacco is now at high and unethical levels. Purposes and principles of a good tax system: Principles for assessment: What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Defining ‘fairness’: How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? The first principle of a good tax system should be Te Tiriti o Waitangi. How is every tax, regardless of what it’s called, honouring the articles of Te Tiriti o Waitangi, or in breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi? Fairness needs to be defined with Maori. A tax that disproportionately drains Maori individuals, families, landowners and business owners is breaching the Treaty of Waitangi. Programmes funded with taxpayers’ money that disproportionately deliver benefits and services to NZ European are breaching the Treaty of Waitangi. For example, as Marama Fox said, Maori do not benefit equitably from the current superannuation programme. There are many many similar examples across the health and welfare system. Tobacco tax is paid at a disproportionately higher rate by Maori than non-Maori. A ‘sugar tax’ would similarly disproportionately be taken from Maori. The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks: New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Govt needs to be more honest about the tax system, whatever it is. Currently, language and rhetoric is used to mislead and misdirect the public so that the majority think they understand what’s being taken from them and why, but the majority absolutely do not comprehend how much they pay in tax and why they should pay so much, nor why the rate is not equitably paid by different people across society. Every dollar amount taken by the Government or any Crown agency or organisation (educational facilities, Councils, hospitals) from an individual or business or other entity – should be clearly identified as a “tax”. For example, when buying tobacco, the receipt should show the portion 3 of the total that is excise tax, and the portion that is GST. Same with alcohol, petrol, healthcare bills, speeding fines etc. The current tax system is not “low” – compared to what? What is meant by “broad-based” – all documentation communicating about tax and purporting to be providing fair and accessible information to enable citizen opinion to be gathered, should be presented in lay language. Income tax, supposedly uses a threshold system. This isn’t applied consistently. For instance, I opened a bank account for my child to teach her about saving money. Many parents are encouraged to do this. Withholding tax on interest earned is automatically deducted by the bank and paid to inland revenue. There is no longer a system whereby I could put in a tax return for my child to get this tax back, despite that her ‘income’ fell well below the bottom threshold of earnings to attract tax. This is wrong! Adults can sell goods they create from a craft or hobby up to a certain amount each year without having to declare the income or pay tax on the goods. Yet a child is taxed on interest earned if put into a bank account!! Taxes and behaviour: Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? NO! The use of taxes to modify behaviour needs to be reviewed. It was based on Anglo-European social science theories that have since been found to be fundamentally flawed or simply unjust and unethical. Public health have gone way beyond their mandate to protect public health and there are several demands for taxes and programmes that have no robust scientific evidence that reduced harm to health will result. Sugar tax is one example. Tobacco tax is another. Matauranga Maori, that is, Maori knowledge has not been listened to or even invited to advise on this topic. The use of taxes to modify behaviour is at high risk of being used to further punish and marginalise stigmatised groups, and they are used to further ethnocide – for example, trying to stop Maori practising traditional protocols. Retirement savings: Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Improving financial literacy across the whole population would be a better option. This needs to start with the Government being honest about money and the way in which the economy currently runs. As above, call a tax, a tax! New Zealand citizens deserve to know how the Government and all its agencies (including Universities) is spending, and misspending, its hard-earned money. Stop taking so much money off people and maybe they’d be able to invest for their retirement. The current tax system creates and maintains a majority of citizens in a dependent state. Teach people how money works. Help people understand that borrowing more money than they have and more than they might ever earn is not necessarily smart. Help people hang on to more of their earnings by reducing theft and fraud and scams that rob people. Shut down Lotto. This is a Government run gambling service. This is not a legitimate and fair way to get money from people. Instead, teach people how to invest their savings safely and for best return, so that they accumulate more of it and potentially have more by the time they retire. I occasionally slip and buy a basic lotto package, which costs $16. If I did that weekly, that’s $832 a year! Without 4 adjustment for interest earned, or withholding taxes taken from it while it sits in the bank – an adult 18yrs buying a lotto ticket every week until they retire would have spent $39,104! Support people to give to charities. Increase the rebate on donations. This would help alleviate the pressure and demand on Government to fund non-essentials. Don’t tax benefits! It’s dishonest. Benefits are paid with taxpayers’ money. Giving a benefit paid from tax and then taxing it is the same as giving money over to help someone and then immediately taking some of it back. This feeds the dishonesty and confusion being perpetrated on the public. The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance: Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? No. See above. Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? The main inconsistencies are in how “cash businesses” are able to avoid declaring income and thus avoid paying tax. This is so widespread it is part of the New Zealand culture. I once was looking to buy a lunch bar. I went through an agent to identify a lunch bar to buy. Of the several that were on offer for sale, only one had an honest set of books to look at. I was told this was because of her religion. The other businesses apparently had no books they could show, or I was openly told, they had 2 sets of books. Part of the sale pitch was that these were “cash” businesses so the books don’t represent the true income. To add to the complexity of taxing ‘cash businesses’, a different sort from the above, are the fake cash businesses that are set-up to provide losses the owners can apply against other income. Auckland is flush with these fake businesses, like cafes or food shops, retail shops etc that do hardly any trade. The shops and cafes appear empty, or never seem to have customers, and they do not welcome customers. One café I went in to, appeared to be open, in that the lights were on, the doors were open and a worker was inside. I had previously been there once before and had been served so I thought they were for real. This time when I went in she claimed they were not open. Others barely turn their lights on. There should be an easy way for the public to assist inland revenue to identify these fake businesses, but I get the impression inland revenue doesn’t have the capacity or instruction to investigate these tax avoidance businesses. It is as if they are a Government sanctioned tax avoidance strategy. Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? The most important inconsistency to address is tax avoidance via the use of fake businesses set up to deliberately run at a loss. And secondly, to require greater use of technology to reduce cash transactions, and or, ensure all business transactions are ‘processed’. 5 As above – don’t introduce more tax. Reduce the amount of money taken from each person and the range of taxes, reduce tax avoidance and fraud, reduce the size and expenditure of Government – cut away non-essential services and encourage the public-private sector to fulfil more of the non- essential public’s needs. Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? As above. Plus, the costs of building and renovating, for honest people, is extraordinary because of enormous Government charges and taxes. To build a new house in Auckland, unless you are a huge property development business that negotiates Government discounts on fees (the taxes), can involve at least a $25,000 new dwelling fee (tax), Watercare charge $5000-$13,000 for a new account (another tax), the local Council charge separate fees (taxes) for a resource development application, building consent application, inspections and then the Code of Compliance certificate. There are further taxes taken at each step of progressing a new subdivision. What’s more other legislation makes sure this process is lengthy and neighbours are now withholding consent for developments until ‘paid’ (a bribe). Housing affordability is a complex problem that is not going to be solved by simplistic and flawed proposals, such as, “tax it”! My recommendations are as above: reduce fraud and tax avoidance. Reduce inequitable tax discounts that favour large developers. Reduce the size and expenditure of local Government. Cut local Government back to essential services. Local Government should not be duplicating health promotion that is currently funded through Vote Health. Place a moratorium on property rates rises. Rates (a tax), water charges and building insurance (usually because of the increased earthquake levy or other tax component) go up annually and these increases are passed on to tenants through rent rises. If the Government truly wanted to address rising rents – they would stop raising these taxes that cause rents to be increased. Perhaps, provide a rates rebate for homes rented to low income households? The Government should buy back control over electricity and water prices, and then reduce the profit margin. The cost of power and water is the same regardless of people’s ability to pay. Low income families have no option but to limit their power and water consumption, which increases risks to health. Capital gains tax & Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? 6 No! Any taxes applied to land and property has huge implications for Maori and must be discussed and resolved with Maori as promised in the Treaty of Waitangi. Too much land has been stolen from Maori already and a capital gains tax or a land tax has very high risk for being misused to continue the shift of resources from Maori to NZ European. There are so many ways that dishonest people can get around a false provision like excluding the family home. Honest people will be disadvantaged and any law or policy as proposed would encourage more illegal and fraudulent behaviour. Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Progressive company tax. Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods. Tax rebates and discounts should be offered for businesses and products, such as, solar energy products. At the moment it is uneconomic to retrofit residential housing with solar power technology, or with grey water tanks. It is also impossible to go off-grid in Auckland. For instance, we looked in to putting in a rain water tank instead of hooking up to Watercare (to avoid the huge new account tax). They said it is unavoidable – everyone has to have an account even if they collect their own water, if wastewater is going to run to the street. Do not add more taxes! Use differential taxes, to encourage a shift to proven environmentally better products and services, for instance via removing GST on some products; providing tax rebates for businesses that can show they are not just carbon neutral, but regenerative. Property developers, small and large, should be assisted via advantageous pricing to build residential and commercial homes and buildings that co-generate energy, e.g. via collecting power and feeding excess to the grid; by collecting rain water and reducing waste water. Work with industry to work on and build these solutions. Industry and social entrepreneurs are way ahead of academics and Government policy analysts in this area. Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue. Some life essentials should be exempt from GST: • fresh (raw, unprocessed) fruit and vegetables • unflavoured milk • residential electricity • residential water and wastewater • residential property rates • sanitary pads and tampons • water tank refills in areas without local Government supplied potable drinking water (yes there are 3 areas in New Zealand without town supplied safe water!) There is no need to increase tax on anything else to make up for this. People will spend the ‘saved’ money on other items so it won’t be lost. Collecting the tax lost through tax avoidance as detailed above will well and truly cover the removal of these unfair taxes and should enable eventually removal of GST altogether because it is disproportionately paid relative to income.

Page 1 of 3 Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax First name: Last name: Paul Kearns Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Submission: On the Future of Tax General remarks I support the Tax Working Group’s review seeking to identify a fairer tax system that positively impacts on the well-being of all New Zealanders, as I do not believe the current system which enables provision of publicly funded infrastructure establishment, maintenance, and/or services has been neutral, fair, or just. Currently with almost a complete absence of tax on capital, the primary beneficiaries are the wealthy who own capital assets. If capital gains tax is unpalatable politically then consideration should be made to tax transactions (including shares etc). There needs to be mechanism to support development of local and co-operative economies, by way of royalties from extraction/industry, tourism/infrastructure tax/ park fees etc. Risks, challenges and opportunities. Uberisation and ‘block-task’ work will further diminish collective and social consciousness. Sense of place and pace of change may fragment the sense of common good. While business, farming and industry benefit from infrastructure, they already do not appear to pay their fair share. Civil Defence/Community resilience, was valued by 98% in GDC Resident Survey Diversifying economy (visitor experience/venue, guest nights and other business), was 97% desired. This includes making most of tourism/provide infrastructure. Greymouth Port remains a tax burden on a tiny rating base. Just down the dock the ‘privately owned’ Westfleet Dock benefits from a thriving fishing industry (and non-unionised, seasonal workers on low wages and poor conditions). \[1\] Page 2 of 3 We have the arts, culture and heritage During New Zealand’s early Pakeha history, the Grey District was central to the economic and political development of the country. This rich heritage and the unique landscape provide a continuing source of inspiration to local artists. The heritage and the work of these artists should be accessible to both locals and visitors, and integrated into the urban landscape. Economic Development Strategy pg. 16 The Resource Management Act requires government to have regard to the recognition and protection of the heritage values of sites, buildings, places or areas. The protection of heritage is important not only for the current generations and as an attraction to visitors, but also for future generations. Earthquakes and cyclones have shown us how vulnerable our heritage is. Our tax system should support the retention of heritage. Where significant parts of a region’s landmass are locked up into public conservation lands (PCL) and protected for the benefit of all New Zealanders there must be some kind of benefit-transfer from government to that region to ensure the declining number of local ratepayers are not unduly burdened with infrastructure costs that also benefit the whole country (eg roads, water supply, communications, civil defence services) yet must meet needs over large distances where other economic and residential activities are not permitted, or are very limited. Our tax system should enable mechanisms for social investment in the sustainability and strategic benefits of cycling and tourism and to support appropriate planning for safe cycleways wherever they are needed. GDC 2017 Annual Plan adopted an increase to the Economic Development targeted rate (which applies to commercial properties and bed and breakfast/homestay operators) providing an additional $50,000 per annum. This appears unfair given the upsurge in accommodation provided by airBnB operations who currently do not contribute. Additional revenues (from bed night tax) could be targeted back to community projects). According to WCRC, water availability is coming under increased seasonal pressure due to extraction for irrigation in the upper Grey Valley. This may require further work to prioritise water allocation between water uses (such as pasture irrigation) and in-stream uses (such as fish habitat/aquatic ecology and other in-stream needs). We need to do the right thing to save the people from suffering. It’s a failure of policy, a failure of not having sufficient regard for the future and looking only at the immediacy of the next business opportunity. ‘User pays’ would seem to oblige the polluters to pay for contributory negligence. We must not let our natural resources (particularly water) be taken offshore without fair returns to New Zealand. The tax system is one tool that can more fairly support these wider social wellbeing measures, provided it is more universally and equitably applied. A taonga tax on water may support the necessary policies, rules, guidelines or other information to avoid, remedy or mitigate the adverse effects of land use activities and management practices on water quality. Page 3 of 3 That the Tax Working Group consider the long-term proposition benefits of a degree of energy self- sufficiency for new buildings, residential or otherwise, perhaps 20%, alongside energy savings from smart design and materials. They may consider appropriate (tax) reductions in any consent/building permit fees for installation of energy efficient recycled materials. I support purpose-driven collective businesses that grow the cooperative economy. Our tax system should complement, facilitate and encourage the values of the Maori economy with focus on intergenerational sustainability, diversification, and tikanga Māori values such as manaakitanga (the care of land and each other), whanaungatanga (wider kindship ties) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship and sustainability) drive business, investment and distribution decisions. I applaud the holistic approach taken to adopt The Living Standards Framework incorporating the four ‘capital stocks’ (financial and physical, human, social, and natural) and associated flows as a basis for public policy direction. This framework should be applied to all government decision- making. I support any reforms that drive more environmentally sustainable and accountable economic activity. Other changes I wish to see A review of all for-profit businesses that currently have Charitable Status. Many such multi- million dollar organisations (Sanitarium, Villa Maria etc) need to start contributing a fairer share of tax for the nation’s wellbeing. I support the revision of existing targeted tax rates on alcohol, and believe that rates of alcohol excise tax should more closely reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. That all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. I suggest government extends the targeted tax model by introducing a tax on sugary drinks and other high-sugar content products to act as a behaviour modifier. Poverty, sugary diets, poor oral hygiene have their impact across children and adults. Management of the alarming rise of pre- diabetes and current diabetes incidence already imposes significant costs on our publicly-funded health system. Future-focussed tax big system changes I want to see (a) A universal basic income (UBI) (b) A universal financial transactional tax (FTT) and thereby do away with income tax and the complex collection of GST; it would close existing taxation loopholes; and it would limit banks and financial traders who gain from the globalised economy but are still able to impose excessive costs on the New Zealand public who must use their services to transact their daily business. Thank you for the opportunity to put forward my views. I do not wish to appear before the committee in further support of my submission. • I acknowledge that my submission will be publicly released (with my email address withheld) and that I have noted that the Official Information Act and privacy considerations apply.

He is currently the pro bono Chair of the Simplicity Trust which “owns” the low fee, passively managed, not-for-profit KiwiSaver provider called Simplicity. He is also a former CEO of the Financial Services Council (FSC) the industry body for KiwiSaver and personal insurance providers. In 2013 while at the FSC he led the team that produced the report “The Tax Barrier to Retirement Prosperity in New Zealand” I would be interested in meeting with the TWG if that would assist with understanding the issues I raise and the proposed remedies. The Disclaimer The views expressed in this submission are my own and should not be read as representing the views of any other organisation. 2 1 Executive Summary This submission addresses the tax issues preventing low to middle income New Zealanders from achieving a comfortable retirement through long- term savings and recommends some practical and fairer solutions. Our current tax system encourages retirement savers to bid up the price of urban land suitable for housing, an existing asset. It also diverts capital flows away from investments that create new wealth, new jobs or could improve labour productivity by increasing the amount of capital used by each worker. What economists call capital deepening. It would be desirable to have a tax regime which helps lift wages rather than bidding up the price of land, which also makes us less competitive. Research reported on back in 2011, by the Savings Working Group revealed that taking reasonable assumptions some 90% of a KiwiSavers retirement nest egg would come from earnings within their KiwiSaver fund and only 10% from their initial contributions and the contributions made by their employer and the taxpayer. New Zealand is currently the OECD country with the most hostile tax environment for long-term savings in financial products earning compound returns (KiwiSaver, bank term deposits and standard annuities). These are the savings vehicles typically used by low and medium income earners in preparation for retirement. The tax penalty on long term savings arises from two drivers; Income tax inherently overtaxes the part of your income you save, because taxing income today, unlike an expenditure tax such as GST, taxes future consumption more than current consumption and, The impact of taxation is particularly severe when the subsequent earnings on those savings within your fund, from compound returns (interest on interest) occurs over a long period of time, such as the 40-45 years prior to your retirement. The tax imposed on KiwiSaver earnings within your fund, effectively halves the earnings that will be added to your nest egg over 40-45 years. The bias in tax treatment creates a huge wedge between the after-tax returns of compound interest products like KiwiSaver and those of investors in residential rental properties even when the pre-tax profitability is the same. The three drivers of the relative over-taxation of compounding interest financial products relative to residential rental investments are as follows; 3 • all interest income is taxed on a comprehensive economic income basis • interest income is taxed on an accrual rather than realisation basis • the part of nominal interest that is just compensation for inflation and so is a return of capital, rather than a return on capital is taxed as if it were income. For someone in the top 33% income tax bracket, the effective tax rate on residential rental property (with gearing being maintained as more rental properties are purchased), is close to 0% while the effective tax rate on KiwiSaver fund earnings is over 50% if you save for 30 years or more. For the well informed this is a powerful disincentive to invest in KiwiSaver above the level that will be matched by the employer’s contribution of 3%. It is a very strong incentive to invest in residential rental property where the effective tax rate could be only around 2% over a 20-year period. If you can gear your residential rental property to 100% the effective tax rate becomes negative. In effect other taxpayers subsidise your investment, the tax system pays you to make the investment. In most OECD countries as in New Zealand owner occupied homes are not subject to tax on the value of the imputed rentals (the tax on the income you don’t need to earn as you are not paying rent) so the equity you have in your home becomes in effect a tax-free bank account, but in contrast, • ownership of rental properties is not encouraged by their tax systems, capital gains are taxed at least on realisation if not as they accrue and rental income is treated as any other corporate income and any losses are not deductible against other, non-rental income, and • typically, in these countries for retirement savings, made through locked-in superannuation schemes you do not pay income tax on the contributions you make into your fund, inside the fund your earnings are not taxed but you do pay tax on the income you receive from your fund in retirement. This type of regime is called EET short for, your contributions into your fund, are Exempt from tax, inside the fund the earnings are Exempt from tax and the withdrawals are Taxed. This was the tax treatment for superannuation savings in New Zealand prior to 1989 and is in line with what optimal tax theory would recommend. The current regime in New Zealand is TTE, that is your contributions into KiwiSaver are out of already Taxed income, the income your contributions earn within the KiwiSaver fund itself, are Taxed but your withdrawals after age 65 are Exempt from income tax. 4 The existing tax regime has provided rental property investors with an almost costless option to buy access to future capital gains that are unlikely to be ever taxed in practice under current tax settings. This is all perfectly legal under current New Zealand tax law. The tragedy we have is that the savings products most easily used by low and middle-income earners (KiwiSaver and bank term deposits) have the highest effective tax rates. That is the people who need of save over a long term face the biggest tax penalties for doing so. As a result of these tax distortions we are poorer as a country than we should be, fewer families own their own homes and wealth inequality has increased. These are self-inflicted injuries that we could have avoided. In the UK investors own some 18% of the housing stock, in Australia the proportion is 27% whereas, in New Zealand no strictly comparable statistics appear to be available. A recent April 2018 Horizon Research Poll reported that 47.5% of New Zealand adults own their own home, 32.8% say they are currently renting, a further 4.3% are currently flatting, another 4.8% have other living arrangements and pay rent or board and 1.4% don’t own a home but live rent free. In recent years more than 30% of new mortgage lending has been to investors. As rental properties on average are less expensive than the average owner- occupied home that is sold, this suggests the proportion of investor owned residential property in New Zealand could be higher than 30%. In 1989 in order to increase tax revenue and reduce the fiscal deficit the tax incentives to save in superannuation schemes were removed and the EET superannuation regime was switched to a TTE regime. In the 1990 Budget other changes were made which reduced the effective tax rates paid on income from investments in residential rental properties. As is so often the case, a tax policy, that was thought fiscally helpful in the short term has been disastrous for our social well-being, the housing of our population, our social cohesion and economic growth over the longer term. The last election result was in part a revolt of the renter generation against the home owner and rental property owner generation. A very good description of the problem and an outline of the issues with the 1989 changes to the taxation of superannuation savings and possible solutions, is contained in Dr Andrew Coleman’s University of Otago Economics Discussion Paper No 1709 Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease. He recommends moving back to EET from the current TTE superannuation tax regime. 5 My suggested solutions In order of preference I would recommend that; 1)As Optimal Tax Theory would suggest we move back to an Expenditure Tax treatment for Retirement Savings, EET or failing that, 2) Reduce the PIE rates to zero to create a level playing field between compound return financial products and residential rental property investments or failing that, 3) Move to a Comprehensive Economic Income (Haig-Simons definition) for all forms of investment income to the degree feasible and then offset any residual advantages for rental property investments by reducing the PIE rates to ensure a level playing field with them and also ensure no investor will pay an effective tax rate higher than the marginal income tax rate they pay on their other income. It should be noted that none of these recommendations provides a tax advantage for locked-in savings. They merely offset the current tax disadvantages retirement savings in compound return financial products suffer relative to investments in residential rental property and with the income tax rates they would pay on their other wage and salary income. The least financially sophisticated and lowest income earning savers are paying our highest effective tax rates, over 50% yet nothing has happened to fix these issues to date. The overtaxed middle and lower-income earner savers, in particularly those in default conservative KiwiSaver funds are much more likely to be, young, female, Maori and Pasifika and renters. In contrast those higher income earners, who are leveraging the equity in their own homes to invest in highly geared residential rental properties are paying effective tax rates of 0-10%, much lower than the marginal tax rates they would pay on their other wage and salary income. This group is far more likely to be older, richer, male, already own their own homes and not be Maori or Pasifika. These tax expenditures represent a massive redistribution of wealth from poorer to richer New Zealanders. The tax expenditures for rental property investors and home owners, benefiting mainly the wealthiest 40% of New Zealanders were in 2013 estimated to be cost $4b a year. That is almost twice the value of all public expenditure on housing assistance (rent subsidies and accommodation benefits) provided in 2013, mainly to the poorest 20% of New Zealanders. 6 While KiwiSavers are locked in till age 65 and term deposit investors for the term of their investment the Government of the day has a captive tax stream paid for by people who do not usually know they are being overtaxed. The TWG can make recommendations to stop that. 2 Introduction and Comments on the Terms of Reference (ToR) The TWG has been asked to report to the Government on: Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth, Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy, Whether there are changes to the tax system which could make it more fair, balanced and efficient, and Whether there are other changes which could support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing, companies, trusts and individuals. 3 This Submission This submission will specifically address the tax issues preventing low to middle income New Zealanders from achieving a comfortable retirement through long-term savings and recommends some practical and fairer solutions. To this end the submission will also respond to the request in the Terms of Reference for the TWG to consider whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it) or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system. Our current tax system encourages retirement savers to bid up the price of urban land suitable for housing, an existing asset. It also diverts capital flows away from investments that create new wealth, new jobs or could improve labour productivity by increasing the amount of capital used by each worker. This is what economists call capital deepening. It would be desirable to have a tax regime which helps lift wages rather than bidding up the price of land, which also makes us less competitive. 7 4 What is the Problem we should be trying to fix? Research reported on back in 2011, by the Savings Working Group revealed that taking reasonable assumptions some 90% of a KiwiSavers retirement nest egg would come from earnings within their KiwiSaver fund and only 10% from their initial contributions and the contributions made by their employer and the taxpayer. New Zealand is currently the OECD country with the most hostile tax environment for long-term savings in financial products earning compound returns (KiwiSaver, bank term deposits and standard annuities). These are the savings vehicles typically used by low and medium income earners in preparation for retirement. The tax penalty on long term savings arises from two drivers; 1)Income tax inherently overtaxes the part of your income you save, because taxing income today, unlike an expenditure tax such as GST, taxes future consumption more than current consumption. (This is always the case as long as people would rather spend today rather than to wait to spend later.) 2)The impact of taxation is particularly severe when the subsequent earnings on those savings within your fund, from compound returns (interest on interest) occurs over a long period of time, such as the 40-45 years prior to your retirement. The tax imposed on KiwiSaver earnings within your fund effectively halves the earnings that will be added to your nest egg over 40-45 years. The tax you pay within your KiwiSaver fund reduces the amount of net interest, after tax has been deducted, reinvested to earn further interest. On existing tax policy settings, over 40 years of saving you retain only 45.3% of the potential earnings, you would have earned in the absence of tax. This is despite the so-called concessional Portfolio Investment Entity “PIE” rates (10.5%,17.5% and 28%)which give the impression you will pay lower than normal income tax rates on your KiwiSaver earnings in the fund over the time you are saving. Similar discriminatory tax treatment exists for other compound return financial saving products including bank term deposits and is a major reason why, standard annuities are both unattractive and not supplied by any New Zealand based organisation. The bias in tax treatment creates a huge wedge between the after-tax returns of compound interest products like KiwiSaver and those of investors in residential rental properties even when they both have the same pre-tax profitability. 8 5 Understanding the Power of Compound Interest & the Rule of 72. How can taxing the earnings, or interest on savings, as you earn them make much of a difference to your retirement nest egg? Most people would think intuitively that paying tax in your fund could not possibly make a big difference to the amount of money that ends up in your KiwiSaver nest egg at retirement. A simple example might help explain the impact of paying tax on your returns, as you earn them, has on your retirement nest egg. Suppose your Grandmother for your 17th birthday gives you $10,000 but on condition that you don’t spend it. You must invest the amount for the next 48 years. She wants you to spend it only after you reach age 65. You have a fund to invest it in, that pays 6% interest each year, but the fund has to pay a 50% tax on each year’s earnings, on your behalf. To calculate the time, it takes to double your money you can use the Rule of 72. That is divide 72 by the interest rate you are being paid and it tells you how many years it will take to double your money, from compound returns (earning interest on interest). If you paid no tax on your 6% interest, the Rule of 72 tells us that 72 divided by the interest rate of 6% means your initial $10,000 of savings will double in value every 12 years. Over 48 years your initial $10,000 investment would double 4 times. So, your initial $10,000 becomes a retirement nest egg worth $160,000 by the time you reach 65 (if you pay no tax on your 6% interest income). If, however you need to pay a 50% tax on your annual interest earnings, the after-tax rate of return drops to only 3%. This means only half the earnings can be reinvested each year to earn compound returns (interest on interest). You can use the Rule of 72 to calculate the time it takes to double your money if the after-tax return is only 3% each year. 72 divided by 3 gives the answer 24 years. Your fund now doubles only every 24 years. This means that over 48 years, earning 3% each year your savings only double twice so your initial $10,000 only grows to produce a $40,000 nest egg at age 65. So, compared to the tax free 6% return, the 3% net, after-tax interest return (after paying the 50% marginal income tax rate), on your annual interest earnings, the marginal Effective Tax Rate (the ETR) over 48 years of saving is 75%. For New Zealanders with above average incomes who already own their own home there are two main avenues for investing their retirement savings one is in KiwiSaver and the other is by investing in residential 9 rental property. Some more risk averse savers invest in bank term deposits. For those on middle or lower incomes, particularly if they do not own their own homes it is almost impossible, on current tax settings, to save for a comfortable retirement by putting a little away each week for a long time, to get the benefit of compound returns (earning interest on interest). In the UK investors own some 18% of the housing stock, in Australia the proportion is 27% whereas, in New Zealand no strictly comparable statistics appear to be available. A recent April 2018 Horizon Research Poll reported that 47.5% of New Zealand adults own their own home, 32.8% say they are currently renting, a further 4.3% are currently flatting, another 4.8% have other living arrangements and pay rent or board and 1.4% don’t own a home but live rent free. In recent years more than 30% of new mortgage lending has been to investors. As rental properties on average are less expensive than the average owner- occupied home that is sold, this suggests the proportion of investor owned residential property in New Zealand could be much higher than 30%. 10 6 What causes such a big difference in the Effective Tax Rates? The three drivers of the relative over- taxation of compounding interest financial products relative to residential rental investments are as follows; • All interest income products are taxed on a comprehensive economic income basis (any change in capital value is treated as income). There is no tax-free capital gain in contrast to investments in residential rental accommodation held for longer than the “bright line” test period. • Interest income is taxed on an accrual rather than realisation basis (income from interest is taxed annually as it is earned) whereas capital gains on rental properties are only taxed on realisation that is when sold. When interest income is taxed on an accruals basis, only the smaller after-tax amount of interest is re-invested each year so grows much more slowly than when tax is deferred until realisation, and • The part of nominal interest that is just compensation for inflation and so is a return of capital rather than a return on capital is taxed as if it were income. Longer term investments in rental property particularly when heavily geared (mainly financed by debt) are strongly favoured by our current tax system. As a result, New Zealand stands out compared to most OECD countries in having the biggest tax bias in favour of investing in residential rental properties and against investing in compound return financial products such as standard annuities, bank term deposits and KiwiSaver conservative funds, which are mainly invested in bonds. It should be noted that KiwiSaver investments in Australian and New Zealand equities (shares) are not taxed on their capital gains. However equally it should be noted that default KiwiSaver members who remain in conservative funds have portfolios that are mainly in bonds, a fixed Calculating an Effective Tax Rate With a 6% tax free return your nest egg grows to $160,000 over 48 years With an after-tax return of 3% (after paying a 50% tax rate) this drops to only $40,000 over 48 years So, the effective tax rate over 48 years is 160,000- 40,000 = 120,000 divided by 160,000 which is 75% compared to the marginal tax rate of 50%. The effective tax rate increases the longer the period of saving continues. This means taxing compound returns in KiwiSaver, particularly hits those who are on lower incomes who need to save a little each year for a very long time to build up a large retirement nest egg. 11 interest compound interest product. These investment products are both subject to tax on any capital gains and suffer the highest effective tax rates. 7 I thought we had a tax system that taxed all forms of income equally, a low rate wide base approach am I wrong? How is New Zealand’s tax system different for the most common forms of retirement savings? Most forms of income in New Zealand such as wages, salaries and fringe benefits. are taxed on a uniform basis but not so for income from capital. In New Zealand as in most countries the imputed income from owner occupied homes is not currently and is not proposed to be taxed. There is however a big difference in the tax treatment between different forms of savings used to prepare for retirement. For someone in the top 33% income tax bracket, the effective tax rate on residential rental property (with gearing being maintained as more rental properties are purchased), is close to 0% while the effective tax rate on KiwiSaver earnings is over 50% if you save for 30 years or more. At over 50% the effective tax rate on KiwiSaver earnings is not only massively higher, than for investments in residential rental properties. They are also much higher than the standard marginal income tax rates paid by a KiwiSaver investor on their other income. The marginal Effective Tax Rate, (ETR) of 54.7% over 40 years of saving in KiwiSaver, is for the case of a 33% marginal tax payer. That means the effective tax rate for KiwiSaver or term deposit investors, is nearly twice as high as the so-called concessional PIE rate of 28% for someone in that income tax bracket. For the well informed this is a powerful disincentive to invest in KiwiSaver above the level that will be matched by the employer’s contribution of 3%. It is a very strong incentive to invest in residential rental property where the effective tax rate could be only around 2% over a 20-year period. If you can gear your residential rental property to 100% the effective tax rate becomes negative. In effect the other taxpayers subsidise your investment, the tax system pays you to make the investment. Some will say that with bank lending restrictions you cannot gear up your rental properties to 100%. This is not in fact the case. A partner in a law or accounting firm or medical specialist owning a debt free home worth $1m can borrow $4m to purchase rental properties and each rental property can be geared to 100% because the average gearing overall, on their real estate holdings including the family home is only 80%. 12 8 What is the tax treatment for retirement savings in most other OECD countries? In most OECD countries as in New Zealand owner occupied homes are not subject to tax on the value of the imputed rentals (the tax on the income you don’t need to earn as you are not paying rent) so the equity you have in your home becomes in effect a tax-free bank account, but in contrast, • ownership of rental properties is not encouraged by their tax systems, capital gains are taxed at least on realisation if not as they accrue and rental income is treated as any other corporate income and any losses are not deductible against other, non-rental income, and • typically, in these countries for retirement savings, made through locked-in superannuation schemes you do not pay income tax on the contributions you make into your fund, inside the fund your earnings are not taxed but you do pay tax on the income you receive from your fund in retirement. This type of regime is called EET short for your contributions into your fund, are Exempt from tax, inside the fund the earnings are Exempt from tax and the withdrawals are Taxed. This was the tax treatment for superannuation in New Zealand prior to 1989 and is in line with what optimal tax theory would recommend. The current regime in New Zealand is TTE, that is your contributions into KiwiSaver are out of already Taxed income, the income your contributions earn within the KiwiSaver fund itself are Taxed but your withdrawals after age 65 are Exempt from income tax. This tax change has been highly distortionary for earnings between different forms of long term retirement savings. The effective tax rate on an owner-occupied home is 0%, for an investment in a residential rental property held for 20 years with 80% gearing it is about 2% and on a term deposit or other debt instrument over 50%. (A conservative KiwiSaver scheme, mainly invested in bonds and cash is fairly close to this at 54.7% over 40 years of saving, (Source 2013 Financial Services Council, report, “The tax barrier to retirement prosperity in New Zealand”) The effective tax rates on bank term deposits and the bonds which dominate the conservative KiwiSaver fund portfolios held by default investors are much higher than the marginal income tax rates they would be paying on their other wage and salary income. 13 9 How do New Zealanders save for retirement? For New Zealanders with above average incomes who already own their own home there are two main avenues for investing their retirement savings one is in KiwiSaver and the other is by investing in residential rental property. Some more risk averse savers invest in bank term deposits. For those on middle or lower incomes, particularly if they do not own their own homes it is almost impossible, on current tax settings, to save for a comfortable retirement by putting a little away each week for a long time, to get the benefit of compound returns (earning interest on interest). This is because on an income of $70,000 or less you need to save steadily for a long time to build up your retirement nest egg you need to fund a comfortable retirement (about $300,000-450,000). On that sum you can earn about $300 a week on top of your NZ Super. However, the longer the period over which you need to save, the higher is your effective tax rate on your fund earnings. This is because of the impact paying tax within your fund, has on slowing the growth of your savings, from only, the lower after-tax earnings being reinvested into your fund. That difference makes a huge impact, significantly reducing your retirement nest egg over 40-45 years of saving. If they do own their own home the best after tax return comes from paying off their mortgage and then using the equity in their home to invest in residential rental properties. This is particularly so when you have sufficient income to fund the tax losses, your highly geared rental property will incur while you benefit from the lift in value of your investment, when property prices increase faster than general inflation. While your investment properties remain highly geared, the interest and other ownership costs are likely to exceed the rents received. In that position you are able to deduct those losses against your other income. Provided you have sufficient other income to deduct the losses against you can keep purchasing more rental properties and gearing up the debt levels they carry. The value of these tax deductions increases the higher is your marginal tax rate. This is a strategy that is really only available for people who have an income above $120,000. Unlike KiwiSaver this form of retirement savings can be accessed well before you turn 65. I would not claim that the tax treatment of residential rental properties is the only reason why residential property prices have increased much faster than prices generally. Rapid population growth from migration particularly into Auckland, super low interest rates since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and regulatory constraints on urban land release for home construction have been the prime drivers. However, the current tax regime has provided rental property investors with an almost costless 14 option to buy access to future capital gains that are unlikely to be ever taxed in practice under current tax settings. This is all perfectly legal under current New Zealand tax law. My point is that our current tax treatment of retirement savings is neither fair nor helpful for our social and economic development. 10 Why is it so hard for low and medium earners to achieve a comfortable retirement? To achieve a comfortable retirement most New Zealanders consider they will need an income of $250-300 a week in addition to National Super. To do so, a low or middle income New Zealander would need to save $300-450,000 over their working lives, in addition to paying off their home so that it was freehold by the time of their retirement. There are different ways you could accumulate a nest egg of $450,000. You could save about $4,000 a year for 40 years, a challenging but not impossible task for someone earning $70,000 or less each year but the effective tax rate on the earnings from their savings would be 54.7% if they were in the 33% tax bracket. That effective tax rate would be lower, closer to 40% if they could save $40,000 a year over just the last 10 years prior to retirement at age 65. Unfortunately, almost no one earning $70,000 a year or less could save $40,000 each year, for 10 successive years. Under the current tax settings that nest egg of $300,00-450,000 is almost impossible to save for, in a KiwiSaver account or in term deposits for someone on a low or even median income. The tragedy we have is that the savings products most easily used by low and middle-income earners (KiwiSaver and bank term deposits) have the highest effective tax rates. That is the people in most need of saving over a long term face the biggest tax penalties for doing so. People who have been unable to save to create the deposit to purchase their own first home are also likely to have insufficient incomes to save for a deposit on a rental property. It is also unlikely that they could also service the tax losses, from highly gearing a rental property or properties, to minimise tax. The tax savings from deducting the tax losses when interest costs exceed the rental income are greater, the higher is your marginal tax rate. So again, this feature is of most benefit to higher income earners. Provided you have sufficient income to deduct the interest costs against and can continue to gear up your properties there is little reason why this retirement income saving strategy won’t work for high income earners. The reality is we have a tax system that is creating 15 a wedge between the home ownership aspirations of low and middle income New Zealanders while providing large tax subsidies to those residential property investors, on higher incomes who usually already own their own homes. If the marginal home buyer is the residential rental investor then the low and medium income earner wanting to purchase a first home is being out competed by an investor able to deduct the mortgage interest expense against their non-investment income. In the UK investors own some 18% of the housing stock, in Australia the proportion is 27% whereas, in New Zealand no strictly comparable statistics appear to be available. A recent April 2018 Horizon Research Poll reported that 47.5% of New Zealand adults own their own home, 32.8% say they are currently renting, a further 4.3% are currently flatting, another 4.8% have other living arrangements and pay rent or board and 1.4% don’t own a home but live rent free. In recent years more than 30% of new mortgage lending has been to investors. As rental properties on average are less expensive than the average owner- occupied home that is sold, this suggests the proportion of investor owned residential property in New Zealand could be higher than 30%. The only practical ceiling in New Zealand on this proportion is that every investor owned home needs a tenant. 11 What are the consequences of the tax regime we currently have? The regime we have has contributed to; • Average house prices having gone from 3 to more than 7 times average earnings over the past 30 years • Housing costs and rents being a much higher proportion of household incomes than they were in the past • Declining home ownership as more New Zealanders find it difficult to get onto the property ladder by purchasing a first home in competition with residential rental property investors • Unlike many countries with more neutral tax treatments for residential rental property investments we have no corporate providers of quality, secure, long-term rentals for low and medium earners as they cannot compete with private investors who unlike the shareholders in corporates are able to deduct their tax losses in rental property investments against their other income • Higher interest rates, as the demand for borrowing increases, to obtain the tax advantages of owning highly geared residential rental property to access substantially tax-free capital gains • Those higher interest rates help push up our currency reducing the profitability of exporting 16 • As a consequence of making KiwiSaver, annuities and term deposits less attractive, capital particularly long-term capital is more expensive than it would otherwise be. • This is also manifested in an underdeveloped capital market in New Zealand particularly when fast growing enterprises need early risk capital. • Our NZX stock exchange market capitalisation is much smaller than it could be if we removed tax discrimination against financial long- term, compound return saving products. As a result of these tax distortions we are poorer as a country than we should be, fewer families own their own homes and wealth inequality increases. These are self-inflicted injuries that we could have avoided. 12 How did this Problem arise? In the 1980’s attempts were made to ensure all forms of economic income were taxed on the same basis to create a level playing field for investment and taxpayers. It was initially applied to most forms of remuneration and along with the introduction of GST widened the tax base which enabled income tax rates to be reduced. Greater reliance on wide based expenditure taxes and less reliance on income taxation is consistent with what optimal tax theory would suggest to assist economic growth and improve economic welfare. In 1989 in order to increase tax revenue and reduce the fiscal deficit the tax incentives to save in superannuation schemes were removed and the EET superannuation regime was switched to a TTE regime. In the 1990 Budget other changes were made which reduced the effective tax rates paid on income from investments in residential rental properties. In 1990 the previous $10,000 annual cap on the losses in investment property that could be claimed, against other income was removed. The other change was, to no longer require investors in property other than in farms, to repay the tax losses they had claimed if they on-sold the property within 10 years. These changes meant that rather than a Mom and Pop owning a single rental property the possibility existed to keep on adding rental properties to your portfolio. This required you to have sufficient income, to gear up each property you purchased and fund the tax losses while the expected capital gains, increased your net worth. When the then, recently deregulated banks started providing 100% loans on residential investment properties the access to these types of investments was greatly enhanced. At that point residential rental property investment became the retirement savings plan of choice for those in the professions and other higher income earners. These changes combined to create in New Zealand the largest gap between the 17 effective tax rates on residential real estate investments which are highly concessionary and the taxation of superannuation savings which had become the most punitive of any OECD country. As is so often the case, a tax policy, that was thought fiscally helpful in the short term has been disastrous for our social well-being, the housing of our population, our social cohesion and economic growth over the longer term. The last election result was in part a revolt of the renter generation against the home owner and rental property owner generation. Our current divisions over immigration policy have also been partially driven by the different interests of those who do not own a home but aspire to do so and those who already own one or more homes. For the person who already owns land or houses, immigration, increasing the number of people competing for the same amount of land, thereby boosting house prices, produces largely untaxed capital gains and is wealth enhancing. For the young and homeless increased immigration makes it harder and more expensive to buy a first home, increases rents and may provide competition for entry level jobs reducing their incomes, all of which for them is wealth reducing. 13 What are some Solutions that could fix the problem? A very good description of the problem and an outline of the issues with the 1989 changes to the taxation of superannuation savings and possible solutions, is contained in Dr Andrew Coleman’s University of Otago Economics Discussion Paper No 1709 Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease. He recommends moving back to EET from the current TTE superannuation tax regime. These are alternative approaches to create a level playing field between rental property investments and compound return financial products such as KiwiSaver, standard annuities and bank term deposits. In order of preference I would recommend that; 1)As Optimal Tax Theory would suggest move back to an Expenditure Tax treatment for Retirement Savings, EET Move from our current TTE system to an EET regime that most OECD countries use. (A comprehensive expenditure tax, Kaldor approach is consistent with optimal tax theory and as recommended by Dr Andrew Coleman), or 2) Reduce the PIE rates to zero to create a level playing field between compound return financial products and residential rental property investments 18 If you cannot agree to recommend a move to an EET regime then at least fix the over-taxation within superannuation funds by moving the “middle T” to an E. Move to a TEE regime by reducing the PIE rates (currently 10.5%, 17.5% and 28%) all to 0% for retirement savings locked in till age 65 and continuing if an approved annuity or other approved savings product is purchased at retirement. Any withdrawals at 65 or later that were taken as a lump sum and not used to purchase an approved annuity would be taxed at 15%. (A pragmatic approach to give a result that would create a level playing field with investments in residential rental property under its existing tax treatment), or 3) Move to a Comprehensive Economic Income (Haig-Simons definition) for all forms of investment income to the degree feasible and then offset any residual advantages for rental property investments by reducing the PIE rates to ensure a level playing field with them and also ensure no investor will pay an effective tax rate higher than the marginal income tax rate they pay on their other income. This would require removing the tax deductibility of interest against other income for rental property investors so that the deductibility can be only against the income being generated by the investment property. (This has been proposed by the current Government but has not yet been enacted.) Only allow the deductibility of the real part of interest rates as the part of nominal interest paid to compensate the lender for inflation is a return of capital and is not income that should be taxed. Pay income tax on any annual real capital gain or deduct any annual real loss against other income on real estate, other than the family home and the land under it or have an annual land tax of 1% on land other than the land under the family home based on an annual self -declaration of value. To help keep the system low cost and effective IRD should be able to purchase any property for later resale at auction, at its declared value plus 20% to discourage the under-reporting of values. If the TWG cannot agree to recommend either an annual land tax or an annual capital gains tax it should at least recommend that the owner-occupied home exemption be capped at a dollar amount say $1m. With those changes in place adjust the PIE rates so they create a level playing field with rental property investments and effective tax rates no higher than the marginal income tax rates investors would pay on their other income. This is a level playing field-based approach built on a close to comprehensive economic income measure, using a Haig-Simons definition of economic income. 19 It should be noted that none of these recommendations provides a tax advantage for locked-in savings. They merely offset the current tax disadvantages retirement savings in compound return financial products suffer relative to investments in residential rental property and with the income tax rates investors would pay on their other wage and salary income. 14 Can these provisions be ring-fenced effectively? These tax treatments could be restricted to products where the investor was locked in, for at least 2 years for the term deposit and annuity products. In the case of KiwiSaver where you are locked in until age 65 apart from for a withdrawal, as under the current rules, for either the purchase of a first home or under the existing extreme hardship conditions. To stop high income individuals backloading income into KiwiSaver as a tax shelter very close to retirement, you could increase the PIE rates after age 55 for late KiwiSaver enrolees so they were neutral with the tax treatment of other earned income. 15 Why has the problem not been solved before? We currently have some 2.7m KiwiSaver, and 750,000 bank term deposit investors that are overtaxed because of the existing tax arrangements. Since 2008 Governments have known that residential rental property investors have an advantage over first home buyers.(Source Final Report of the House Prices Unit: House Price Increases and Housing in New Zealand, March 2008, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, New Zealand) Since the 2011 Savings Working Group reported, Governments have known that the effective tax rates for KiwiSaver type conservative assets and bank term deposits are much higher than what KiwiSavers would pay on their other income. In the case of KiwiSaver they are also much higher than the nominal single year PIE tax rates which are often described as concessional. The least financially sophisticated and lowest income earning savers are paying our highest effective tax rates, over 50% yet nothing has happened to fix these issues to date. While I do not think anyone set out to make it this way, the existing tax benefits for rental property investments and the tax penalties for long term savings in annuities, bank term deposits and KiwiSaver have been an engine for increasing wealth inequality in New Zealand. The overtaxed middle and lower-income earner savers, in particularly those in default conservative KiwiSaver funds are much more likely to be, young, female, Maori and Pasifika or renters. In contrast those higher income earners, who are leveraging the equity in their own homes to invest in highly geared residential rental properties and paying effective tax rates of 0-10%, much lower than the 20 marginal tax rates they would pay on their other wage and salary income. This group is far more likely to be older, richer, male, already own their own homes and not be Maori or Pasifika. These tax expenditures represent a massive redistribution of wealth from poorer to richer New Zealanders. The tax expenditures for rental property investors and home owners, benefiting mainly the wealthiest 40% of New Zealanders in 2013 were estimated to be cost $4b a year. That was almost twice the value of all public expenditure on housing assistance (rent subsidies and accommodation benefits) provided in 2013, mainly to the poorest 20% of New Zealanders. While KiwiSavers are locked-in till age 65 and term deposit investors for the term of their investment the Government has a captive tax stream paid for by people who do not usually know they are being overtaxed. 16 Conclusion The Tax Working Group has an opportunity to recommend solutions for these issues. Be bold and brave in making your recommendations to address these issues.

I feel this situation is unfair on people with disabilities and is inconsistent with the United Nations Convention rights of persons with disabilities. I would ask that the working group look at this continuing problem. History: 1) In 2011 I had my ACC weekly compensation suspended, ACC “Deemed I was Rehabilitated”. Instead of receiving 80% of my pre-injury weekly compensation, I was forced to live off a sickness benefit for 4 years which equated to 1/3 of the minimum wage. \[1\] Effectively this has created a new class of poverty by the two crown entities due to the lack of engagement in rectifying the issues that exists. Try to imagine the financial injustice and social stress that has been imposed over those years of dis-entitlement / suspension. 2) ACC decision was wrong , this was challenged through the appropriate legal channels. ACC acknowledged it’s decision was wrong. ( Administrative decision) 3) ACC reinstated me back to weekly compensation. I was paid a substantial backdated lump sum which then incurred a significant tax liability that disadvantaged me financially further through the result of ACC errors. The backdated lump sum payment was taxed in the year it was paid. This resulted in an increase of approximately $30,886.54 payable tax more than if the payments had been spread over the years of entitlement. I considered the following result as double taxation. I also argued that PAYE on the backdated compensation should not have been taxed in one year but spread across the years in which the ACC entitlement arose. This in turn would have resulted in the lump sum payments being taxed at a lower marginal rate, as PAYE deductions are calculated based on a person’s annual income. Unfortunately for being a successful claimant where the lump sum arrears is accumulated and then taxed at the higher rate, to comply with the provisions of the 2007 Tax Act. This has potentially put the ACC claimant in the highest possible tax bracket for that particular tax year despite right to be taxed at a much lower marginal tax rate had ACC made the right decision. The cost to claimants has been the benefit to the Crown as a legislative windfall that breaches a basic principle of Law of “Commodum Ex Injuria Sua Nemo Habere Debet” , which means the wrongdoer should not be enabled by law to take any advantage from it’s actions, a profit to which the Crown had no right to the disadvantage. It should be observed the breach of principle whereby the Crown was profiting from a circumstance created by a Crown entity ACC at the expense of the individual that ACC is meant to serve. If the legislation was drafted to reflect the actual situation then there was no reason for the “essential misfortune” to exist. The lump sum did not amount to an increase in compensation (“wages”) I was then receiving for the current period. Rather, it was a payment of the amount to which I was entitled by way of compensation for the prior years of dis-entitlement. It could not therefore be characterized as an extra payment over and above my ordinary entitlement for the “pay period” in question. 4) I asked ACC to compensate for the extra tax ACC refused / declined stating their internal criteria were not met. 5) The ACC policy is that it will only compensate people for paying the extra tax when there has been a serious service failure and this directly caused a loss. 6) ACC stated that there is no jurisdiction to challenge this. I do not think that ACC decision was justified so I applied for a review using ACC’s Dispute Resolution Provider, Fairway Resolution Limited. 7) Fairway Resolution issued it’s decision stating it would not address ACC’s refusal to pay the extra tax incurred because it was not a “Decision” I have Initiated the Legal process to object this anomaly with the District Court of Appeal. 8) This has placed a significant burden sorting this Tax issue out by creating additional stress which has impacted further on my mental / physical well-being which eventually led to me being hospitalised 9) I have received legal advice that if the district court decides that reviewer was correct and ACC has not made a “decision”, my only other option is to seek Judicial Review in the High Court. I should not need to spend thousands on legal fees and risk tens of thousands of dollars by taking a case to the High Court to address this. 10) The Ombudsman has raised the issue 2009/10 annual report in reaction to a complaint about the over taxation problem these circumstances have been acknowledged by the Taxation Review Authority and the Accident Compensation Appeal Authority these parties were left to consider rectifying the inequity of those who had received a back payment that was subjected to the inequitable taxation regime. But no action has been taken. 11) The new Minister for Revenue wrote to the then Minister for Revenue about the issue on my behalf, explaining it’s unfair and asking that the problem be addressed. The then Minister made it clear it would not be addressed. 12) I wrote to the new Minister who has explained that this is harder to fix than he thought. This unfair Tax collection has been well known to the senior administrators of the Crown at all levels as early as the 1990’s if not earlier. I believe I have exhausted every avenue that is currently available I.e officials in government departments through Politicians in Parliament and in the process through the justice system. I thought administrative requirement when legislative incongruities are identified by way of such Court decisions is Government departments or Crown entities such as the IRD and the ACC are required to raise such issues by way of the appropriate internal management systems so that the Parliamentary Minister’s responsible can redress the ineptly drafted ‘bad law’. It’s one thing to acknowledge the existence of this anomaly, but it’s another delivering a solution / remedy in a timely manner. If the well-being of vulnerable members of society are paramount, then their needs to be an active approach to ensure that the incapacitated are not taxed at the highest marginal rate. I respectively ask that people in my position are not disadvantaged further in paying for others mistakes, I look forward to a direction / guidance's on how this anomaly can be addressed / rectified fairly. Please also make sure that historic problems of this nature can be addressed by the tax system. Yours Sincerely Sefton Pryce

Submission to the Tax Working Group I am a chartered accountant working in a public practice firm in provincial NZ. I have been in this role for 28 years and have experienced a wide range of business activities over that period. Tax policy and settings are key to a lot of investment decisions. The current settings heavily bias towards investments providing capital gains which are generally lightly taxed in NZ. With my experience, I see the following tax issues that need to be reviewed by the Working Group with sound recommendations being provided to the government of the day. • Depreciation on motor vehicles – there should be a limit on the capital value for motor vehicles that depreciation can be claimed on. This value should be somewhere around $60,000 (GST exclusive), as this will cover most vehicles used by NZ businesses. Having a vehicle valued at greater than this amount provides little economic benefit to the business or NZ. • Capital Gains – all real property (land, buildings, shares, businesses) should be subject to a capital gains tax, or subject to similar provisions to the taxation of overseas investments using FDR/CV – although the rate should be reduced from 5% to 4%. There should also be a de minimus exemption for the main residential home costing less than $1,000,000 for any property. This exemption amount needs to be adjusted annually using the average increase/decrease in residential property prices. All capital gains should be taxed separately from income at a flat rate of 25%. • National Park Entrances Fees – many other countries in the world have entrances fees for anyone wanting to enter a national park. This should also be introduced in NZ. NZ residents should also be charged, but the rate should be half that charged to non-residents. There could be daily, weekly, monthly and annual passes issued as various rates. These funds should be allocated exclusively to DoC to further the work they carry out to enhance our environment. • National Identity Number – and IRD number should be converted to a national identity number to enable better identification of individuals to reduce tax evasion. A card with picture should be issued at no cost every 5 years for children under 18 and then 10 yearly thereafter. There would be no need to have a separate number for a drivers licence or passport – just a national identity number. • Taxing Overseas Entities – rules need to be amended to make overseas based companies selling goods/services to NZ customers to pay their fair share of tax. Income for NZ tax purposes could be calculated using the net profit percentage achieved by the parent company. Transfer prices rules are not effective. • GST on Imported Low Value Goods – Australia has brought in laws requiring NZ entities to register for GST in Australia for sales of goods/services to Australian purchasers. The same law needs to be passed here in NZ, or customs de minimus rules need to be abolished. • Increase Marginal Tax Thresholds – marginal tax thresholds need to be lifted significantly. The 17.5% threshold needs to go up to at least $75,000 and the top tax rate should not start until at least $110,000 • GST – this tax works very well. No additional exemptions are required.

If you need me to drop it off or post it let me know. Plugging the income tax cullender Executive Summary Income tax resembles a colander more than a tax collection bowl. The consequence is an out of control tax avoidance industry that is undermining civil society and the ability to do business in it. As importantly, destructive economic signals on competition and the use of resources are currently being sent to business about expenses and this is undermining innovation in the economy. It is now overdue to reconsider the fundamental assumptions that underpin the income tax regime and make changes so it will work better for the economy and society. These proposals see tax not as a cost to business to be avoided but as payment of a ‘society dividend’ for the laws and structures that enable the business to function in safety. For income tax to recover its primary purpose and role of funding the needs of society, and to drive efficient economic decisions for the better of society and business, it must be simplified. By: Three main proposals (there are 3 more subsidary) 1. Remove deductibility for all expenses except for domestic (NZ) salary and wage payments. 2. No capital revenue distinction for non-individuals with a wider definition of income for all, (variation for private homes in trusts or other entities). 3. Imputation and other related memorandum accounts should be ceased. Why? 1. The tax avoidance industry can almost be stopped or at least deeply and seriously hindered by these two proposals.  More revenue comes to the govt.  a greater sense of fairness and therefore cooperation on compliance.  more financial capital can be freed up for investment elsewhere in the economy. 2. Economic efficiency is being seriously undermined by the ability to deduct expenses and re-characterise revenue income as capital gain. For example, Proposal one - deductibility of expenses as current. (i) Current rules of deductible expenses for two companies producing the same good/service earns expenses Tax income 28% tax residual to invest Efficient company A $150 $50 $100 $28 $72 Lazy inefficient B $150 $100 $50 $14 $36 As a question of economic policy, why should efficient Company A pay more tax than Inefficient Lazy Company B when they earned the same gross income? (ii) Proposed changes - no deductibility of expenses (no employees) \[1\] 2 earns expenses Tax income 28% tax residual to invest Efficient company A $150 $50 $150 $42 $58 Lazy inefficient B $150 $100 $150 $42 $8 With no deductibility of expenses Efficient Company A’s competitive advantage is properly rewarded and the economy gets either cheaper goods and services from the business or there is financial capital accumulated and available for investment in the wider economy. When expenses are deducted Inefficient Lazy Company B gets a massive handout of $28 (28%) on their expenses for no benefit to the economy or society. The money it spends on being wasteful and inefficient (thought it has some benefit for those who get the expenditure) could be taken up elsewhere in the economy to stimulate the production of needed goods and services, or even exports. There is less waste. If the company was already efficient then it will remain so. No deductibility of expenses rewards and helps drive innovation because you have to be efficient, to earn the income to drive your return on capital. The focus for a return on capital gives a better focus not only on exports, but value add. You have to make every item count. There is less resource/financial capital waste with no deductibility of expenses. No deductibility for expenses will also significantly free up financial capital for other investments in the economy without the risk of targeting one business type and creating a victim culture, e.g. by targeting rental properties. If for example you ring fenced losses then this opens it for some big businesses being built around renting and capital gains. Just ordinary NZ’ers would be shut out of the current tax gains. Or if you removed expense deductibility for small businesses the same would happen, large companies come in and there would be no freeing up of financial capital to fund new business ventures outside of property. Proposal two - no capital revenue distinction for non-individuals A non-individual entity is recognised and supported by the laws and processes of society which defend its rights and entitlements. As a consequence of that recognition and protection, all income (not donations) that may be generated through that non individual entity should pay a ‘society dividend’ to the society that supports that entity. (There is no free ride). These are mechanical entities designed to achieve a purpose in society and that means managing itself financially, so a part of that purpose is to pay a ‘society dividend’ back to society. By their mechanical nature luck and good fortune do not belong to them but to the owners. For example if an owner buys a lotto ticket and wins in the name of the entity, or deposits it through the entities bank account, then that is taxable income to the non-individual entity. (Perhaps the owner has a child support obligation?) Thus all revenue that accrues to a non individual entity is taxable, including windfall or capital gains. (Some of these entities only accrue these sort of gains). The risks of the distinction being used for tax avoidance are real if we don’t. Ill focused business accountants may drive more and more of the income (using the colander techniques) away from revenue and into capital to avoid tax. NZ society is no better off if this happens. Proposal three - Imputation and other related memorandum accounts should be ceased. Imputation was introduced to avoid the idea of double taxation. However, ordinary NZ’s pay tax on their income and then that income is used to pay GST . It is said not to be double tax but a switch in how tax is paid but the regressive nature of GST means it is. Financial capital may stay in the companies to finance further development and only withdrawn when revenue maximised. Summary The economy is greatly improved by removing the deductibility of business expenses, and the capital revenue distinction for non-individuals. Positive signals are sent to business about economic efficiency and competitive advantages so both are correctly rewarded. Opportunities will open up for many more smaller low capital intensive businesses. The economy will be healthier and more stable as the debt level of NZ’ers will decrease, the money leaving the economy to overseas will have tax paid on it, the incentive to debt finance is gone improving our international credit rating and reducing risk to our economy when recession bites. Financial help may need to be given to assist transition. It is quite possible new taxes are not really necessary if the existing foundation income tax is made to work more efficiently. Because:  Removing the capital revenue distinction is like a wealth or capital gain tax only simpler.  Removing imputation is simple and low cost and is like a well targeted progressive tax rate charge on those who can afford to pay because it is on income coming to them.  removing expense deductibility is again a targeted progressive tax rate increase with essential and highly desirable economic behaviour outcomes. The economic reasons are paramount. Overall tax rates could be reduced, or debt repaid, or govt services given the chance to catch on capital expenditure, if these are applied in full. Introduction The purpose of a tax regime is to quickly and cheaply raise funds for the work of supplying societies needs as identified through the elected government. But the current income tax regime collection bowl more resembles a colander poked full of holes to serve the special interests of those with the ear of a politician. Holes are about a clarification needed or a situation being amended to ‘be fair’. The rules and exceptions can become a way of dispensing the largess of government (benefit handouts) without the inconvenient transparency on how they drag on the crown accounts. 3 Thus the ability to deduct expenses from gross income, and make capital revenue distinctions within income tax have been stretched over many years; as part of a world wide phenomenon. We now have the situation of multi nationals barely paying tax combined with the ability of wealthy individuals to shift money at will around the world to avoid tax. As importantly, inefficiency in the economy is being encouraged by the deduction of expenses and the tax system is less efficient and fair when the bigger players can more easily re-charactise their income as capital and therefore non taxable. The current income tax assumptions inadvertently encourage a focus on tax avoidance as an easy low capital intensive path to profit. Tax being seen as a cost that an entity has the right to avoid that and they should do so, (everyone else is) for profitability and shareholder value. It is now overdue to reconsider the fundamental assumptions that underpin the income tax regime and make changes to the understanding, calculation, and administration of this tax so it will work better for the economy and society. We need change that will have a long term benefit to the economy with a shift to more efficient use of the Financial Capital resources of New Zealand, and in turn that shift will better protect our natural, our human and our social capital. Change is not only justified by the values of ‘fairness’ about paying tax but also the desperate need to raise funds to meet the needs of our society. Too little tax is currently collected to sustain society, hence the crisis in health, education, water quality, the environment, and social environment. At times of high society stress, as previously in wars, taxes are high. There is no suggestion here to raise income tax rates, in fact the suggested changes may over time make it possible to reduce tax rates. These suggestions should not be dismissed on a false pretext they raise taxes, though one outcome I expect is that tax revenue rises. Now is the time to move from tax being seen as a cost that can be morally and legally avoided to a recognition that all business benefits from contributing back to the society that underpins the economy in which a business runs. The proposals here move from the denigrated label ‘income tax’, to the payment of a 'society dividend’, payable on whatever income is generated. Income tax simplification six proposals For income tax to recover its primary purpose and role of funding the needs of society, and to drive efficient economic decisions for the better of society and business, it must be simplified. By: 1. Remove deductibility for all expenses except for domestic salary and wage payments. 2. No capital revenue distinction for non-individuals. (variation for private home in trusts or other entities). 3. Imputation and other related memorandum accounts should be ceased. 4. Introduce some restrictions on charitable status, and donations. 5. Remove GST as a tax (alternative taxes could be considered to replace if needed). 6. Tax evasion (tax avoidance is dealt with by the above proposals) is the one of the most serious threats to the health of our society and therefore to our democracy. (The current growth of populist leaders could be linked to the instability created by inequality which is in part driven by tax avoidance and evasion). Tax evasion must be made an act of treason in our laws and the powers of the GCSB made available to help tackle it. Some of these proposals links to the theorists on Turnover Tax, but this is a wider more systemic approach which is why it is much stronger. Why these six proposals? Proposal One - Remove deductibility for all expenses (except for domestic salary and wage payments) 1. The deduction of expenses along with the capital revenue distinction have helped facilitate the massive growth of the destructive tax avoidance industry. It’s that industry that pushes the drive for nations to have the lowest company tax rates to try and draw investment capital back into their nations economy. But lower tax rates just set up a cycle that further strips money out of societies and economies. It is redistributed tax revenue that can help stimulate a demand driven growth economy. The tax avoidance industry can be easily stopped or at least deeply and seriously hindered by these proposals. Economic efficiency 2. Deductibility of expenses means a company pays 72% of the cost of an input to business as they can offset the expense against their gross income which means for each dollar of expense they don’t have to pay the 28% ’cost’ of tax . If tax is a cost of business no other ‘cost’ can be subsidised like this. 3. Because the expenses come off the gross income, tax payable is reduced. The people of NZ in effect become a subsidiser of the company or entity because less tax is paid on income earned. There is an opportunity cost to ordinary NZer’s to allow less revenue to be collected. 4. There is no consideration of the efficiency or effectiveness of the expenditure as these are private decisions by the owners. So the risk in these private decisions should sit with the entrepreneurs who make those decisions. 5. The consequences of those decisions should be felt in full by the entrepreneur so the right economic signal is sent about the use of the resources. There is no compelling reason why other NZer’s should subsidise those decisions. 6. The subsidy effect is sending damaging economic signals to the economy about the efficient use of the financial capital of NZ, which is what expenses represent. See the Table A example below. Current deductibility of expenses and its impacts Table A - two companies producing the same product Entity Gross income Expenses Net income 28% tax Residual to invest Efficient Company A $150 $50 $100 $28 $72 4 Inefficient Lazy Company B $150 $100 $50 $14 $36  Efficient Company A earns gross income of $150, less expenses of $50 = gross income of $100 so it pays tax of $28 and it now has $72 to develop new business.  Inefficient Lazy Company B earns gross income of $150, less expenses of $100 = gross income of $50 so it pay’s tax of $14, leaving it with $36 to grow new business. 7. As a question of economic policy, why under Table A should efficient Company A pay more tax than Inefficient Lazy Company B when they earned the same gross income? Proposed highly limited deductibility of expenses and its impacts Table B - same two companies Entity Gross income Tax at 28% Expenses Residual to invest Efficient Company A $150 $42 $50 $58 Inefficient Lazy Company B $150 $42 $100 $8 With the proposed change to ‘no deductibility of expenses’, each company would pay $42 tax (28% tax) on their $150.  Company A would have ($150 less $50, less $42 =) $58 to grow new business.  Company B would have ($150 less $100, less $42 =) $8 to grow new business.\* \*Company B in Table B does spend money in the economy with the wasteful expenditure but that waste could be freed up to produce needed goods or services, even exports. 8. Table A shows deductibility of expenses has narrowed the competitive advantage between the two companies (as measured by the ‘residual to invest’ figures) with no benefit to the economy. Table B with no deductibility of expenses shows the competitive advantage being properly rewarded. Allowing the deductibility of expenses is sending the wrong economic signals around both the wasteful use of resources in the economy and the efficient use of financial capital. 9. Comparison of Table A and B shows Inefficient Lazy Company B gets a huge subsidy of $28 dollars when they deduct expenses. The effective subsidy means, not only more money in hand for their next business choices but also the choices they have already made have been supported more than the company that was efficient and did not need to incur extra expenses. 10. Business expenditure can be about anticompetitive behaviour to drive competitors out and reduce competition. This does not produce better goods and services for society or our social capital. If companies want to do that they should not be able to deduct those costs. Economic benefits of removing expense deductibility from Gross income 11. Table B shows the removal of deducibility of expenses gives a strikingly strong economic signal toward the efficient use of resources. Both companies remain viable but Company B has to really pick itself up as its return on its capital is lower and consequently its ability to reward investors is lower. This is as it should be in a competitive world. 12. Deductibility of expenses is sloping the economic playing field towards inefficient and high cost business structures. The existing old boys club of businesses is being favoured by this. To remove deducibility of expenses would slope the economy back to smaller scale , low cost, innovative, service industry businesses. This would promote and favour what our economy has left after the gutting of our manufacturing and industrial base by the failed neoliberal market reforms. 13. Removal of deductibility does not remove the ability of a future government to directly fund what businesses it wishes. e.g. R&D research development tax credits could still occur, if desired. 14. More financial capital will be available for new low cost structure businesses as the clear tax signal is you have to earn money to deliver a return on capital. (See Table B)  Some of this new financial capital will come from expenses being reined in.  the removal of interest deductibility as an expense will drive down demand for borrowing as a mechanism for financing capital growth. There will be a shift in how assets are held and NZ’s level of indebtedness will reduce. This improves the nations credit rating and overall access to financial capital.  Financial accounts would reflect positive investments rather than creating debts and structures to hide income  over time there will be a diversion of money from investment in property because no tax advantages would exist. This will free up capital for the wider economy - without singling out property and creating a victim culture.  Banks will also be directly impacted by no deductibility of expenses so they will have the push to attract and earn business. Also they can’t coast along with residential property as a safe strong investment. There would be an incentive for them to look for economic development opportunities. 5  With the removal of the strong incentives to invest in property some financial capital may over time come back into the NZ share market. Though the problem that has ruined it, too open an economy that has allowed our companies to be stripped out, is still not dealt with. Further economic benefits from the removal of deductibility of expenses. 15. Vastly reduced opportunities for tax avoidance. e.g.  Thin Capitalisation is removed as a device to pay less tax as interest is no longer deductible, including by multi-nationals.  The ability of multi-nationals to do Transfer Pricing is significantly reduced in scope, e,g, no deduction for management fee charges. (Valuation of goods sold between related entities is still an issue).  no benefit in re-characterising capital expenditure to revenue expenditure as expenditure is not deductible.  no ability to generate losses, which currently shelter profitable business activities.  Entertaining clients is done at full cost to the company and not subsidised by a reduced tax take for ordinary NZer’s, giving a visible sense of fairness. 16. Easier collection of revenue  Gross income could be paid into a bank account and an automatic tax deduction made and sent to IR. No worry about due dates, late payment penalties or shortfall penalties; unless fraud is involved.  Where credits of income are involved the existing or new rules about paying tax would apply. Less risk of tax dispute or the need to check lots of business accounts.  Payment of the society dividend could become procedural. 17. Less red tape and industry specific rules  Rental property would be treated like any other business with tax paid on the gross rent received. The tax advantages to invest in property would disappear but there is nothing making it inequitably treated compared to other businesses.  Over time houses prices may decrease or not rise as steeply as there is less investor demand for property.  The two major and sizeable NZ tax acts would plummet in size.  With a lot of complexity stripped out the administration needed to support income tax would reduce. 18. Reallocation of investment  Another implication is that if high cost business models were more difficult to start up there would be more money in the economy for other initiatives. This is a similar idea to the old concept of Government expenditure crowding out funding for the private sector within the economy. Here it is businesses with high cost structures that are sucking in the investment money which restricts the ability of the economy to provide other goods and services.  Another current example in the NZ economy is money being sucked into real estate leaving under investment in NZ businesses, especially as most of that mortgage investment is borrowed money. Real estate has been the only reliable investment in NZ, especially considering the repeat stock failures and every 10 years a significant shake up of finance companies, 1988, 1998, 2008.  It would be good for the NZ economy to target all high cost structure businesses equally and without resentment at being targeted, as amendments such as ring fencing losses does.  Tax exceptions can still be made for research and development expenditure but it would be better if tax money went to Govt research institutes and research was then picked up by companies or others. Proposal Two - Remove capital revenue distinction for non individuals and define ‘income’ widely within the Act 19. Creative accounting has abused it.  The distinction has been abused through creative accounting to re-characterise income as capital and not subject to tax. The distinction is a major driver of the tax avoidance industry. 20. Negative practises are encouraged within the NZ economy.  Entrepreneurs and investors are lured by the quick wins of a non taxable sale to a third party, usually overseas. Time and again our NZ income earning assets are lost to the NZ economy and with it the sources of financial capital growth.  The benefits of trade appear based on the foundation of ownership. Once owned overseas the gains are lost from NZ to other markets even when they sell the assets. 21. Overseas entities with bases in NZ will pay tax in NZ.  The removal of expenses and the capital revenue distinction would mean overseas entities are sourcing income within NZ and subject to tax on all that is sourced from NZ.  And all income, as defined by NZ laws, that is sourced from NZ should be subject to NZ tax. 22. Historical precedent of capital revenue distinction is no longer relevant.  The original intent was to separate gains from income but has become a tool to avoid tax.  Most countries now have wealth or capital gain taxes so removal of the distinction of capital and revenue makes for a simpler introduction of such a tax.  The calculation of gains will be a battleground that should be decided with an emphasis on simplicity and ease of collection, and ability to generate revenue (that is its purpose), without an overriding input by those with a vested interest, i.e. business. It should have a wide range of academic input. Why can’t a non individual get a chance windfall gain? 23. A non-individual entity is protected by the laws of society. 6  As a consequence of legal recognition and protection, all income that may be generated through that entity should contribute to the welfare of the society that supports that entity.  All actions, windfall gains, and capital gains , sale of assets are used towards the purposes it was set up for and so by nature they are gross income to the entity.  Its mechanical nature means there is no ‘luck’ for the entity. If a company director buys a winning lotto ticket in the name of the company or cashes it through a company account, it is taxable income to the company. (Possibly done to avoid child support?) The director has the luck, the company has the income.  For syndicates of people who buy lotto tickets it is not taxable though it often is overseas. For a Trust to manage the old family home, or current home, it is not taxable unless it is conducted as a rental. If the house is owned by the family that lives in it, then the sale of the home is not a capital gain, same as if it was held in the name of an individual living in the home . 24. Holiday homes.  Are subject to the capital gains bright line test. Gain from the sale of these holiday homes would remain as taxable income. Rules about the gain would have to be developed to prevent sales to related parties at below market rates to avoid taxation. 25. There would be no capital loss allowed from the sale or loss of an asset.  These are risks carried by the decision makers. It is not appropriate for rest of society to carry the consequences for individuals decisions.  Society carries the obligation to support the person through our social welfare system, health, education and superannuation policy, etc. i.e the fabric of society carries the person. 26. It is appropriate for society to share in the benefit of private decisions.  Because society has protected the business assets and provided the context in which positive decisions can be made. Even if it sometimes feels to the entrepreneur that they have achieved despite all the nay sayers and ‘society’ has tried to hold them back. Society has still provided the context to enable the success.  The struggle to succeed is inherently a competition of ideas and the success of that struggle for the individual should not perversely be used as an excuse to petulantly tear society down. Impacts of proposal One and Two 27. The transition period will be difficult for some. But ...  The tax is on gross income so no business will go under but the return on capital may be significantly reduced and some businesses may decide they are not profitable enough. This will create opportunities for new low cost structure businesses.  Some businesses are in loss and will pay tax on the little they earn. They will have to budget for the ‘society dividend’ just as they would if any other expense rises in price. The need to make profit does not change, and the entrepreneur must budget for it but not in some imagined future.  Many businesses in loss have some quite lucrative income streams, these would now pay a ‘society dividend’. The loss making activities can be about anticompetitive behaviours so the business would have to decide whether they want to continue these or not. Opportunities for low cost businesses could again open up. High cost business structures (See Appendix B for a list and brief discussion of market segment impacts) Themes on impacts 28. Competition - Overseas firms are able to deduct expenses but our firms can’t so NZ products will be more expensive.  This can be said about other costs, like transport and distance to market. Businesses factor this in and overcome these or it just isn’t viable. Economic activity must return a ‘society dividend’ or it is not worth it for society and the economy. This is the same argument for any shareholder so it is valid for society and govt - expectations of the return on capital must change in the short term.  A struggle to compete overseas will refocus on the need to get the value add for exports. e.g. instead of a business strategy allowing whole milk powder to be sold wholesale and then marketed by dozens of dubious middle men who may damage the NZ brand in the process, the incentive is for NZ to build that value add.  NZ has few manufacturing or industrial jobs left after the neo-liberal experiment so the risks to NZ are low from supposedly being less competitive. If competitive means society has to subsidise the business then it is not economic for society to support the business or allow the use of resources to support that business when there are other business opportunities.  NZ is now very focused on those items where it has a comparative advantage and our comparative advantage for tourism is not impacted. This is our biggest economic activity and it is growing. 29. Inflation - it will be argued it will inevitably increase.  The removal of the regressive GST tax would minimise that.  The same forces of demand and supply would apply.  Sharp rises in price would instantly provide a stronger signal for smaller local low cost businesses to enter the market. There would be a damaging lag that may need some fiscal stimulus, like how GST was supported by govt when introduced.  Govt co-operation with some key local businesses could ensure price inflation is kept under control. e.g. The Warehouse (just guessing here) has retail and supermarket activities and they could be supported by the govt to ensure it has low prices. This would make sure other competitors do not act as a de-facto oligopoly and hike prices to undermine the changes. Self interest reactions of high cost structure businesses will be extreme. 30. Low cost technology remains - innovation? 7  e.g. clothing manufacturers using old sewing machines. If they can make things and run a business that complies with health and safety, environmental and labour laws, all with no deductions from tax (except for domestic salary and wages), then this shows their business is truly viable.  New technologies have to be truly efficient or we are wasting money on the new without it being better for society. For the new to be effective it must prove that by being able to price compete. The new must prove its value, not just be different.  innovation is not just high cost technology. Laws should encourage local enterprise and decentralised. Centralised wealth is a bureaucracy that tends to be inefficient, and risk adverse. 31. Automation - must prove itself by being price competitive  It is the future and will bring great benefits. But unless the people in society have enough money to pay for the things that machines produce, then automation could collapse.  Automation could open the way for costs of production to be extremely low and therefore prices to be extremely low.  Automation is a signal that employment in our economy will become even more focused on service related industries and that is often best delivered local and small scale. These proposals are a step that supports our economy’s transition purely by making sure high cost structures are not being favoured as currently. We don’t need to subsidise the trend. Automation has to prove itself by being price competitive (or will that die too?). 32. Domestic employees - pay tax in NZ  Salary and wages are deductible because they pay tax independently of the entity they are employed by and they have background costs that are not deductible expenses (training, health and safety, etc). These are just the cost of doing business.  Private contractors do not carry all the costs of employees. The privilege of undertaking this employment practise is that the cost becomes like any other contract cost and it is not deductible.  This means employment agencies contracts are not deductible. These people may be employee’s of the agencies.  Employment must not be a negative to a business otherwise nobody would earn income to pay for the items automation produces and all businesses go under. Proposal Three - Imputation and other related memorandum accounts should be ceased 33. Times have changed  This was a tax cut in disguise when introduced and tax rates were higher than they are now. Tax rates are now lower and the need for this type of reduction is less.  NZ’s tax rates for investors due to imputation are one of the lowest in the OECD but NZ is a small economy where the govt plays a much bigger part in role in providing services. Therefore it should not have some of the lowest tax rates in the world as govt has to do more here. 34. The justification for imputation is not consistent, i.e. to prevent double taxation.  Ordinary NZ’s pay tax on their income and then pay tax again for GST. (The argument went ,it is just a switch of how to pay so it isn’t double tax. But the proportional impact means that is not the case). Income tax rates are now below 15% . 35. Progressive tax structure  Taxing income, such as dividends, rather than wealth taxes is easier to administer and identify, and it is properly targeted to those who can afford to pay.  Removing imputation can be likened to the input of a more progressive tax structure. 36. More financial capital could be available to business.  Taxation of investors encourages them to consider leaving money in the company for development and growth so the revenue is maximised before investors decide to take the return and pay tax.  There could be reductions in taxes from extra revenue collected, e.g. to align the top rate or attempt a flat tax tax(?). Proposal Four - Introduce some restrictions on charitable status, and donations. 37. The advancement of religion  We can no longer determine the direct value of religion as in times past. It is different to how it used to be. It is far more fragmented and open to sects which can have dubious value for the individuals involved in them, or to society.  The positive and targeted outcomes of religion, e.g. relief of poverty, advancement of education are tangible and of clear benefit to society. Those objectives can be covered under the other charitable grounds.  The idea that a business can be run to fully support a religion without it paying a ‘society dividend’ seems incongruous with the religion sharing and directly contributing to the society it is part of. None of this affects the rules about religious people getting small stipends. Religion as a grounds to gain charitable status should be removed. 38. Donations  The current ability to turn all your taxation on income to a donation to charity undermines the need for every society member to contribute to society and to what makes it safe for the charity to function in.  Several millionaires have said they pay no tax as they can divert all tax to the causes or choices they prefer. Those who like cats may not agree with that sort of choice and would rather the contribution by the society dividend was to a wider cause where they can influence their democratically elected representative.  The ability to channel all tax to your personal choice undermines the need to contribute to society and the ability of elected representative to represent some peoples interests. Tax deductible donations should be restricted to $500 or something small. 39. The advancement of education  Is too wide as NZ already tries to provide free education. The grounds arose in the day’s when there was not universal education. 8  This ground is also from memory allowed to be a little more targeted which can favour the privileged. This ground should be modified to apply openly (i.e. to the general public and not defined groups or schools) to those who are economically disadvantaged or to the provision of assets where there are socially deprived people who can use those assets. Proposal Five - Remove GST as a tax (alternative taxes could be considered to replace if needed). 40. GST damages the demand driven economy  Keyes showed demand drives the economy more effectively. GST is helping to suck the life blood out of the services industries that our economy has come to heavily rely on.  The need is to put more money back into consumers pockets to help drive business.  Removing GST will make NZ businesses more competitive with overseas online providers.  Cost of imports will rise due to expenses not being deductible. That will send a signal to local suppliers or innovators that there is a market opportunity. Franchises, often overseas chains, that supply overseas product and have high cost structures will struggle more, see appendix B, but local owned businesses should finally thrive.  GST is stifling business because even though they don’t pay it, their customers do. 41. Inflation  GST removal combined with the removal of deductibility of expense would see less risk to the economy from inflation.  Combined with govt co-operation with some key local businesses could ensure price inflation is kept under control. e.g. The Warehouse (just guessing here) has retail and supermarket activities and they could be supported by the govt to ensure it has low prices. This would make sure other competitors do not act as a de-facto oligopoly and hike prices to undermine the changes.  The object of this is to make sure Inflation is not just an expectation of other price rises or is fear driven. 42. GST is a regressive tax Proposal Six - Tax evasion must be made an act of treason in our laws and the powers of the GCSB made available to help tackle it 43. The most significant threats to NZ are not from terrorists but the bleeding of the NZ economy from tax avoidance and evasion.  Tax avoidance is largely dealt with in these proposals.  Evasion is much more difficult as it involves illegal activity.  White collar crimes needs to be dealt with because of the serious and long term harm it can cause for ordinary NZ’ers. A more robust co- operation between IR and GCSB will go a long way to making tax more effectively policed and shutting down big crime.  The willingness to voluntarily comply will be increased as people will have more confidence that competitors are complying and not getting a tax advantage by not paying the ‘society dividend’.  The legal privilege extended to accountants for advice given to business on tax should be removed as the advice could be illegal. A business has an obligation to the society that it works within just as citizens do. Advice about evading paying the ‘society dividend’ is illegal and must be stopped. Just as crime or terrorist organisations are followed. Summary In this model business entities work in a context where tax is much hard to avoid and must shift their mindset (a shake up is good as things aren’t working great) as these proposals would mean:  business will receive strong and immediate economic signals about efficiency in cost structure.  Those firms that are more cost efficient will get the full benefit of their comparative advantage  No losses available to shelter profitable business from taxation.  Reduced scope for multi nationals on transfer pricing.  The elimination of Thin Capitalisation.  The removal of opportunities to re-characterise capital as income.  No tax benefits from the grouping of companies, which links to the ability to use losses.  No tax subsidy to inefficient business or wasteful/high cost business practises,  Entrepreneurs would carry the full risks of their business or investment decisions.  No tax subsidy to polluters.  Business getting back to running their business, with a full focus on efficiency.  Changes in society being truly based on the more efficient and effective low cost options.  As cost structures lower, more funds remain within business entities to drive investment.  More potential opportunity for smaller low cost business to arise and succeed.  A level tax playing field for all those in business.  Tax is paid according to earning power, (not cost structure) which is the intention of income tax.  A lot less regulation and red tape, making for a cheaper more streamlined tax administration These changes do not mean that govt can’t directly assist business, such as with Research and Development grants or tax credits. These changes do not mean the ruin of business but there would be adjustment and rationalisation away from top heavy large bureaucratic structures that now dominate much of our business Appendix A Principles guiding structural reform of Income Tax.  tax should not be costly to calculate or collect 9  have a strong argument for being fair. (You can never convince everybody or fit all situations).  Send positive signals to the economy promoting efficiency and effectiveness in economic behaviour.  Remove distortions in the financial capital market and free up more capital for investment. Assumptions in the proposed Income Tax system  The government/Inland Revenue should not inadvertently encourage certain behaviours or types of businesses. There should be a level playing field that does not favour inefficient or high cost structures.  Business people should be focused on making their business work, not calculating tax.  Tax is like a cost of business and accountancy is ancillary to business (not an income stream in itself).  Each company or legal entity or economic activity needs to stand or fall on its own merits.  Entrepreneurs and business risk takers should carry the risk in their ventures.  Tax should be paid according to the ability to earn money and not be influenced by how inefficient or costly their business structure is. Appendix B 1. Franchises - will become less profitable.  Revenue is often taken overseas by these structures and out of the NZ economy. Now they will pay more tax and their structure is not subsidised. This will really open up opportunities for small local businesses, e.g clothing, fashion, food. Retail could become more local.  These places will not disappear as the infrastructure will remain physically in place but they will have to carry their full cost structure into their prices making other low cost producers more competitive. The current deductibility rules favour the big existing players that push franchises. 2. Supermarkets - are now palaces to extract maximum revenue.  NZ already has a price vulnerability from just two main players in the market.  A rise in the price of the goods in these currently subsidised palaces would make other options more price competitive and bring back more local retail opportunities, e.g. farmers markets, online retail, community co-operatives, dairies.  (a confession - it is currently cheaper for me to go to the dairy for milk and bread despite it being double the price of the supermarket because of the money I spend on ‘addiction needs' when I go to a supermarket). 3. Steel or aluminium firms in NZ - are they viable?  They should be. They still return gross income.  The infrastructure is in place but would the return on capital be sufficient. There is plenty of spare capacity in the world if it is not. If these firms decide to close the assets, NZ could take them and offer them to see if there is a willing party to take over the running. This action would only be to prevent petulant behaviour to undermine the changes.  However, my own opinion is every business must live or die on its own merits and that is its ability to earn income. 4. Overseas film production companies in NZ - do these overseas firms pay tax in NZ?  The firms based in NZ and who support these productions presumably return tax to NZ.  If NZ wants to fund these firms/films then it should do so directly and we have a film fund to do so, it cold be expanded.  There is no need for deductions. If it is essential to have deductions of expenses then it can’t be a viable business model. It’s just a business like any other that has to pay its way. 5. Luxury shipbuilding - The input costs not deductible  There is still gross income so the business must be viable. The ‘society dividend’ impact would be passed onto the purchaser just like any other cost.  If the business is less competitive then it may have to change its return on capital expectations. 6. Fishing industry - costs would go up?  This is already a high cost structure business so a ‘society dividend’ is just another essential cost.  Fishing quota to NZ businesses only would help offset the disadvantage.  In all cases there can be specific things done to assist a business if the govt decides.  But the economic principles should remain consistent and the same and not seriously distorted by tax which is what currently happens. 7. Housing - will build costs go up?  The market is currently dysfunctional as it does not build enough houses to meet demand. Significant work needs to be done in this area, so impacts could be modified.  Most inputs are local so all businesses are in the same boat.  The net income a builder takes home has no need to change but some will be tempted to use the change to increase it. 8. Rental property - will rent go up?  Clearly many will see any change, ring fencing etc as the opportunity to raise rents to recover costs. This problem is not confined to this suggestion. Those who own property can get guaranteed social welfare payments of rent as well as making deductions from their other income. The current situation is unsustainable and damaging the NZ economy.  Property needs some measures to directly address the reaction problems that any tax changes will make.  I suggest, govt invites rental property owners (those interested) upon the new tax law taking effect, to transfer their property to the Government (at an agreed value depending on condition and compliance with a building warrant of fitness), but the money is held in a govt bond for up to 5 years or more ( because property is a long term investment for an invesor). Options to roll these forward could exist. Govt could then raise money by selling the property back to first home buyers (at an affordable price with the rest to be held to be paid back later either as income increase or when the property is sold) or those on low incomes through rent to buy schemes. This would pull demand out of 10 the housing market and increase supply of the existing houses - there is less chance then for some rental properties to be left empty. No matter what option we still have to build more capacity.  If these properties bought are close together (a caveat could be held over the properties) then opportunities for medium density housing builds could open up, with the existing residences have guarantees of accomodation in them.  Overall this could reduce the social welfare liability of paying markets rents to owners. It would also spread the cost over many years. 9. Petrol retail - the existing big business would struggle?  Opportunities for small simpler operators to start up and break away should be encouraged by law changes. Current practises by companies are deliberately punitive to discourage this. With more smaller operators the opportunity to collude on price is reduced. 10. Employee’s overseas - become more costly?  For example, some businesses run overseas call centres and the cost is deductible from gross income and those people employed do not pay tax to NZ.  Where to have the call centre is the business’s choice but it should not be at the expense of the NZ taxpayer having our tax base undermined. 11. Public transport - public utility  Trains are such big costs such that they can’t viably be run in NZ privately. Privatisation did not work.  Little benefit has been gained from privatising local bus services as costs of using public transport are very high and priced to match alternative transport options. This maximises revenue rather than public utility and the environment. The cost of making a return to shareholders is an extra cost that did not exist before.  The return to shareholders will be lower and the likelihood of public transport buses being like trains is high. This is not the end of the world. 12. Oil/mineral exploration -  Special rules already exist for these. If the govt wanted some special rules it could easily allow it. It could even be directly funded. Otherwise they would have to pay their own way. The choices and risks sit with them.  The current depression in world prices means it is not hugely likely they will be successful. The current environmental crisis and accompanying mass extinction means this is not a bad thing.  Many many years in the future our retained reserves have some exceptional value.

Submission in relation to the Future of Tax By Steven Moe, Parry Field Lawyers, Christchurch Tax Working Group Submission – the future of tax Monday 30 April 2018 Submitted by email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Introduction My name is Steven Moe and I work at Parry Field Lawyers in Christchurch. I appreciate the opportunity to give recommendations to the Tax Working Group on the future of tax. I would be happy to discuss this submission if that would be of assistance by phone. We act for a number of different clients wishing to form, or running a social enterprise. We see time and time again the issues that arise out having to choose between following a charitable trust structure, or a company structure. This submission argues that a different type of tax should be imposed on social enterprises to encourage the growth of that sector. Tax change proposed for Social Enterprises Summary: We argue that social enterprises are a new way of doing business and often do work which traditionally has been done by registered charities (which are tax exempt). We argue that a new legal entity form is needed and that part of that would involve some tax concessions for such entities. Longer explanation: In the classic children’s story by Hans Christian Andersen, an emperor is given new clothes which are invisible to those who are unfit to see them. So no-one dares tell him he isn’t wearing anything at all. That’s a bit like the current legal structures available for someone who has an idea to start a new venture which incorporates purpose beyond making profit – they are faced with a difficult choice. Do they become a company, which carries assumptions that it is for profit, with less focus on social good? Or a charity, which carries assumptions that it is not-for-profit, focusing on helping others. Neither really fit a “social enterprise” the term used to describe businesses that act for both profit and purpose. Social enterprises combine entrepreneurial spirit with a strong dose of ‘heart’ as they work to make a real difference in our world. And it is not just part of a temporary trend. The 1,600 people who assembled last year in Christchurch at the Social Enterprise World Forum demonstrate that. But how should social enterprises set themselves up? Would a legal structure created for these ventures help? Let’s walk for a minute down each of the usual roads taken to map out that answer. Choosing a company structure has advantages because it is well known, and provides a return of profit to the founder through dividends or selling shares. Investors are easier to attract, although they probably won’t understand a business that exists for more than profit. And, in fact, directors may feel a legal obligation to maximise shareholder returns. While the purpose- driven company may solve a critical social or environmental problem, otherwise addressed by expensive government programmes, it will be hard to access any funding from that source as they will not be a charity, which is usually required. Down the other fork in the road, a charity may offer the ability to access grant funding, although the danger is that it may come or go. People assume a charity is doing good, and an advantage that flows from such an assumption (if it meets strict charitable purposes) is that donations are tax deductible. However, despite years of a founder’s blood, sweat and tears – \[1\] which every new venture requires – the founder will not be able to have private gain, apart from a market rate salary. Neither option truly suits our social entrepreneur, a conclusion explored in detail in the recent Ākina Foundation paper about the inadequacy of current legal structures. What would help is a “Social Enterprise Company”, a new legal structure which takes the best of both roads described above, as well as a dash of learning from Scotland, Canada and the USA where these structures already exist. Increased legitimacy would result as the purpose is baked into the DNA through clear statements in the constitution, reporting on how it is travelling (to prevent abuse), and the ability to return capped dividends to shareholders so profits go back into the purpose. What’s the pitch to you in Government on the case for change and in particular the tax aspects? We will end up with tax paying companies, that are also uniquely positioned to give back to their communities in ways that improve the environment, or care for disadvantaged social groups as they combine both making profit and acting with purpose. However, what if the social enterprise companies were given some tax concessions for that part of their business which would otherwise be “charitable” and tax exempt? That would be world leading and really promote social enterprise as an option. This new legal structure would ensure that when that light bulb moment happens, social entrepreneurs don’t need to reach for the number 8 wire in order to adapt, and then make do with the ill-fitting legal forms that currently exist. Social enterprises need ‘new clothes’ that fit better than the current legal structures we have. All of us want to lead lives of purpose and meaning, and more businesses are seeking to position themselves in that direction as the old paradigms are tossed off the throne that profit and private wealth creation is king. New Zealand has the chance to be a true world leader through a new social enterprise legal structure that other countries would look to as an example, and which the next generations that follow us demand. Recommendations The comments above outline the reasoning for our recommendation that a different form of tax should be imposed on social enterprises. Currently there is no legal structure that fits a social enterprise (which is both for profit and for purpose). Social entrepreneurs are forced to make the decision between forming a charitable trust or a company. If they choose to form a charitable trust, it carries the assumption that they are not-for-profit. If they choose to form a company, tax will be imposed as it normally is regardless of the fact that they are giving back to the community. If a different form of tax was imposed on social enterprises, this would be a world-leading step for New Zealand. It would work to allow social enterprises to act for both purpose and profit as they are not tied down by the reporting obligations that come with a charitable trust or the tax obligations that come with a company not acting for the good of the community. The more social enterprises that are properly equipped to give back to the community while still making a profit, the better. Conclusion In conclusion, the current legal structures and consequently tax systems do not adequately fit social enterprises. The imposition of a different form of tax would be a step in the right direction to making the running of social enterprises more practical.

Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand 30 April 2018 Submitters: Cherry Morgan Sally Liggins Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback to the Tax Working Group. We are experienced public health practitioners with experience primarily in the prevention areas of tobacco, alcohol and obesity. We are aware that our submission will be released on the Tax Working Groups’ website, with our email withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply. Tobacco, obesity and alcohol are leading risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) including cancer, yet all are preventable. Our submission will focus on supporting taxes on unhealthy products (tobacco, alcohol and sugary drinks) that will improve health and reduce inequalities. Taxing harmful products There is clear evidence that additional taxes on harmful products incentivises positive behaviour change. Such taxes are also required to reduce consumption and uptake of harmful products. Increasing taxes on harmful products will also help address negative externalities as well as align the consumer price with the true health, social and other costs of the product. We recommend: Tobacco tax 1. Increasing tobacco excise tax by 20% (above inflation) annually. 2. Setting a minimum retail price for tobacco products. \[1\] 3. Dedicating tax revenue for tobacco control to achieve Smokefree 2025 and supporting quit services. Alcohol tax 4. Raising alcohol excise tax by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% 5. Adjusting excise rates annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) 6. Taxing alcohol content, not the volume of the beverage 7. Setting a minimum Unit Pricing Policy to prevent the availability of very cheap alcohol 8. Increasing the level of tax revenue earmarked for health promotion and harm prevention, research and treatment services Sugary Drinks tax 9. Introduce a tax on sugary drinks that targets manufacturers and importers 10. Revenue raised from taxes on sugary drinks be earmarked for prevention Tobacco taxes Tobacco tax increases are the most effective way of reducing smoking prevalence, initiation, consumption and inequalities in smoking. i Continued tax increases are important if we are to achieve Government’s goal of Smokefree 2025 of under 5% of adults smoking. Tobacco taxes can be justified as a tool to reduce consumption and to address negative externalities of tobacco. Tobacco tax increases effective During New Zealand’s recent period of annual tax increases, smoking prevalence has further declined along with tobacco sales. Tobacco tax rises have saved and will continue to save thousands of lives in Aotearoa. Tax increases help people to quit and remain smokefree. Crucially, tobacco taxes are very effective in helping prevent young people from experimenting with smoking, becoming addicted, and enduring a lifetime of addiction. During 2001-2010, tobacco tax only increased in line with inflation. However, since 2010, there have been annual 10 % increases in tobacco tax, in addition to inflation adjustments. The larger increases have made a difference. The evidence shows that tobacco consumption per person reduced during 2010-2016 at about double the rate of that during 2000-2010. ii The difference can also be seen for 'current' (at least monthly) smoking amongst young adults (aged 18 to 24), a key priority group. During 2006/7 to 2011/12, the percentage of smoking barely changed (from 27.7% to 27.3%). However, from 2011/12 to 2016/17, smoking among this group declined significantly from 27.3 per cent to 20 per cent. iii For Māori, there have been encouraging results. Daily smoking among Māori fell by only 1.5% from 2006/7 to 2011/12 (from 39.2% to 37.7%), but fell by 5.2 per cent between 2011/12 and 2016/17 (from 37.7% to 32.5%). iv Modelling from Otago University suggests that these benefits to Māori are likely to continue. Reducing inequalities There has been some concern expressed about the financial harm to smokers who don’t respond to tobacco tax increases. However, there is evidence that such financial harm is small relative to the high level of harm from smoking. v Minimum tobacco price A minimum tobacco price would help ensure tax increases are even more effective. Currently tobacco companies reduce the effect of tobacco tax increases on smokers by phasing in price increases in stages. Tobacco companies also load extra tax onto higher price brands to enable lower priced tobacco to remain at low prices. Dedicate tax revenue for prevention and quit services We strongly support revenue from tobacco taxes being dedicated for tobacco prevention and supporting people to quit. Ethically, the only justification for taxing tobacco is for health gain, not general revenue. New Zealanders, including smokers, are far more supportive of tobacco tax increases when they know that tax revenue will be used for tobacco control or supporting people to quit. We recommend: • Increasing tobacco excise tax by 20% (above inflation) annually. • Setting a minimum retail price for tobacco products. • Dedicating tax revenue for tobacco control to achieve Smokefree 2025 and supporting quit services. Further increases in tobacco taxes are very likely to produce further health gain, reduce inequalities and generate cost- savings for the New Zealand health system. Continued tax increases are important to achieve Government’s goal of Smokefree 2025. Significantly increase excise tax on alcohol Alcohol is a major contributor to the overall burden of death, disease and injury in New Zealand. vi Alcohol is also a Group 1 carcinogen (the highest level) vii and a risk factor for many cancers. Costs of alcohol-related harm The estimated cost of alcohol-related harm to NZ society was $5.3 billion in 2005/6 . viii Alcohol use is a major contributor to health costs, lost productivity for businesses and to financial costs to society with crime, police and court time and incarceration. We also recognise the harm alcohol has on other people including violent crime and road traffic deaths and injuries. All these problems help justify higher alcohol taxes. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. We believe that the rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol- related harm to society. Hazardous drinking Hazardous drinking increases the risk of adverse health and social outcomes for the drinker as well as others. The 2011/12 New Zealand Health Survey estimated that 530,000 New Zealanders aged 15 years and over (15 percent of the adult population) are hazardous drinkers. ix In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers in New Zealand than in 2012. x Alcohol consumption increasing Nearly every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. Women have increased their alcohol consumption the most. There continues to be significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori. Reducing alcohol consumption is an important and under- emphasised strategy that can help to reduce alcohol-related harm and other health and social costs. Raising the tax on alcohol will provide an incentive to reduce consumption and reduce the growing number of hazardous drinkers. Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been. Increasing the tax on alcohol has been widely recommended by health experts and through the comprehensive Law Commission Report. xi Tax alcohol content There is an opportunity to align the level of tax to the alcohol content of beverages rather than the type of drink (e.g. for wine). This would be fairer as currently some beverages are taxed by volume and others by alcohol content. It is the alcohol that causes the harm, not the type of beverage. Reducing Inequities Alcohol tax could particularly help prevent hazardous drinkers in low socio economic communities in New Zealand. This is because “Adult drinkers in the most deprived areas were 1.7 times more likely to be hazardous drinkers than adults in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnic differences”. xii Low income heavy drinkers are shown to benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Minimum Unit Pricing We also recommend a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to prevent the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. Dedicate tax revenue Currently a very small proportion of alcohol tax goes to the Health Promotion Agency for alcohol-related health promotion. We strongly support increasing the tax revenue earmarked for prevention, including public health/ prevention work DHBs and NGOs are undertaking. We recommend: • Raising alcohol excise tax by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% • Adjusting excise rates annually to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) • Taxing alcohol content, not the volume of the beverage • Setting a minimum Unit Pricing Policy to prevent the availability of very cheap alcohol • Increasing the level of tax revenue earmarked for health promotion and harm prevention, research and treatment services Introduce a tax on sugary drinks The Government needs to urgently act to prevent the growing obesity epidemic in New Zealand. The Minister of Health is interested in considering a broad tax on sugar in food and drink. The Tax Working Group can introduce a tax on sugary drinks as the first key step to reducing obesity in New Zealand. This would align with the World Health Organisation’s recommendation to tax sugary drinks. xiii Revenue generated by a sugary drinks tax could be earmarked for obesity prevention initiatives particularly in low income communities. Obesity epidemic in New Zealand Obesity is linked to a long list of health conditions, including heart disease, diabetes and many types of cancer. Obesity is projected to overtake smoking as the leading risk factor causing health loss in New Zealand. xiv New Zealand has the third highest rate of adult obesity and the fourth highest rate of childhood obesity in OECD countries. xv In New Zealand a staggering two thirds of adults (2.4 million) are obese or overweight. One third of children are obese or overweight. xvi Furthermore, our rates are rising. Overweight children are more likely to develop into obese adults increasing the risk of cancer and other diseases. Obesity is the biggest preventable cause of cancer after smoking and increases the risk of 11 cancers. xvii Children and adults living in low income neighbourhoods are much more likely to be overweight or obese. Why tax sugary drinks? It is well established that excess sugar is a major contributor to weight gain, obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Sugary drinks are the main source of sugar for children and young people. Recent research found there is more sugar in New Zealand drinks compared to Australia, Canada and the UK. xviii A sugary drinks tax should be the first food/drink tax in New Zealand as it: • has the strongest evidence base • is focused on protecting children ( from dental decay, obesity and diabetes in adolescence and cancers in later life) • is a product with no nutritional value and empty calories The levy can be targeted at the beverage industry thereby promoting reformulation of the sugar content of drinks. WHO and the World Cancer Research Fund, xix along with The New Zealand Medical Association, the NZ Dental Association and many other national organisations recommend taxing sugary drinks. More countries are taxing sugary drinks A number of countries and American cities have introduced a tax on sugary drinks to address obesity and diabetes epidemics. Studies from Mexico, Hungary, Berkley, California and Philadephia, USA, all documented significant declines in sugary drinks consumption following introduction of sugary drinks tax. Low income communities, where obesity and diabetes have the highest prevalence, saw the largest declines in sugary drinks consumed. xx, xxi The UK recently introduced a “soft drink industry levy”. A number of UK beverage manufacturers reformulated their beverages with a lower sugar content ahead of the sugar tax being implemented on 1 April 2018. One study reported a 10% reduction in sugar content of energy drinks in the UK. Public support sugary drinks tax The majority of the New Zealand public support a tax on sugary drinks with a strong increase in support since February 2014. xxii Public support would be strengthened further if revenue generated from a sugary drinks tax was used to support community wellbeing initiatives e.g. sports facilities in schools, fruit in schools, healthy school lunches, school dental services. Reducing inequalities Young people, especially Māori and Pacific youth, consume the highest amounts of sugary drinks in New Zealand. The WHO recognises that young people and low income consumers get the greatest health benefit from taxes as they are the most influenced by price. xxiii A tax on sugary drinks provides an evidenced based approach to reduce health inequalities. Source: Ministry of Health Some are concerned about a sugary drinks tax disproportionately impacting on low income communities. However high sugary drink intake, and its negative health consequences, disproportionately impacts on low income communities. Sugary drinks deliver empty calories with little or no nutrition. Evidence from countries that have introduced a sugary drinks tax found a higher decrease in consumption of sugary drinks in low socioeconomic communities. We recommend: • Introducing a tax on sugary drinks that targets manufacturers and importers • Revenue raised from taxes on sugary drinks be earmarked for prevention Appendix A: Facts on impacts from smoking, obesity and alcohol Smoking • Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in New Zealand. Every year 5000 people die in New Zealand from smoking related illness xxiv with an estimated 1700 people being Aucklanders. • Every year more than 5000 New Zealand children start smoking xxv , on average at 14 years. • The Ministry of Health has acknowledged that smoking is a major contributing factor to health inequalities between Māori and non- Māori. Obesity • Obesity is projected to overtake tobacco as the leading risk factor causing health loss in New Zealand. • Obesity is the single biggest preventable cause of cancer after tobacco xxvi and is a significant and growing problem in New Zealand. • New Zealand has the third highest rate of adult obesity and the fourth highest rate of childhood obesity in OECD countries. xxvii • Overweight or obesity are major risk factors for 11 cancers, as well as many other chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. xxviii,xxix There is convincing evidence that greater body weight causes cancers of the oesophagus, pancreas, bowel, endometrium, stomach, gallbladder, liver, kidney, ovarian, prostate and breast (in post- menopausal women). xxx • Two thirds of New Zealand adults and one third of children are either overweight or obese. xxxi • The burden of obesity is not equally shared with Māori and Pacific people and those living in low socioeconomic neighbourhoods more likely to be obese or overweight. • Obesity costs New Zealand $849 million or 0.3% of our GDP in healthcare and productivity costs. xxxii Alcohol • Alcohol is a major contributor to the overall burden of death, disease and injury in New Zealand. xxxiii • Hazardous drinking increases the risk of adverse health and social outcomes for the drinker as well as others. The 2011/12 New Zealand Health Survey estimated that 530,000 New Zealanders aged 15 years and over (15 percent of the adult population) are hazardous drinkers. xxxiv • The estimated cost of alcohol-related harm to NZ society was $5 billion in 2005/6. xxxv • Early initiation into alcohol use increases the risk of being a heavy drinker and experiencing alcohol disorders later in life. Young people experience greater harm from alcohol consumption. • Alcohol has been classified as a Group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organisations’s International Agency for Research on Cancer since 1988. xxxvi Over 240 cancer deaths in New Zealand in 2007 were attributable to alcohol consumption. • Alcohol is a risk factor for many cancers with the risk increasing with the level of consumption. The strength of evidence for a causal relationship between alcohol use and cancer is of the highest level. xxxvii The volume of alcohol consumed over one’s lifetime is important in determining the risk of developing cancer. • Breast cancer is the leading cause of alcohol-related death among New Zealand women for both Māori and non-Māori. Even low levels of alcohol consumption, e.g. up to 1 drink per day, increases the risk of breast cancer for females. xxxviii Alcohol consumption of more than 3 drinks per day has been estimated to increase the risk for breast cancer by 40-50%. xxxix i Hiscock R, Branston JR, Mc Neill A, Hitchman SC, Partos TR, Gilmore AB.

Submission to the Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax From: Lorna Crane Tax Working Group Secretariat, P.O. Box 3724 Wellington 6140 I appreciate the democratic nature of the Tax Working Group’s invitation to make submissions on the Future of Tax. In support of the Government’s Tax Working Group’s efforts to identify a fairer tax system for New Zealand I offer the following personal beliefs, ideas and suggestions. 1. I do not believe that the current fiscal system in New Zealand adequately meets the target of “Fairness for All”.  The concept of sharing the cost of expected public funded services (health care, policing, justice, education, etc) may be well understood by most New Zealanders but the logistics in assessing (working out what is payable) and making those payments is not easy and can be unnecessarily stressful for many.  The system is tilted in favour of those who have already accumulated wealth and leaves young people at the start of their working lives at a severe disadvantage.  There are disincentives within the current tax system which cause employees to pause to calculate possible losses to their income rather than fearlessly work extra hours. Some do the extra hours, work really hard and then find that they are actually penalised for their effort. 2. We should harness advances in Digital Technology to devise a new system for creation, collection and distribution of “money”. 3. The wealth of the nation need not be measured against fixed assets but measured by  the wellbeing of the population  natural resources  manpower  virtual creativity  intellectual property \[1\] 4. I support the introduction of a Universal Basic income for New Zealand citizens from birth to death. This will  allow every individual to access the necessities of life without fear.  reduce or redirect Social Service staffing, primarily in Work and Income, but demand for staff in other support services could also be reduced  stimulate small business through more available spending power  allow people to study and further their skills  free artists to be creative  allow parents to spend more time caring for their families  reduce crime  engender greater community spirit and encourage more volunteers I do not believe this will  deter people from working to improve their situation  lessen the desire of individuals to be productive  remove incentives for people to excel in their chosen fields  reduce the numbers of Teachers, Doctors, Police, etc Special consideration will need to be given to  transitioning Permanent Residents to Citizenship  possible increase in births  immigration quota 5. I support a flat rate Financial Transaction Tax to be levied on all withdrawals, including  Cash  Transfers, except to “own” account  Payments to overseas entities (which covers purchases made over the internet) The rate should be set high enough to match current GST and Personal Income Taxes Difficulties with regulation may be encountered because of foreign ownership of banks. However, if payment of the UBI is restricted to a New Zealand owned bank a significant part of the problem could be easily solved. Once overseas banks are aware of this they are likely to also enter into an agreement to FTT collection. 6. In conjunction with the FTT I propose that Personal Income Tax and GST be discontinued. I consider that a Capital Gains Tax will not be necessary as property sales would be covered by the FTT. 7. I support the idea of Special Target Taxes levied on products that are deemed harmful, with the intention of changing consumer behaviour, e.g. cigarettes, alcohol and sugary drinks. 8. I propose that a mechanism for discouraging exorbitantly high personal salaries be considered.  Sky city and Fonterra are examples where CEO remuneration is considered morally obscene. There will always be people who wish to evade their responsibilities and try to find loopholes in any form of taxation. I hope the Tax Working Group will come up with a recommended plan that will limit the opportunities for such avoidance. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this forum. I do not wish to appear in person. Lorna Crane, \[1\]

Submission to the Tax Working Group / Te Awheawhe Take Paul Wernham 30th April 2018 New Zealand has endured the Neoliberal experiment begun by the NZ Labour Party in the 1980’s. It has bought about significant changes through the taxation regime. Through alternate governments we have felt keenly the gradual dismantling of the social welfare reforms of the Michael Savage government of the 1930’s. In order to help my own understanding of taxation and society I begin my submission with two quotes. One from Margaret Thatcher and the other from Thomas Piketty. Thatcher is quoted as saying “There is no such thing as society. There is living tapestry of men and women and people and the beauty of that tapestry and the quality of our lives will depend upon how much each of us is prepared to take responsibility for ourselves and each of us prepared to turn round and help by our own efforts those who are unfortunate” (in an interview with Margaret Thatcher in Women’s Own in 1987) which reflects the dynamic of neoliberal thinking that is still prevalent today. With the introduction of “Rogernomics” (neoliberalism) to New Zealand, much has changed, and we are now finally recognising the effects of that change. There are a number of chickens coming home to roost. Guy Standing in a paper entitled “Meet the precariat, the new global class fuelling the rise of populism” describes one of those “chickens”, “the precariat lives in economic uncertainty, usually in chronic unsustainable debt, in which one shock, mistaken decision or illness could tip them over the edge into the under-class, cut adrift from society and probably condemned to social illness or an early death.” We are seeing the massive rise in inequality between the haves and the have nots in society, the rise of homelessness and child poverty, the running down of health and education the list is constantly growing as we learn of underfunding is so many areas of our lives. Those “unfortunates” we individuals of the “living tapestry” need to help? Which brings me to Piketty “Taxation is not a technical matter. It is preeminently a political and philosophical issue, perhaps the most important of all political issues. Without taxes, society has no common destiny, and collective action is impossible.” (Pg493, Piketty – Capital) The contrast between individual responsibility and collective action is the point I wish to make with this submission. If we are to believe both Jacinda Ardern and Winston Peters re the failure of capitalism, (can I read neoliberal capitalism?) will this sentiment be reflected in the work of the ‘Tax Working Group’? In the “TAX REVIEW 2001 – FINAL PAPER”, the introduction has this comment “This Review was asked to consider whether the architecture of our tax system is adequate for today’s needs. We conclude that radical restructuring is not required. The broad architecture of the tax system is sound. That contrasts with the conclusions of the last general review of our tax system – the 1982 McCaw Report. Reporting almost twenty years ago, McCaw concluded that the then tax system needed a major overhaul. We generally conclude that the subsequent reform programme has been a success and should not be reversed. The essential questions of tax policy design do not change. The main issues now are the same as they were for McCaw, namely: • the level of tax ; • the appropriate bases for tax; • the detailed definition of those bases; and • the rates of tax that should apply.” How does this review panel feel about those comments today? Has anything changed to reconsider those remarks? Wealth inequality, property speculation, house price increases, high levels of child poverty, homelessness, the rise of the precariat, underfunding of health, welfare and education ... that list has grown quite large since that report in 2001. Will these issues be addressed in your report this time? \[1\] On page 9 of the “TAX REVIEW 2001”: “We do not support implementing a general wealth tax in New Zealand, nor reintroducing an estate duty. We conclude that neither of these taxes would fill a gap in the income tax base. We recommend that the Government not implement a cash-flow tax, given the severe transitional problems that would arise. In the Issues Paper, we indicated our support of the overall design of GST and did not propose any significant changes. In particular, we did not believe that a strong case could be made for either narrowing the GST base or for taxing some goods or services at lower rates. We have not altered our view of GST, and do not recommend any material reform. We endorse our original recommendations that gift and cheque duties be repealed. We do not support the introduction of a financial transaction tax, first, because of harmful cascading effects, and secondly, because we do not consider it a superior substitute for GST. We do not support the introduction of a tax on short-term foreign exchange flows popularly known as a Tobin Tax, as we believe that the goal of reducing exchange rate volatility by means of a Tobin-type tax is misguided. We are also unconvinced that a Tobin tax imposed by a single country would be effective in furthering such a goal.” The 2001 Tax Review appear to be very supportive of the reforms of the Douglas/Richardson era, and dismissive of areas of taxation such as wealth taxes and a financial transaction tax, that a “ Tobin-type tax is misguided”. What is the position of this tax working group, do you come with preconceived notions of what is, or is not, possible? When the Labour Party introduced the so called Rogernomic reforms (neoliberalism) in the 1980’s, this country underwent major changes, not least the tax reforms. “New Zealand went through a major program of tax reform in the 1980’s. The top marginal rate of income tax was reduced from 66% to 33% (changed to 39% in April 2000, 38% in April 2009 and 33% on 1 October 2010) and corporate income tax rate from 48% to 33% (changed to 30% in 2008 and to 28% on 1 October 2010). Goods and services tax was introduced, initially at a rate of 10% (then 12.5% and now 15%, as of 1 October 2010). Land taxes were abolished in 1992.\[Taxation in New Zealand, from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\] This effectively shifted the levels of taxation from a progressive tax system into a broad based tax system. Goods & Services Tax (GST) The ‘broad base’ of the Goods and Services tax was applied universally thus making it simple to implement and hard to avoid. But also one which had greater impact on the less well off than those with greater wealth. This tax now set at 15% irrespective of the product or service, from womens sanitary products, all food and local government rates. These items are expensive enough without the added tax. If you are in the growing lowest socioeconomic sector this makes the cost of living 15% more expensive. It has hurt that sector disproportionately than those in the upper socioeconomic sectors. It is long overdue for review and I expect the Tax Working Group to closely examine the damaging effects of this universal tax and provide suggestions for alternatives to this iniquitous tax. It is my recommendation that GST be phased out of the tax revenue system. Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) A light weight comment for a heavy weight team ... ? “We do not support the introduction of a financial transaction tax, first, because of harmful cascading effects, and secondly, because we do not consider it a superior substitute for GST.” \[TAX REVIEW 2001\] I would like to ask the Tax Working Group what this actually means, apart from no way! What harmful cascading effects? The terrifying concept of the financial sector paying a tax on its operations? There appears to be many arguments for and against an FTT, and that in the end it might be difficult to implement and would not necessarily collect high levels of taxation. That it would need international cooperation adds to the difficulty of application of a FTT. I support Brian Eastons hope that “in the depths of the bureaucracy, a small team is pondering such a tax for New Zealand. They have probably already concluded it won’t generate a lot of revenue – perhaps $100 million after the clumsy stamp duties are abolished – although any extra revenue would be welcome. More importantly, it would reduce some of the dangers that high-spinning financial transactions expose the economy to. And it would do so without wrecking the constructive contribution to prosperity that specialisation provides.” \[Macroeconomics & Money, Regulation & Taxation, Brian Easton, March 2012.\] Oxfam has called for “The Robin Hood tax (also known as the Financial Transactions Tax) is a tax levied at a very low level, say 0.05 per cent (5c for every $100), on all financial transactions such as stocks, bonds, commodity trading and currency transactions. At such a low level, the tax would have no impact on our everyday shopping or even buying foreign currency for a holiday. But it would raise significant amounts of money when levied on big financial institutions and speculators that move hundreds of millions of dollars around daily in casino-style trading. The funds raised from the tax could be used to make a real difference to people living in poverty and facing the devastating impacts of climate change.” What I call for is a comprehensive and unbiased review of a Financial Transaction Tax as it be applied to the New Zealand taxation system. Could it be possible for a Financial Transaction Tax to be introduced as GST is removed? The settings for the rates could be set at levels that the majority of working people would not be unduly affected by. Some suggest this tax could be set at 0.01%-0.05% on financial transactions. I would like to see a comprehensive discussion by the Tax Working Group on the pros and cons of a FTT, not a glib statement of dismissal. Wealth taxes A staggering 28 per cent of all wealth created in New Zealand in 2017 went to the richest 1 per cent of Kiwis. While the 1.4 million people who make up the poorest 30 per cent of the population got barely 1 per cent, according to new research released by Oxfam today. \[Richest 1% of Kiwis bagged 28% of all wealth created last year Oxfam 2018\] This report goes on to say: “Let’s have a national conversation about tax. Labour’s Tax Working Group and the opportunity it provides New Zealand to examine the structure, fairness and balance of the New Zealand tax system, is a huge opportunity to ensure our economy reflects the fairness that is innately Kiwi. It also offers an opportunity for New Zealand to provide an example to many developing countries in using a fairer tax system to reduce the extreme gap between the very rich and the very poor. Oxfam’s report includes a strong list of recommendations, backed up by experts, for both governments and multi-nationals that can help us achieve this.” I am fully supportive of this call, and look to the Tax Working Group to put forward taxation measure that will redress the balance of wealth in New Zealand. Capital Gains taxes to taxes on wealth, have various forms and implications, and it is my hope that the Tax Working Group can provide a range of options for New Zealanders to consider. Progressive taxation Thomas Piketty in his book ‘Capital’ says “a progressive tax is a crucial component of the social state: it played a central role in its development and in the transformation of the structure of inequality in the twentieth century, and remains important for ensuring the viability of the social state in the future.” (pg 497 Piketty – Capital) Can the Tax Working Group explain why the Lange / Douglas government made those moves towards a flat tax option? Can this working group explain those decisions in the light of the major societal changes that I have tried to highlight in this submission? I ask the Tax Working Group to investigate progressive taxation for income and company taxes. That thresholds above $70,000 be considered and higher percentage rates be set for those levels. I would also like to ask the Tax Working Group why there is a tax spike at $70,000. Is there an issue here that needs to be addressed with regard to more wealthy people finding ways to reduce their levels of taxation? Can such “loopholes” be repaired for the common good? Tax avoidance I support Oxfam’s call for New Zealand to support a UN Tax Body to tackle tax avoidance Points for consideration: • The Tax Working Group should extend the remit of its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system. • The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated that the lack of tax transparency is a global problem that needs a global solution. • Developing countries are missing out on $150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance • Tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. • Governments must act together to force this system to end. Countries must work collaboratively to remedy the system. • New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms. This will be most easily done through a new UN-based global tax body. • A UN Tax body will ensure all countries participate on an equal footing and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. Council of Trade Unions economist Bill Rosenberg said tax avoidance was a worldwide issue which had led to the loss of more than $3.1 trillion in annual tax revenue. “If governments internationally, including New Zealand, could do more to track down dodged taxes we might not be facing the degree of financial austerity and government cuts that we are seeing around the world.” (Stuff Aug 26 2012) Universal Basic Income (UBI) My final request for the Tax Working Group is to review the taxation issues around a UBI. The paper written by Max Harris and Sebastiaan Bierema for “The Future of Work” - A Universal Basic Income for New Zealand is an encouraging sign of hope for a less precariat future for New Zealand. “A UBI could create a more efficient tax and welfare system. There are currently 53 different – overlapping or complementary – benefit packages available to people in different situations, not including student loans or the vast array of tax exemptions available. A UBI would replace most or all existing benefits. This single payment would, commentators say, be easier to implement. Further evidence is needed to back up this claim, but the argument is intuitively appealing.” Indeed it is, and clearly needs to be given closer investigations regarding the taxation aspect of a UBI. I am not a particular supporter of Gareth Morgan, with his suggestion that a UBI of $11,000 be funded through a flat tax of 30%. I would hope the Tax Working Group might research many other options available to deliver the costs of maintaining such a UBI of around that figure of $10-$11,000. Can the Tax Working Group provide a paper discussing a UBI and look at the options of that using a progressive tax base as opposed to a flat rate of tax? Conclusion It is very encouraging that this coalition government is addressing issues that have languished under the previous regime. Their ability to provide tax relief for the most wealthy and underfund the most necessary functions of government for the rest, is not actual government, but an abuse of power for the redistribution of wealth to the select few. I am with Thomas Picketty “Without taxes, society has no common destiny, and collective action is impossible”. Since the 1980’s, the “broadening’ of taxation has hit wage and salary earners hard. It is time to declare the neoliberal experiment a failure to deliver to middle and low income sectors, to the increasing benefit of the top 10% and above particularly. A reversal of this economic programme is needed urgently to redress the balance to establish that elusive “decent society”. The Tax Working Group can show that collective responsibility towards society is possible through a taxation system that is to the benefit of all New Zealanders, and sharing that fairly across our community. I would like to thank the Tax Working Group for this opportunity to have my say on the future of tax in New Zealand. Paul Wernham.

Institute for Governance and Policy Studies School of Government Victoria University of Wellington 30 April 2018 This submission is from Dr Simon Chapple, Director of the IGPS and Toby Moore of the School of Government. \[1\] General comments We note the very short deadlines for submissions – six weeks from the Submissions Background Paper to the cut-off date. We observe that such short deadlines are not necessarily conducive to well-informed public submissions. In addition, while we note that a separate consideration of the tax-welfare interface is discussed, the scope and timing of this review is undefined at time of writing. The risk here is that there is a failure of coordination between the two processes and important issues fall between the gaps. To mitigate these risks, this submission addresses some important issues in relation to taxes and benefits where we consider there is a significant risk that the issues will not be fully covered in the unannounced second process. Finally, it would be remiss of us not to note the various restrictions in the terms of reference of the working group in terms of what is off the agenda. We observe that these restrictions make little or no sense in terms of the criteria provided for the assessment of the efficacy of a tax system in the Tax Working Group’s own submission paper. Consequently we must regard these exclusions as most regrettable for the purposes of rationally developing a coherent tax system. What are the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? The main tax challenges we identify include the following: A. An insufficiently broad definition of income for income tax purposes B. Lack of high quality data on comprehensive income in our sample and administrative surveys to assess true equity and efficiency issues C. Inconsistent definitions of income across the distribution in terms of the tax-benefit system D. Inconsistent treatment of units for the purposes of tax-benefit assessment across the household income distribution E. An insufficiently broad definition of value added for GST F. Low effective income taxation rates on tax payers self-reporting business income and expenditure G. Lack of attention to taxation where supply is inelastic H. Fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes is likely to become more influential in the future and we need to explicitly consider this in terms of the tax system – both in terms of automatic stabilisers and pre-planned discretionary instruments How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? A. Broadening the income definition for income tax purposes We believe the income tax definition should be broadened. A comprehensive measure of income is as follows. Income in a given period of time is the maximum amount that can be consumed in that period while keeping real wealth unchanged (the Hicks-Simon-Haig definition of income). This broad definition of income thus includes capital gains (and losses), one-off and regular gifts, bequests, child support payments, lottery wins, as well as in-kind payments. It is noteworthy that this definition of income does not, largely speaking, correspond to the current definition of income for the purposes of levying income tax. To create a comprehensive income tax would involve adding the following forms of income to current definitions of income to move as close as possible to the Haig-Simons-Hick definition: 1. Imputed income net of depreciation from owner-occupied housing 2. Imputed income net of depreciation from consumer durables 3. Accrued capital gains 4. Inter-vivos gifts in money and in-kind 5. Inheritances 6. Lottery winnings 7. Child support 8. The value of home production This comprehensive income can then be taxed at a person’s marginal income tax rate. There are obvious difficulties in expanding income definitions in these direction. The terms of reference place (1) outside consideration by the Working Group. We recommend taxation of imputed income from owner occupied housing on both efficiency and equity grounds. Both (2) and (8) are difficult to both measure and to value for income tax purposes, but they are likely to comprise a substantial proportion of comprehensive income. A specific inheritance tax is ruled beyond the scope of the Working Group by the terms of reference. Additionally, if one designs an income tax to apply to comprehensive income, there is no good basis for a specific separate inheritance/gift regime. It is our view that incorporating inheritances (5) - and perforce inter-vivos gifts (4) - as part of a broader definition of income and subjecting all broader income to the normal income tax schedule falls within the terms of reference. Our recommendation therefore amounts to an income tax applied to income including inheritances, not an inheritance tax. On both efficiency and equity grounds, we recommend including inheritances and gifts into the income definition for income tax assessment and hence make them subject to the normal income tax rates and thresholds. B. Improving data on comprehensive income There is an urgent need to support Statistics New Zealand to develop a regular high quality large sample household income survey which collects information on an income concept more accurately aligning with Hicks-Simon-Haig definitions of income (see A above) for consideration of a wide range of income distribution/equity/efficiency issues and suitable for high quality tax-benefit policy modelling. C. Addressing inconsistent definition of income across the distribution in terms of the tax- benefit system The current system treats income for effective tax purposes differently across the distributional spectrum. Welfare benefits are no more or less than negative taxes, and taxes are no more than negative welfare benefits. The point was well acknowledged in earlier New Zealand tax reviews, as early as the 1967 Ross Tax Review, as well as in the 1982 McCaw Tax Report. But, while acknowledged, it has not be integrated into our considerations of the tax system. The terms of reference for the current review are, in our view, a retrograde step in this regard. We further note that the Working Group’s submissions background paper (Future of Tax, 2017) suggests a number of high-level principles and objectives that are difficult to achieve with a self-imposed blind spot that encompasses the transfer system. ‘Coherence’ is listed as a well-established criteria to which the tax system should adhere (pg. 5), despite the possibility of deep incoherence between the tax and transfers aspects of public policy. The distributional outcomes used by the Working Group specified as the “results of the tax system” are in fact the reductions in pre-tax income inequality that results from “the tax and transfer system” (pg. 6, emphasis added). The Group also invites submissions on “the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system”. Yet a tax system, in any sense other than pure abstraction, is a part of a particular social system. Its inconsistencies primarily stem from its interaction with the system in which it is applied, and as such, cannot be considered in isolation. Keeping this essential tax-benefit equivalence at the forefront of one’s analysis reveals some serious systemic problems. The manner in which the tax-benefit system currently operates treats extra income differently for poor people on a benefit compared to rich people not on a benefit, to the evident and considerable disadvantage of those on a benefit. Let us illustrate how this serious inequity arises. If one earns $100,000 per annum, the income tax rate on any monetary gifts and child support payments is zero. However, by way of contrast, if one receives a first tier welfare benefit, regular gifts of money are abated (that is to say, effectively taxed) as income, often at substantial rates. Equally, if one receives the Accommodation Supplement, this supplement is effectively taxed or abated (in this case) against both regular and irregular gifts of liquid wealth. Now consider child support. If one earns $100,000 and additionally receives child support, the tax rate on child support is zero percent. However, if one is on a first tier benefit and receives child support, one is taxed, at an effective rate of 100 percent, up until the first tier benefit payment is fully clawed back by the government. As we have argued above, these matters cannot be neatly treated as issues of the tax system or the transfer system alone. They are issues of incoherence, inconsistency and inequity for the tax-negative tax (or benefit) system as a whole. We recommend that income for net tax purposes be defined identically across the income distribution and also recommend that gifts and child support be treated the same for both rich and poor people in the tax-benefit system. D. Inconsistent treatment of unit of tax-benefit assessment unit across the household income distribution The benefit (or negative tax system) assesses need on the basis of family income. The income tax system assesses ability to pay on the basis of individual income. Need and ability to pay are two sides of the same coin. Need exists in the lower part of the income distribution. As one moves up the distribution the ability to pay grows. Thus need and ability to pay are both about fairness or vertical equity of the system. We assess many (most?) fairness or equity issues in terms of families - as indeed does the Tax Working Group when considering distributional issues - not on the basis of individual circumstance. Yet we have a tax system – which has as an important goal equity – which bases income tax on individuals rather than families. This inconsistency in the treatment of taxable unit across the income distribution appears to be a major problem in terms of equity and coherence of the system. We perceive both significant advantages and significant disadvantages in solving this issue via (1) individualising welfare benefits (negative taxes) or (2) taxing families rather than individuals. On this basis we recommend that serious research consideration be made by the secretariat of the Tax Working Group to the appropriate unit for assessment of ability to pay taxes, and to the pros and cons of a family based tax system, rather than taking it for granted that individuals are the appropriate unit for equitably levying taxes but not for negative taxes (welfare benefits). E. Broadening value added taxation to include (1) the financial sector and (2) low value online imports The exclusion of the financial sector from GST is a major flaw in the system. The omission of the financial sector distorts resource allocation by subsidising activities to consumers of financial services (likely better off consumers, who tend to consume more financial services) and is unfair to other sectors who have to bear a greater tax burden. There are considerable technical problems in applying a GST to the financial sector. As recommended by the IMF and the European Union, we favour a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) to complement GST in other sectors. A FAT is a tax on the sum of the profits and remuneration paid by financial institutions. While existing FATs (e.g. Norway, Denmark) only tax the wage portion of value added, we favour a complete value added tax, including profits. A FAT of this kind could make the tax treatment of the financial sector more like that other sectors and so help offset a tendency for the financial sector to be too large. Additionally, for consistency and simplicity, we favour a rate equal to the current GST rate (15 percent). Furthermore, we favour adding taxation to as many low value imports, which currently typically do not attract GST, as possible, for reasons of both efficiency and equity. F. Low effective income tax rates for self-reported income and expenditure Opportunities for tax avoidance (legal) and evasion (illegal) in New Zealand are unequally distributed across different sources of income, raising serious horizontal and vertical equity concerns. Wage and salary earners in the PAYE system have very few opportunities for avoidance and evasion. IRD has independent information on the major income source for those in the PAYE system, information which is provided to them by a third party – their employer. In addition, tax is deducted at source. The biggest avoiders and cheaters are the ones for whom it is easiest to evade (unfair) or avoid (unfair, and illegal) particularly farmers and those running small businesses like building or plumbing firms, as well as other independent contractors. In these businesses, the people generating the income and choosing their expenditures are the same ones who decide the information to share with IRD. There is no disinterested third party — an employer or investment manager — to pass those details to the tax agency. High quality regular independent research into the tax gap between actual and reported income needs to be instituted, making the size of this inequity more transparent to wage and salary taxpayers (the line between the two is likely to be blurry in many circumstances). In addition, for reasons of equity and efficiency (for over-burdening of wage and salary earners), we recommend that a greater IRD resource should be devoted to enforcement in this area. G. Taxing where supply is inelastic In this context, there is a strong case to be made for introducing a significant in-bound tourist poll tax. In-bound tourism offers a potentially broad and rapidly expanding tax base. In 2017 New Zealand received about 3.7 million tourist visitors from overseas. Tourism is forecast to continue to grow at about over 5% pa in volume. The available evidence suggests that the price elasticity of demand for in-bound tourism to New Zealand is inelastic. As one piece of research concludes, “international visitors are unlikely to greatly change their travel behaviour within NZ due to higher prices, even for transport price increases (e.g. the international airfare).” 1 A meta-analysis of international 1 Schiff, A., & Becken, S. (2011). Demand elasticity estimates for New Zealand tourism. Tourism Management, 32(3), 564-575. elasticities supports this conclusion, suggesting that price elasticity of demand in-bound tourism to Oceania is also less than unity. 2 Thus an inbound tourist poll tax is likely to be efficient. This inelasticity makes in-bound tourism an ideal base for tax purposes. As well as being efficient, from a New Zealand perspective the tax is fair. In terms of incidence it falls, in the first instance and to a large extent ultimately (for demand is inelastic) on foreigners, not New Zealanders. A tourist tax is thus almost uniquely fair in New Zealand’s potential tax-choice suite. In addition, it primarily falls on well-off foreigners, since it is these people who have sufficient largesse to travel internationally long-distances by aeroplane to New Zealand. So even in a global sense it is fair. It also makes sense on the benefit principle. If the price elasticity of demand is assumed to be about 0.9 (on the high side, based on the econometric work referred to above), New Zealand could progressively levy a poll tax on in- bound tourism, starting at $250 in the first year (about five percent of the price of an average visit to New Zealand, adding tourist spending locally to airfares paid to get here) and raising it by that increment in four year period to $1000. Phasing in the tax in such a way would ensure a more stable adjustment, without absolutely reducing tourist numbers and threatening tourism business stability. Given that annual swings in real exchange rates, which change the price to in-bound tourists in a similar manner to a real exchange rate change, have considerably exceeded five per cent on several occasions, the tourist industry is more than capable of adjusting to such a tax introduction. Assuming assume 4 million visitors prior to imposition of the tax, and the average tourist visit including airfares costing about $5000, the levying of a steady state $1000 per head tourist tax could raise about $2.5 billion, a significant sum compared to the current tax take in the order of $75 billion. 2 Peng, B., Song, H., Crouch, G. I., & Witt, S. F. (2015). A meta-analysis of international tourism demand elasticities. Journal of Travel Research, 54(5), 611-633. Further gains to tax efficiency could be made via segmenting the market by country of origin, as the research indicates that demand elasticities may be significantly lower for tourists from Australia, the United Kingdom and Germany. Looking forward, this tax base would then grow in excess of 5 percent per annum, which is significantly more rapid than GDP, which going forward is another attractive characteristic. In terms of the other criteria for assessing a good tax, given the tax will be levied on people before they get on a plane (less often a boat) to come to the islands of New Zealand, the tax is very difficult to evade and avoid. Additionally it has low compliance and administration costs. Because of the low price elasticity of demand, we do not view the proposed tourist tax primarily as a corrective tax, as some discussions have focussed on. However, to the extent that the tax results in a lower interim visitor path, pressure on infrastructure and on congestion is relieved. For similar reasons of both efficiency and equity, we also favour a land tax on the value of unimproved land. H. Taxes and fiscal policy for stabilisation purposes The experience of the global financial crisis \[GFC\] and its enduring consequences over the past decade have refocused the attention of many policy-makers on the adequacy of the policy tool kit in response to major economic shocks to aggregate demand. The Submissions Background Paper (2017) contains no consideration of the stabilisation role of the tax system, both in terms of automatic stabilisers or in terms of discretionary tax policy. The Paper however notes that New Zealand will face “other shocks and surprises that we have not considered and cannot foresee”. 3 The logical response to this is to consider what measures 3 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-03/twg-subm-bgrd-paper- mar18.pdf will enhance the resilience of our system and institutions, and what sort of tax policy contingencies might help us prepare for a shock. The prevailing pre-crisis wisdom suggested that monetary policy had primary responsibility for macroeconomic stabilisation (largely through targeting price stability), and that central banks had the tools necessary to achieve that. Fiscal policy, though important in earlier times, was considered to be an undesirable option due to long lags in its implementation, 4 concerns as to the accumulation of public debt, and scepticism that discretionary fiscal policy would be well-designed, given political considerations. 5 Aside from these concerns, the responsibility placed with central banks to achieve their agreed targets was presumed to mean that monetary policy would in normal circumstances offset the effects of fiscal policy. The GFC provided clear evidence that fiscal policy would be necessary to respond to some shocks. Furman has set out a ‘new view’ of fiscal policy, being that fiscal policy is: - Beneficial as a complement to monetary policy, particular in light of the long-term decline in real interest rates and the corresponding limitations placed on monetary policy due the issue of the zero lower bound. The prospect of there being inadequate space for nominal interest rates to fall in order to stimulate the economy in the face of a substantial shock is a real concern for policy makers internationally, and means that governments are more likely to have to rely on fiscal policy than many would have previously believed; 4 This is primarily a concern around ‘inside’ lags – see discussion below. 5 Elmendorf, D. and Furman, J., If, When, How: A Primer on Fiscal Stimulus. Strategy paper. Brookings Institution, 2008 - Very effective in circumstances where monetary policy is constrained, and more likely to crowd in additional private sector spending than crowd it out through higher interest rates; - Less limited by fiscal space than many have assumed, due to the benefits of increased growth on government balance sheets. This can mean that fiscal stimulus causes output to grow faster than debt, lowering debt-to-GDP ratios; - Sustained fiscal policy “can play a critical role not only in demand but also in expanding productivity and aggregate supply going forward”. 6 The fact that the world is currently facing a conditions of persistently low inflation and correspondingly low nominal interest rates also significantly reduces the capacity of monetary policy to respond to negative aggregate demand shocks. 7 The prospect of future crises beyond the ability of monetary policy to deal with is a major future challenge. It also has important implications for the role that the tax system must play in New Zealand. To what extent can the tax system contribute to macro-economic stabilisation in an environment where this is likely to be an ongoing concern? What additional tools, systems or contingencies within the tax system could improve the effectiveness of fiscal policy in situations where monetary policy is indeed constrained? The tax system has long had a well-recognised role as an automatic stabiliser. Tax liabilities and eligibility for tax credits will tend to be counter-cyclical at the individual or household level. This is because as peoples’ income falls (through unemployment, underemployment or 6 Furman, J., “The new view of Fiscal Policy and its application”, 2016, retrieved from https://voxeu.org/article/new-view-fiscal-policy-and-its-application 7 Romer, C. and Romer, D., “Phillips Lecture – Why Some Times Are Different: Macroeconomic Policy and the Aftermath of Financial Crises”, Economica, 85, 2018, 1 - 40. hours being cut), their tax liability decreases and their entitlement to income-tested transfers increases. In aggregate, this can help offset fluctuations in the broader economy without the need for any discretionary intervention by policy makers. 8 Despite this, the objective of contributing to macro-economic stability has not always been treated as an explicit priority in policy discussions around tax, and has not been explicitly considered so far by the current Tax Working Group. We consider this lack of design consideration another serious lacuna. To the extent that the tax system can contribute to stabilisation, this function deserves to be weighed up against other objectives. The consequences of economic turmoil and unemployment for human wellbeing are such that more good could be done through a proper consideration of a stabilisation objective than through any marginal improvement in pursuit of other goals. To paraphrase Keynes, when our problems change, we must change our minds about what public policy is trying to address. And as the economists’ saying goes, “it takes a lot of Harberger triangles \[inefficiencies generated by behavioural change due to tax in this case\] to fill an Okun’s gap \[loss of output experienced in a recession\]”. The topic of macroeconomic stabilisation as an objective of the tax system has received only sporadic attention in New Zealand over the years, as fiscal policy has been targeted on government debt ratios and the rest of tax policy has been micro-economically focussed. The use of a variable GST as a counter-cyclical stabilisation tool has been proposed or discussed at different stages by Federated Farmers, Buiter 9 and the Reserve Bank of New 8 http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-automatic-stabilizers-and-how-do- they-work 9 Buiter, W, “Stabilisation policy in New Zealand: Counting your blessings, one by one”, 2006 Retrieved from https://willembuiter.com/nz.pdf Zealand. 10 For many, the appeal of this tool was found not only in its potential as a counter- cyclical measure, but in the promise that it would alleviate the pain felt by interest rate- sensitive sectors of the economy by reducing the unequal sectoral burden of monetary policy (the impact of interest rates on the exchange rate being the main area of concern). The weaknesses in this proposal are that providing such an option to the central bank might results in its two primary tools – the Official Cash Rate and the proposed variable GST - working against each other. Increasing GST to dampen aggregate demand and inflationary pressure would also increase the consumer price index and make the Central Bank’s task in controlling inflation more difficult. 11 Although there are international examples of cuts to GST/VATs to stimulate the economy, such as in the UK, 12 the wisdom of adding further deflationary pressure to the economy at a time when central banks are consistently undershooting inflation targets is not particularly clear. For some of the reasons stated above, Ball suggested that an independent ‘Macroeconomic Policy Committee’ be given the power to temporarily vary income taxes in response to macroeconomic fluctuations. 13 Parliament would retain control over the average level of income taxes, and their level of progressivity. 10 https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/- /media/ReserveBank/Files/Monetary%20policy/About%20monetary%20policy/3075586.pdf? la=en 11 Additional concerns include menu costs, and adding to the variability of prices. Claus, I. and Sloan, B., “Variable GST/VAT: A tool for monetary policy?”, 2008, retrieved from https://www.otago.ac.nz/economics/news/seminars/otago079331111.pdf 12 https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/aug/26/vat-cut-ineffective 13 Ball, L., “A proposal for the next macroeconomic reform”, 1996, retrieved from https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research-and-publications/research-programme/visiting- researchers/fellowship/a-proposal-for-the-next-macroeconomic-reform Brash proposed that the Reserve Bank governor be given the power to adjust the excise tax on fuel in order to complement the effect of traditional monetary policy. 14 This was envisioned to be a way to spread the burden of tighter monetary policy across the economy more broadly, while avoiding further upward pressure on the exchange rate. As mentioned already, such proposed changes to the tax system are often grounded in concerns about the costs of fighting inflation, particularly those felt by the tradeable sector through the impact that higher interest rates have on the exchange rate. In many of these instances, there is an implicit assumption that monetary policy already has, for the most part, adequate firepower to respond to large economic shocks. However, in a world where fiscal policy is likely to be a more frequently-utilised tool, the principles guiding a macroeconomic stabilisation role for the tax system will be different. Krugman has summarised some guiding principles for fiscal stimulus, which include: - effectiveness; - short time lags; - targeted at sectors strongly affected by the shock; - include assistances for levels of government less able to borrow to maintain spending; An important option for fiscal stimulus is direct assistance to individuals and households. Though our concern here is how the tax system can be designed to contribute to the goal of macroeconomic stability, it is important to note that ‘assistance through the tax system’ can 14 Brash, D., “How can our Reserve Bank keep raising interest rates when the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps dropping theirs?”, Speech in memory of Michael Joseph Savage, La Trobe University, 2008, retrieved from http://www.donbrash.com/after-parliament/how-can-our- reserve-bank-keep-raising-interest-rates-when-the-u-s-federal-reserve-keeps-dropping-theirs/ refer to a wide range of policy measures. Some stimulus measures incorporate permanent changes to income or company tax rates, or other aspects of tax policy. However, there are also discretionary lump-sum payments that are administered through the tax system, but are unrelated to any chance in tax policy. The 2008 and 2009 Australian stimulus package totalled 5% of GDP of which discretionary cash payments to households was 40%. 15 In terms of pure effectiveness, direct spending by the government (for instance, on infrastructure) should provide the most “bang for the buck”, as - unlike households - the government will not choose to save any portion of the allocated money. The arguments for providing government assistance through the tax system is that assistance can be targeted to alleviate economic suffering at the same time that the wider economy is supported. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of such stimulus on aggregate demand depends primarily on the marginal propensity to consume of the recipient. This provides support for targeting assistance at lower income individuals and households, who have less ability to smooth their consumption over time, and are therefore more likely to spend any additional money received. 16 An additional advantage of providing fiscal stimulus through the tax system is relatively short lags in its effectiveness. There is always a delay between changes in the national economy and the impact of policy responses. It is common to distinguish between ‘inside’ and ‘outside’ lags. An inside lag is the time taken for policy makers to perceive, consider and respond to changes in economic conditions. This is distinct from the ‘outside’ lag, or how 15 Hyslop, D. The Distributional Effects of the Australian Cash Bonus Payments Response to the Global Financial Crisis”, 2014. Retrieved from “http://www.nzae.org.nz/wp- content/uploads/2015/01/NZAE\_Hyslop2014.pdf 16 Elmendorf, D. and Furman, J, 2008. long it takes for policy to have an effect. Though macroeconomic stabilisation is often a necessary function of government, too great a lag (of either sort) risks mistiming the support, and exacerbating the business cycle rather than offsetting it. Milton Friedman’s memorable analogy was of a furnace reacting to a thermostat in the furthest room of a house – meaning that the furnace was likely to be warming or cooling at the precisely the wrong times. Though modern central banking institutions allow for monetary policy decisions to be made promptly, it is well recognised that there is a considerable lag in the impact of a change to the official cash rate. This is commonly estimated at 12-18 months or longer (and likely differs between transmission channels). 17 Conversely, fiscal policy has the potential to have a much more timely impact on economic conditions and avoid exacerbating fluctuations through mistiming. Elmendorf and Reifschneider find significant short-run impacts associated with a one-off tax rebate, provided that it is directed towards households that are likely spend it. 18 Infrastructure projects and investment incentives (which are options that often dominate thinking on fiscal stimulus) tend to operate over a much longer timeframe. Though these measures may be worthwhile for other reasons (e.g. a positive effect on long-term productivity), and might form part of a broad fiscal package, they appear to be less worthwhile as an options for timely macroeconomic stabilisation. The lags associated with fiscal policy are more of the inside variety – policy makers recognising the need for action, debating and deciding on the form of the assistance, and then implementing their preferred policy response. The concentration of decision-making power 17 Ball, 1996; http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/lags\_in\_monetar.html 18 Elmendorf and Reifschneider, “Short-Run Effects of Fiscal Policy with Forward-Looking Financial Markets”, National Tax Journal, 55:3, 2002, 377. within the executive branch of government in New Zealand puts us in a better position to take decisive action should the need arise. However, the lags associated with policy formulation and implementation mean that the tax system needs to be designed with this function in mind, with a range of options available for quick implementation depending on the need and context. There is also the matter of what one might call the political economy of urgency, whereby the need for a quick response weakens normal accountability mechanisms and leads to worse decisions being made. 19 We believe that clear thinking and prior preparation around the discretionary ability of the tax system to contribute to macroeconomic stability may also contribute to greater coordination between fiscal policy and monetary policy in the face of a large scale shock. There are a number of reasons why the shape of the assistance might make a difference as to whether individuals or households choose to spend the money or save it. 20 Richard Thaler’s ‘mental accounts’ framework suggests that money that recipients consider as falling into the ‘current income account’ is more likely to be spent (a marginal propensity to consume of close to one) than that ear-marked as ‘asset account’ or ‘future income account’. 19 A version of this concern was raised by Republican economist Doug Holtz-Eakin in response to the Obama administration’s stimulus bill, which in his view was made up of ready-to-go projects that had previously been debated and rejected. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2011/10/04/gIQALuwdVL\_story.html?noredirect =on&utm\_term=.27f3f4d5c05c 20 Sahm, C., Shapiro, M. and Slemrod, J. “Check in the Mail or More in the Paycheck: Does the Effectiveness of Fiscal Stimulus Depend on How It Is Delivered?”, in Am Econ J Econ Policy, August 4:3, 2012. Furthermore, the visibility of a change in income may effect whether the recipient considers it to be permanent or not, and whether it is in fact spent. 21 Recent literature has considered the effectiveness of different means of fiscal stimulus: Sahm, Shapiro and Slemrod find that a one-off tax rebate paid to households through the US tax system in 2008 was around 3 times more likely to be mostly spent compared to a 2009 tax credit that was disbursed gradually through a change in withholding. This was contrary to what one would expect according to the mental accounts hypothesis (and against the expectations of the Obama administration officials who designed the stimulus). 22 Leigh uses survey data to estimates a marginal propensity to consume of around 40 cents in the dollar for payments made to households as part of the Australian government’s stimulus package. These payments, made at two stages in 2008 and 2009, were of various forms – some linked to eligibility for the Child Tax Benefit, and others a tax ‘bonus’ paid in relation to taxable income in the previous tax year (with higher payments going to lower income individuals). This MPC is a higher rate than similar studies in the US, despite the fact that US households seemed to be more credit-constrained. Leigh suggests that framing the payments as a ‘bonus’ rather than a ‘rebate’ might have increased the programme’s impact. 23 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid. 23 Leigh, A., “How much did the 2009 Australian Stimulus Boost Demand? Evidence from Household Reported Spending Effects”, in B. E. Journal of Macroeconomics, 12:1, 2012. Hyslop also examines the case of the Australian stimulus, and finds that the payments were effective at counteracting the effects of the GFC on individuals and households (more so the latter than the former). 24 In anticipation of future negative aggregate demand shocks in a low inflation environment, we recommend the work be undertaken to determine how fiscal stimulus through the tax system could be undertaken with minimal lags, and in a way that complements other government measures aimed at macroeconomic stabilisation. 24 Hyslop, 2014.

Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. Tracy Livingston: submission to the Tax Working Group “The Government taketh away” The most obvious place to start to reform our current ridiculous taxation system, that keeps the poor poor and enriches those who can use the system to their advantage (no judgement), is through a Financial Transactions Tax. Democrats for Social Credit (www.democrats.org.nz) suggests the following which I agree with and recommend New Zealand/Aotearoa implements as soon as feasible. “FTT is simple and inexpensive to administer, has no loopholes available for tax evasion, and gathers revenue across the entire economy. Where currently GST is not charged on financial services, which involve huge sums and correspondingly huge economic damage, those transactions will not be exempt under FTT. • Replace GST with a financial transactions tax • Setting the level of transactions tax at a very low percentage • Relieving businesses of compliance costs when GST is phased out • Collecting the tax through data bank facilities on every bank transaction at point of withdrawal • Making the total amount of revenue raised available for Government spending as there will be no collection costs, just bank transfers • Automatically increasing everyone's spending power as the GST level is far higher than any transactions tax need be “The banking mechanism by which FTT may be gathered is already in use, thanks to modern technology. Banks already withdraw their own account fees as well as Resident Withholding Tax from interest on deposits through an automated function of account management. It will be very simple for the banking system to implement FTT, and very difficult to avoid payment. Although there are some examples of FTT functioning in other countries, the full impact on the economy of FTT replacing all other forms of taxation remains largely an unknown. As FTT is intended to not only gather revenue for Government spending, but also to affect economic behaviour by discouraging speculation, it is thought advisable to introduce FTT progressively, beginning with replacing GST. Many consider GST to be a ‘poor tax’. People on the lowest incomes, with little or no ownership of the real economy, are taxed far out of proportion to their incomes compared with those with investment incomes and business ownership. GST also carries a cost to administer for both Inland Revenue and businesses. Therefore GST is an obvious place to begin tax reform, by replacing it outright with FTT at a very low rate. Because FTT is a ‘cascade’ tax, accumulating in the prices of goods and services, a low rate will ensure that those prices will still drop compared to current GST level prices. Research reveals that currently some $50 billion dollars a day are involved in financial transactions within New Zealand. Just 0.1% of that figure (i.e. a tenth of a percent), a level so small that ordinary consumers and SME will barely notice the loss from each transaction, is $50 million a day or more than $18 billion a year in potential revenue. Add to that the money saved on the administration and compliance costs of GST, and the economic advantages of FTT are readily apparent. However, FTT will have an intentional effect on speculative transaction behaviour, and it is difficult to accurately predict the scope of that effect. It is therefore deemed necessary that the implementation FTT be done in stages, adjusting the levels and accompanying regulations at each stage to maintain economic integrity.” Idea 2: The next thing to work on is the handicap of “the scarcity of money”. The government only creates 2-3% of our money, which is obviously not enough to run our country. If our tax system was sustainable, NZ would not have $90 B in public debt and $550 B in private debt, paying $12 million/day in government debt alone. Governments, including local government, never have enough income through taxes and rates (another tax), so they borrow money from the private banking sector (who get their money by creating it out of thin air). The creation of this money as debt money, instead of credit money the way a government creates it, means that as a nation we are enslaved in un-repayable debt. The creation of the right amount of money is the government’s most vital role in running its country. Instead we have to sell off parts of our nation’s heritage to pay the bills and our people and businesses have to work like demons just to survive. “Conventional economics virtually compels sane people to engage in insane economic activity.” (J.M.Braden) Social Credit has always advocated that our government should borrow from its own Reserve Bank at 1% interest or less. As loans are repaid, they can be taken out of circulation or reinvested to meet increasing demand. This injects spending power into the economy that is not inflationary. We need our Reserve Bank to support our country by creating money. The government already creates some of its money, just not nearly enough. Democrats for Social Credit (www.democrats.org.nz) suggests the following which I agree with and recommend New Zealand/Aotearoa implements as soon as feasible. Interest free loans will be available from the sovereign Reserve Bank Monetary Authority (RBMA) at an administration cost only, for: • Investment in public and local authority infrastructure – public transport, sewage systems, public amenities, sustainable power alternatives, major environmental projects, etc; • Providing a short term overdraft facility for the government to manage its cash flow requirements; • Facilitating reciprocal trade arrangements made with other nations; • Lending to trading banks to on-lend to their commercial, business, farming and corporate clients; • Lending to first home buyers to increase home ownership; and • Removing speculative demand from overseas investors chasing returns from high interest rates. A low interest rate policy will create a more realistic and stable trading value for the NZ dollar. All of which will reduce our need to over-tax people and local businesses. Here Ellen Brown makes a strong case for sovereign governments to create their own money supply to reduce reliance on much more expensive debt money from the private sector. https://ellenbrown.com/2018/02/27/funding-infrastructure-why-china-is-running-circles- around-america/#more-13742 (just replace the word America with Aotearoa, the same issue applies). This would reduce the need to tax our citizens and would improve our competitiveness in the global market place. The cost of adding income tax, interest and GST increases the cost of our locally produced goods hence increasing cost to locals as well as export markets, reducing our competitiveness both locally and abroad. This has the double whammy negative effect of encouraging us to buy cheaper overseas goods as well as discouraging local producers/growers. Encouraging local producers/growers would flow on to increase prosperity for New Zealanders – the real ‘trickle down effect’. Incomes and benefits have continually fallen behind inflation (especially taking housing and energy into consideration); making life impossible without taking on debt. By the time we pay our tax, there is even less money. Income tax forces us to borrow at interest from the private banking sector, then the interest we have paid goes off-shore depriving NZ of the wealth we have created. We ‘enjoy’ one of the highest interest rates in the world – meaning that we pay not just the cost of our house (that’s on a personal level but it works the same for infrastructure, health, etc) but also that amount two or three times over. No wonder no one has any money! And it’s even worse if you’re poor, it’s expensive to be poor.... https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/money/101241277/why-its-so-expensive-to-be-poor “The Child Poverty Action Group calculated last year that a family able to boost their incomes through extra hours and hard graft from $42,700 to $47,700 may end up seeing 84% of the money being clawed back in tax, lower accommodation supplement, loss of Working for Families tax credits, student loan repayments and KiwiSaver deductions.” “Susan St John, a University of Auckland associate professor in economics and co-director at the Retirement Policy and Research Centre, said the country had “major issues” with child poverty which were not evident in Australia and the social welfare system was one of the biggest factors. “If you’re going down the path of copying us, you really need to look at impacts,” she said. She said tax benefit policies disadvantaging children from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the lack of indexation of some welfare payments had resulted in the “rapid falling behind” of benefits. “It pushes families into poverty,” she said. “.. It’s nothing to be proud of.”” https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/03/dont-copy-our-welfare-cuts-new-zealand- experts-warn-australia These statements alone should be enough for us to seriously look at changing our taxation system. Is this what we really want for our people? Our tax/benefit system is way too complicated, with convoluted methods of rewarding and punishing wage earners and beneficiaries alike. Subsidising employers with the Working for Families scheme must be a nightmare for IRD, as well as recipients. Secondary taxing those who work two or more part time jobs to make ends meet is ridiculously punitive and quite unnecessary. If you make no real changes to the tax system (because I really don’t expect you to actually DO anything), but this one, let all earners be entitled to keep all earnings up to a living wage, say $40,000/year, before taxation begins, with a graduated scale commencing after that. Scrap all complicated taxation and payment systems that require a huge bureaucracy to administer. The craziness of cutting someone’s benefit if they try to earn a few dollars, is just cruel and pointless and probably costs as much to administer as the government ‘earns’ and of course, follows the law of ‘unintended consequence’ creating beneficiary fraud and turning our people into criminals and forcing people into poverty. (sometimes you have to think that the government is doing it on purpose!) If money and education is only available to the wealthy, we will not be a contented, unified country. The bigger the gap between the haves and the have-nots creates disharmony. The solution is not taxing the rich to give to the poor, NOR the other way around. That just creates discord between us as a nation which is the last thing we need. Privatising profit and socialising costs: I’m not the first to say it, but we have a corporate welfare system in this country that subsidizes our low wage economy. “There is no doubt our welfare system needs reform, and a massive one at that. The epitome of the precariat is someone who has no certainty in their job (or hours) but works hard, improves their lives only incrementally and yet is still reliant on state benefits which only serve to subsidise low-wage employers which keep wages artificially low.” https://www.newsroom.co.nz/2017/12/06/65876/have-we-forgotten- the-working-poor# Which means that we, the tax payer, pay for (often multi-national) corporations and businesses to not pay a living wage or to only employ people part-time whilst the (multi-national) corporation enjoys the profits. If a person receives a tax-free living wage this would take pressure off all three parties – the employee, the employer and the welfare system. Money is a man-made construct to enable the exchange of goods and services – we can use it do what we wish – so we need to be better at ‘what we wish’. To use it as a commodity was never the plan – to make money from money, as we are doing in this age destroys our wealth base and limits our creativity and ability to create real wealth. And taxing our citizen’s hard work but not the harmful activities in our economy (e.g. currency trading and speculation and environmental degradation) makes little sense and is a very old fashioned, poorly thought out practice. To finish up, I thought I would share some of J.M. Braden’s ideas on the hows and whys of changing taxation and taxing negative behaviour to move towards positive behaviour. The entire article by Robert Snefjella is here: https://www.globalresearch.ca/economic-system-reform- saving-the-planet-salvaging-the-human-prospect/5628951 “Braden calls his proposed economic program Intelligent National Frugality (INF). It is offered as a corrective to current economic systems that in effect mandate environmental degradation, increasing resource scarcity, and social breakdown and dysfunctions. He proposes an alternative taxation and pricing and financing strategy that will inherently encourage environmental stewardship, more careful resource use, and greater social health, and discourage resource foolishness and energy gluttony: Thus Intelligent. The term Frugality explicitly rejects the ideology of perpetual economic growth, and the culture of ‘more and more stuff is better and better’, of material and energy extravagance. But it allows for a wealth of cultural expression and unlimited qualitative progress within the context of a much more careful and sensible human presence on earth. The term National identifies the nation state as the scale at which INF economics should apply, and also that a country is the appropriate political vehicle for establishing INF economics. Implied is that in order for any country to be able to carry out such a reformed economic system, it must have sufficient independence and sovereignty. Given that current financial systems are catastrophically flawed, proposals have been made for economic system reform that is intended to provide broad, not narrow, benefit, and to eliminate harmful features. And what person of goodwill would not prefer economic system designs that work well – intrinsically – on behalf of broad, not narrow, human benefit, while encouraging harmony with the biosphere, and including a decisive concern for the future? One basic principle found at the heart of Braden’s thesis is that a taxation and pricing system should as far as possible encourage the beneficial and discourage the harmful – encourage the good and discourage the bad. Stated thus, it’s a principle hard to argue with, but it begs the ongoing question as to what constitutes good and bad.” Braden’s core answer is that INF economics would heavily tax those types of energy classified as non- renewable – so-called fossil fuels and nuclear – on the basis of their actual energy content, and at the primary stage of their movement into use. This would mean that all processes and products coming later, using either the energy or matter of the energy source, would in cost and price reflect that original taxation. (Obviously nuclear doesn’t pertain to NZ, however the ideas can still be used for whatever activity we wish to reduce. T.L.) All direct and indirect subsidies would be removed from these forms of energy. (or any negative activity we wish to reduce T.L.) And the tax would be introduced gradually, intending a not-seriously-disruptive process of increase over a period of years. As a result, there would be a growing disincentive to use fossil fuels in a cavalier fashion, and a growing incentive to use such energy more carefully. More benign and renewable competing forms of energy, and processes that use these, would gain comparative price advantage; thus be encouraged.” “Which leads to another key principle of INF economics: that human energy, mental or physical, is not taxed at all. Human energy thus becomes the financially most advantageous energy of choice in many instances. Under INF economics, sales taxes and value added taxes would also be eliminated. There is no inherent ‘right’ or ‘left’ ideological basis for Braden’s proposals. But in order to implement his ideas, it is as noted necessary that a country be able to make independent national economic policies. This includes not being bound by restrictive bi-national or multinational economic agreements that preclude independent national initiatives in economic policy. Braden repudiates so-called ‘free trade’, which in practice elevates international financial and corporate power over indigenous national economic policy, and he endorses less reliance on distant trade and long transport of goods. INF economics inherently encourages a more decentralized and self-reliant society; and a tendency towards many more and smaller internally competitive industrial enterprises and businesses. And many more small farms, and villages and towns, would primarily serve their locality. INF economics would also intrinsically encourage production of products featuring ease of repair, durability, recycling, and so on.” So I don’t personally have the answers to our taxation problem, but certainly the system we have now is obsolete (if it ever wasn’t) and not fit for purpose. I look forward to some if not all Social Credit ideas being utilised by this government bearing in mind that the first Labour Party in government in New Zealand used Reserve Bank funding to great advantage for our nation. With our current technology so much more is possible. We need to ‘go back to the future’ to ensure financial security for our people, be a good place to do good business, stabilise our economy, reward hard work, create satisfying jobs within a high wage economy, support parents to provide for their children, take care of our environment by using tax very specifically and more. To reiterate Social Credit, “Whatever is environmentally, socially and technically feasible AND desirable, is absolutely financially possible” so please let that guide you in your decision on changing our taxation system. Kia kaha, Kia ora. Tracy Livingston, \[1\]

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Introduction 1. This is the submission of Warren Forster, barrister and researcher currently based in Dunedin, New Zealand. This submission outlines that I will be recommending a system for disability that includes a funding model based on a sovereign wealth fund for disability in New Zealand. 2. In December 2017 I was awarded the New Zealand Law Foundation International Research Fellowship. The focus of my research is how to create a system for dealing with the consequences of disability that does not discriminate based on the origin or cause of the disability. The current system in New Zealand has been variously described as discriminatory, illogical, unfair, inequitable and inconsistent with New Zealand’s international obligations. 3. At the outset, I can explain I intend the system to aspire to Sir Owen Woodhouse’s original vision and comprise a system for disability including elements that are now covered by Ministry of Health, Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation. I will refer to this future system as the Disability System. 4. This paper explains why my research is relevant to the tax working group. I ask the working group to, in the course of its deliberations and in its subsequent reporting: a. note my submission: i. that an sovereign wealth fund which I will call an “investment fund” in the style of existing NZ Superannuation and Accident Compensation funds should be created from existing and novel sources of capital and revenue; ii. that earnings from the fund should be used to finance a consolidated health and social welfare system for disability that does not discriminate based on cause of disability; iii. that this fund will, to a large extent, draw its funding from within current and reconfigured structures of the Disability System without imposing significant additional long-term burdens to levy and tax payers, iv. that a system of levies should be established to enable an appropriate Crown actor to impose general levies and specific levies on conduct that evidence shows unduly contributes to negative public health and disability outcomes, taking into account the human rights implications of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. b. note my submission that such an outcome meets the existing principles of New Zealand’s system of taxation as put to the working group; c. indicate what opportunity will be available for me to discuss this with the working group in person and for further input into the working group to be provided as my research progresses, noting that a public discussion paper on my research is anticipated in August 2018. Brief summary of preliminary research outcomes 5. My research is still in preliminary stages. From 12 March 2018 to 9 April 2018 I travelled to Europe to speak with various public policy experts on the systems for administering health and disability services. I visited Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, and Switzerland. 6. I also had discussions with several institutions with interests in multiple countries including the Nordic Council of Ministers, United Nations High Commission for Human Rights, World Health Organisation, European Commission, Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, European Association of Service Providers for Persons with Disabilities, European Disability Forum. 2 7. I can report there is no existing model that I believe is suitable for adoption in New Zealand. 8. Health and social welfare systems directed towards disability suffer from a lack of funding that leads to restrictive definitions of who constitutes a person with a disability. This leads to discriminatory outcomes that are unacceptable from a human rights perspective. Accordingly, the new system would define disability as widely as possible in a manner consistent with the CRPD, and then tailor services according to need. One benefit of the system is that it could significantly reduce the burden of the current individual assessment of causal impact of impairment, for example injury, ageing, developmental factors and mental health factors. 9. The current boundary between the ACC system and the wider social welfare and health systems leads to attempts at cost-shifting and an associated increase in heated boundary disputes. An integrated system will remove the need for boundary disputes and re-focus dispute in the system on identifying issues of lawfulness and human rights, including the Government’s or the institutions’ compliance with a legislated system. All disputes would be against the state and turn on a human rights basis. From this perspective, it would be a rights based system. 10. The system will be arranged around the following kinds of services: a. Health, on a lifelong basis; b. Social support and support to engage in the community, on a lifelong basis; c. Financial and income support, limited to people of working age; d. Rehabilitation and habilitation, on an intervention basis across a person’s lifetime. 11. To fund continually rising costs of health and social services, I was informed that the top rate of tax in Finland approached approximately 60%, which is unlikely to be accepted as legitimate by taxpayers or meet the Government’s expectations that tax be kept to its current level in relation to GDP. At the same time, public confidence in the public health system in Finland was declining such that 85% of children currently born in Helsinki have private health insurance. 12. Social spending is limited by limited revenue from taxation due to reducing workforce population and increased cost and uptake on the health system. 13. Further, by relying primarily on revenue from taxation to fund health and social services, this pegs the well-being of people with disabilities to political cycles, which is inconsistent with the human-rights based regime New Zealand has committed to adopting. 14. New Zealand’s also has obligations to its citizens under international instruments such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. 15. I acknowledge that the system described in my research will have some consistency with te ao Māori and the Māori philosophy of hauora comprising taha tinana, taha hinengaro, taha whanau, and taha wairua. I consider synergies may exist with this research and te pae tawhiti, whanaungatanga and kaitiakitanga. As I conduct my research, I am committed to consulting with Māori. 16. In our current system, society and individuals argue over which aspect of our health and social system (health, mental health, social welfare, justice, ACC) should meet an individual’s need. One response to that issue is to fund access to justice mechanisms to fairly resolve these disputes; including obtaining evidence and providing access to lawyers and courts. Alternatively, we can redesign the system to meet a person’s needs without the need for most of the dispute that currently occurs. An example of how the system would be funded 3 17. To illustrate the idea I offer a practical example of the capacity to grow the ACC fund over time and expand “cover” to all disability. The figures are by way of example only, using 2017 figures. Rather than reducing levies as has occurred between 2012 and 2017, if these continued to be set at approximately 2.5% of GDP, then $6.7 billion in levies would have been collected in 2017. After $3.7 billion in claims were paid, the $3 billion remaining from the levy collection could have been added to the “disability” investment fund in addition to the $4 billion income from the investment fund itself. 18. A total of $7 billion would have been added to the “disability” fund in 2017. If this pattern were to be continued over 25 years, the growth in the fund would result in the fund exceeding $200 billion (as adjusted for inflation to 2017 levels). At this level, it could fund a significant proportion of the future disability system without tax revenue, even after taking into account the fact that the costs of that are likely to increase over time. 19. I recognise that this analysis is simplistic and also that the levels of return on investment may well decrease. A more detailed analysis is required. My claim is that ACC has a proven track record of producing returns above benchmark over decades and is a proven funding model. I note any reduction in investment returns would simply extend the timeframe before the system could be self-funding. Any longer growth lower than anticipated could be offset by increasing levy funding. 20. I note that there is significant variation in ACC levies as a percentage of GDP for example, ranging from 1.6% for the year ended 30 June 2017 to approximately 2.4% for the year to 30 June 2012. 1 I understand from the Financial Statements of the Government that these levies are included in the “other” category (p 24). 2 Relevance of my research to the tax working group’s deliberations 21. One of the most significant limitations on achieving a health, social and disability system that does not discriminate based on cause or impose thresholds for access with negative policy consequences is the amount of public funding required. Conflicts over funding have led to cost shifting between and within systems. 22. The Tax Working Group has been tasked with taking into account: a. public confidence in social services; b. fairness of the tax system; c. changes in demographics including an ageing population; d. the changing nature of work. 23. While it is not for the tax working group to form a view on the likelihood of reform to the public health system, my submission is that such reform is likely. In support of that submission I refer to the following high-level sources: a. reporting by news media; b. the original Woodhouse report, the Law Commission’s 1988 report on accident compensation; c. repeated public statements by Sir Owen Woodhouse and Geoffrey Palmer as architects of health and disability schemes and experienced policy commentators; d. the report of the Royal Commission on Social Policy (1988), and “Choices for Healthcare: Report of the Health Benefits Review (1986); e. public acknowledgements by the current government that the existing health system is in crisis, including the effects of limited public funding decisions made by the previous government on capital expenditure, for example; f. my own research and experience on the discriminatory and negative policy effects of the current ACC system; 1 ACC annual report 2017 and ACC annual report 2012 recorded levies as $4,865 million and Statistics New Zealand reported GDP as $205,000 million (ISSN 1178-0290). 2 ISSN 978-1-98-853440-4 2017 Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand – B.11. 4 g. the government’s inquiries into mental health and addiction services; h. the likelihood that New Zealand will maintain a dynamically efficient economy for most of the foreseeable future i. the likelihood that a well managed fund’s return on investment exceeds growth in GDP for the foreseeable future (recognising that the gap between the return on investment and GDP decreases); j. UNCRPD reporting processes and the Committee’s enquiry into the differing level of services and support available to people on the ACC system as opposed to the wider health and disability system. 24. Further, it is widely acknowledged that the health system (including wider social services) does not deliver equally beneficial outcomes for Māori and that greater access to funding is required to provide equality of outcomes. Better access to funding for social and health services must be seen as beneficial for this outcome. 25. I submit that the working group is entitled to take account of this context given that public spending on health and social welfare is one of the biggest impositions on tax revenue. 26. I note that the working group has taken into account the United Nations sustainable Development Goals, including within the context of the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework. 27. The greater use of a large investment fund and system of levies presents an alternative source of revenue for the Government that does not require some of the more controversial changes being considered, such as GST exemptions and a capital gains tax. It may also benefit from, rather than suffer from, base erosion and profit shifting. 28. I intend to seek expert input from economists but it is important that I broadcast my thinking to the working group at this early stage in case it would be considered. 29. I am aware that previously the social security system was funded with a specific tax from 1938 to 1968 and that this approach was abandoned. It reappeared in 1972 in the form of a levy system for ACC (but not “social security” or “health” in a wider sense) and this has remained in place since. 30. I am concerned to improve society’s trust and confidence in both health and social services. Transparency go some way towards improving trust and confidence, but it could be that if people believed that their levies were going towards a system that was fair, equitable, sustainable, inclusive and efficient, without the need for doubling the levies, they would be more willing to pay levies even at a moderately higher rate. Relevant policy considerations from tax working group background paper 31. The use of a large investment fund would enable revenue to fund social services to be drawn from international sources, including investment in international stocks and properties. Taking into account the projections for Government Expenditure and Revenue (Table 1, p 10), a model along the lines that I am researching might meet (or go a long way towards meeting) the balanced shortfall of 1.2% in 2030 and 4% in 2045. The return on investment of the existing ACC fund in the 2016 and 2017 years was 1.6% and 1.3% of GDP. Whilst there will be fluctuations, if the investment fund was increased from approximately $40 billion to $200 billion, over the next 20-30 years, there is no reason why the working group’s projected shortfall in the vicinity of 1-5% of GDP could not be largely met by return on investment from the fund. 32. The use of an investment fund would also mean that revenue is drawn from capital rather than labour sources reflecting the changing nature of work and population demographics. 33. I am also considering the benefits that an investment fund based approach could have for “future-proofing” health and social services: for example, by the adoption of “lifetime cost” models currently being used by MSD and ACC in particular. Such a model may allow us to 5 finally address the social determinants of health by taking an integrated approach to addressing the social need and enjoy the benefits of healthier people and communities. 34. I see the following “challenges, risks and opportunities” (p 4) as being relevant to the funding model I am suggesting for my research: a. changing demographics, ageing population and associated fiscal pressures; b. the treaty and equal access to services for Maori and equality of outcomes; c. the changing nature of work; d. growing concern about inequality; e. the impacts of globalisation including profit shifting and base erosion. 35. Acknowledging that there is on-going debate, a save as you go system (as opposed to a pay as you go system) is an accepted part of our approach for superannuation. There appears to be no reason why that thinking cannot also be applied to other areas including health and social services. 36. Access to sufficient funding for broad-coverage high quality social and health services are also highly relevant to the four “capital stocks” for intergenerational wellbeing (p 4), particularly human and social capital. It would also increase the ability of everyone to participate in society (p16). It would also create financial capital and contribute to physical capital (by providing a funding mechanism for projects like transmission gully). 37. The system is consistent with existing approaches taken to products with a documented impact on health and social outcomes, with targeted taxation (or levying, in this case) on tobacco and alcohol. While generally taxation is not used to modify behaviour, ACC does levy based on risk of activity causing harm or injury and this would be logical once the health and social system takes on greater responsibility for the costs of conduct which causes adverse health outcomes. 38. By creating an investment fund, the suggested amendments would also meet the criteria used in past tax reviews (p 5): a. efficiency and the enhancement of economic growth and avoid distortions to the use of resources; b. fiscal adequacy; c. revenue integrity; d. reduction in compliance and administration costs; e. generate coherence in the raising and spending of tax on social services. 39. The quality and coverage of public healthcare and social services are crucial to public perception of the legitimacy and fairness of taxation. 40. This applies with equal force to the highest taxpayers who, while funding a significant proportion of the tax required for those services, may not rely on them in favour of private providers because of a perception of the quality and coverage of public services. 41. I note the working group’s comments on taxes and behaviours (p 26). I consider that the levy system I propose would allow the externalities from economic activity to be managed through a levy system which allows policy to be developed and implemented to internalise these within the risk causing groups. This is consistent with the broad base low rate system that currently exists and it also allows for management of particular risks and behaviours. 42. I note the efficiency of ACC levy collection (approximately 0.9%) is slightly less than IRD (0.85%) (p 42), however if the levies were to increase to $6 billion and the efficiency gains from the new technology rollout (Shaping Our Future) are realised, this could drop well below the current IRD efficiency figures. This cost of levying would increase if targeted levying was developed (which would need to be considered against the benefits of increased revenue and modification of behaviour) or the cost of levying would decrease if flat rate levying were used (as originally proposed by Sir Owen Woodhouse). 6 43. There is another issue with product liability for imported goods. If there is going to be a revenue collection from these imports, consideration might be given to a levy to fund product liability for dangerous products that carry risks. 44. There are also potential problems with hypothecation. The ACC system has dealt with this on the basis of social solidarity. Potential shortfalls can be addressed through increased levies, although the effects of these should be smoothed out through long term levy planning. Importantly, these also provide a very effective mechanism for risk pooling in a way that will allow system learning and therefore innovation. This does not allow for the limiting of expenditure in this area if there is limited tax funding available, however by taking a long term view and developing the fund, the return on investment will eventually be able to offset the need to entirely fund the disability system from tax revenue. 45. Finally, I note that the system will provide for an intergenerational, long term approach to address social and health related issues within New Zealand society. It provides a forum to develop that debate and a mechanism to implement change in a sensible, sustainable way as we transition from where we are now to a different funding model. Requested outcome 46. I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you further on this in person and to hear any concerns or criticisms you may have that might allow me to emphasise certain aspects of my research enquiry. 47. I ask that you please note my submission in any reporting along with any conclusions drawn on the funding model I am suggesting. 48. I hope to have further detail on my proposal by August of 2018 to allow for public consultation before finalising my research in late 2018.
