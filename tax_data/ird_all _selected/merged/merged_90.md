The Bill is currently expected to receive its second reading in the week beginning 10 June. Executive Summary 3.The Bill includes a proposal to require offshore suppliers of imported goods valued at or below $1,000 to register for and return GST on supplies of these goods to New Zealand consumers. This proposal will level the playing field between domestic retailers and offshore goods suppliers by ensuring that GST is paid on the sales of both. 4.At its introduction, the Bill included an application date of 1 October 2019 for the GST on low-value imported goods proposal. Several submissions on the Bill made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee (FEC) raised concerns about the short lead-in time between enactment of the legislation and the 1 October start date. 5.In response to submissions, the FEC has recommended that the application date be delayed by two months to 1 December 2019. 6.A two-month delay would help mitigate the risk of offshore shopping websites temporarily ceasing the shipment of goods to New Zealand and would help ensure a smooth and successful launch of the new rules (for instance, by better enabling the fast freight industry and customs brokers to make consequential software changes). 7.However, delaying the application date by two months to 1 December 2019 would have a net fiscal cost of $9.666 million over the 2019/20 to 2022/23 forecast period. The impact will be limited to the 2019/20 fiscal year. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 1. 2 8. It would also delay the benefits of the proposal in terms of achieving fairness and a level playing field for New Zealand retailers. 9. On balance, we recommend that Cabinet agree to an application date of 1 December 2019, in line with the FEC’s recommendation. Background 10. The Bill proposes requiring offshore suppliers of imported goods valued at or below $1,000 to register for and return GST on these supplies. 11. Several submissions on the Bill (including from Amazon, Alibaba and eBay) have raised concerns that there will be insufficient time after the Bill is enacted for offshore suppliers to make the systems changes necessary to start collecting GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers from 1 October 2019. 1 12. Amazon, Alibaba and eBay have stated that they will not invest in making the necessary systems changes until the law is enacted as until that time the proposed rules are not yet finalised and may be subject to change. 13. The Bill is expected to be enacted in late June 2019. This is approximately three months before the changes are due to take effect. If for any reason the Bill does not receive its third reading by 27 June, it should be noted that the House does not sit again until 24 July, so enactment would not occur until late July – leaving only two months between enactment and 1 October 2019. 14. As GST is a real-time transactions-based tax, the affected suppliers will need their systems for charging and collecting GST to be fully operational from the start date. 15. Part of the technical challenge for large marketplaces such as Amazon, Alibaba and eBay is that their websites are complex and are designed to service a global customer base. This means the systems changes they need to make to comply with New Zealand’s GST requirements will need to be carefully planned and tested to ensure they do not create errors that interfere with other parts of their systems. 16. Alibaba and eBay have noted there is a risk they may have to temporarily block their sales to New Zealand customers until they can make the necessary changes and comply with our laws. If they or other suppliers are forced to take this action, it would reduce consumer choice and lead to unhappy consumers and negative publicity. 17. Providing insufficient time for suppliers to make the systems changes could also impact on the successful launch of the new revenue collection system which is critical to the ongoing success of the rules. 18. New Zealand Post and some in the fast freight industry have also raised concerns about their ability to make necessary software changes by 1 October 2019. 1 Alibaba and eBay, Amazon, CAPEC New Zealand, Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, Deloitte and PwC all made submissions to FEC recommending a delay to the proposed application date. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 3 Analysis 19. We consider that submitters have raised genuine concerns about offshore suppliers’ and marketplaces’ ability to implement the necessary systems changes within the two- to-three months between enactment and the proposed application date. As such, we recommend that the application date of 1 December 2019 in the Bill as reported back by the FEC remain. 20. The proposed two-month delay would help to mitigate the risk of offshore shopping websites temporarily ceasing the shipment of goods to New Zealand customers and would help ensure a smooth and successful launch of the new rules. 21. Delaying the application date by two months to 1 December 2019 would reduce forecast GST revenue by $14 million over the 2019/20 to 2022/23 forecast period (the forecast would be revised downward to $390m of additional GST revenue as opposed to the $404m that was forecast with an October 2019 application date). However, this reduction in GST revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in funding required for Vote Customs and Vote Biosecurity of $4.334 million. 22. Currently, the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) collects duty (including GST), as well as cost recovery charges (its Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy) on all imported consignments with $60 or more of duty owing. This threshold is equivalent to a consignment value of $400 if GST is the only duty applying. 23. As part of the design of the proposals, Customs will no longer collect duty or the Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy on consignments with a value of $1,000 or less (CAB-18-MIN-0466.01 refers). If Cabinet approves the proposed delay in the application date to 1 December 2019, the Customs and Excise Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2019 (relating to the thresholds for collecting duty and the Import Entry Transaction Fee) and any required changes to the Biosecurity (System Entry Levy) Order 2010 will also need to come into force on that date. 24. Delaying the application date by two months would also delay the benefits of the proposal in terms of achieving fairness and a level playing field for New Zealand retailers. If Cabinet agrees to the change, my officials will contact submitters, including Retail NZ to explain why a short two-month delay was considered necessary. Consultation 25. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment was consulted and is supportive of the proposed delay. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry for Primary Industries were informed. 26. Following public submissions on the Bill, officials had discussions with Alibaba, Amazon and eBay about the 1 October application date. It was clear from these discussions that these organisations would welcome any delay in the application date, although their first preference (as stated in their written submissions) would be a start date of 1 April 2020 at the earliest. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 4 27. The Conference of Asia-Pacific Express Carriers (CAPEC), the Customs Brokers and Freight Forwarders Federation of New Zealand Inc (CBAFF) and New Zealand Post were specifically consulted on the proposed two-month delay, as well as an alternative option of delaying application by three months to 1 January 2020. 28. These stakeholders also prefer a 1 April 2020 application date (delay of six months). A 1 December 2019 or 1 January 2020 application date would create difficulties, as it clashes with New Zealand Post’s and the fast freight industry’s peak period. However, if given a choice between these two dates, CAPEC and CBAFF prefer an application date of 1 January 2020, while New Zealand Post prefers an application date of 1 December 2019 over 1 January 2020. Financial Implications 29. The proposed 1 December 2019 application date would have a net fiscal cost of $9.666 million over the forecast period. This is due to an estimated reduction in GST revenue, offset by a reduction in the replacement funding required for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries. GST Revenue 30. Changing the date of implementation will result in forgone tax revenue as current forecasts assume a 1 October 2019 implementation date. The revenue impact is limited to the 2019/20 fiscal year. The estimated revenue impact is outlined in the table below: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Tax Revenue: GST (1 October 2019 application date) - 66.000 100.000 112.000 126.000 Tax Revenue: GST (1 December 2019 application) - 52.000 100.000 112.000 126.000 Total Operating - (14.000) - - - 31. The $14 million forgone tax revenue would be charged as a pre-commitment against the Budget 2020 operating allowance. Vote Customs/Vote Biosecurity 32. As noted in paragraph 22, Customs will not collect the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Ministry for Primary Industries’ associated Biosecurity System Entry Levy on consignments valued at $1,000 or less. 33. Both agencies have received contingency funding in Budget 2019 to replace revenue forgone from 1 October 2019. If Cabinet agrees to delay application to 1 December 2019, then the funding required, in the 2019/20 fiscal year, will reduce from $9.222 million to $6.886 million for Vote Customs and $8.991 million to $6.993 million for Vote Biosecurity. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 5 Legislative Implications 34. The amended application date is included in the Bill as reported back to the House by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Reversing the change in the application date proposed by the FEC would require Cabinet and Parliamentary support for a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) at the Committee of the whole House stage. Given that an SOP to the Bill is planned to be introduced in the week beginning 18 June, this could effectively delay the enactment of the Bill, exacerbating the concerns raised about the amount of lead-in time between enactment and application. Impact Analysis 35. A RIA GST on low-value imported goods was prepared by Inland Revenue and Customs in September 2018. The information in this RIA has been updated to reflect the proposal in this Cabinet paper to delay the application date of the proposals by two months. The updated RIA is attached. 36. The quality assurance assessment remains the same as the original RIA. When the original RIA was reviewed by a panel from Treasury, Inland Revenue and Customs, the reviewers considered that the Regulatory Impact Assessment partially met the quality criteria as it could probably have been clearer and more concise. Human Rights, Gender and Disability Implications 37. The proposal is consistent with the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. 38. The proposal does not have gender or disability implications. Publicity 39. The Minister of Revenue has issued a press release announcing that an extension has been included in the reported back version of the Bill, in response to submissions to the FEC. Our officials will also contact affected submitters to inform them of the change. Proactive Release 40. We propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated RIA and minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Ministers of Finance, Revenue and Customs recommend that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1. Note that several submitters on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, New Zealand Post and some in the fast freight industry have expressed concern that it may be difficult to implement the necessary system changes to comply with the GST on low-value imported goods proposal by 1 October 2019. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 6 2. Note that in response to submissions, the Bill as reported back by the Finance and Expenditure Committee delays the application date for the GST on low-value imported goods proposal by two months to 1 December 2019. 3. Agree to the proposed 1 December 2019 application date of the GST on low-value imported goods changes. 4. Note the following changes as a result of the decision in recommendation 3 above, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Tax Revenue: GST (1 October 2019 application date) - 66.000 100.000 112.000 126.000 Tax Revenue: GST (1 December 2019 application) - 52.000 100.000 112.000 126.000 Total Operating - (14.000) - - - 5. Agree that the forgone revenue under recommendation 4 above be charged as a pre- commitment against the Budget 2020 operating allowance. 6. Note that if the application date of the GST on low-value imported goods changes are delayed to 1 December 2019: 6.1 the Customs and Excise Amendment Regulations (No 2) 2019 (relating to the thresholds for collecting duty and the Import Entry Transaction Fee); and 6.2 any required changes to the Biosecurity (System Entry Levy) Order 2010 will also come into force on 1 December 2019. 7. Note that this Cabinet paper and the associated Cabinet minute will be proactively released on Inland Revenue’s website. Authorised for lodgement Hon Grant Robertson Minister of Finance Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue Hon Kris Faafoi Minister of Customs 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:22 Impact Statement T emplate | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Coversheet: GST on low-value imported goods Advising agencies Inland Revenue, New Zealand Customs Service Decision sought Final policy approval Proposing Ministers Hon Grant Robertson (Minister of Finance), Hon Stuart Nash (Minister of Revenue) and Hon Kris Faafoi (Minister of Customs) No te : Ch a ng es to th e Imp a c t Sta te me n t Submissions on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill expressed concern about the proposed application date of the GST amendments of 1 October 2019, noting that this leaves little time between the likely enactment date of the Bill and the start of the proposed collection system for GST on low-value imported goods. Submitters considered that offshore suppliers cannot be expected to invest in making information technology systems changes until the law is enacted, as the proposed rules are not finalised and may yet be subject to change. They have also noted that there may not be enough time after the rules are finalised for offshore suppliers to register for New Zealand GST and make the systems changes necessary to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers by 1 October 2019. This raises a risk that electronic marketplaces and suppliers (that do intend to comply with the proposed legislation) may be left with little choice other than to temporarily cease shipping goods to New Zealand from 1 October until the required systems changes are ready. In light of the issues raised with officials and, by submitters, Ministers’ preferred option in relation to the application date is 1 December 2019, so the Impact Statement has been updated to reflect this Ministerial preference. Fiscal impact of the proposed delay The tax forecasts in the original Impact Statement assumed an application date of 1 October 2019. A delay in the application date to 1 December 2019 would reduce the forecast amount of GST revenue for the 2019/20 fiscal year by $14 million. Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries have been allocated extra funding in Budget 2019 by way of tagged contingencies. These amounts will decrease by approximately $4.334 million in the 2019/20 fiscal year if implementation of the proposals is delayed to 1 December 2019. The net fiscal cost of the proposed delay in implementation is therefore estimated at $9.666 million. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 2. Impact Statement T emplate | 2 IN CONFIDENCE Su mma r y : Pr o ble m a n d Pr o po se d Ap pr o ac h Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? The Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). The problem under consideration is how to implement the proposed system in a way that imposes as little deadweight cost as possible on the parties involved and in the least distortionary way possible, while also maximising voluntary compliance. Proposed Approach How will Government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? The taxing point for imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is proposed to be the point of sale (as opposed to being at the border, as is presently the case for consignments between the Customs de minimis 1 and $1,000). This means that non-resident suppliers (as well as electronic marketplaces and “re-deliverers”) 2 would be required to register for, collect, return and remit GST on their sales of goods valued at or below $1,000. This is considered to be the most feasible and cost-effective collection option at this time. Requiring offshore suppliers to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $1,000 is Inland Revenue’s preferred approach. The reason for this preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on making the rules as simple as possible for the parties involved in order to minimise aggregate compliance costs. Customs prefers an approach whereby offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST on imported goods valued at or below $400. Under Customs’ preferred approach, Customs would continue to collect GST and other charges on imported consignments valued above $400. Customs prefers this approach because it is estimated to collect $303 million of additional GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold. The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under a $1,000 threshold, and Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. 1 The Customs de minimis is defined as the minimum amount of “duty” collectable (which includes GST), as opposed to the maximum value of a consignment on which duty is not collected. The de minimis is $60, meaning that if the amount of GST and duties on a consignment is less than $60, revenue and cost recovery charges are not collected on that consignment. 2 An electronic marketplace, such as a website, app or internet portal, is commonly used by sellers to market and sell their products to buyers. Re-deliverers are used by consumers when the supplier of the goods (or the marketplace) does not offer shipping to New Zealand. The most common scenario is that the goods are instead shipped to an overseas mailbox from which the re-deliverer collects the goods and ships them to New Zealand, but the re-deliverer definition would also include businesses providing personal shopper services. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 3 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n B: Su mma r y Imp a c ts : Be ne fits a n d c o s ts Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? Key beneficiaries are expected to be: • Government: The New Zealand Government would collect additional GST, estimated to be $52 million for the 2019/20 fiscal year (assuming a 1 December 2019 application date). However the Government may incur a fiscal cost of approximately $17.795 million per annum (based on the 2017/18 year) in replacing funding for Customs and the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) that is currently cost-recovered by the two agencies under existing arrangements, depending on final decisions. The Government would also forgo tariffs (of up to $3.2 million per annum based on the 2017/18 year) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. • Domestic retailers: Collecting GST on low-value imported goods may in some cases help to improve New Zealand-based retailers’ ability to compete with offshore suppliers of low-value goods. • Fast freight: Courier companies would no longer collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on behalf of the Government on goods between the current de minimis and $1,000. This is expected to generate some administrative cost savings for the industry. • New Zealand Post: Like courier companies, New Zealand Post would no longer be involved in collecting revenue on goods valued at or below $1,000 which may lead to some cost savings. • Consumers: While consumers as a whole are unambiguously worse off, some consumers would benefit from the removal of tariffs and cost recovery charges from imported consignments between the de minimis and $1,000. • Businesses importing low-value goods: Businesses that import low-value consignments would also benefit from the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Where do the costs fall? Costs are expected to fall on: • Consumers: Consumers would pay GST on imported goods valued at less than $400 which they previously would not have paid any GST or duties on under the current border collection system. Suppliers’ compliance costs may also be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices (over and above the amount of the tax itself). There is also a risk that consumer choice may be adversely affected if suppliers cease to offer shipping of goods to delivery addresses in New Zealand. Consumers may also experience delays in receiving goods if Customs and MPI require increased physical inspections as a consequence of a potential decrease in the reliability of information provided to Customs for border and biosecurity risk assessment. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Suppliers (including electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers): Suppliers meeting the $60,000 GST registration threshold would bear the compliance costs of making the necessary systems changes and implementing new processes, registering, filing GST returns and remitting the GST to Inland Revenue. Suppliers selling through electronic marketplaces would not be required to register and return GST to Inland Revenue if their non-marketplace sales to New Zealand consumers are less than $60,000, as the operator of the electronic marketplace would be the entity responsible for registering and returning GST on sales made by third parties through its marketplace. In these situations, the marketplace operator may pass its compliance costs on to the underlying suppliers. • New Zealand-based manufacturers: Footwear and clothing manufacturers may be adversely affected by the removal of tariffs on imported footwear and clothing under the proposed $1,000 threshold (given that the few remaining tariffs are mostly on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries). However, these industries have already had to adapt to the increasing non-collection of tariffs, as the phased implementation of New Zealand’s free trade agreements mean that the amount of tariffs that would otherwise be collected if no action is taken would be decreasing over time anyway. • Customs and MPI: Cost recovery charges 3 which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk management activities at the border would be forgone on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. This would exacerbate an existing funding shortfall for Customs and MPI until a new cost recovery regime is put in place, unless Crown funding is provided to replace the lost cost-recovered funding. Customs and MPI may also incur costs should the quality of data associated with entries diminish resulting in increased physical inspection of goods. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? Key risks and unintended impacts include: • Risk of suppliers and electronic marketplaces ceasing to offer shipping to New Zealand delivery addresses: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non-resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to ship goods to New Zealand delivery addresses. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 4 The inclusion of rules that impose the liability to register for and return GST on operators of electronic marketplaces in respect of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers by non-resident suppliers should help to 3 The Import Entry Transaction Fee and associated Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy. 4 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 5 IN CONFIDENCE mitigate the risk of smaller suppliers ceasing to ship to New Zealand, as many of these suppliers would be selling to New Zealand through an electronic marketplace. Officials’ preferred options that are outlined in this Regulatory Impact Assessment include measures that are intended to simplify the requirements for non-resident suppliers, operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers as much as possible, which should help to reduce this risk. • Competitive disadvantages for compliant businesses: There is a risk that the addition of GST to the prices of goods offered to consumers by compliant businesses may result in a competitive advantage for other businesses that would not be required to register and return GST (or that would not comply with the rules if liable to register). The inclusion of rules that would deem operators of electronic marketplaces to be the suppliers of low-value goods sold through their marketplaces by non-residents should help to minimise this risk by improving compliance with the rules. This would however result in GST being collected on goods supplied by non-residents that would not otherwise be required to be returned if these suppliers sold goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website. It is a possibility that this may potentially create a competitive disadvantage for compliant marketplace operators. However, this risk is not thought to be significant given the market dominance of the large electronic marketplaces. • Quality of import entry information for biosecurity and border risk assessment: The preferred option may reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information (as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments below $1,000), which may have adverse consequences for the management of biosecurity and other border risks. Customs and MPI will monitor any impacts on the management of border and biosecurity risks. • Undervaluation of goods by suppliers or importers for Customs purposes: Compared with the existing de minimis, a $1,000 threshold may exacerbate the existing issue of undervaluation in relation to high-value consignments. This may not have a significant impact on net GST collections on imported consignments valued above $1,000 (as the vast majority of imported goods above $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses), but this could have adverse implications for the collection of tariffs and cost recovery charges on high-value consignments. • Potential behavioural changes by consumers: Compared with the existing de minimis, the $1,000 threshold may also incentivise consumers to purchase goods valued between $400 and $1,000 free of GST/VAT from offshore retailers that would be below the registration threshold. It is difficult to say how significant this risk may be, since it is expected that many larger offshore retailers that ship goods to New Zealand would be above the registration threshold, and it is unclear how many smaller offshore suppliers below the registration threshold would sell goods to New Zealand consumers through their own website or mail order. Consumers may also be incentivised to arrange for friends or family members in foreign countries to buy goods for them and reimburse the friend or family member. However, whether this would necessarily be cost-effective is uncertain, as it is likely to be the case that the consumer would end up paying foreign 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 6 IN CONFIDENCE VAT, GST or sales tax if they arrange for a friend or family member to buy the goods and ship the goods to them. Identify any significant incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Sec tio n C: Ev id e nc e c er ta in ty a n d q u ality a ss u ra n ce Agency rating of evidence certainty? Analysing the impact of the proposals on offshore suppliers has been constrained by the lack of data and information available. Fiscal impact estimates have been modelled using retail banking data for the 2017/18 fiscal year supplied by Datamine. Online transactions were identified using a range of methods, including by identifying whether a card was present for a transaction and isolating transactions with known e-commerce only retailers. To exclude services and intangibles and the likes of tax payments, only transactions with merchant category codes clearly related to goods retail were included. Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: The Treasury, Inland Revenue Department and New Zealand Customs Quality Assurance Assessment: A joint panel from The Treasury, Inland Revenue and Customs considers that the Regulatory Impact Assessment partially meets the quality criteria. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: The RIS could probably be clearer and more concise, particularly as to the nature and implications of the agency disagreement as to the value threshold below which offshore suppliers would be required to collect GST. However, it seems unlikely that this would make the decision itself any more clear-cut, since the adoption of either threshold will entail downsides as well as upsides. It is also evident that consumer and supplier behaviour will be a major driver of the outcome in practice, particularly in terms of revenue collected. It will therefore be important, as set out in the RIS, to collect data and information from different sources, including experience in other jurisdictions, to inform ongoing monitoring and possibly review of the new approach. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Statement: GST on low-value imported goods Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue and the New Zealand Customs Service are responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations and constraints on the analysis are as follows: • Range of options considered: The Government has already made a decision that it intends to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 (refer CAB-18-MIN-0143). Options considered are therefore focussed on the key design settings for that particular collection model (as opposed to considering alternative collection models), including the level of the low-value goods threshold. • Evidence of the problem: There are some uncertainties about the scale of the problem in terms of estimating the forgone GST revenue. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine suggests a potential forgone revenue figure on imported goods below the de minimis for the 2017/18 fiscal year of approximately $130 million, which is assumed to be growing at a rate of around 11.9 percent each year. • Quality of data used for impact analysis: It is not possible to accurately determine how many offshore suppliers may register and comply under the preferred option. A crude estimate may be obtained by reference to the number of entities that have registered under Australia’s new GST legislation (which is based on essentially the same collection model). However, registrations are continuing to be processed in Australia, which means that the eventual number of registrants in Australia may be significantly more than the 721 entities that had registered as of 10 July 2018. While there is data on how much GST is collected by Customs on imported goods, it is not possible to determine the net amount of GST collected on imported goods as many consignments are imported by GST-registered businesses that are able to claim the GST back from Inland Revenue. This means the potential fiscal risk of increasing the threshold above which GST is collected on consignments at the border and below which non-resident suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers are responsible for returning GST cannot be precisely quantified. • Assumptions underpinning impact analysis: The Government’s proposed approach is estimated to increase GST revenue by approximately $66 million for the 2018/19 fiscal year, increasing to $100 million and $112 million in the 2019/20 and 2020/21 fiscal years respectively. The primary caveat to this revenue forecast 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 8 IN CONFIDENCE is that it assumes static behaviour on the part of both suppliers and consumers. However, the imposition of GST on low-value imported goods may decrease consumers’ propensity to buy goods from offshore, and may also decrease suppliers’ willingness to ship goods to New Zealand, further increasing costs of importing goods for consumers. Another key limitation is that the revenue forecast assumes for simplicity a 100 percent collection rate under the existing border collection system in relation to consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. The limitation of this assumption is that it is clear that undervaluation by suppliers is an issue to some extent, but the exact scale of the problem and the amount of GST forgone as a result are unknown. • Time constraints: The Government has chosen offshore supplier registration as the proposed collection model on the basis that this is the only option that can be feasibly and cost effectively implemented in 2019/20 (that is, without having to wait for future technological advancements and improvements in the availability of electronic advance data in the international postal system).

Historically, the majority of imported goods have been imported by businesses in consignments valued above the de minimis. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers imported goods below the de minimis. Therefore, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing imported goods below the de minimis were considered to outweigh the benefits of taxation at that time. However, the growth in online purchases means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant (retail banking data supplied by Datamine indicates that New Zealand consumers spent approximately $870 million online on goods from offshore suppliers in 2017/18). The implication of this is that domestic businesses may be at a disadvantage compared with offshore businesses supplying products with no GST added to the price of the goods. It also means that the Government is forgoing GST revenue on goods that are consumed in New Zealand, and this forgone revenue is increasing over time. Based on a seven-year average, the number of imported consignments valued below $400 is growing at about 17 percent per annum. In response to these issues, the Government has made a decision to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low-value imported goods (refer CAB-18- MIN-0143). 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? Border collection system GST is currently collected by the New Zealand Customs Service on imported consignments on which at least $60 of “duty” (including GST) is collectable. In practice this means that GST is not collected on imported consignments with a value below $400 (including freight and insurance) if GST is the only duty owing (which is typically the case). However, where the goods are subject to tariffs, the insurance and freight-inclusive value of the goods may be as low as $226, depending on the applicable tariff rate and the amount of international freight and insurance charges. 5 Customs’ and MPI’s border risk and biosecurity activities are funded by the collection of cost recovery charges on imported consignments above the de minimis. Work to date has shown that a substantial reduction in the current de minimis (from $60 of duty) is not feasible in the short term as the marginal costs of collection under the existing system would outweigh the additional revenue collected. The extent to which the de minimis may eventually be reduced in a cost-effective way under the current system or under a model where fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post collect the GST is also uncertain, as is the likely timing of such a reduction in the de minimis. Other interested agencies (from a trade, competition or consumer affairs standpoint) are the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and 5 This consignment value of $226 assumes that the applicable tariff rate is the maximum 10 percent rate and that there are no clearly separable freight and insurance charges. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Employment (MBIE), who were all consulted during the process of drafting this Regulatory Impact Assessment. Offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on remote services The preferred option builds upon the existing system that has been successfully implemented since 1 October 2016 for the collection of GST on cross-border supplies of “remote” services, including supplies of digital services and intangibles such as streaming services and software. At the time of designing the rules, policy officials had conservatively estimated the total forgone GST revenue to be around $40 million and that around 100 businesses might register. Since implementation, the rules have been performing better than initial expectations, with $131 million in revenue being collected under these rules for the 2017/18 tax year (the year covering 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018) with over 200 businesses registered to date. This more than favourably compares with other jurisdictions’ experience with implementing similar rules for the collection of consumption taxes on cross-border services and intangibles. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? GST as a broad-based consumption tax should apply to all consumption that occurs within New Zealand, including imported goods. This helps to ensure GST is fair, efficient and simple, as opposed to being a tax that distorts competition by creating biases in consumers’ or businesses’ behaviour or which collects little revenue by only collecting on a narrow tax base. At present, GST is collected on imported goods when duty (including tariffs and GST) of $60 or more applies. This threshold is called the de minimis 6 and equates to a consignment value that varies between $226 and $400 according to whether or not tariffs are payable. The non- collection of GST is problematic because the growth in online purchases from offshore suppliers means that the volume of low-value imported goods on which GST is not collected is large and growing, and so is the amount of forgone revenue. Forgone revenue Estimates of the forgone revenue vary. In 2015, Inland Revenue estimated a ‘maximum potential’ forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $140 million per annum using credit card data. Officials did further work in 2016 using a mixed dataset including Customs sample data on import values, as well as data on volumes from New Zealand Post and fast freight carriers and Australian estimates of the split between business and consumer purchases. This work indicated a lower potential forgone GST revenue figure of approximately $80 million for the 2016 calendar year. More recently, Inland Revenue has estimated using retail banking data that approximately $130 million in GST revenue was forgone in 2017. This more recent figure is considered to be more robust than previous estimates, as the use of merchant category codes and proxies for identifying online-only transactions should mean that the dataset roughly consists only of online purchases of goods from offshore suppliers. A limitation of the 2015 estimate is that an assumption had to be made about the split 6 The rationale behind having a de minimis is to achieve a balance between the cost of collection and revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the free flow of goods across the border. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 11 IN CONFIDENCE between spending on goods versus spending on services and intangibles. The main limitation of the 2017 estimate (based on a mixed dataset including Customs’ sample data) is that its reliance on declared values may produce an estimate that is lower than the actual forgone revenue, as suppliers may be incentivised under the current system to under- declare values. The growth in direct consumer imports is a relatively recent development and the amount of forgone GST is expected to continue to grow – estimates vary but assuming the growth in the total value of goods imported below the de minimis is 11.9 percent per year 7 , the amount of forgone GST is forecasted to grow to $183 million by 2021 if no action is taken. Competitive neutrality The extent to which the current non-collection influences consumers’ purchasing decisions is unclear, as there are a number of reasons why New Zealand consumers may purchase goods from offshore, including overall cheaper prices, product availability and convenience. However, ideally, the tax treatment should not be a factor in consumers’ purchasing decisions. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The following options were considered and ruled out by ministers: • Collection between the point of sale and delivery by transporters: fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post would collect GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges on goods above a lowered de minimis (“extended status quo” or “transporter model”). • Collection after delivery: consumers would pay GST directly to the government after delivery of the goods (“pay after delivery” or a “consumer reverse charge”). These options were also considered by officials in a previous Regulatory Impact Assessment in July 2017 and by the Tax Working Group (the TWG). The TWG recommended that the Government implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on low- value imported goods, noting that practical concerns with options to collect GST between the point of sale and delivery and after delivery mean these two options may not be feasible in the short term. The previous work on GST on cross-border services and intangibles considered an option where financial intermediaries, such as credit card companies and other payment processing intermediaries, would be responsible for remitting GST on online purchases of low-value imported goods. This option was considered to be unlikely to be feasible because financial intermediaries would be unlikely to have the information necessary to precisely determine in all cases whether the payment was for goods or services (or both), or whether the goods or services were purchased while the consumer was overseas. Another limitation is that where the payment for the goods is made to a New Zealand-based entity (such as a resident marketplace), there would not be sufficient information about whether the underlying supplier of the goods is based offshore or not. 7 The growth in the total value of low-value goods imported by New Zealand consumers would be less than the annual growth in volumes of 17%, as the majority of the growth in volumes is at the lower value bands. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Interdependencies with ongoing work Customs’ border risk management and MPI’s current biosecurity processes are reliant on information about the content of low-value goods. For example, courier companies provide information on low-value goods prior to their arrival at the border for risk management. Import entry data are used by MPI and Customs to risk-assess consignments at the border. This means that these existing information requirements would need to remain in place under the preferred option, even though this information would not be used for the collection of GST or tariff duty on low-value imported goods. There are also cost recovery implications for Customs and MPI, associated with the proposed removal of the Import Entry Transaction Fee and the Biosecurity Systems Entry Levy (which fund Customs’ and MPI’s risk and biosecurity assessment activities at the border) from imported consignments with a value of $1,000 or less. Customs is currently reviewing its cost recovery arrangement and will report back on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding in the context of that review. MPI expects to report to Cabinet on the financial implications of its lost cost-recovered funding at the time of final policy decisions by Cabinet on the GST on low-value imported goods proposals. Both MFAT and MBIE carry out work which has implications for New Zealand’s tariff policy. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 13 IN CONFIDENCE 2.5 What do stakeholders think? The main stakeholders are consumers, non-resident suppliers of low-value goods, operators of electronic marketplaces, re-deliverers, the fast freight industry and customs brokers, New Zealand Post, domestic retailers, tax advisors and domestic clothing and footwear manufacturers. A government discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system was released in May 2018 for full public consultation on key design issues. Inland Revenue received 32 submissions in response to the discussion document. A further 49 submissions to the Tax Working Group that mentioned the GST on low-value imported goods issue were also forwarded to Inland Revenue officials to consider. The submissions received were from private sector tax advisors, goods transporters and customs brokers, New Zealand business groups, electronic marketplaces and a number of private individuals. Most submissions were generally favourable at a high level of the proposed offshore supplier registration system. However, some submissions indicated a preference for a different collection model to the one proposed in the discussion document, or otherwise stated that other collection models should be given further consideration before being discounted. A couple of submissions from tax advisors considered that the proposed offshore supplier registration system may only be an interim step until technological advancements make an alternative collection model feasible. The New Zealand retail industry groups that made submissions on the discussion document agreed with the analysis of the problem presented in the discussion document and were strongly in favour of the proposed solution. New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and customs brokers were also broadly supportive of the proposed approach but expressed some concerns about the finer details of how the system would be implemented, particularly in relation to the lack of detail provided in the discussion document as to how the proposals would interact with customs processes at the border and any potential changes to these processes. Most private individuals (the bulk of whom submitted to the TWG rather than on the discussion document) supported the collection of GST on low-value imported goods. However, as most of these submissions were made to the TWG prior to the release of the discussion document, these submissions tended not to comment on any specific details of the proposals, such as the proposed collection model. A small number of submissions (including those on the discussion document and to the TWG) from private individuals were opposed to the collection of GST on low-value imported goods regardless of the collection model. Submitters’ views on the design options are noted in the discussion of those options in section 5. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 14 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3 : O p tio n s id e n tific a tio n 3.1 What options are available to address the problem? The options analysed in section 5 consist of the following packages of key design options: • Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (with some gap-filling design options added in for where the discussion document was silent on a specific design detail). • Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400. • Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Option one: Design options proposed in the government discussion document (status quo option) In April 2018, Cabinet decided to implement an offshore supplier registration system for collecting GST on imported goods valued at or below $400 and to release a government discussion document to consult on the design details of the proposed system (refer CAB- 18-MIN-0143). This option reflects the package of design features that were proposed in the government discussion document released for public consultation in May 2018. Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would only apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $400 or less. 8 Goods would be covered by the proposed regime where either the actual supplier of the goods (or the supplier for GST purposes if not the same person) arranges, assists or facilitates the delivery of the goods to a New Zealand address. 9 Supplies to GST-registered businesses would be excluded from the scope of the rules. Rules for determining whether the supply is made to a consumer or to a GST-registered business would apply. However, where GST is charged on a supply to a GST-registered business, the supplier would be allowed to issue the recipient with a tax invoice (thus allowing the GST-registered recipient to claim a deduction for the GST in its GST return), 8 The calculation of the customs value is set out in Schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act 2018. In the case of low-value imported goods, the customs value would generally be the transaction value of the goods (being the price paid or payable when they are sold for export to New Zealand), subject to a number of adjustments including deductions for the costs of transportation, insurance and other charges and expenses related to the handling and transportation of the goods from the time they have left the country of export. For the purposes of determining whether GST applies at the point of sale, a supplier would be able to self- assess the customs value using a reasonable estimate as at the time of supply, rather than being required to determine it strictly in accordance with schedule 4 of the Customs and Excise Act. 9 The discussion document was silent on whether or not this $400 threshold would be based on the customs value or the freight and insurance-inclusive value of the goods. Basing the threshold on the customs value of the goods has been chosen on the basis of feedback received in submissions. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 15 IN CONFIDENCE provided that the value of the supply does not exceed $1,000 – otherwise the supplier would be required to provide a refund of the GST. Non-resident suppliers would be required to register for GST and collect and return GST on goods that have a customs value of $400 or less if their taxable supplies of goods and services exceed (or are expected to exceed) $60,000 in a given 12-month period. However, where low-value goods are sold through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier of the goods for GST purposes and would therefore have the responsibility for registering and returning GST. Suppliers that only sell through GST-registered electronic marketplaces (or who make less than $60,000 in taxable supplies outside of a GST-registered electronic marketplace) would not be required to register. A re-deliverer would only be deemed to be the supplier of low-value goods imported by a consumer if neither the supplier nor an operator of an electronic marketplace assists in bringing the goods to New Zealand. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $400 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $400. Double taxation (where both the supplier and Customs collect GST) may arise when multiple low-value goods are sent in a single consignment valued above $400, or if low-value goods are sent in a consignment with goods valued above $400. Double taxation could also arise where the exchange rate used by the supplier at the time of supply differed from that used by Customs at the time of importation. The supplier would be required to issue a receipt to a New Zealand consumer in relation to a supply of low-value imported goods. The receipt would be required to include the name and GST registration number of the supplier, the date of issue and a description of the goods supplied. If GST has been charged on all of the goods, the receipt should show the amount paid for the supply along with a statement that this includes GST, or alternatively, the receipt could identify the GST charged for each of the goods separately. If GST has been charged on only some of the goods (for instance if some are valued above $400), the receipt should include information showing whether GST has been charged on each of the goods. Monetary amounts detailed on the receipt would not need to be in New Zealand dollars. To prevent Customs from collecting GST on the importation of the goods, the consumer would provide their receipt to Customs when asked by Customs to pay the GST. Where double taxation does arise, the supplier would be responsible for providing the consumer with a refund of the GST. 10 10 The discussion document was silent on who would provide a refund. Placing the responsibility for providing refunds on the supplier is included as one of the design options here as it is officials’ preferred option in relation to who is responsible for providing refunds. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 16 IN CONFIDENCE Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST Operators of electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers need to use information from either underlying suppliers or consumers to determine the GST treatment of supplies. A marketplace operator would need to have information about the residency of an underlying supplier, as the proposed marketplace rules only apply to supplies made by non-resident underlying suppliers. Re-deliverers would rely on information provided by consumers about the value of the goods. Marketplace operators and re-deliverers would still be liable for GST and any associated interest or penalties in situations where the supplier or consumer provides incorrect or misleading information which results in a GST shortfall. Operators of electronic marketplaces would also be liable for GST on goods sold by non- resident suppliers through their marketplaces to New Zealand consumers in situations where: • The payment for the goods is made directly to the supplier instead of to the marketplace operator, or when there is not a split payment mechanism allowing the amount of the GST to be remitted by the payment processor to the marketplace operator; and • The supplier defaults on paying the amount of the GST to the marketplace operator. Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Scope of the rules and registration requirements With the exception of two additions, the design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules are the same as those described under option one. To reduce compliance costs for some suppliers (including re-deliverers and operators of electronic marketplaces), these businesses would be able to charge GST on goods valued above $400 supplied to New Zealand consumers if: • The supplier (or deemed supplier) self-assesses that their total sales of goods individually valued above $400 are no more than 5 percent of the value of their total supplies of goods to New Zealand consumers; or • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to allow a supplier not meeting the above 5 percent test to charge GST on goods valued above $400. 11 To reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST-registered businesses, suppliers would also be able to agree with the Commissioner on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is made to a GST- registered person. This could apply in situations where the nature of the supply or the total 11 The proposed discretion could cover circumstances where the 5 percent test is not met due to a minor or one- off discrepancy, where it is too difficult for the supplier to determine precisely whether or not their supplies of goods above the threshold to consumers are less than 5 percent of their total sales of goods to consumers (but it is likely to be the case that they would be less than 5 percent) and the Commissioner is satisfied that the supplier represents a low compliance risk. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 17 IN CONFIDENCE value of the supply is such that it would be expected to be received only by a GST-registered business. For example, if the supply is of a large number of low-value imported goods (for instance, hundreds of t-shirts or hundreds of hard copies of a book), either the nature or the value of the supply (or both) would likely indicate that the customer is not a consumer. The design features relating to registration requirements are the same as in option one. Interaction with border collection system Aside from one addition relating to the prevention of double taxation, the design features for how the proposed offshore supplier registration system would interact with the existing border collection system are the same as those described under option one. The supplier would be required to take reasonable steps to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents. 12 The supplier could do this by providing the fast freight carrier with a copy of the receipt described under option one, or by instructing the person that undertakes the fulfilment of the goods to do so. If the value of the consignment is above the low-value goods threshold, the fast freight carrier or customs broker would include the supplier’s GST registration number and information about which goods had GST collected by the supplier on the Customs documentation. If this information is included on Customs documents then Customs will only collect GST on the items in the consignment on which GST was not collected at the point of sale. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The Commissioner would be provided with the ability to prescribe or agree to a method for a marketplace operator or a re-deliverer to make conclusions relevant to whether they are the deemed supplier of low-value goods and the amount of GST that is payable. When exercising the discretion, the Commissioner would take into account the commercially relevant information that is available to the marketplace operator and the reliability of this information, the compliance costs of the marketplace operator and the mechanisms the marketplace operator has to prevent and address situations where incorrect information is provided. Where the marketplace operator or re-deliverer has a safe harbour agreement, they would not be liable for additional GST if they have relied on incorrect information and as a result have underpaid GST. If this happens, the underlying supplier or consumer may be required to register and pay the GST instead. Operators of electronic marketplaces would be able to claim a bad debt deduction in circumstances where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator, provided the marketplace’s commission or facilitation fee was also not collected. 12 At present this would only be feasible where goods are being delivered by fast freight, as there is currently insufficient electronic data on parcels sent through the international postal system. Hence this would not be a requirement where goods are sent to New Zealand by post. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 18 IN CONFIDENCE Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 (Ministers’ proposed option) Scope of the rules and registration requirements The proposed offshore supplier registration system would generally apply to goods supplied by non-residents with a customs value of $1,000 or less. With the exception of the change in the proposed low-value goods threshold from $400 to $1,000, the other design features relating to the scope of the proposed rules and registration requirements would be the same as those described under option two. Interaction with border collection system GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges would not be collected at the border on imported consignments with a customs value of $1,000 or less. However, GST (along with tariffs, cost recovery charges and other applicable levies) would continue to be collected at the border by Customs on consignments with a customs value in excess of $1,000. The design features for the prevention of double taxation are the same as those under option two, as is the process for GST refunds where double taxation does arise. Electronic marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST The design features for marketplace operators’ and re-deliverers’ liability for underpaid GST (where the supplier or consumer provided incorrect or misleading information or where the supplier defaulted in paying the GST to the marketplace operator) are the same as those in option two. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits, have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? The criteria against which the options have been assessed are: • Certainty and simplicity: The rules should be clear and simple to understand, so that taxpayers are aware of the GST treatment of a particular supply and their GST obligations. • Efficiency of compliance: Compliance costs for businesses and consumers should be minimised as far as possible. • Efficiency of administration: Administrative costs for government departments should be minimised as far as possible. • Fairness and equity: Taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation. • Sustainability and neutrality: The preferred option must have the ability to meet the objectives of collecting the forgone GST revenue and reducing the distortions the current treatment brings about, without unduly restricting trade and consumer choice or creating new distortions. Counteracting measures should be kept proportionate to the risks involved. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 19 IN CONFIDENCE Efficiency of compliance, sustainability and neutrality and fairness and equity are the most important criteria. It is generally worth trading off increased administration costs for gains in these three areas. The certainty and simplicity criterion would generally be positively correlated with the efficiency of compliance criterion, in that the more certain and simple the rules are, the lower compliance costs should be. However, there are some instances where increased simplicity and certainty for one group may come at the cost of increased uncertainty or complexity for another group. There may also be instances where having more flexible as opposed to prescriptive rules makes the rules simpler for some parties (and thus reduces their compliance costs) but results in the rules being more complex or less certain for other parties. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No low-value goods threshold An option where offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers would be required to charge GST on all supplies of imported goods to New Zealand consumers (with or without GST collection at the border by Customs on consignments above a certain value) was ruled out. This option was discounted because of concerns about the potential revenue risks involved with replacing the existing collection of GST at the border on high-value consignments with collection at the point of sale by offshore suppliers, being that offshore suppliers may not return the GST that they had collected (or had purported to have collected on the customs documentation). Defining the low-value goods threshold with reference to the value of the transaction Defining the low-value goods threshold in terms of the value of the total transaction, as opposed to the value of an individual good, was also ruled out. This is because multiple low- value goods could be sold together in the same transaction with a total value in excess of the low-value goods threshold. Non-taxation would therefore arise where the goods were shipped separately in multiple consignments each valued below the low-value goods threshold, thus creating an avoidance opportunity. Preventing double taxation The discussion document asked for submissions on whether a reasonable belief exception similar to that legislated in Australia may be an appropriate way to avoid double taxation. Under a reasonable belief exception, the supplier would not charge GST on a supply of low- value goods if it had a reasonable belief that the goods will be shipped together in a single consignment with a total value above the low-value goods threshold. A reasonable belief exception was ultimately ruled out on the basis that it would likely be only very rarely used by suppliers, based on the experience so far in Australia. It may also be potentially quite subjective, which could create difficulties for suppliers pose and potentially pose an integrity risk. Refunds where double taxation arises Options where either Customs or Inland Revenue would be responsible for providing GST refunds to consumers where double taxation arises were considered and ultimately ruled 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 20 IN CONFIDENCE out. This is mostly because having Customs provide refunds would be disproportionately costly and would likely be difficult for consumers (at present the provision of one refund takes two hours of staff time). Given that the instances of double taxation should be rare, having Inland Revenue set up an entirely new process is likely to also be disproportionately costly. It would also not be intuitive for consumers to approach Inland Revenue for a refund (being a party that they had not otherwise had any interaction with in relation to the transaction). It is expected that placing the responsibility for providing refunds on suppliers would provide suppliers with more incentive to take reasonable steps to prevent double taxation. Business-to-business supplies Options where offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST in respect of business-to-business supplies or where suppliers would have the option of charging GST on business-to-business supplies valued above $1,000 were ruled out owing to the revenue risks associated with high-value supplies, which naturally pose a greater fraud risk. 13 Electronic marketplaces A “pure” vendor collection model (where the only persons that would have a liability to register and return GST would be suppliers that have legal title over the goods sold to consumers) was not considered. Officials consider that the level of compliance with a pure vendor collection model would not be likely to be good enough to warrant serious consideration of such a model, as it is expected that a large proportion of revenue would continue to be forgone while also meaning that there would not be a level playing field for suppliers that do comply. A joint and several liability model, similar to the one introduced in the United Kingdom for tackling non-compliance by suppliers selling through online marketplaces, was not given much consideration primarily because it is similar to the rebuttable presumption model described below, and hence there are similar concerns with it in relation to compliance costs, enforcement and administration costs. Consideration was given to two exceptions to the “deemed supplier” approach behind the proposed marketplace rules: • Rebuttable presumption model: The default position would be that the marketplace would be deemed to be the supplier, but this presumption of liability can be rebutted if the marketplace agrees to meet the requirements of a “recognised marketplace”. A recognised marketplace would be required to provide Inland Revenue with information about their underlying suppliers, including their trading names, contact details and the total value of supplies of low-value goods that each of their underlying suppliers is making through the marketplace to New Zealand consumers. A recognised marketplace would also endeavour to ensure that liable suppliers have registered and are returning the GST on supplies made to New Zealand consumers, and 13 Although the goods covered by the proposals are by definition of a low value, multiple low-value goods may nevertheless be supplied together as a single high-value supply. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 21 IN CONFIDENCE would be required to block suppliers that are continuously non-compliant from selling to New Zealand where the marketplace is aware or should be aware of this non-compliance. For low-level compliance with their responsibilities, a recognised marketplace would be subject to warnings, ultimately leading to monetary penalties. For significant or ongoing non-compliance the marketplace would lose its “recognised” status even if, despite its best efforts to ensure compliance from suppliers, the suppliers selling through the marketplace are largely non-compliant. • Commissioner discretion: The Commissioner would have a discretion to allow a given electronic marketplace to not have the responsibility for registering and returning GST in respect of goods sold through its platform. This discretion would apply where the Commissioner considers the marketplace has a compelling case that it cannot be reasonably expected to be able to comply with the deemed supplier requirements. These two options were ultimately ruled out for the following reasons: The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion if exercised) would shift compliance costs to underlying suppliers. Aggregate compliance costs are therefore likely to be higher as a result of there being more collection entities, some of whom may have less sophisticated systems and may not be as well-resourced. The model would rely on ongoing commitment of resources by Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces to continually educate suppliers and enforce compliance. It is questionable that these responsibilities and the information requirements for recognised marketplaces would be less onerous than their obligations under the deemed supplier model. Inland Revenue and operators of recognised marketplaces would also need to deal with the risk of underlying suppliers continually creating new identities to avoid GST. If compliance is perceived to be low, this may reduce the willingness of other suppliers to comply. It would be difficult to assess the point at which the recognised marketplace would need to revert to being deemed to be the supplier for GST purposes where there is persistent non- compliance by underlying suppliers. Compliant underlying suppliers may be disrupted by potential deregistration. The rebuttable presumption model (and the Commissioner discretion option) would create uncertainty for electronic marketplaces and underlying suppliers in the lead-up to the implementation date, as it may take a considerable amount of time to reach an agreement with the Commissioner (or for the Commissioner to reach a conclusion as to whether her discretion should be exercised). Given there is just under five months between expected legislative enactment and 1 December 2019, it is desirable that all parties have certainty about their obligations so that they can make adequate preparations to comply. The use of the Commissioner’s discretion would be likely to distort competition between electronic marketplaces. There may also be risks that the Commissioner may be perceived as applying the discretion unfairly where it is available only to some electronic marketplaces, which would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the tax system. It may be difficult for the Commissioner to apply the discretion consistently and assess whether the marketplaces are capable of collecting GST. It may be especially difficult for the 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 22 IN CONFIDENCE Commissioner to respond to assertions that a marketplace may withdraw from the New Zealand market if the discretion is not applied. Many of the prominent electronic marketplaces would already be registered in Australia under their equivalent legislation. In many cases the systems already implemented by these marketplaces for Australia could be extended to comply with New Zealand’s rules, as the rules would be broadly similar. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 23 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4 : Imp ac t An a ly s is Marginal impact: How does each of the options identified at section 3.1 compare with the counterfactual, under each of the criteria set out in section 3.2? Option one Status quo (Design options proposed in the government discussion document) Option two Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $400 Option three Design options reflecting submissions, with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 Certainty and simplicity 0 + The addition of simplifying design details post-consultation should simplify compliance for suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers compared with option one. ++ Suppliers that only sell goods valued at or below $1,000 or who fall into the 5 percent rule as a result of the $1,000 threshold can charge GST on all of their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than being required to distinguish between goods valued below or above the threshold. Greater price transparency for consumers compared with options one and two as GST is charged at the point of sale and tariffs and cost recovery charges are removed from imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. Efficiency of compliance 0 + Some compliance cost savings compared with option one. + This option is expected to have the least compliance costs overall compared with the other options owing to the $1,000 threshold. Efficiency of administration 0 + Some administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to preventing double taxation, owing to the requirement for suppliers to ensure that GST information is included on Customs documents where goods are delivered by fast freight. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under option one. + Administrative cost savings for Customs in relation to the prevention of double taxation. Administration costs for Inland Revenue would be the same as those under options one and two. Fairness and equity 0 + Reduced compliance costs for suppliers and consumers, including reduced potential for double taxation (since the supplier would be required to provide a refund if double taxation occurs). + More suppliers are likely to be liable to register under this option, increasing the coverage of imported goods that are subject to GST compared with options one and two. Reduced potential for double taxation owing to $1,000 threshold and the proposed mechanisms for preventing double taxation.

Sustainability and neutrality 0 + Estimated GST collections are the same as under option one. However, the reduction in compliance costs for suppliers compared with option one may mean that less suppliers cease to ship to New Zealand or refuse to comply. ++ Estimated to collect $25m less in GST over the forecast period than options one and two. However, this option is considered to be the most sustainable over the longer term, as it is considered that it may result in a better compliance outcome than options one and two whilst minimising the number of suppliers that cease shipping to New Zealand (and therefore may actually result in more GST being collected). Approx. $14.9m p.a. in cost recovery charges for Customs and MPI would be forgone compared with options and two. Any resulting funding shortfall may have to be funded through a changed cost recovery structure or through replacement Crown funding. Overall assessment 0 + This option is an improvement over option one with respect to all of the considerations. ++ Sustainability and neutrality and efficiency of compliance outweigh the other considerations. This option is an improvement over option two with respect to most of the other considerations and is therefore Inland Revenue’s preferred option. Key: ++ much better than doing nothing/the status quo + better than doing nothing/the status quo 0 about the same as doing nothing/the status quo - worse than doing nothing/the status quo - - much worse than doing nothing/the status quo 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 25 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 5 : Co n clu s io n s 5.1 What option, or combination of options, is likely best to address the problem, meet the policy objectives and deliver the highest net benefits? Inland Revenue officials consider the preferred option is Option three: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $1,000. Customs officials prefer Option two: Design options reflecting submissions received on the discussion document with a low-value goods threshold of $400. The reason for Inland Revenue’s preference is that Inland Revenue has placed a higher weighting on the efficiency of compliance criterion (in particular the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers and electronic marketplaces, as well as the freight and logistics industry). It is acknowledged that the additional benefits to offshore suppliers, electronic marketplaces and the freight and logistics industry of the $1,000 threshold compared with a threshold of $400 cannot be valued with certainty, whereas the estimated impacts on the government’s financial position are better understood. There is also uncertainty in predicting possible unintended behavioural changes by consumers (as well as other importers and their agents) as a result of a $1,000 threshold. To mitigate these factors and their associated risks, specific monitoring of implementation and compliance will be established, and a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold will be conducted after three years. Customs’ preference is for a low-value goods threshold of $400 (as in options one and two), as this is estimated to collect $303 million of GST over the forecast period compared with $278 million under a $1,000 threshold (option three). The Crown would also forgo up to $8.8 million in tariff duty under option three, and Customs and MPI would forgo at least $48.9 million of departmental revenue over the forecast period if alternative funding arrangements are not put in place. A $1,000 threshold may also reduce the incentive for importers to provide accurate information, potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management. Trade, competition and consumer choice issues Some private submitters expressed concerns that consumers’ access to goods from offshore may be significantly reduced as a consequence of the proposals if they go ahead. These sentiments were echoed by Business NZ and KPMG, who while being broadly supportive of the proposals noted that there is a risk that implementation of the policy will affect consumer choice and trade. Business NZ warned against making the rules overly complicated, noting that a pragmatic and reasonable approach is needed to ensure the impacts on trade, competition and consumer choice are minimal. It was also pointed out there could be reciprocal problems for New Zealand exporters if New Zealand is perceived to be a country to avoid selling to. Private submitters expressing concerns about possible adverse impacts on consumer choice tended to disagree with the analysis of the problem or expressed some reservations about it. In particular, these submitters pointed out that many goods that are being imported by consumers cannot be purchased from New Zealand retailers – or, where they can be purchased domestically, the price difference compared with an overseas supplier tends to be significantly more than 15%. Two submitters expressed particular concern in relation to 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 26 IN CONFIDENCE clothing and shoes in less common sizes that they could not easily source from domestic retailers and stated that they have little other choice than to purchase these goods from overseas suppliers. A submission from an industry group representing three electronic marketplaces stated that the extraterritorial application of GST will create additional costs for overseas businesses which would serve as a barrier to trade. They considered this to be contrary to both New Zealand’s advocacy for free trade and the spirit of various free trade agreements. They stated that the policy risks reciprocation by other governments on New Zealand exporters, which could stifle entrepreneurship and innovation and decrease exports. As discussed below, a number of design features have been incorporated into option 3 (Customs’ preferred option) and option 4 (Inland Revenue’s preferred option) that are designed to minimise compliance costs for suppliers and electronic marketplaces, and as such are intended to minimise the risk of adverse trade and consumer impacts. Electronic marketplaces Under the rules proposed in the discussion document for electronic marketplaces, where a supply of low-value goods is made through an electronic marketplace, the operator of the electronic marketplace would be deemed to make the supply for GST purposes. The $60,000 registration threshold would therefore apply to the marketplace operator’s deemed supplies to New Zealand consumers, as well as any other taxable supplies the marketplace operator makes. Where the operator of the electronic marketplace is deemed to be the supplier, whether or not the actual supplier of the goods is above the $60,000 registration threshold is irrelevant for determining whether or not GST applies to the supply. The design and scope of the marketplace rules were commented on in many of the submissions received. A number of submissions noted that business models for marketplaces vary widely and as such, a simple extension of the existing rules for cross- border services and intangibles to marketplaces for goods may not be appropriate. Submissions noted that clarity, simplicity and flexibility would be crucial to ensuring the marketplaces rules are workable. Discussions with stakeholders also indicated that clear and simple rules would be crucial to making the marketplace rules workable. Submissions from electronic marketplaces were strongly opposed to the proposed offshore supplier registration system and in particular the proposed rules for electronic marketplaces. Submissions from electronic marketplaces raised the following objections: • The proposed electronic marketplace rules are onerous for marketplaces to implement and are more complex that the rules requiring operators of electronic marketplaces for services and intangibles to collect GST. • Complying with the rules will result in significant compliance costs for marketplaces and it is unfair for the New Zealand Government to impose these costs on marketplaces. These costs may either be passed on to their suppliers, increasing the risk of these suppliers choosing not to ship to New Zealand, or will at least be partly borne by consumers, therefore imposing additional costs on consumers over and above the amount of the tax. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 27 IN CONFIDENCE • Marketplaces may not have and may be unable to obtain sufficient information to correctly determine the amount of GST payable. • Marketplaces that do not process transactions between buyers and sellers on their platform may have difficulties in collecting the GST they are liable to remit. • Requiring marketplaces to collect GST on supplies made by third party suppliers below the $60,000 registration threshold would place these suppliers at a disadvantage, would be discriminatory, and would lead to market distortions. • Compliant marketplaces will be at risk of third party sellers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold switching to selling through small or non-compliant marketplaces or to selling on their own websites. • Consumers will seek out small or non-compliant marketplaces or suppliers to avoid the tax, giving an unfair competitive advantage to suppliers and marketplaces that are not complying with the rules and disadvantaging the marketplaces and suppliers that would comply. This may result in decreased compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protections and dangerous goods. • Electronic marketplaces that are only caught by the electronic marketplace rules because they set some of the terms and conditions under which offshore sellers make sales on the marketplace would be able to easily structure out of being deemed to be the supplier of the goods by simply ensuring they do not set any of the terms and conditions of sale. This would reduce the level of compliance with New Zealand regulations in relation to consumer protection and prohibited or dangerous goods. As noted in section 3.3, two exceptions to the deemed supplier approach (a Commissioner discretion and the rebuttable presumption model) were considered but ultimately ruled out. The proposed rules for electronic marketplaces are considered to be crucial to the success of the offshore supplier registration system. Without such rules, it is expected that thousands of suppliers that sell through marketplaces would be required to register for GST, meaning that aggregate compliance costs may be higher, compliance would likely be lower and enforcement more difficult. Narrowing the scope of the proposed rules is also unpalatable as the creation of a new boundary would be likely to create opportunities for electronic marketplaces to structure out of the rules, and may distort competition between electronic marketplaces. While still hypothetically possible, these risks are considered to be less significant under the proposed rules. Given the current market dominance of the most prominent electronic marketplaces, the extent to which having electronic marketplaces collect GST on sales by suppliers below the registration threshold would give a competitive advantage to small or non-compliant marketplaces is not entirely clear. For instance, in an online shopping environment, consumers already have strong incentives to purchase from trusted websites. It is not clear that avoiding GST of 15% on a low-value purchase (which may still be significantly cheaper than a similar item sourced domestically) would provide enough incentive for many consumers to switch to shopping on websites that may not be as well- 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 28 IN CONFIDENCE known or reputable as the larger marketplaces, and therefore which may be less readily trusted by consumers. It is also unclear whether the imposition of GST on what is likely to be only a small proportion of most suppliers’ sales would be a large enough motivator for smaller suppliers to establish their own websites or switch to selling through a marketplace that would likely reach a smaller audience. If these suppliers consider that the revenue from these sales does not justify the costs to them associated with having the marketplace operator charge GST on their sales to New Zealand, a more likely possibility seems to be that these suppliers would simply stop shipping goods to New Zealand, rather than leave the electronic marketplace altogether (at least if they are selling through a global marketplace as opposed to a New Zealand-specific website). However, the extent to which this may eventuate is also unknown, given that the marketplace operator would be fulfilling the bulk of the GST compliance obligations for the supplier (although these compliance costs may be passed on to underlying suppliers). Marketplace operators’ concerns about being provided with incorrect or inadequate information to determine the GST treatment of supplies and any associated liabilities in respect of these supplies should be addressed by the Commissioner discretion to prescribe or agree to a method for determining the GST treatment of supplies. Concerns about bad debts risk for electronic marketplaces that do not actually collect the money from the consumer should also be addressed by the suggested bad debt deduction. Low-value goods threshold Several submitters commented on the $400 threshold that was proposed in the discussion document GST on low-value imported goods: An offshore supplier registration system. Most of these submitters expressed a preference for a $1,000 threshold, which was considered to reduce compliance costs for suppliers (since it is closer to Australia’s low-value threshold of AU$1,000 than $400 is), as well as being better for consumers and for the freight and logistics industry. In comparison, only two submitters expressed a strong preference for a $400 threshold. It appears that this preference was based on concerns about a potential fiscal risk in relation to goods valued between $400 and $1,000, on which GST is (or should be) collected at present. Inland Revenue officials consider that the overall compliance costs to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers associated with a $1,000 threshold would be lower than the overall compliance costs to these businesses if a $400 threshold is chosen. Implementing a low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would also be more beneficial for New Zealand consumers compared with a $400 threshold. However, Customs has concerns about the potential impacts of a $1,000 threshold on the management of border risk. Impacts on suppliers, electronic marketplaces and re-deliverers While the vast majority of goods imported by consumers are of a very low value (consumer surveys and Customs import entry data show that the average value is less than $100), a number of e-commerce businesses will also stock goods that may be more expensive, such as certain types of clothing, jewellery, watches and electronics, which some New Zealand 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 29 IN CONFIDENCE consumers may potentially import. The existence of a low-value goods threshold of any value therefore creates additional complexity for suppliers who supply goods both above and below the threshold, as their checkout systems would need to be set up to charge GST on goods individually valued at or below that threshold and not on those valued above that threshold. Also, because the threshold is defined in New Zealand dollars, the supplier’s systems would also need to perform a currency conversion where the prices of the goods on their website are expressed in a foreign currency for the purposes of determining whether a given good is above or below the low-value goods threshold. By increasing the proposed $400 low-value goods threshold to $1,000, the number of suppliers that may sell goods both above and below the threshold would be reduced. This would decrease the number of suppliers that would need to implement systems to differentiate between high and low-value goods and have differing GST treatments for high and low-value goods (since if they do not stock any goods valued above the threshold they will not need to distinguish and can simply add GST to all of their sales to New Zealand consumers without requiring complex foreign exchange conversions at the time of sale). As Australia has a low-value threshold of AU$1,000 under their equivalent rules, there would be some suppliers that are already registered in Australia that only supply goods below Australia’s threshold. At present, these suppliers do not need to build systems to distinguish between low and high-value goods, as these suppliers can simply add GST to all of their supplies made to Australian consumers. However, some of these suppliers would sell goods both above and below $400 – therefore if New Zealand sets a $400 low-value goods threshold these suppliers would need to build additional systems to those already implemented for Australia in order to comply. This may be much less of an issue with a higher threshold that is much closer to Australia’s threshold, such as $1,000. Impacts on consumers Some submissions from consumers expressed support for removing cost recovery charges collected on consignments valued above the current de minimis. Increasing the proposed low-value goods threshold to $1,000 would see the removal of cost recovery charges and tariffs from most goods imported by consumers. This would mean that consumers importing goods between $400 and $1,000 would actually pay less overall for these goods than they do at present. This would also ensure the overwhelming majority of consumers are no longer surprised or inconvenienced by having to pay additional GST, tariffs and cost recovery charges. Further, Customs would continue to collect cost recovery charges on consignments of goods that have had GST is collected at the point of sale by the supplier where the total consignment is valued above the threshold. A $400 threshold may mean there would be more instances of consumers having to pay these cost recovery charges where they might have expected that they would not have to (as they had already paid GST). Having offshore suppliers collect GST on a broader range of goods (in terms of value) would also provide greater price transparency for consumers, as offshore websites may be more likely to display a GST-inclusive price for all of their goods at the time of purchase. This would provide a fairer price comparison with New Zealand retailers who generally display GST-inclusive prices. A $1,000 threshold is also expected to be less distortionary than a $400 threshold. Anecdotally, many consumers at present limit their online purchases to a maximum of $400 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 30 IN CONFIDENCE to avoid having their goods stopped at the border. A $1,000 threshold may mean that less consumers would limit their spending to avoid having goods stopped at the border or to avoid the collection of duties and cost recovery charges. On the other hand, a $1,000 threshold may increase consumers’ incentives to seek out and purchase from unregistered suppliers or to have items purchased and sent to New Zealand by friends and family overseas. Double taxation While the inclusion of the 5 percent rule in option two would be expected to help to reduce compliance costs for a number of suppliers associated with differentiating between low- value and high-value goods, one issue with combining this design option with a threshold of $400 is that it would be likely to further increase the incidence of double taxation. Increasing the proposed threshold to $1,000 however would greatly reduce the potential for double taxation to occur as much fewer consignments valued over $1,000 are imported by consumers, compared with the number of consignments valued over $400. Based on 2017/18 transactional banking data showing goods purchases by New Zealand consumers from offshore suppliers, there were 230,398 transactions between $400 and $1,000 and only 56,671 transactions between $1,000 and $2,000. Furthermore, the vast majority of consignments valued above $1,000 would be imported by GST-registered businesses and would not be subject to the proposed rules. Border and biosecurity risks Importers are incentivised by Customs’ penalty regime to ensure that accurate imported entry information is provided in relation to imported consignments on which revenue is collectable. The penalties for providing inaccurate information for consignments on which no revenue is assessable are however smaller, and therefore provide less incentive for importers to ensure the accuracy of this information; consequently, the quality of information provided in relation to these consignments tends to be poorer. Customs and MPI consider that setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may therefore reduce the incentive for importers to enter accurate information as there will be no requirement to pay revenue on consignments under $1,000. As well as potentially impacting on the effectiveness of border and biosecurity risk management, poor quality information may also impact on the efficiency of border processes. Customs considers that non-compliance in the valuation of goods to evade duty will continue to exist under a $1,000 threshold. This may also increase costs to both agencies and slow down the clearance of goods at the border. Customs has a range of sanctions to encourage the provision of accurate information and will continue to work with customs brokers, fast freight carriers and New Zealand Post, but it will remain a challenge for both agencies to manage risks. Impacts on goods transporters and customs brokers Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 may be beneficial for fast freight carriers, customs brokers and New Zealand Post, with fewer goods stopped at the border for revenue collection. This would reduce the costs that New Zealand Post, fast freight carriers and 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 31 IN CONFIDENCE customs brokers currently incur in transporting consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. New Zealand Post noted in their submission that they currently incur a significant compliance cost burden in facilitating the collection of GST (and other charges) and holding goods in storage on behalf of Customs. New Zealand Post considered that having a $1,000 threshold would therefore reduce their compliance costs. It is also noted that the effects of inflation and the expected continuation of the rapid growth in import volumes experienced over the last few years (and in particular the growth in the volume of low-value goods imported by post) will further exacerbate the existing pressures on border processing of low-value imported goods over time, which may mean that maintaining a low-value goods threshold of $400 may not be cost-effective in the medium term (at least not for New Zealand Post). GST revenue A risk with having a $1,000 threshold is that it may put at risk the GST currently collected by the Crown on imported goods valued between $400 and $1,000. In 2017/18 approximately $4.26 million of GST was collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers valued under $400, and $22.40 million was collected on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000. 14 While a $1,000 threshold does put more currently collected GST at risk, Inland Revenue considers that most of this currently collected GST would continue to be collected under option three. A $1,000 threshold may even have some benefits for GST revenue collection including: • increasing the number of suppliers with a liability to register by increasing offshore suppliers’ level of taxable supplies (as supplies of goods valued between $400 and $1,000 would also be taxable supplies); • reducing the risk of GST not being collected on goods between $400 and $1,000 owing to undervaluation as, even if the supplier undervalued the goods, when the goods are supplied through a marketplace the marketplace will still collect the correct amount of GST; and • reducing the reliance on New Zealand Post to identify when goods sent by post are above the de minimis. Customs’ and MPI’s cost recovery charges Setting the low-value goods threshold at $400 would result in a reduction in Customs’ and MPI’s cost-recovered funding of $2.92 million per year based on the amount collected in 14 We have assumed that 30% of consignments between the de minimis and $400 and 44% of imported consignments between $400 and $1,000 are imported by GST-registered businesses. These estimates of the business share of imported goods are derived from Australian data, as we do not have any New Zealand data on this. It is possible that the business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 is higher in New Zealand owing to New Zealand’s lower de minimis (likely resulting in fewer consumers importing consignments above $400). If New Zealand has a higher business share of consignments between $400 and $1,000 then the net amount of GST collected by Customs on consignments imported by consumers would be lower. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 32 IN CONFIDENCE 2017/18. Setting the low-value goods threshold at $1,000 would result in Customs and MPI forgoing more cost-recovered funding. In 2017/18 $17.795 million (GST exclusive) was collected through Customs’ Import Entry Transaction Fee ($10.736 million) and MPI’s Biosecurity System Entry Levy ($7.059 million) on consignments below $1,000. A low-value goods threshold of $1,000 would therefore require a greater amount of Crown funding to replace the additional cost- recovered funding forgone. Customs’ and MPI’s costs of processing goods are also expected to increase due to expected volume growth and ongoing resource impacts. Therefore, regardless of what threshold is chosen, or even if no action is taken, Crown funding for Customs and MPI is likely to need to be increased over time in response to increasing import volumes. Tariff revenue Changing from the current de minimis of $60 duty owing to either a $400 or $1,000 low- value goods threshold will result in the loss of tariff revenue collected between the current de minimis and the low-value goods threshold. In 2017/18 $0.58 million was collected in tariffs on consignments between the current de minimis and $400 and $3.23 million was collected in tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. These tariffs are mainly collected on clothing and footwear manufactured in certain countries. MFAT does not consider that the loss of $0.58 million in tariffs from having a $400 threshold or of $3.23 million from there being a $1,000 threshold would significantly diminish the value of New Zealand’s remaining tariffs as negotiating coin in current and future Free Trade Agreements. MBIE, the agency responsible for tariff policy, also does not consider the revenue collected from these tariffs to be significant and supports the removal of tariffs on consignments valued at or below $1,000. If the low-value goods threshold is set at $1,000, the loss of tariff revenue on consignments valued between $400 and $1,000 may potentially be seen as unfair to New Zealand retailers. A retailer that imports a consignment valued above $1,000 containing goods subject to tariffs will need to pay these tariffs to Customs. The tariffs paid by these businesses would ultimately be passed on to their customers. In contrast, if a consumer buys one of those goods directly from an offshore supplier they will not have to pay any tariffs if the good is shipped in a consignment valued at or below $1,000. Compared with setting the low-value goods threshold at $400, setting it at $1,000 does therefore further undermine the principle that taxpayers in similar situations carrying out similar transactions should be subject to similar levels of taxation, but only in relation to a small subset of transactions. This is not considered to be likely to be significant in its impact as New Zealand has few remaining tariffs (mainly on clothing and footwear) and our free trade agreements have eliminated these tariffs for many countries including China, Australia and the 10 ASEAN countries. If no action is taken, the amount collected from tariffs is likely to continue to reduce over time as a result of current and future free trade agreements. On balance Inland Revenue considers that this concern is outweighed by the efficiency benefits of setting the threshold at $1,000 and relinquishing tariff duty on imported consignments valued at or below $1,000. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 33 IN CONFIDENCE New Zealand businesses importing low-value goods would also benefit from the removal of tariffs (and cost recovery charges) on consignments valued at or below $1,000. Net revenue impact Table 1 below shows the estimated GST revenue net of forgone cost recovery charges over the forecast period (based on actual cost recovery collections on consignments under $400 in 2017/18) under options one and two, based on the 1 October 2019 start date that was originally proposed. The figures in Table 1 have not been revised to take into account the change in the proposed application date and contingency funding for Vote Customs and Vote Biosecurity in Budget 2019 because at the time of revising this impact assessment, options one and two were no longer relevant, as Cabinet had already agreed to implement option three (CAB-19-MIN-0466.01 refers). For this reason, a revised estimate of the fiscal impact of options one and two was not produced. Table 2 shows the estimated GST revenue over the forecast period under option three net of contingency funding in Budget 2019 for Vote Customs and Vote Biosecurity and assuming a 1 December 2019 application date. Table 1: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $400 threshold 2019/20 (1 October start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 73.000 109.000 121.000 303.000 Cost recovery charges (2.190) (2.920) (2.920) (8.030) GST net of cost recovery charges 70.810 106.080 118.080 294.970 Table 2: Net revenue over the forecast period of 2019/20 to 2021/22 (in $m) $m – increase/(decrease) $1,000 threshold 2019/20 (1 December start) 2020/21 2021/22 & out years Total GST 52.000 100.000 112.000 264.000 Expenditure (13.879) (25.562) (25.596) (65.037) Net fiscal impact 38.121 74.438 86.404 198.963 The tables above do not account for any tariff revenue forgone under options one, two and three. This is because tariff revenue is decreasing over time owing to the phased implementation of New Zealand’s current and future free trade agreements, resulting in an annual reduction in the amount of goods that are subject to tariffs. In the 2017/18 year the amount collected in tariffs on consignments under $400 was $0.58 million and the amount collected under $1,000 was $3.23 million. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 34 IN CONFIDENCE Proposed exclusion for business-to-business supplies Under the proposed rules, only supplies of low-value imported goods to New Zealand consumers would be subject to GST. Supplies of low-value imported goods to GST- registered businesses would not be subject to GST. The rationale for excluding business- to-business supplies from the rules is to prevent a revenue risk arising from a resident business claiming a GST deduction for GST charged to them by an offshore supplier, but the offshore supplier not returning this GST to Inland Revenue. Three submissions proposed allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods. Submitters noted that identifying a customer as a GST-registered business can be difficult for suppliers to do, and that compliance costs arise for both the offshore supplier and the New Zealand business when GST is incorrectly charged. Furthermore, some submitters noted that the revenue risk from allowing suppliers to charge GST on business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods may be relatively low. CA ANZ however was supportive of the proposed exclusion of business-to-business supplies. They noted that the exclusion of business-to-business supplies would mean some suppliers are outside the regime entirely because they only supply to businesses, which they agreed is desirable. They also considered that the exclusion would provide GST-registered recipients with an incentive to notify the supplier of their GST-registered status, which they considered would likely be easier than obtaining a valid tax invoice from the supplier. As noted in section 3.3, allowing offshore suppliers to charge GST on high-value business- to-business supplies was ruled out due to the fiscal risks involved. However, officials consider that the proposed design options under options two and three (of allowing offshore suppliers to issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies of low-value imported goods where the value of such a supply does not exceed $1,000, and allowing suppliers to agree with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue on an alternative method for determining whether a supply is to a GST-registered persons) should help to reduce compliance costs for suppliers in distinguishing between supplies to consumers and to GST- registered businesses. Allowing suppliers to charge GST and issue tax invoices in respect of business-to-business supplies valued at or below $1,000 may mean that suppliers would be rarely required to distinguish in practice. Compliance and enforcement A number of submitters were concerned whether the proposed rules could be effectively enforced. The submission from the electronic marketplace industry group suggested that the proposed system would result in only 25 percent of the currently forgone GST being collected, based on the Australian Treasury’s forecasted collection rate for the first year of the Australian legislation. Several submitters stated that where suppliers refuse to comply, it will be difficult and costly for Inland Revenue to enforce compliance from these suppliers. Concern was also raised in some submissions that offshore suppliers would avoid collecting GST by splitting their business into multiple entities in order to get below the $60,000 registration threshold. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 35 IN CONFIDENCE Based on the available evidence, officials consider that a relatively small number of suppliers and electronic marketplaces are likely to account for the majority of low-value goods imported by consumers. Retail banking data supplied by Datamine shows that 10 entities account for approximately 25 percent of the amount that consumers spent in 2017/18 on goods valued below $400 from offshore suppliers. Recent research by the International Post Corporation suggests that the five biggest electronic marketplaces account for around 50 percent of goods imported into New Zealand. On this basis, officials consider it is not unreasonable to assume that 75 percent of the GST that would be returned if all liable entities registered and complied will actually be collected (which is the assumption that was used in coming up with the revenue estimates). Application date A number of submissions on the Government discussion document commented on the application date of 1 October 2019 proposed in the document. Retail NZ and Booksellers NZ both expressed support for the earliest possible implementation date. In an earlier version of this Impact Statement published online when the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced, officials considered a 1 October 2019 implementation date to be feasible. However, it was noted that any delays to the introduction or passing of legislation, or major changes to the legislation between introduction and the Royal assent would necessitate reconsideration of the implementation date. Submissions on the Bill expressed concern about the proposed application date of 1 October 2019, noting that this leaves little time between the likely enactment date of the Bill and the start of the new rules. Submitters considered that offshore suppliers cannot be expected to invest in making information technology systems changes until the law is enacted, as the proposed rules are not finalised and may yet be subject to change. They have also noted that there may not be enough time after the rules are finalised for offshore suppliers to register for New Zealand GST and make the systems changes necessary to collect GST on low-value goods supplied to New Zealand consumers by 1 October 2019. Submissions from electronic marketplaces noted the technical challenges for large electronic marketplaces that service a global customer base, which mean the required systems changes will need to be carefully planned and tested to ensure they do not create errors that interfere with other parts of their systems. A joint submission from Alibaba and eBay noted the risk that electronic marketplaces and suppliers (that do intend to comply with the proposed legislation) may be left with little choice other than to temporarily cease shipping goods to New Zealand from 1 October until the required systems changes are ready. Several submitters (including Alibaba and eBay) specifically suggested 1 April 2020 as a more realistic application date. Amazon recommended an extension of 6-12 months to the proposed 1 October 2019 application date, which suggests a preferred implementation date of 1 April 2020 at the earliest. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 36 IN CONFIDENCE On the basis of the submissions received,and comments relayed to officials, it appears that an application date of 1 April 2020 should allow enough time for the affected businesses to make the required systems changes. However, this reduced risk of suppliers being non- compliant or ceasing to ship goods to New Zealand is estimated to come at a significant fiscal cost ($32 million overall in the 2019/20 fiscal year). It is unclear whether the proposed extension to 1 December 2019 will provide adequate time for suppliers and marketplaces to comply. However, it should at least reduce the risks of having lower than expected compliance at the outset of the rules and of suppliers ceasing to ship goods to New Zealand, compared with an application date of 1 October 2019. It also has a much lower fiscal cost than a delay to 1 April ($31.856 million in the 2019/20 fiscal year). 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach 15 Monetised costs and benefits in this table have not been discounted, since for revenue measures the undiscounted figures (as opposed to net present value figures) make more intuitive sense and are the figures that are included in Budget estimates. Affected parties Comment: Impact Evidence certainty Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties The costs to offshore suppliers would include registering for GST (one-off), altering business systems to account for GST on goods sold to New Zealand consumers (one-off), and returns filing and paying the GST collected to Inland Revenue (ongoing). Potentially high upfront systems and medium ongoing compliance costs for offshore businesses above the $60,000 registration threshold. Low Regulators The implementation costs to Inland Revenue are estimated to be up to $460,000, with ongoing administration costs estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. This includes the costs to change the current registration form for suppliers of cross-border services to accommodate offshore suppliers of low-value goods and other minor systems changes. It also allows for an increase in the volume of work for staff currently processing registrations. Up to $0.7m over the forecast period (not discounted) 15 .

Other impacts: GST would be collected on goods from offshore suppliers that are below the $60,000 registration threshold where the sale is made through a GST-registered electronic marketplace. From a revenue standpoint, this may be seen as an advantage, as it is expected that a significant amount of revenue would be collected on sales by offshore suppliers below the registration threshold though electronic marketplaces. Given the rationale of having a registration threshold is to balance compliance and administration costs against the revenue that would be generated if the supplier registered for GST, collecting GST on these supplies may be justified on the basis that the rationale behind the registration threshold is not as relevant, given that the marketplace operator would bear the bulk of the compliance costs. However, this may give rise to concerns about competitive disadvantages for marketplace operators and smaller offshore businesses selling through these marketplaces. Potential risks and uncertainties: If the compliance costs are disproportionately high or are perceived by the relevant collection entities to be too high, there is a risk that some non- resident suppliers or operators of electronic marketplaces may not comply with the rules or may not continue to offer shipping of goods to New Zealand. This risk is thought to be more significant for smaller suppliers that make supplies to New Zealand consumers near or above the $60,000 registration threshold. 16 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? The proposed approach is not incompatible with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. 16 It is assumed that non-resident suppliers with annual sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000 would predominantly be large (or at least medium) entities, given that the $60,000 registration threshold applies to their supplies to New Zealand consumers rather than their worldwide sales, and that in most cases their sales to New Zealanders would be a small proportion of their total worldwide sales. However, it is likely that there would be some smaller suppliers that would nevertheless have sales to New Zealand consumers in excess of $60,000. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 40 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6 : Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? The proposal will require amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments are currently being drafted and will be included in an upcoming tax bill. The proposal will also require amendments to some Customs regulations. These regulations will be updated by Order in Council. Both Inland Revenue and Customs will be responsible for the ongoing operation and enforcement of the new arrangements. Inland Revenue and Customs have not identified any concerns with their ability to implement the proposals in a manner consistent with the Government’s ‘Expectations for regulatory stewardship by government agencies’. Ministers’ preference is that the proposed changes come into effect on 1 December 2019. Inland Revenue and Customs are confident that the proposals can be implemented within this proposed timeline. Inland Revenue has estimated that the one-off costs to implement these proposals will be up to $460,000. Inland Revenue’s ongoing administration costs are estimated to be approximately $120,000 in the first year and $70,000 per annum thereafter. Inland Revenue will self-fund the costs associated with the initiative. Customs expects the costs of systems changes for implementation at 1 December 2019 will be minimal in the short term. These costs will be met within existing baselines. Marketplaces and private sector tax advisors and the fast freight industry, customs brokers and New Zealand Post have suggested 1 April 2020 as a “more reasonable” application date. However, many of the overseas suppliers and marketplaces would have had 17 months of experience complying with Australia’s substantially similar rules and, as such, the systems changes themselves may not be that extensive – although it appears there will be substantial planning and testing of changes required, in addition to potential changes to pricing and contracts or arrangements with third parties. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The primary issue concerning implementation that has been raised through consultation is whether the 1 October 2019 application date proposed in the Bill gives offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers enough time to make the necessary systems changes in order to comply, as well as for the fast freight industry, customs brokers and New Zealand Post to make the required systems changes in relation to border clearance and information required to be provided to Customs. To help mitigate this risk, Ministers propose extending the application date to 1 December 2019. Another implementation risk is that offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re-deliverers may not be aware of the new rules. To address this risk, Inland Revenue will need to identify and communicate the legislative change to offshore suppliers, marketplaces and re- deliverers who might be required to register in New Zealand. A targeted marketing campaign would be needed to reach all the affected offshore suppliers and aid with compliance. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 Impact Statement T emplate | 41 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lu a tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue will monitor the outcomes pursuant to the Generic Tax Policy Process ("GTTP") to confirm that they match the policy objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. Customs and MPI will monitor the impact on the management of border and biosecurity risks. If the preferred option is implemented and compliance with the new regime is lower than expected after 12 months of its implementation, Inland Revenue will explore options for increasing compliance. This could include joint compliance initiatives with other jurisdictions that have similar rules, including possible data matching programmes with other jurisdictions and Customs. Officials will monitor the extent to which offshore businesses no longer ship goods to New Zealand by keeping a close watch over articles in the media. Talking with private sector advisors and re-deliverers may also provide some indication of the extent to which this occurs. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the GTPP is the implementation and review stage, which involves post- implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues. Officials from Inland Revenue and Customs will undertake a post-implementation review of the level of the threshold three years after the new rules are implemented. Officials will also continue to monitor the future viability of other collection models to see if the practical issues with these models can be overcome. Any necessary changes identified as a result of the review would be recommended for addition to the Government's tax policy work programme. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:11:32 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0153 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

This report is intended to assist Ministers’ consideration of the high-level objectives and process for the next tax policy work programme (TPWP). In particular officials would like to gauge Ministers’ views on: (a) The proposed overarching objectives of the next TPWP; (b) The approximate resource weighting for the TPWP; (c) The fiscal approach Ministers would like to take for the next work programme; and (d) The process and timing for consultation and communication. 2. We are currently undertaking a prioritisation exercise for the individual items that could form part of the work programme. We will report to you further on this. Background 3. At a meeting with you on 30 April 2019, we discussed our intention to begin reviewing potential items for inclusion in a refreshed TPWP for 2019-20. This year, we are taking a top-down approach to refreshing the TPWP. We have considered the potential objectives of the refreshed TPWP, and the possible items of work which would contribute to or support these objectives. 4. In its response to the Tax Working group (TWG) recommendations, the Government indicated that a number of TWG recommendations would be considered as high priority items on the refreshed TPWP, while others would be considered for inclusion more generally. Further, the Government noted that several recommendations were items of work which were already underway, including work involving other agencies. 5. Therefore, possible items for inclusion in the next TPWP will be drawn primarily from recommendations of the TWG, Government priorities, and a list of policy items that officials are aware of – this includes both existing items on the work programme and emerging issues. 6. An A3 is attached to this report which provides a high-level picture of what the refreshed TPWP could look like. Objectives of the refreshed TPWP 7. As the TWG found, New Zealand’s tax system is generally sound and working well. The TWG made a number of recommendations aimed at improving the fairness, balance and structure of the system. Many of these recommendations are being considered for the refreshed TPWP. To support the ongoing strength of the tax system, we consider that the refreshed TPWP needs to contain a mix of items which In Confidence IR2019/255; T2019/1375: 2019-20 Refresh of the tax policy work programme Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE ensure that the system not only functions well now but is responsive to likely future challenges. 8. In light of this, we have organised the general structure for the refreshed work programme into the following overarching objectives, which items on the TPWP could contribute to or support. These objectives are based primarily on what we understand the Government’s objectives to be, including from our conversations with Ministers. • Improving the integrity and fairness of the tax system • Ensuring the tax system contributes to economic performance • Ensuring the tax system functions well now, and is responsive to likely future challenges and opportunities • Ensuring the tax system minimises compliance and administration costs • Ensuring the tax system effectively supports and contributes to wider government priorities 9. The third objective is aimed at ensuring our tax system continues to function well for the 21 st century and beyond. While we have made this a separate objective, it cuts across all objectives, and will be a feature in all projects. Trade-off s will need to be considered within projects, and there is a need to ensure that policy solutions are fit for purpose now and for the future. For example, exploring options to make the gap between the company tax rate and top personal rate more sustainable would be an example of improving the integrity and fairness of the tax system, while at the same time ensuring that the tax system functions well now and is responsive to likely future challenges. Components of the refreshed TPWP Items that will be included TWG recommendations (high priority items) and Government priorities 10. A significant component of the next TPWP will be items that the Government has indicated, in its response to the TWG report, should be progressed as high priority items in the TPWP. These recommendations relate to: • Land and housing – this includes options for taxing vacant land by land-bankers, reviewing the current tax rules for land speculators and requiring IRD numbers when transferring a main home. • Infrastructure – this includes understanding the Government’s wider agenda on infrastructure and how the tax system could facilitate or contribute to this agenda. • Seismic strengthening – this includes considering whether the current tax settings are appropriate in relation to seismic strengthening. Progressing this will involve making decisions, for example, about the relative treatment of those who have already progressed seismic strengthening (and not received tax benefits) and those who have not. • Improving the integrity of the tax system – this includes a potential range of measures to ensure everyone pays their fair share. We will report to you further on which specific measures we recommend prioritising for this work. In Confidence IR2019/255; T2019/1375: 2019-20 Refresh of the tax policy work programme Page 3 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 11. The refreshed TPWP will also include items which contribute to or support Government priorities, coalition and confidence and supply agreement items. Existing work programme items 12. A mix of items which are on the current work programme will be rolled over to the refreshed TPWP. Some items will be included because they are still ongoing or are non-discretionary. Others are items which are on hold – that is, they were deprioritised for higher priority projects – but we now consider that they should be reprioritised under a refreshed work programme. Examples include: • International tax – this includes the work on a potential digital services tax and the DTA programme. (Ongoing) • Business transformation (BT) – we will continue to support Inland Revenue’s BT programme and also consider opportunities to further leverage off the benefits provided by BT – for example opportunities under BT for the self-employed. (Ongoing) • Research and development tax credit. (Ongoing) • GST discussion document – GST issues arise from time to time that require a policy response. It is important for the health of the GST system to address these issues. This item has been on hold since mid-2018. We expect the discussion document to be largely revenue neutral. (May be reprioritised) Emerging issues 13. Since the last TPWP refresh, new issues or issues that were not previously on the work programme have emerged. Some of these emerging issues are non- discretionary and will need to be added to the work programme. The new issues include: • Considering the tax consequences arising from the establishment of the Housing and Urban Development Authority (HUDA) • Supporting the Government’s response to the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) Items that will be considered for inclusion 14. The rest of the work programme will be drawn from the remaining TWG report recommendations and the list of discretionary items we are aware of (both on the current work programme and emerging issues). We are currently undertaking a prioritisation exercise of all these items and will report to you further on the outcome of this work. 15. Recommendations of the TWG that the Government has already agreed will not be progressed are not being assessed. Resourcing the work programme 16. The high priority items that will be included in the next work programme are likely to take up a significant amount of available tax policy resource. This means there are constraints on how many additional measures beyond these items that can be included, at least in the short-term. We will undertake further work on this and report back to you. 17. In addition to the high priority items, we consider it is important to commit resources to general maintenance and remedial policy items. These are necessary to ensure a well-functioning tax system. We also consider it important to carve out In Confidence IR2019/255; T2019/1375: 2019-20 Refresh of the tax policy work programme Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE some resource to focus on long-term stewardship projects. Both of these focus areas will likely require approximately 20 per cent each of total resources. 18. Our initial assessment is that we will be at capacity when taking into account: • The high priority items from the TWG; • General maintenance and remedial items; • The stewardship function; and • Any rollover items from the current work programme. 19. However, we will have the options to manage this capacity by flexing the timing of delivery of various items. Once we have direction from you on your highest priorities, we will advise you on realistic timing and, depending on how acceptable our proposed timing is, what trade-offs may be required to achieve your objectives. Fiscal implications 20. Some of the items proposed for inclusion, including some of the high priority items such as seismic strengthening and infrastructure support have with fiscal costs. We would like to discuss with you the approach to the potential fiscal implications of the work programme. 21. The following table provides you with an indication of items being considered for the refreshed TPWP that may have significant fiscal impacts: Items which could potentially raise revenue Measures is likely to significantly reduce revenue International tax issues such as the digital economy Support for nationally significant infrastructure Further integrity measures to ensure everyone pays their fair share, including: - Closely-held company issues - Options to make the gap between the company and top personal tax rate more sustainable. Research and development tax credit (already included in forecasts) Purchase price allocation Seismic strengthening Improvements to the land rules Small business compliance cost reductions Feasibility and black-hole expenditure ($5m- $50m per annum depending on design and as cost increases over time) Loss carry forwards when ownership changes (fiscal cost depends on design, costing for the TWG proposal was approximately $50 million per annum) Building depreciation (up to $300m per annum) Next steps Timelines 22. Officials would like to discuss the proposed work programme objectives with you at the Joint Ministers meeting of 13 May. If Ministers are comfortable with the direction of the work programme, we will undertake a prioritisation exercise, which will involve assessing all the possible items for inclusion on the refreshed TPWP against our resourcing capacity. We will bring the outcome of this exercise back to In Confidence IR2019/255; T2019/1375: 2019-20 Refresh of the tax policy work programme Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE you in the form of a detailed draft work programme, for your consideration at the joint meeting on 11 June. This will take into account the consultation referred to below. Consultation 23. While we have not done any formal consultation, discussions on items for possible inclusion on the work programme were heavily canvassed with stakeholders during the TWG process. We understand issues that are particularly important to business stakeholders (specifically, the Corporate Taxpayers Group (CTG) and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ)) include: • Feasibility and blackhole expenditure; • Cross-border employment 1 ; • Building depreciation; • Loss continuity; • Small business compliance costs; • Disputes. 24. Given the ongoing resource constraints on the work programme, it will be important to ensure that stakeholder expectations are managed appropriately. 25. We would like to discuss with you our proposed approach for consulting with stakeholders on the proposed refresh of the TPWP. In particular, we would like Ministers’ approval to undertake limited consultation with key stakeholders (including CA ANZ, CTG, and a representative group of civil society) on the proposed direction of the next TPWP, before our next meeting with you on 11 June. Communications 26. Once Ministers agree to a refreshed TPWP, we will prepare a Cabinet paper for Cabinet’s noting. This will likely be in July 2019. Following Cabinet consideration, we will discuss with you how you would like to publicly announce the refreshed work programme. Revenue Strategy 27. The Government will also be updating its revenue strategy as part of the Fiscal Strategy section of the Minister of Finance’s Budget document. The revenue strategy has been revised to reflect the Government’s response to the TWG and is attached to this report as an appendix. 1 This item is about ensuring that definitions of tax residency are not an undue impediment to the temporary movement of employees overseas, or temporary movement of offshore employees to work in New Zealand.

In Confidence IR2019/277; T2019/1464: Tax policy work programme refresh – options on possible packages Page 1 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE 17 May 2019 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Tax policy work programme refresh – options on possible packages Purpose and background 1. At the joint-Ministers’ meeting on 13 May 2019, you indicated that you were interested in advancing certain items on the refreshed tax policy work programme (TPWP) particularly around land, businesses and small businesses. 2. Given the time it takes to implement policy changes, we would like to check in with you on what your expectations are for implementing changes in these areas by 2020. This report therefore outlines the possible deliverables in the areas of land, businesses and small businesses over the next 12-months, and provides examples of the items that could be considered under each area. We are interested in your views on our proposed approach, including the proposed deliverables and timing under each of the packages. Potential packages of work to be progressed within the next 12 months 3. In our last discussion, we outlined some overarching objectives for the refreshed TPWP and the possible items which could be included that would contribute to or support these objectives. While you were broadly comfortable with this general approach, it was accepted that there is fluidity between the objectives and certain items of work may cross-over several objectives. Further, while the TPWP is set for 18-months, you were interested in progressing certain items of work (particularly the high priority items indicated in your Tax Working Group (TWG) response) on a faster track. 4. This has led us to consider another way of organising the work programme, which is to consider items as part of focused packages of work. We consider that the overarching objectives of the refreshed TPWP would remain, however, the packages proposed recognise that several items of work would contribute to or support multiple objectives. 5. Based on our discussion with you, we have packaged items up into the following key areas: Land 6. You have indicated that you are interested in progressing a package of work on land. We consider that a focused programme of work is possible in the short-term which would cover recommendations by the TWG around: o Reviewing the current rules relating to speculators, land banking and vacant land (noting this could include work already underway by the Productivity Commission); and o Any issues around enforcement of the current rules including whether we can do anything more operationally. 7. We do not think we would be able to conduct a wider review of the land rules in the next 12 months, especially if Ministers are interested in enacting legislation. Any consultation document could, however, fla g any potential issues that may warrant In Confidence IR2019/277; T2019/1464: Tax policy work programme refresh – options on possible packages Page 2 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE further consideration in the longer term. If Ministers are comfortable with this approach, we propose the following timeline: S eparate packages for businesses and small businesses 8. You were also interested in a potential package for businesses and small businesses. These packages would include a mix of integrity measures as well as items which have fiscal costs. In the first instance, we consider that further scoping work is required to determine what is included in these packages. This will involve talking to stakeholders to ensure the right mix of items are included – for example, any business-friendly initiatives we are considering should not only be ones that the business community see value in us progressing but should also contribute to enhancing economic performance. 9. 10. 11. A summary of our proposed approach is as follows: Other packages of work to be progressed over the 18-month TPWP period 12. We consider that the remainder of the work programme (and our resources) would be committed to the following packages of work: • Infrastructure • Information collection s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019/277; T2019/1464: Tax policy work programme refresh – options on possible packages Page 3 of 4 IN CONFIDENCE • Environment • Government response to WEAG recommendations • Tax exemptions • Charities • General maintenance and remedial matters • Business Transformation 13. The attached table provides Ministers with further details of the possible packages of work and the approximate timing of deliverables. We note that the list of possible items for inclusion under each package is not comprehensive, but rather is intended to provide Ministers with a general sense of what could be included. Next steps 14. We are currently undertaking a prioritisation exercise of all the items for potential inclusion in the refreshed TPWP. We will provide you with a detailed draft work programme, taking into account any comments you may have on this report, in time for a discussion at the joint ministers’ meeting on 11 June. 15. Following Ministers’ approval of the refreshed work programme, we will prepare a Cabinet paper for Cabinet’s noting in July. Ministers can announce the refreshed work programme following Cabinet consideration. We will discuss with you closer to the time options for announcing the TPWP.

We previously reported to you on our proposed approach to refresh the T ax Policy Work Programme (TPWP). This included organising the next TPWP into key packages of work around which items for consideration could be arranged (IR2019/255; T2019/1375, IR2019/277; T2019/1464 refers). We understand that Ministers are comfortable with this approach. This report, which includes the details of the proposed refreshed TPWP, has been prepared on this basis. 2. This report provides you with a detailed draft of the items, and key areas of focus, that could sit within packages of work proposed for inclusion on the refreshed TPWP \[attachment 3\]. This report also provides a high-level picture of the TPWP, including how the TPWP sits alongside wider Government strategies and objectives \[attachments 2 and 1 respectively\]. 3. We would like to discuss this report with you at the next joint meeting on 11 June 2019 and get your views on: • whether you are comfortable with the detailed draft of the next TPWP; • whether you would like us to develop land and business packages . We previously canvassed these packages in our last report to you (IR2019/277; T2019/1464 refers ); • whether there is anything further you would like to include or remove from the proposed TPWP; • the proposed key products and deliverables under each package of work; • whether you are comfortable with us providing key stakeholders with further information on the detailed draft of the refreshed TPWP, in particular details on key deliverables and timing; • how you would like to announce the refresh of the TPWP and the overall presentation of the TPWP documents that we propose to publish alongside your announcement; and • whether you are comfortable with the proposed timetable for next steps. 4. Subject to your agreement, we will prepare a Cabinet paper of the final refreshed TPWP for noting at the Economic Development Cabinet Committee (DEV) meeting on 24 July 2019 (with Cabinet consideration the following week). We propose that the TPWP be published and announced following Cabinet consideration. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/306; T2019/1661: Final details of the refreshed Tax Policy Work Programme for 2019-20 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: (a) Discuss this report at the joint-Ministers’ meeting on 11 June 2019, and indicate your preferences on final details of the refreshed TPWP for 2019-20 in the following table: Recommendation Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue (1) Agree to the final details of the proposed refreshed TPWP for 2019-20 as outlined in this report and the associated attachments.

Since our last discussion with you on 13 May 2019, we have undertaken an exercise to prioritise the items of work for possible inclusion in the TPWP. When considering whether to include an item of work on the next TPWP, we weighed up the following factors: • What we already know are priority items or areas you wish to progress on the refreshed TPWP, in particular: o the Tax Working Group (TWG) recommendations that the Government has indicated are high priority items for consideration; and o Ministers’ desire to advance a focused package of work around land and businesses (including small businesses). • Whether the item supports or contributes to wider Government objectives (including both social and economic objectives); • The fiscal cost of certain items of work and whether these items could be packaged together with other items of work (for example, integrity measures) to deliver a coherent package; • Feedback from stakeholders to date; • The need to ensure the TPWP contains a mix of items that are both responsive to the issues of today but also to any longer-term opportunities or challenges; • The resourcing required to deliver the packages of work; and • Whether we could phase the delivery of certain items of work or packages. Details of the refreshed TPWP 6. As a result of this prioritisation exercise, we have prepared three documents (attached to this report) which present an overall picture of the proposed TPWP for 2019-20. 7. 8. Attachment 3 – Details of the refreshed TPWP 9. This attachment provides detailed descriptions of the packages which would be progressed on the next TPWP, including the key deliverables and timings for each proposed package of work. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/306; T2019/1661: Final details of the refreshed Tax Policy Work Programme for 2019-20 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE 10. Unlike previous TPWPs, we have deliberately chosen not to provide a “shopping list of items” under each package. Instead, the focus is on outlining why we are progressing with certain areas of work ( having taken into account the factors outlined above). 11. This approach would a llow us, where appropriate, to consult / engage with stakeholders during the policy development process to refine the specific items or initiatives that could be considered under each package. Where we have been able to, we have outlined examples of the types of items that could be included under certain packages of work. 12. Also attached to this report is a table illustrating how the TWG recommendations are reflected on the refreshed TPWP \[see attachment 4\]. Packages for land and business 13. In our last report to you, we outlined a possible approach for progressing packages for land and businesses. The approach for both packages is summarised on the first page of attachment 3. We are seeking confirmation from you to begin developing these packages. 14. Releasing details of the TPWP 15. We would like to discuss attachments one, two and three with you. Taken together, they represent our proposal of what should be on the Government’s refreshed TPWP. Subject to your views, we consider that these attachments could be released when Ministers announce the refresh of the TPWP. 16. Further, we seek your views on whether there are any other items of work you would like to include on the TPWP, or any items you do not wish to include. For example, is there any particular work you would like on longer-term tax issues? This work may not necessarily end up on a publicly released TPWP given it is unclear what the deliverable or timing would be at this stage. However, it can still be factored into our wider TPWP if Ministers are interested in including it. s 9(2)(f)(iv) s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/306; T2019/1661: Final details of the refreshed Tax Policy Work Programme for 2019-20 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE High-level consultation 17. Since our last meeting, we also consulted with the following key stakeholders: • New Zealand Bankers’ Association; • Corporate Taxpayers’ Group (CTG); • Chartered Accountants Australia New Zealand (CA ANZ); and • Small Business Council. 18. We note that CTG provided us with a letter outlining what their members consider should be prioritised by the Government. We were also provided with a copy of a letter to the Minister of Revenue from the Small Business Council, which covered key areas of interest for that group. Finally, CA ANZ noted that the outcome of a survey of its members (on what they consider to be priority issues) will be released later in the year. 19. Our discussions with stakeholders covered the broad direction of the next TPWP, the priority areas for the Government, and the idea of the next TPWP being organised into packages of work. While discussions covered all the proposed packages of work for the next TPWP, the general focus was around the packages you had indicated you would like prioritised – that is, the packages for land and business (including small business). 20. Discussions with stakeholders went well. We outlined that the packages (particularly for business) would have to include a mix of measures which would support a productive economy and encourage growth and innovation, while at the same time recognising the need to protect the integrity of the tax base and the overall fiscal constraints. They were generally comfortable with this approach. 21. Where stakeholders had a specific interest in progressing a particular item of work, they indicated that they would provide us with further information on why that item should prioritised over other items. For example, CA ANZ noted that they will provide us with a list of land measures they consider should be included in the review of the land rules. CTG also indicated that they would think about providing the items they would like progressed on the TPWP within the context of the Government’s wider objectives, particularly around productive investment and innovation. 22. Stakeholders also told us that understanding key deliverables and the possible timing of the different packages of work on the TPWP was important to them. To this end, we would like your permission to provide key stakeholders with further information on the detailed TPWP. Further consultations planned 23. The consultation we have undertaken over the last few weeks is only the first step of a wider strategy for engaging with stakeholders on the packages of work we intend to deliver under the next TPWP. As mentioned above, as we begin the policy development process for each individual item or package of work, we will engage further with stakeholders. This includes, where appropriate, involving stakeholders right from the start of each project. 24. Once the TPWP is finalised, we also expect to start engaging with a wider set of stakeholders and interested parties, including other businesses, social partners, Maori/iwi and across Government. One of the groups you had asked us to talk to at our last meeting was the Prime Minister’s Business Advisory Council, chaired by Mr Christopher Luxon. We have been discussing with the Minister of Finance’s office IR2019/306; T2019/1661: Final details of the refreshed Tax Policy Work Programme for 2019-20 IN CONFIDENCE IN CONFIDENCE about how best to engage with this group as we advance items relating to business on the TPWP. Next steps Timeline 25. Subject to your agreement, we will prepare a Cabinet paper for noting by DEV, which would include all the documents attached to this report. 26. The following timetable provides you with key dates which will allow you to announce and publish the next TPWP in July: Item Timing TPWP discussion with joint-Ministers Tuesday 11 June 2019 Draft Cabinet paper to Ministers’ offices Thursday 4 July 2019 Cabinet paper lodged in CabNet Thursday 18 July 2019 Paper to DEV for noting Wednesday 24 July 2019 Paper to Cabinet Monday 29 July 2019 Release of TPWP Any time after Cabinet consideration Communications/announcing the TPWP 27. We would like to discuss with you how you would like to announce the refresh of the TPWP.

In Confidence 6 September 2019 Minister of Finance Minister of Revenue Tax measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Executive summary 1. This report seeks your approval to: • clarify the tax treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure to encourage innovation and investment. This measure would be advanced for inclusion in the first taxation bill scheduled for introduction in 2020 and have application from the start of the 2020-21 income year; • prepare a Government discussion document investigating options for relaxing the tax loss continuity rules and reviewing the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. This discussion document could be released in early 2020 with application of any change in the 2021-22 income year. 2. These measures support the Government's economic strategy to build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy, to improve the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders. Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure 3. The tax treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure may be having a detrimental effect on businesses wanting to take risks associated with developing new assets. 4. The Tax Working Group recommended that: • feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure should be able to be deducted and spread over a 5-year period (which is the spreading period for an equivalent rule in Australia); and • a de minimis safe harbour be included to reduce compliance costs of smaller taxpayers who have total annual expenditure of this type below $10,000; in this case the expenditure would be immediately deductible in the year incurred. 5 . Officials recommend that a longer (7 year) period for spreading be adopted in New Zealand. This is primarily due to the absence of a capital gains tax in New Zealand that taxes any increases in value of these types of investments in the event they are successful (as compared to Australia, where there is a capital gains tax). However, there are compelling arguments for either a 5 or 7 year spreading period. 6 . Officials recommend that changes to feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure apply from the start of the 2020-21 income year and be introduced in the first tax bill of 2020. 7. We understand Ministers have discussed the possibility of these rules applying from the current 2019-20 income year, with a Supplementary Order Paper being tabled to the Taxation (Kiwisaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill that is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. This would IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 1 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence occur at the Committee of the Whole House stage meaning there would be no opportunity for consultation. 8. Officials do not recommend this option. This is because to apply the new rules to the current income year will not result in any increase in innovation spend over and above that which would have already taken place, as investment decisions have already been made for this income year. Accordingly, the legislative option of the first tax Bill of 2020 would seem more appropriate and allow sufficient time to draft the legislation. Relaxation of the loss continuity rules 9. The restrictive nature of the current loss continuity rules may also be hindering the ability of innovative businesses to expand and grow. 10. The Tax Working Group recommended these be reviewed specifically in relation to start-up firms. In respect of larger firms, they indicated that care was needed to ensure that the ability to trade in tax losses was minimised. 11. To some extent, the current research and development tax loss cash out scheme potentially lessens the negative impact of the loss continuity rules; however, it is narrowly targeted and there are a range of innovative firms which would benefit from a more general relaxation of the loss continuity rules. Given this, officials consider this scheme should be reviewed along with any relaxation of the loss continuity rules. 12. Officials recommend that the Government release a discussion document early in 2020 which will canvas options for the relaxation of the loss continuity rules along with the review of the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. 13. We understand that Ministers may prefer a faster timeline for this discussion document. However, given the integrity concerns around relaxation of these rules officials recommend that a release in early 2020 is preferable to a less developed issues paper or summary document that is released earlier. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 2 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence Consultation 16. Substantial consultation has been undertaken with the private sector in respect of allowing deductions for feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure, including the release of a discussion document and a second round of consultation. 17. No specific consultation has been undertaken in respect of the relaxation of the tax loss continuity rules, however, this issue was considered as part of the Tax Working Group process and the business sector has consistently raised the need to address this issue with officials. Recommended action 18. We recommend that you: IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 3 of 15 SENSITIVE Recommendations Feasibility and non-deductible expenditure (a) Agree to allow deductions for feasibility and certain other non-deductible expenditure to encourage innovation and growth.

You have asked for officials' advice on tax measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy with a view to encouraging New Zealand business to be innovative and assist those business to grow by removing any barriers to growth that exist within the tax system. 20. This report seeks your approval to: • encourage innovation and investment by clarifying the tax treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure. This measure could be advanced for inclusion in the first taxation Bill scheduled for introduction in 2020 and have application from the start of the 2020-21 income year; and • prepare a Government discussion document on growing New Zealand's productive businesses through investigating options for relaxing the tax loss continuity rules and reviewing the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. This discussion document could be released in early 2020 with any resulting changes applying from the start of the 2021-22 income year. 21. Together officials consider these measures support the Government's economic strategy to build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy, to improve the living standards and wellbeing of all New Zealanders. 22. These measures will ensure that businesses have certainty over the treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure, and any relaxation of the current loss continuity rules will remove an impediment to the growth of innovative businesses allowing them better access to capital. Problem definition 23. The Government's economic v1s1on for New Zealand is to build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy, to improve the living standards and well-being of all New Zealanders. 24. Two key economic shifts that are needed to achieve that vision are: • assisting New Zealand businesses to become more productive, which includes initiatives to encourage innovation such as the recently introduced research and development tax credit; and • ensuring that New Zealand businesses have timely access to capital to enable them to innovate and grow. 25. There are currently two tax impediments to these economic shifts: • the current tax treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure is uncertain following the Supreme Court decision in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1 (Trustpower) which may deter those businesses who want to undertake feasibility studies with a view to innovating and expanding their businesses; and • the current policy settings for allowing firms to continue to use tax losses after a change in ownership (including the introduction of new investors) could be an impediment to businesses obtaining capital to further innovate and grow. L SC 74/2015 \[2016\] NZSC 91 IR2019/490; T2019/2768 : Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 7 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence 26. Addressing these impediments is likely to have a positive effect on businesses and provide them more certainty to undertake innovative projects and expand to encourage new and larger investment. Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure 27. As a general principle, expenditure on business operating costs or assets whose economic value is expected to decline should either be immediately deductible, or, when it provides an on-going benefit over multiple years, deductible over time (under the depreciation rules). Some expenditure will never be deductible, because it is not expected to result in an economic loss. 28. When the tax system does not provide for the appropriate treatment of these different types of expenditure, an economic distortion is created. 29. Under current law, certain classes of expenditure that should be either deductible or depreciable are not. Prime examples are expenditure incurred to investigate whether to invest in a new asset, process or business model (feasibility expenditure) and expenditure that is incurred to create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned. 30. This is particularly problematic for businesses in the infrastructure/utilities sector following the Trustpower decision which materially limited the deductibility of such expenditure. 31. The non-deductibility of this expenditure effectively raises the cost of risky investments in new assets, processes or business models (where a viable outcome is uncertain), and therefore reduces the incentives for businesses to undertake them. These are the very types of investments that are vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements. Example Company A, an electricity generator, is exploring the practicality of establishing a new windfarm. It incurs expenditure over a five-year period associated with measuring wind frequency and speeds (anemology) relevant to the local geography at six different sites. At the end of year 5, the studies indicate that three sites are suitable for windfarms. Those three projects go ahead, but the remaining three are not suitable and so are abandoned. Tax impact The anemology expenditure does not give rise to an immediate deduction under the Income Tax Act. As three of the assets (windfarms) are not completed, there are no tax assets for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules in the Income Tax Act. Result Company A incurs feasibility expenditure and receives no tax deductions for the three abandoned sites. The non-deductibility of the feasibility expenditure effectively raises the cost of the risky investment in new windfarm assets and therefore reduces the incentives for businesses like Company A to undertake them. These are the very types of investments that are vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements and moving to a sustainable economy. IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 8 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence 32. Providing appropriate economic deductions and addressing the complexity of the current state of the law, would improve economic efficiency, minimise distortions and reduce compliance and administration costs. Consultation on the problem 33. The proposed changes to the deductibility of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure have been subject to two rounds of public consultation and consideration by the Government's Tax Working Group. • In May 2017, a discussion document was released by the previous Government in response to the Trustpower decision which narrowed the scope of deductibility of feasibility expenditure. Twenty-three submissions were received that largely supported the policy direction of the discussion document but had concerns regarding the complexity of the proposal and its practical application. • In October 2017, a second-round of consultation was held on a revised proposal with key stakeholders. Of the ten responses we received, feedback was generally supportive of the revised approach but were concerned (again) with the degree of complexity of the proposal (as it was a blend of financial and tax accounting concepts). Submitters were also concerned that the revised proposal created gaps which could still give rise to non-deductible treatment of feasibility expenditure. • Subsequent to these rounds of consultation, officials proposed that to address submitters concerns that businesses be allowed to deduct expenditure related to the impairment of unsuccessful or abandoned assets over a period of 7 years. The proposal would not apply to expenditure on land or assets that do not decline in value. The 7-year period was decided on in the absence of a capital gains tax. The absence of a capital gains tax is relevant because for any risky investment a deduction for losses when unsuccessful (the proposal), can create a tax bias to invest if there is not symmetric treatment (by taxing the capital gain) on the upside if the successful asset is sold. Choosing a longer period of spreading can lessen this to some degree, although there is no precise science in choosing either 5 or 7 years. • As part of their review, the Tax Working Group also considered the issue of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure and recommended to the Government that expenditure that is not already deductible be deducted over 5 years. In addition, they recommended a safe-harbour de-minimis rule be added for businesses who have less than $10,000 in total of feasibility expenditure annually. 34. From the consultation undertaken it is highly likely this proposal will be favourably received by the business sector. Proposal 35. Officials recommend amending the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow a deduction (spread over either five or seven years) for expenditure incurred to investigate whether to invest in a new asset, process or business model (feasibility expenditure) and create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, in cases where the expenditure is otherwise not deductible. 36. A similar approach is applied in Australia and allows such expenditure to be spread over a 5-year period. Officials consider a longer period (such as 7 years) could be appropriate for New Zealand in recognition that capital gains on these types of IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 9 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence investments are not comprehensively captured by New Zealand's income tax system. 37. However, Ministers may consider that a period of 5 years is more suitable as this is consistent with the Tax Working Group's recommendation and mirrors the rules that apply in Australia. 38. To reduce complexity and compliance costs, we also propose to include a threshold whereby this type of expenditure incurred and not otherwise deductible under the Income Tax Act, would be immediately deductible if that expenditure, in total, amounted to $10,000 or less annually. This threshold is similar to other compliance cost savings measures in the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to immediately deduct low levels of expenditure, such as legal fees. 39. The proposal would also have appropriate integrity safeguards. Apart from expenditure deducted under the $10,000 threshold, deductions claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequent reinstated would be reversed in the year of reinstatement. 40. We consider this proposal strikes a suitable balance between business sector expectations that any policy change is simple and easy to apply (a criticism directed at earlier proposals), and ensuring the policy response is fiscally sustainable . As a result, we expect the proposal to be favourably received by the business sector. Application date and delivery 41. Officials recommend that to support the Government's economic v1s1on to encourage innovation, the change apply from start of the 2020-21 income year (for most firms this is 1 April 2020) to new expenditure incurred on and after that date. Expenditure incurred in that year would be eligible to be spread and deducted. 42. Officials recommend this application date, as investment decisions by firms have already been made for the current 2019-20 income year and introducing clarifying rules will not change or increase investment. If the rules were changed for the current income year it is possible that the objective of the initiative - to change innovation decision-making behaviours - would be lost and rather result in a windfall gain to taxpayers who have already incurred the expenditure. 43. Officials also recommend these changes be included in the first available tax Bill in 2020. It is important that the legislation is robust and is correctly targeted and allowing more time to develop that legislation will reduce the risk that the rules can be manipulated. It will also give officials the opportunity to test the legislation with interested parties. 44. Officials also consider it is important that legislation that makes a substantial change should have full consideration in the select committee process. 45. Another option would be to deliver the legislation as a Supplementary Order Paper to the current Taxation (Kiwisaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee. We do not recommend this as: • this could result in rushed legislation with little consultation than a full legislative process; • substantial law changes such as this would benefit from the select committee process; and IR2019/490 ; T2019/2768 : Ta x Measures to support the Government 's Economic St r ategy Page 10 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence • if Ministers agree with officials on the application date for the amended rules there would be no benefit in rushing the legislation. s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 11 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence s 9(2)(f)(iv) IR2019/490 ; T2019/2768 : Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 12 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence s 9(2)(f)(iv) Relaxing the loss continuity rules and the tax loss cash out scheme 57. The second proposal would review the asymmetrical treatment of losses and income under New Zealand's company tax system. Currently, companies pay tax when their income is positive, but the Government does not provide a refund when income is negative. Instead, losses can be carried forward to offset any future income of a company. 58. The loss continuity rules determine whether losses from a previous year can be used in a future year. Generally, losses may be used to offset future income, unless more than 51 % of the company's shares have changed hands since the losses were incurred. 59. The loss continuity rules require a balance between efficiency and integrity objectives. Strict rules can reduce efficiency by discouraging risk taking but loose rules may allow companies to reduce their taxable income by trading in losses. 60. For many companies the existing loss continuity rules are appropriate, but they do not work well for start-up firms. These firms require equity capital to grow. The capital is often raised over time, through multiple rounds, from differing types of investors. Yet these firms are often inherently loss-making as they grow from an idea to a viable business. The existing loss continuity rules may be constraining their ability to grow through additional equity capital - because such capital injections will generally breach the 51 % threshold. 61. New Zealand's lost continuity rules are more stringent than many other OECD countries, including our closest trading partner, Australia. 62. The Tax Working Group considered that the existing loss continuity rules are appropriate for most companies but may not be working well for start-up firms as these firms require equity capital to grow and the current settings may be constraining their ability to grow. To address this the Tax Working Group recommended some relaxation of the rules to support the growth of innovative start-up firms. 63. It was noted by the Tax Working Group that any relaxation of the rules would need to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the change does not facilitate trading in losses among larger firms. 64. Some of the business arrangements that can be impeded by strict loss continuity rules include: • the sale of a company by a controlling shareholder, such as a founder cashing out of a start-up; • the acquisition of a company, with the intention of using that company's business assets in a continuing business; • the merger of two companies with commercial synergies; • the initial public offering of a start-up company; and • major capital raising to fund business expansion. 65. To an extent, the research and development tax loss cash out scheme provides some relief to those companies who do incur losses in their initial years. That scheme allows research and development intensive firms to receive cash refunds IR2019/490; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 13 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence for their tax losses to the extent these match their research and development expenditure. It is a separate scheme from the research and development tax incentive that this Government has introduced. 66. However, the research and development tax loss cash out is narrowly targeted. There are a range of innovative firms who would benefit from a more general relaxation of the loss continuity rules, who do not currently benefit from the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. 67. Though adjusting the loss continuity rules would not necessarily provide the same benefits to current recipients of the research and development tax loss cash out, there are links between these policies - the research and development tax loss cash out scheme was developed to mitigate the effects of the stringent loss continuity rules for a specific set of firms. For that reason, we propose to review the loss cash out scheme in conjunction with reviewing the loss continuity rules. 68. It is important to balance any relaxation of the loss continuity rules to support the growth of start-up entities with the need to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is protected, and large taxpayers are not permitted to trade in tax losses. Such trading of tax losses could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand's tax base. The current stock of tax losses is approximated at $44 billion. This is why it is important to consult carefully on different options to relax the rules, while minimising the potential fiscal risk. Proposal 69. We recommend the Government direct officials to prepare a discussion document canvassing options for relaxing the loss continuity rules and reviewing the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. 70. Given the frequency that this issue is raised by the business sector we expect this proposal to be favourably received. Application date and delivery 71. Officials recommend any changes to the loss continuity rules and the research and development tax loss cash out scheme apply from the start of the 2020-21 income year. We consider that development of these rules will involve substantial consultation with the business sector and due to the integrity issues around relaxing the loss continuity rules the development of legislation will be important and should be progressed over time. 72. Officials consider there are substantial fiscal and integrity risks with a faster implementation timeframe. 73. The timeframe for delivery of the discussion document is dependent on its content. Although the research and development tax loss cash out scheme component could be done prior to the end of 2019, in terms of the work on relaxing the loss continuity rules there are three possible timing options: • a high-level officials' issues paper - Officials could release an issues paper that would seek feedback from stakeholders in respect of the problems with the current loss continuity rules and potential solutions. The risk to this approach is that submitters will have an expectation that one of the suggestions made will be accepted by Government - and some suggestions may involve large amounts of forgone revenue. However, such a document could be developed on a faster timeframe potentially before the end of 2019; IR2019/490 ; T2019/2768: Tax Measures to support the Government's Economic Strategy Page 14 of 15 SENSITIVE In Confidence • an officials' issues paper containing international comparisons - Officials could release an issues paper that summarises the rules of other countries in respect of loss continuity and ask for submissions on the regime New Zealand should adopt. Again, a document of this type could be issued before the end of 2019; or • a full Government discussion document - a discussion document that provides several options developed through consultation with the private sector and worked through the policy development process. This document would not be meet a timeframe of the end of 2019 but could be released in early 2020. 74. Officials' recommend the third option - a Government discussion document for release in early 2020. This has the benefit of providing options that the Government is willing to implement and will allow pre-consultation with interested parties to form the basis for the options provided. Although there is a longer timeframe to release, officials consider that the work required to implement changes resulting from the consultation is likely to be reduced. Financial implications 75. There are no expected financial implications for the release of the discussion document in relation to the relaxation of loss continuity rules and review of the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. 76. Any changes to relaxing the loss continuity rules or to the research and development tax loss cash out scheme will have a fiscal impact. The size of the impact will depend on which options are selected and how they are designed. Advice on financial implications will be provided when approval of the finalised proposals is sought. Compliance and administration implications 77. For the proposal on feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure, the proposals are expected to reduce compliance costs and have no direct implications on Inland Revenue's technology platform or systems. Officials consider the proposed changes to feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure incurred in investigating and/or developing assets will reduce compliance costs as it resolves an uncertainty in the tax rules that has existed since the Trustpower decision. 78. The preparation and release of a discussion document on the loss continuity rules and the review of the tax loss cash out scheme have no compliance or administrative impacts, although any change in the rules will result in some impacts which will be determined when the discussion document is prepared. Consultation 79. Given the time available, other than previous public consultation on the tax treatment of feasibility expenditure and feedback during the Tax Working Group process, officials have not consulted stakeholders on the proposals discussed in this report. Next steps 80. We have provided you a companion report (IR2019/491; T2019/2793 refers) with an attached draft Cabinet paper for your review and comment that seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committees' agreement to announce these proposals as part of the release of the Government's Economic Strategy on 23 September 2019.

This paper also seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s approval to announce the Government will consult on further tax changes to support small and innovative businesses. We propose to announce these initiatives in support of the launch of the Government’s Economic Plan on 23 September 2019. These two initiatives were considered and recommended by the Tax Working Group, and are included on the recently released Government Tax Policy Work Programme. Executive Summary 2.We seek the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to announce a law change to provide greater deductibility of feasibility and other currently non- deductible expenditure to encourage business innovation and investment. This initiative is well developed and would be included in the first taxation bill scheduled for introduction in 2020, with effect from the 2020-21 income year. 3.We also seek the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to ann ounce the Government’s commitment to consult on options to relax the tax loss continuity rules and review the research and development tax loss cash out scheme introduced in 2016. This initiative is the next in a pipeline of proposed measures in the Government’s tax policy work programme that aim to support the growth of New Zealand’s productive businesses. We recommend the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s direct officials to start the consultation process on proposals in late 2019. 4.Together these measures support the Government’s Economic Plan to ensure that New Zealand’s economy is productive, sustainable and inclusive. The measures will contribute to two of the key economic shifts we need to achieve this economic vision – moving the New Zealand economy from volume to value with Kiwi businesses, inc luding SMEs, becoming more productive and deeper pools of capital are available to invest in infrastructure and grow New Zealand’s productive assets (highlighted below). It will do this by assisting firms that invest in exploring new and better ways of doing business, and small and medium businesses, especially start-up firms. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE 2.

Source: Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. 5. Both of these tax initiatives have had long-standing support within the business 6. We propose to announce these initiatives as part of the release of the Government’s Economic Plan on 23 September 2019. 7. We also seek, in respect of the initiative described in paragraph 2, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to delegate authority to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue to make decisions about the final details of the proposal. Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure 8. This initiative, which we recommend including in the first taxation bill for 2020, with application from the start of the 2020-21 income year, will remove tax barriers for businesses to invest in innovation, new assets and business expansion by allowing greater tax deductions for feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure. 9. Under current law expenditure incurred to investigate whether to invest in a new asset, process or business model (feasibility expenditure, sometimes called community These measures have been developed with a view to supporting business growth and innovation, while also maintaining the integrity of the tax system. s 9(2)(f)(iv) 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE “blackhole expenditure”) and expenditure that is incurred to create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, is generally not deductible. 10. This is particularly problematic for businesses in the infrastructure/utilities sector following the 2016 decision by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 1 (Trustpower) which materially limited the deductibility of such expenditure. Examples of possible expenditure affected by the decision are set out in the attached annex. 11. The non-deductibility of this expenditure effectively raises the cost of risky investments in new assets, processes or business models (where a viable outcome is uncertain), and therefore reduces the incentives for businesses to undertake them. These are the very types of investments that are vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements. 12. Business sector interest in this issue is long-standing and high and potential solutions to the problem have been subject to two rounds of public consultation in 2017. The Tax Working Group also considered the issue and made recommendations for policy change in this area. 13. Our proposal responds to stakeholder comments and the Tax Working Group recommendations and complements the work the Government has already done to support innovation which includes the introduction of the research and development tax incentive. The proposal means that businesses undertaking the full range of innovative investment, whether it is formal research and development or other types of innovative activities, these activities will be supported by the tax system. 14. This will support the key shift of driving the New Zealand economy from volume to value, by encouraging businesses to invest in new technologies and ways of working as the after tax cost of undertaking these investments will be reduced. 15. This is because the cost of feasibility expenditure should be allowed as a tax deduction, but currently is not. Because of this, a company undertaking this kind of investment has less money to invest, or may choose not to make the investment. There have been numerous case studies and feedback from leading practitioners that this measure will increase productive investment, and have positive flow on impacts to innovation and the economy. Proposal 16. We recommend amending the Income Tax Act 2007 to allow a deduction (spread over five years) for expenditure incurred to investigate whether to invest in a new asset, process or business model (feasibility expenditure) and create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, in cases where the expenditure is otherwise not deductible. 17. We recommend a spreading period of 5 years as this is consistent with the Tax Working Group’s recommendation and mirrors a similar set of tax rules that apply in Australia. 1 \[2016\] NZSC 91. Under New Zealand’s income tax laws expenditure connected with developing an asset is not immediately deductible. If the partially developed asset is subsequently impaired and abandoned so that it is not completed, a depreciable asset is not created for tax purposes and the taxpayer cannot deduct depreciation. As such, the expenditure incurred by the business in developing the asset is not tax deductible at all. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE 18. The change would apply from the start of the 2020-21 income year (for most firms this is 1 April 2020) to new expenditure incurred on and after that date. This is the first income year the proposal could take effect and have an impact on business investment decisions. Expenditure incurred in that year would be eligible to be spread and deducted. 19. To reduce complexity and compliance costs, we also propose to include a threshold whereby this type of expenditure incurred and not otherwise deductible under the Income Tax Act, would be immediately deductible in a year if that expenditure, in total, amounted to $10,000 or less. This threshold is similar to other compliance cost savings measures in the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to immediately deduct low levels of expenditure, such as legal fees. 20. The proposal would also have appropriate integrity safeguards. Apart from expenditure deducted under the $10,000 threshold, deductions claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequently reinstated would be reversed in the year of reinstatement, with the reinstated asset able to be subsequently depreciated. 21. We consider this proposal strikes a suitable balance between business sector expectations that any policy change is simple and easy to apply (a criticism directed at earlier proposals), and ensuring the policy response is fiscally sustainable. The proposal also has significant (but unquantifiable) benefits for the business community as it provides greater certainty for business decision-making which has been sought following the Trustpower decision (which reduced the scope of the deduction available as compared to business expectations). Our proposal ensures that tax is not a barrier for businesses seeking to invest in new projects or assets. 22. Details of the proposal, such as the implications for reinstated assets, will need to be finalised, as well as legislative design. We recommend delegating final design decisions, including the detail of the proposed amendment, to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue. Relaxing the loss continuity rules and reviewing the tax loss cash scheme rules 23. The next tax initiative we recommend progressing, is a review of the asymmetrical treatment of losses and income under NewZealand's company tax system. Currently, companies pay tax when their income is positive, but the Government does not provide a refund when income is negative. Instead, losses can be carried forward to offset against the future income of a company. 24. The loss continuity rules determine whether losses from a previous year can be used in a future year. Generally, losses may be used to offset future income, unless more than 51 percent of the company's shares have changed hands since the losses were incurred. 25. The loss continuity rules require a balance between efficiency and integrity objectives. Strict rules can reduce efficiency by discouraging risk taking but loose rules may allow companies to reduce their taxable income by trading in losses. 26. For many companies the existing loss continuity rules are appropriate, but they do not work well for start-up firms. These firms require equity capital to grow. The capital 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE 27. 28. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. is often raised over time, through multiple rounds, from differing types of investors. Yet these firms are often inherently loss making as they grow from an idea to a viable business. The existing loss-continuity rules may be constraining their ability to grow through additional equity capital – because such capital injections will generally breach the 51 percent threshold. New Zealand’s loss continuity rules are more stringent than many other OECD countries, including our closest trading partner, Australia. The Tax Working Group recommended that these loss continuity rules be changed to support the growth of innovative start-up firms. Some of the business arrangements that can be impeded by strict loss continuity rules include: 29.1 the sale of a company by a controlling shareholder, such as a founder cashing out of a start-up; 29.2 the acquisition of a company, with the intention of using that company’s business assets in a continuing business; 29.3 the merger of two companies with commercial synergies; 29.4 the initial public offering of a start-up company; and 29.5 major capital raising to fund business expansion. To an extent, the research and development tax loss cash out scheme provides some relief to those companies who do incur losses in their initial years. That scheme allows research and development intensive firms to receive cash refunds for their tax losses to the extent these match their research and development expenditure. It is a separate scheme from the research and development tax incentive that this Government has introduced. However, the research and development tax loss cash out is narrowly targeted. There are a range of innovative firms who would benefit from a more general relaxation of the loss continuity rules, who do not currently benefit from the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. Though adjusting the loss continuity rules would not necessarily provide the same benefits to current recipients of the research and development tax loss cash out, there are links between these policies – the research and development tax loss cash out scheme was developed to mitigate the effects of the stringent loss continuity rules for a specific set of firms. For that reason we propose to review the loss cash out scheme in conjunction with reviewing the loss continuity rules. It is important to balance any relaxation of the loss continuity rules to support the growth of start-up entities with the need to ensure that the integrity of the tax system is protected and large taxpayers are not permitted to trade in tax losses. Such trading of tax losses could have a detrimental effect on New Zealand’s tax base. The current stock of tax losses is approximated at $44 billion. This is why it is important 5 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 to consult carefully on different options to relax the rules, while minimising the potential fiscal risk. Proposal 34. We recommend that the Government announces a commitment to consult on relaxing the loss continuity rules, and officials prepare a discussion document canvassing options for relaxing the loss continuity rules and reviewing the research and development tax loss cash out scheme. 35. We propose that discussions with stakeholders begin in late 2019, with a final discussion document to be released in early 2020. 36. Addressing loss continuity issues will assist our small, innovative businesses to grow through capital injections, and support the key economic shift from volume to value, by encouraging a thriving and dynamic business sector. Financial Implications Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure 37. The financial implications of allowing firms tax deductions for unsuccessful or abandoned assets, including deductions falling under the minimum threshold ($10,000) for small-to-medium enterprises, is illustrated in the table below. 38. The revenue estimates are based on business sector asset formulation statistics and assume a 3 percent growth in spending per annum. When fully phased in, in the 2024-25 income year, the proposal is estimated to cost approximately $42 million (growing by 3 percent per annum thereafter). 39. $million – increase/(decrease) 40. s 9(2)(f)(iv) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 2023/24 & outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue -(7.000) (16.000) (24.000) (33.000) Total Operating -7.000 16.000 24.000 33.000 Relaxing the loss continuity rules 41.

Any changes to relaxing the 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE loss continuity rules or to the research and development tax loss cash out scheme will have a fiscal impact. The size of the impact will depend on which options are selected and how they are designed. Advice on financial implications will be provided when approval of the finalised proposals is sought. Consultation 42. The proposed changes to the deductibility of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure have been previously subject to two rounds of public consultation and consideration by the Government’s Tax Working Group. 43. In May 2017, the previous government released a discussion document in response to the Trustpower decision. Twenty-three submissions were received that largely supported the policy direction of the discussion document, but had concerns regarding the complexity of the proposal and its practical application. 44. In October 2017, a second-round of consultation was held on a revised proposal with key stakeholders. Of the ten responses received, feedback was generally supportive of the revised approach but were concerned (again) with the degree of complexity of the proposal (as it was a blend of financial and tax accounting concepts). Submitters were also concerned that the revised proposal created gaps which could still give rise to non-deductible treatment of feasibility expenditure. 45. The proposal we are recommending in this paper is broadly similar to the proposals consulted on, but responds to submitters’ concerns by significantly simplifying the rule and providing an immediate deduction for those with qualifying expenditure that is $10,000 or less (in total) in an income year. Stakeholders have informed officials that the most important issue is that such expenditure is deductible; not the timing of that deduction. 46. While there has been some limited public consultation on the loss continuity rules as part of the Tax Working Group process, this paper seeks approval for specific consultation through a Government discussion document. Legislative Implications 47. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. 48. If approved, we propose including the legislative changes on feasibility expenditure and other non-deductible expenditure in the first omnibus taxation bill scheduled for introduction early 2020, with application from the start of the 2020-21 income year. 49. The publication of the discussion document on the relaxation of loss continuity rules does not have any legislative implications. However legislative change will be necessary if Cabinet subsequently decides to implement the policy recommendations developed as a result of public consultation on the discussion document. Impact Analysis Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure 50. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets regulatory impact 7 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE assessment (RIA) prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 51. As outlined in section 5 of the RIA, consultation has been carried out with stakeholders in relation to the identified problem and potential solutions over the last few years. However, as noted in the Key Limitations and Constraints on Analysis section of the RIA, the detailed policy design of officials’ preferred option is still to be developed and consulted on with stakeholders and this has limited officials’ ability to undertake a complete analysis. A key unexplored issue with the preferred option is the point in time in the development of an asset at which the spreading over 5 years of deductions for expenditure incurred will commence. Consequently, there is still uncertainty as to the impacts of the preferred option (for example, on taxpayers’ compliance costs). The RIA notes that consultation on the final design of the preferred option will occur over the coming months if Cabinet decides to proceed with it. Loss continuity and research and development tax loss cash out scheme 52. Elements of the regulatory impact analysis will be included in the discussion document at a level that is appropriate given the stage of policy development. A full regulatory impact analysis will be carried out later in the policy process, once officials have finalised their policy recommendations. Human Rights 53. The recommendations in this paper are not inconsistent with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993. Publicity 54. Once Cabinet Economic Development Committee has made a decision on the proposals in this paper, we will make an announcement on 23 September 2019 as part of the launch of the Government’s Economic Plan. Proactive Release 55. We propose to release this Cabinet paper and accompanying Regulatory Impact Statement on the date the proposal is announced. Recommendations The Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue recommend that the Cabinet Economic Development Committee: 1.

Authorised for lodgement Hon Grant Robertson Minister of Finance Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 10 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE Annex: Examples of feasibility expenditure Company A, an electricity generator, is exploring the practicality of establishing a new windfarm. It incurs expenditure over a five-year period associated with measuring wind frequency and speeds (anemology) relevant to the local geography at six different sites. At the end of year 5, the studies indicate that three sites are suitable for windfarms. Those three projects go ahead, but the remaining three are not suitable and so are abandoned. Tax impact The anemology expenditure does not give rise to an immediate deduction under the Income Tax Act. As three of the assets (windfarms) are not completed, there are no tax assets for the purposes of the tax depreciation rules in the Income Tax Act. Result: Company A incurs feasibility expenditure and receives no tax deductions for the three abandoned sites. The non-deductibility of the feasibility expenditure effectively raises the cost of the risky investment in new windfarm assets and therefore reduces the incentives for businesses like Company A to undertake them. Yet, these are the very types of investments that are vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements and moving to a sustainable economy. Company B, a water management company is working on ways to meet demand in times of low- aquifer inflows and drought without have to resort to water restrictions. It is exploring the viability of desalination. The company carries out a number of studies on the practicality of building and operating a desalination plant and secondly, how water from the plant could be connected to the wider network. Work on the project is shelved after an assessment determines it is uneconomic, in terms of energy needs and water output, for the plant to meet forecast demand – given current technology. The project is shelved pending further work on desalination nanotechnology. However, the investigation work carried out as part of the studies yielded useful information about how such desalination plants could be built and brought to market in future once the technology advances. It also identified other useful areas for future research and several other potential projects that could be commercialised in the next 3 years. Tax impact The costing and initial scoping work does not give rise to an immediate deduction under the Income Tax Act. As the expenditure does not relate to an existing tax asset or create a new tax asset, there is no tax deduction for the purpose of the deprecation rules in the Income Tax Act. Result: Company B incurs feasibility expenditure and receives no tax deductions. As in the example above, the tax rules raise the cost of undertaking the risky investment, and some companies may not be prepared to undertake it. This would mean that the advances in the understanding of desalination technology would not have taken place. It is possible that the other resulting projects will be highly profitable, and these would not have been possible without the investigatory work carried out on the shelved desalination plant. 11 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:47:42 SENSITIVE Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non- deductible expenditure for incomplete as sets Section 1: General information Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA), except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis There is no direct evidence on hand to give an estimate about the extent to which non- deductible expenditure affects efficiency in the tax system. This makes it difficult to quantify the scale of the problem or the potential benefits from introducing the preferred option. Officials were informed during consultation of anecdotal examples where current tax policy settings were acting as a barrier for businesses in respect of developing assets where uncertainty existed in respect of their completion or potential impairment and abandonment. Estimates on the impacts of the proposed option have been based on New Zealand 2018 gross fixed capital formation ($m) provisional statistics. The assessed impacts in the table in section 4.1 contain assumptions regarding taxpayer compliance and the composition of private sector asset creation in the 2018 statistics. Officials have a moderate level of confidence in the assumptions we have used but note the 2018 statistics are subject to volatility as a result of asset revaluations. Although the proposals in this RIA have been developed over several years the recent development of final proposal has been completed in a short timeframe which has limited officials’ ability to undertake a complete analysis of the final proposals including its final design. The time available has also prevented officials from fully testing the design of the preferred option with stakeholders. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Chris Gillion Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 13 September 2019 Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 1 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 3. Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? This RIA considers two questions:  Do the current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain, and  If the answer to the first question is yes, what is the best option for solving the problem. The first question is considered in this section, section 2, the second question is considered in section 3. Do current tax policy settings hinder businesses from committing resource to developing new assets in situations where the completion of that asset is uncertain? Business decision-making on the potential or practicality of developing new assets, business models or processes is vital to innovation and driving productivity improvements. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are acting as a barrier to business decision-making on these types of investment, specifically investments that decline in value. Under current law, expenditure (that is more than preliminary in nature) incurred to invest in a new asset, process, or business model (feasibility expenditure), and expenditure that is incurred to create a business asset that is subsequently abandoned, is generally not deductible. As a general principle, the economic value of business expenditure that does not provide an enduring benefit should either be immediately deductible, or, when it provides an enduring benefit, deductible over time if that benefit declines over time and has a finite lifetime. When the tax system does not provide for that treatment, an economic distortion is created. Overlaying this principle, New Zealand’s income tax framework draws a distinction between the treatment of economic income from capital and non-capital sources. The distinction is best described using the following metaphor of a fruit-bearing tree. New Zealand’s income tax is designed to tax the fruit from the tree. It does not necessarily tax the tree itself. The corollary of the example is that expenditure is deductible when it has a connection or relationship with producing taxable income (fruit) and is non-deductible when it relates to capital assets (the tree). Consistent with the general principle above, the system also allows depreciation deductions recognising the use of capital assets in producing taxable income. The income tax system’s distinction between income from capital and revenue can result in expenditure not being deductible. For example, feasibility expenditure or other expenditure that results in an economic cost to a taxpayer, but for which neither immediate deductions nor depreciation deductions are available (commonly referred to as “black hole” expenditure). Such examples can skew investment decisions. Feasibility expenditure is expenditure that is undertaken to determine the practicality of a new proposal. In some cases, the Income Tax Act 2007 will deny taxpayers an immediate deduction for such expenditure when it has a connection with an asset that has the potential to yield future economic benefits beyond the taxpayer’s immediate income year. In addition, because of the early-stage nature of feasibility expenditure uncertainty exists over the outcome and this can make it difficult for taxpayers to assess whether an asset indeed exists. Inland Revenue’s original interpretation statement 1 on feasibility expenditure allowed a Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 2 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 relatively wide scope for preliminary expenditure to be immediately deductible if there was no definitive commitment to proceeding with a project. Concerns that the Income Tax Act was skewing business decisions came to a head in 2016 as a result of obiter comments by the Supreme Court in Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 2 (the Trustpowerdecision). The case itself was about resource costs, which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue maintained were not immediately deductible. The Supreme Court agreed with the Commissioner’s view but noted that the statutory test for deducting certain types of expenditure was narrower than Inland Revenue’s interpretation and taxpayer expectations at the time. Officials have been informed that an effect of the Trustpowerdecision is that less expenditure is immediately deductible for tax purposes than previously thought 3 which increases the likelihood that businesses will incur non-deductible expenditure when creating income producing depreciable assets. In 2017 Inland Revenue released an updated interpretation statement that applies the analysis from the Trustpowerdecision. 4 Inland Revenue has been anecdotally informed by stakeholders that the current state following the Trustpowerdecision is discouraging businesses from undertaking spending on new assets or processes that they otherwise would have undertaken in the absence of tax. Additionally, if a project or investment is unsuccessful or abandoned, the capitalised expenditure may not generate depreciation deductions over time. As such, businesses may be incentivised to complete projects that, but for the tax effect, would be abandoned. This behaviour affects economic efficiency. Figure 1 illustrates a simple project timeline and the tax treatment of the expenditure incurred in developing that project following the Trustpower decision and Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement: Figure 1: Tax treatment of feasibility expenditure 1 Interpretation Statement IS 08/02: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 20, No 6 (July 2008) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/e/e/ee3c54c3-4675-45d3-8fa4-2cea747ff52b/tib- vol20-no6.pdf 2 Trustpower Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2016\] NZSC 91. 3 This outcome is appropriate, however, for assets that are not expected to decline in value. 4 Interpretation Statement IS 17/01: Deductibility of feasibility expenditure, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 29, No 3 (April 2017) available at https://www.classic.ird.govt.nz/resources/3/e/3e0303d0-0b02-4f86-844a- 547a6179b661/tib-vol29-no3.pdf Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 3 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 2.2 Who is affected and how? The proposal in this RIA is directed at businesses, specifically in the following circumstances:  Businesses delaying or not undertaking feasibility studies that would otherwise occur if there is uncertainty over whether the expenditure would be deductible and the higher after-tax cost of an unsuccessful investment.  Businesses continuing with feasibility studies that would be uneconomic on a pre-tax basis to ensure they can claim deductions for expenditure already incurred. The Government is concerned that current tax settings are not providing the correct outcome for businesses in respect of expenditure on new assets and processes (that would, if completed, decline in value). The Government wants to remove these tax barriers to promote economically efficient business decisions. It is not intended that the reform would have effect on spending related to assets that are not expected to decline in value over time, such as land or shares, or other assets where the Income Tax Act 2007 provides for a specified treatment. Inland Revenue does not hold information to inform who is directly impacted by the current treatment of expenditure directed at creating new assets. We are, however, aware from tax practitioner comment following the Trustpowerdecision and the views of submitters about the initial problem definition and initial solutions, that there is an impact on small-to-medium sized firms and the large corporate sector. Not for profits, public sector entities and individuals are not considered be within the scope of those affected. Reform in this area of tax law has had long-standing support from the business community. The magnitude of the impact is also difficult to estimate as Inland Revenue does not directly capture data relating to the costs incurred by business when making investment decisions or when decisions are made that result in physical assets being abandoned. In assessing the revenue impact of the preferred option discussed in this RIA, Inland Revenue has used asset formulation statistics to get an understanding about how asset formulation changes from year to year. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 4 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? To date, the government has taken an incremental approach to other instances of non- deductible expenditure under New Zealand’s tax system in relation to:  Research and development;  Company administration costs;  Resource consents;  Software projects;  Patents; and  Plant variety rights. The options discussed in this impact statement are not intended to replace or otherwise alter the rules that are specific to the type of expenditure on the activities or transactions listed above. As such, it is not within the scope of this project to review or consolidate these previous responses. It is expected that any policy change would be directed at expenditure that is not the subject of these other rules in the Income Tax Act; as such, it is likely to act as a rule of last resort. The options in this RIA therefore consider expenditure that is not dealt with elsewhere in the Income Tax Act. The options are also not intended to alter the current non-deductibility for assets that are expected to appreciate in value such, as land or shares, as such assets are not expected to result in an economic loss. The Tax Working Group’s consideration of the treatment of expenditure on feasibility and expenditure on abandoned assets, as set out in its final report in February 2019 have also had a strong influence on the selection of the preferred option. 5 5 Future of Tax: Final Report Volume I – Recommendations, Thursday, 21 February 2019 https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-final-report-vol-i-html#section-3, recommendation 33 refers. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 5 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered:  Neutrality: the tax rules should not influence taxpayer decisions about incurring feasibility expenditure  Compliance and administration costs: the impacts on taxpayers complying with the tax rules and Inland Revenue’s administration of those rules, should be minimised as far as possible.  Integrity: Tax deductions should not be available for expenditure that when incurred is unlikely to give rise to taxable income now or in the future or for expenditure on assets that are not expected to decline in value over time. Option One: Status quo This would leave the deductibility of feasibility expenditure to be considered on a case-by- case basis with guidance from Inland Revenue’s 2017 interpretation statement following the Trustpowerdecision. Option Two: Spread the timing and recognition of feasibility expenditure over 5 years This option would allow taxpayers to deduct expenditure on developing new assets and incomplete assets over a defined period of 5 years. Alternative spreading periods have been considered such as 7 years. Officials initially considered 7 years was most appropriate for New Zealand, noting the absence of a comprehensive tax on the income from capital. A 5-year spread was chosen following detailed consideration of the treatment of feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure on incomplete assets by the Tax Working Group headed by Sir Michael Cullen. It is also noted that Australia has a comparable 5 year spreading rule to deal with expenditure incurred for similar purposes when developing new assets. 6 A period shorter than 5 years was considered to introduce a distortion to abandon incomplete assets earlier than would otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). 7 Officials plan to carry out an additional round of consultation with key stakeholders on the final design of this option including any resulting draft amendments. An outstanding matter for stakeholder comment is the test(s) that would need to be met to establish the point in time in which expenditure can be recognised for tax deductibility. Option Three: Generally accepted accounting practice (application of Financial Reporting Standards) This option would allow generally accepted accounting practice (with certain constraints) to determine the recognition and timing of deductions. 6 Inland Revenue notes that any comparison of this proposal with tax deductibility rules that apply in Australia should be considered in the context of differences between New Zealand’s and Australia’s treatment of income from capital. 7 Noting that a tension can exist for taxpayers who are required to comply with financial reporting standards. Assets expensed for tax purposes have a direct reflex in the taxpayer’s balance sheet and profit and loss statement. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 6 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 This would allow for:  a defined class of expenditure, known as “feasibility expenditure”, to be immediately tax deductible until an asset is recognised under generally accepted accounting practice; and  an immediate deduction if the project or proposal is abandoned and written off under generally accepted accounting practice. This option would also require support by new rules to deal with abandoned partially completed assets. The additional rule would be needed to remove distortions that would otherwise be created as depreciation deductions are available for completed assets only. Modifications to options 2 and 3 for compliance and tax base integrity reasons Options 2 and 3 have modifications that are not separate options in themselves but alter their application and effect to ensure the reform option is appropriately targeted and contains appropriate safeguards. Reinstatement of expenditure if abandoned or completed asset is subsequently recognised Under options 2 and 3, safeguards would be added to provide that deductions claimed for abandoned or impaired assets that are subsequently reinstated would be reversed in the year of reinstatement. Reinstatement would involve bringing back earlier tax deductions as an increase in revenue in the year of reinstatement and capitalizing those values in the cost of the asset (which would then be subject to tax depreciation). Safe harbour for low threshold expenditure Submitters on option 3 argued that a safe harbour was necessary to reduce compliance costs on small-to-medium sized taxpayers. This was largely due to the fact that such taxpayers were unlikely to be required to comply with New Zealand financial reporting standards. Similar compliance cost savings arguments apply to option 2 as there are costs attached with identifying and spreading expenditure under the option. It therefore makes sense for low levels of spending on investigating and/or developing a new asset, model or process to be immediately deductible. It has yet to be explored with stakeholders if expenditure covered by the safe harbour would have to be reinstated if it related to a completed asset that is expected to decline in value. 8 A threshold of $10,000 was suggested by stakeholders, and officials considered that it was an appropriate amount that targeted asset creation expenditure by small-to-medium sized businesses. The $10,000 threshold is similar to other compliance cost savings measures in the Income Tax Act that allow taxpayers to deduct low levels of expenditure, such as legal fees. 8 Ibid footnote 8. Officials note that taxpayers who are not required to comply with financial reporting standards do not always face a tension between accounting for tax and financial reporting when making decisions about whether to abandon an asset prior to completion. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 7 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? The Government considers the status quo is inefficient. Current tax policy settings, based on comments from stakeholders and the conclusions reached by the Tax Working Group, act as a barrier to businesses committing to expenditure on developing assets when uncertainty exists as to whether that asset would be completed. In the absence of regulatory change, the current state requires taxpayers and Inland Revenue to take decisions regarding the deductibility of expenses and the recognition of assets through to disputes and the Courts. Regulatory intervention therefore seeks to remove, or substantially reduce, these interpretative transaction costs. The next question is, which option for reform is preferable. Option 3 was initially developed in response to stakeholder concerns following the Trustpowerdecision and was the subject of the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. Option 3 proposed that financial reporting should be used by businesses to determine the deductibility of expenditure or if it should be capitalised. Responses to option 3 suggested that it would not be a complete solution and could be expensive for taxpayers, who are not required to use financial reporting standards, to apply. Stakeholders also noted that the tax treatment of abandoned incomplete assets was unsatisfactorily unanswered if financial reporting standards were applied. Further consideration of option 3 by officials identified a concern that immediate tax deductibility could incentivise decisions to abandon incomplete assets earlier than otherwise occur (in the absence of tax). Option 2 is a response to the concerns stakeholders voiced regarding the application and effect of option 3. Option 2 is preferred as it better meets the assessment criteria in section 3.1. Allowing deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, including abandoned incomplete assets, improves neutrality as businesses no longer face tax barriers depending on whether the results of that expenditure are successful or not. Relative to the other options, option 2 should have a lower compliance and administration impacts. This comment is subject to final decisions about the legislative design of the proposal. Further consultation will be carried out on the practical application of Option 2, if Cabinet decides to proceed. The details of when reinstatement of previously deducted expenditure is required has yet to be tested with stakeholders. It is, however, necessary to ensure the integrity of the proposal and the wider tax system. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. A summary of our analysis of the options is set out in the table on page 10.

The intent of the preferred option is to remove barriers to firms carrying out expenditure on developing new assets, business processes and other investments where the result of that expenditure is uncertain and could result in abandonment or impairment of the investment. This type of investment is important to innovation and driving productivity improvements. As such, the preferred option is expected to produce wider benefits to the business community. The final design of the preferred option has not been the subject of full consultation with stakeholders. This consultation is expected to occur in the next few months following the outcome of Cabinet’s decision. To ensure the integrity of the proposal, the consequences of any reinstatement of expenditure have not been fully explored and this may involve trade-offs regarding how simple option 2 operates in practice. Officials have made certain assumptions regarding taxpayer behaviour in response to the proposal, those assumptions have inherent uncertainties, including:  Whether the proposal may incentivise taxpayers to commit to completing uneconomic assets to reduce tax payments (raising tax-base integrity risks); and  Whether this proposal, in conjunction with earlier policy responses outlined in section 2.3, causes introduces more complexity in taxpayer decision-making and associated tax compliance costs. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 11 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Following the Trustpowerdecision, the private sector, being corporate taxpayers and their advisors, approached the government seeking a revision of the tax policy settings for expenditure on projects that was more in line with business norms and prevailing practices. Officials undertook preliminary targeted consultation to define the parameters of the problem and consider initial solutions. The outcome from this consultation was the development of a proposal that was released in May 2017 for wider public comment in the government discussion document Black hole and feasibility expenditure. 23 submissions were received that largely supported the policy direction but had concerns regarding the complexity of the proposal and its practical application. In October 2017, a second round of consultation was held on a revised proposal with key stakeholders. Of the ten responses received, feedback was generally supportive of the revised approach but concerns were again expressed over the complexity of the proposal. Submitters were also concerned that the revised proposal created gaps which could still give rise to non-deductibility of feasibility expenditure. The preferred option in this RIA simplifies the rule and introduces a trade-off that deductions are spread over five years rather than immediately unless the qualifying expenditure is $10,000 or less in a tax year. Stakeholders have informed officials that the most important issue is the expenditure being deductible; not necessarily the timing of that deduction. Consultation with stakeholders initially focused on a framework (option 3) that would allow businesses upfront tax deductions for expenditure incurred in developing assets, that if completed would decline in value, at the point when a decision was made to completely abandon progress on that incomplete asset. Immediate tax deductions would also be allowed for feasibility expenditure by reference to accounting principles, with an overlay of tax principles for tax base integrity purposes. Submissions on the practicality of option 3 noted that the proposed deductibility test for feasibility expenditure was too complex. Submissions also noted that partial write down of assets needed to be recognised for tax purposes. Submitters noted that accounting standards imposed tight requirements on when assets should be written off and specific tax rules were recommended to provide for such impairments. Submitters also recommended a safe-harbour threshold that would allow small- to-medium sized businesses immediate tax deductions for low-levels of exploratory expenditure on new assets. Submitters noted that for businesses considering developing new assets, the requirement to use financial reporting standards could be an impediment if the business was not required to use New Zealand International Financial Reporting Standards, which also have a compliance cost attached to their use and application. Officials revised the parameters of option 3 in response to submissions and undertook a second round of consultation with key stakeholders. The revised proposal relaxed the basis on which tax deductions could be claimed on partially impaired assets and suggested the tests for deductibility would be based on Inland Revenue’s revised interpretation statement. Submitters were supportive of the revision but again noted the degree of complexity with the proposal (as it was a blend of accounting and tax concepts). Concerns were also expressed that the integrity measures that supported option 3 would lead to gaps with its application. Option 3, without appropriate safeguards could, by allowing immediate tax deductions raise Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 12 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 integrity risks around activities being claimed to be ceased while they were still intended to be progressed in order to access the tax deduction. This option is an improvement over the status quo, but less than option two. There is a risk that if the proposal is not well targeted the change may incentivise taxpayers deferring the recognition of asset (so as to continue incurring feasibility expenses) or encourage the early abandonment of projects and proposals. In response to the concerns identified by submitters on option 3, officials considered that option 2 could provide a more complete response to submitter concerns. However, there is a trade-off. While option 2 is intended to deal with the gaps and problems identified in option 3, the deduction allowed under the option is spread over a specified period. As the requirement to track and record expenditure can create compliance costs, a safe harbour threshold is still required to ensure option 2 does not unreasonably disincentivise small-to-medium sized businesses. Consultation on the final design of option 2 has not occurred and is subject to Cabinet decision-making. Subject to Cabinet decisions, Inland Revenue will discuss the practical application of option 2 with stakeholders. Another round of consultation will also available as part of Parliament’s consideration of any legislative amendment through the Parliamentary select committee process. Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 13 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The preferred option would require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be introduced in the next available tax omnibus bill planned for early 2020. Legislation implementing the preferred option is expected to have effect for new expenditure incurred from the start of the 2020-21 income year (for most firms this is 1 April 2020) even if the feasibility project itself had started in previous years. It is not intended that these rules would apply to expenditure incurred before that date as these periods have already occurred so the change in tax treatment would not be able to impact on business investment decisions. These proposals would be favourable to affected taxpayers and would be enacted before taxpayers would typically file tax returns for the relevant periods. When the bill is introduced into Parliament, a Commentary on the bill will be concurrently released explaining the amendments. Further explanation about their effect will be contained in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletinseries, which would be released shortly after the bill receives Royal assent. Inland Revenue would administer the proposed legislative changes. Enforcement of the changes would be managed by Inland Revenue as business as usual. Inland Revenue has assessed the magnitude of the administrative impacts and considers that the proposed approach can be implemented and made effective for qualifying expenditure incurred anytime from the start of the 2020-21 income year. No changes to Inland Revenue systems are expected as a result of implementing the proposals. Taxpayers would be expected to use existing schedules and internal record- keeping processes to capture information to support tax positions that involve tax deductions relating to developing new assets, or when decisions are made to impair and abandon incomplete assets (that would otherwise decline in value if completed). Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? There are no plans to specifically collect data on the proposal as, of itself, expenditure on developing new assets is a general business activity that would be incorporated and aggregated within existing business tax disclosures and tax returns. The existing record- keeping rules in the Tax Administration Act 1994 would apply to deductions allowed under the proposal. Monitoring of the proposed approach will be done through existing relationships Inland Revenue has with relevant stakeholders and their advisors. Following enactment of the proposal, any issues with the new law identified by tax practitioners and taxpayers would be considered for inclusion for remedial change as part of the stewardship programme on the Government’s tax policy work programme. Comments from stakeholders and their advisors will inform officials if the proposal is not working as intended or creating unintended outcomes. Inland Revenue’s enforcement of the relevant rules (referred to in section 6.1) would also Impact Summary: Feasibility and other non-deductible expenditure for incomplete assets | 14 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 09:50:28 inform officials if the risks noted in section 4.2 are material, or raise concerns regarding the integrity of the tax system. Inland Revenue would monitor the outcomes as per the objectives of the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) to confirm that the proposed approach meets its objectives. The GTPP is a multi-stage policy process that has been used to design tax policy in New Zealand since 1995. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? If the Government adopts option 2, officials propose to engage with key stakeholders 18 months after the proposal’s enactment and receive feedback regarding the effectiveness of the proposal (if feedback is not received earlier) for the period 2020-21. The Government’s tax policy work programme makes provision for work required to deal with remedial matters where tax legislation is not achieving its policy intent. Remedial work is informed from a variety of sources external and internal to Inland Revenue. Any concerns identified by stakeholders about the proposed approach discussed in this RIA would be considered for priority as part of the remedial items component of the tax policy work programme. If the concerns with the proposal are more substantive, consideration would be given to prioritising the matter on the tax policy work programme.

In Confidence Office of the Minister Revenue Chair, Cabinet Economic Development Committee INCOME TAX TREATMENT OF LEASES SUBJECT TO NZ IFRS 16 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Economic Development Committee’s agreement to allow taxpayers who follow International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) to choose to follow their accounting treatment, with certain adjustments, for calculating tax deductions for expenditure under operating leases other than real property. 1 2.Cabinet approval is sought as this is a policy change to the timing of lease deductions which will potentially affect all IFRS taxpayers and has a $9 million fiscal cost over 5 years. Executive Summary 3.Taxpayers who have IFRS reporting obligations 2 are required to follow the new accounting standard New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16) for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. 4.IFRS 16 changes the timing of accounting expenditure for lessees (the person with us e of the asset) compared to the previous treatment; but total deductions are unchanged over the life of the lease. I propose that lessees who follow IFRS should be able to elect to follow, subject to certain adjustments, their IFRS 16 treatment when calculating income tax deductions on operating leases other than real property. 5.Allowing these taxpayers to follow their IFRS 16 treatment will more closely align the ta x treatment with other methods of acquiring assets such as a finance lease or a debt funded outright purchase. It will also reduce compliance costs, and the possibility of inadvertent errors, from having to back out accounting expenditure and calculate a separate tax deduction. Background 6.A lease involves one person (known as the lessor) who owns (or otherwise holds) an ass et providing it to another person (known as the lessee) to use in exchange for payment over the term of the lease. For entities with IFRS reporting obligations, the accounting treatment was previously determined under New Zealand Equivalent to 1 Real property is a commonly used term that essentally relates to land and buildings. 2 The requirement to prepare accounts under IFRS varies but the most common is having total assets in excess of $60 million or total revenue in excess of $30 million. In 2017 the External Reportng Board (XRB) identfed 2,575 enttes with IFRS reportng obligatons based on 2015 data. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 15:28:55 IN CONFIDENCE 1. International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17). This standard has been replaced by IFRS 16 for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. Accounting treatment under NZ IAS 17 7. Under NZ IAS 17, there was a difference in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. NZ IAS 17 defined the distinction as follows: A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. 8. For example, a lease would be a finance lease if the lessee leased the asset for the majority of its estimated useful life then had the right to purchase it from the lessor for a fixed price at the end of the lease. In contrast, a lease would be an operating lease if the lessee only leased the asset for a short portion of the estimated useful life then at the end of the lease it was returned to the lessor to lease or sell to someone else. Current tax treatment 9. The Income Tax Act 2007 contains two separate sets of rules for finance and operating leases. These definitions are similar, but not identical to, the NZ IAS 17 definition. The largest difference is that all leases of real property are operating leases for tax purposes. For finance leases, the lease payments are taxed under the financial arrangements rules and are treated like the repayment of a loan with interest. For operating leases, the lease payments are currently spread equally over the life of the lease. This treatment is similar to the NZ IAS 17 accounting treatment which reduces the need for tax adjustments. Accounting changes moving from NZ IAS 17 to IFRS 16 10. For lessees, IFRS 16 removes the distinction between operating and finance leases for accounting purposes. Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognise on their balance sheet a new asset, being the right to use the leased asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the obligation to pay rentals. 11. Under IFRS 16, there is usually a slight acceleration of deductions compared to accounting under NZ IAS 17. This can be shown in the following simplified example for a 5-year lease, that was an operating lease under NZ IAS 17, with $100,000 per year of lease payments and a 3.7237% discount rate: 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 15:28:55 IN CONFIDENCE Year NZIAS 17 Expense s IFRS 16 Expense s 1 100,000 106,439 2 100,000 103,337 3 100,000 100,120 4 100,000 96,783 5 100,000 93,322 Total 500,000 500,000 12. The NZ IAS 17 treatment matches the cashflows of the lease, whereas IFRS 16 more closely matches the economic cost of the lease. The IFRS 16 treatment can be thought of similar to a typical fixed-rate mortgage where total payments are consistent over time, but the interest expenditure is higher in earlier periods when the loan is higher, and the interest expenditure is lower (and therefore capital repayments are higher) near the end of the loan when the amount outstanding is lower. 13. IFRS 16 does not significantly change the accounting treatment of leases for the lessor. The lessor will continue to reflect the leased asset on their balance sheet for operating leases. This Cabinet paper does not consider changes to the tax treatment of lessors. Comment 14. The introduction of IFRS 16 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax and accounting treatment of lessees’ operating leases. I propose this be optional for all lessees that follow IFRS 16. This will achieve two main objectives: 14.1. Efficiency - As finance leases and debt used to purchase assets are already taxed under the financial arrangements rules, deductions are accelerated similar to the IFRS 16 example above. Aligning the tax treatment of operating leases with the IFRS 16 treatment will make the tax treatment of all three methods of asset acquisition more similar which will reduce the tax incentive to choose one method over another to obtain a tax advantage. 14.2. Compliance costs - Unlike when entities followed NZ IAS 17, an entity following IFRS 16 will need to make tax adjustments to remove accounting deductions and claim tax deductions. By following IFRS 16 for tax the number of adjustments required can be reduced and therefore compliance costs will be lower as will be the possibility of inadvertent error. 15. This option will only be available to taxpayers who follow IFRS 16 for accounting purposes. The calculation of expenditure under IFRS 16 is sufficiently complex that I do not recommend allowing a non-IFRS taxpayer to undertake these calculations solely for tax purposes. Instead these taxpayers, and any IFRS taxpayer who chooses not to follow their account treatment for tax purposes, should continue to follow the existing method. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 15:28:55 IN CONFIDENCE Adjustments between accounting and tax 16. There are certain accounting entries required to be made under IFRS 16 that spread expenditure over the (remaining) term of the lease that should be recognised differently for tax purposes. This is because expenditure for tax purposes is typically deductible when it is incurred and allowing a deduction over the life of the lease would offer a more favourable tax treatment compared with taxpayers that do not follow IFRS 16 or have not elected to follow IFRS 16 for tax purposes. 17. The adjustments that should be made between the IFRS 16 and tax treatment are: 17.1. Impairment, fair value and revaluation costs – these are essentially a provision against future events and for tax purposes they should be deductible when (and if) they are incurred. 17.2. Make good costs – these are the costs of restoring an asset before it is returned to the lessor and for tax purposes should be deductible when they are incurred which is typically near or at the end of the lease. 17.3. Direct and mobilisation costs – these are the costs of entering into a lease and for tax purposes should be deducible when they are incurred which is typically at or near the start of a lease 3 . To minimise compliance costs this adjustment should be at the option of the taxpayer. 18. The exclusion of real property leases, which is discussed further below, should significantly reduce the number of adjustments that taxpayers are required to make. Leases that will be covered by the election 19. This election to follow the IFRS 16 treatment for tax purposes will apply only to operating leases, using the existing tax definition of operating lease. This definition achieves a similar outcome to the accounting definition, in paragraph above, with the largest difference being all leases of real property must be a tax operating lease. There are some exceptions to this, discussed below, where operating leases should continue to follow their existing treatment. Real property 20. The election to follow the IFRS 16 treatment for tax purposes should not apply to leases of real property and they should instead continue to follow their existing tax treatment. 21. There are several reasons for this including: 21.1. there is less efficiency benefit from this alignment as leases of real property cannot be a tax finance lease; and 3 Some direct costs are already incurred over the term of the lease. For these costs the IFRS 16 and tax treatment will already align so no further adjustment will be required. 4 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 15:28:55 IN CONFIDENCE 21.2. leases of real property typically have many more accounting features, as discussed at paragraph above, that would need to be adjusted for tax purposes. By excluding real property compliance costs will be much lower and the proportion of taxpayers choosing to follow their accounting treatment for tax purposes is expected to be higher. 22. Many businesses will have more non-real property leases than real property leases. However, real property leases are typically for longer terms and over higher value assets, so the total value of real property leases is expected to be far higher. Excluding real property significantly reduces the fiscal cost of the proposals. Leasing to associated persons and sub-leasing 23. When a taxpayer has an asset they lease to an associated party this would create a tax timing benefit to those two taxpayers when considered as a group if they could follow the IFRS 16 treatment for tax. 24. This timing benefit also arises when a taxpayer leases an asset from another person and then sub-leases that asset. 25. These issues arise as IFRS 16 applies a different method to spread income for lessors and expenses for lessees. 26. To prevent this mismatch, the existing tax treatment should continue to apply if: 26.1. a taxpayer leases an asset then sub-leases it to another person; or 26.2. a taxpayer leases an asset from an associated party. Equipment leases 27. Aside from real property, the other common high value assets subject to leases are large equipment such as aircraft. These are typically treated as tax finance leases so will not be affected by the recommendations in this paper. If high value equipment is leased under a tax operating lease by a taxpayer who has chosen to follow the IFRS 16 treatment for tax then they should also be able to follow the IFRS 16 treatment for that equipment. Further details 28. Once a taxpayer elects to follow IFRS 16 for tax they should be required to continue this treatment in all future periods except when they cease to follow IFRS 16 for accounting purposes. 29. A taxpayer electing to follow IFRS 16 for tax will typically incur a one off deduction arising from expenditure that was not deductible under NZ IAS 17 or the former tax treatment but would have been deductible if they have been able to follow IFRS 16 in earlier periods. To minimise the upfront impact on tax revenue I recommend this deduction be spread over five years. 30. When a taxpayer ends a lease or stops applying IFRS for accounting they should calculate a wash-up to ensure total tax deductions are the same as those incurred by 5 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 15:28:55 IN CONFIDENCE a taxpayer who is not following IFRS 16 for tax. When a lease ends after following its full intended term this wash-up will typically be zero. Consultation 31. Targeted consultation has been undertaken with affected taxpayers, representative bodies and their advisors. They are supportive of proposals to allow closer alignment of tax and accounting operating lease expenditure for lessees following IFRS. 32. The Treasury has been consulted and support the proposals. Financial Implications 33. The fiscal impact of the changes is a revenue loss of approximately $1.8 million per year for 5 years, with a corresponding impact on the operating balance: $m – increase/(decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Tax Revenue (1.800) (1.800) (1.800) (1.800) Total Operating (1.800) (1.800) (1.800) (1.800) 34. The cost of this proposal can be accounted for on the tax policy scorecard. 35. The current scorecard balance to the end of the 2022/23 fiscal year is $51.806 million. The implementation of this policy would reduce the cumulative scorecard balance to $44.606 million. There are currently no other upcoming items on the scorecard. 36. As expenditure by lessees will continue to be deductible, and these proposals only change the timing of those deductions, this proposal will have no direct effect on tax revenue after the five-year transition period ends in 2023/24. Legislative Implications 37. Implementing these proposals will require changes to the Income Tax Act 2007. I recommend that the necessary amendments are included in the next omnibus taxation bill scheduled for introduction in early-2020 with effect from the 2019-20 income year. Impact Analysis 38.

This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by or on behalf of Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis Officials do not hold operating lease payments data for all IFRS 1 taxpayers. Estimating the total amount of annual operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers was necessary to determine the fiscal cost of the proposals. We identified the population of IFRS taxpayers and extracted operating lease information on the approximately 43% (by value of income tax payable) of IFRS taxpayers where it was available. This was then used to estimate lease payments for the balance of the population on the assumption their lease payments would be in the same proportion to their income tax payable. This identified total operating lease payments for all IFRS taxpayers of approximately $2.5 billion per annum. Two other factors that influence the fiscal cost are the average lease term (higher cost for longer terms) and the interest rate (higher cost for higher rates). We could not identify data on average lease terms so estimated these for a variety of situations then checked their reasonableness with exte rnal stakeholders. The interest rate on leases will differ from lease to lease and taxpayer to taxpayer; whereas the forecasting model requires a single interest rate. We chose the NZ dollar BBB+ rated corporate 5-year fixed term interest rate on 20 June 2019 which was the date the calculation was performed. In costing the proposals we have assumed that lease payments will remain static over time. A more realistic assumption is that, due to inflation and economic growth, lease payments will slowly grow over time. If this was factored into the costing there would be a small ongoing cost to the proposals; however, this cos t would be very small so has been disregarded on a materiality basis. We h ave also assumed that, for the preferred option, all eligible taxpayers will elect to follow their accounting treatment for eligible leases. This is the most conservative assumption, but we expect the proportion will be very high. We have not attempted to estimate the exact percentage expected to elect. 1 In ternational Financial Reporting Standards – The requirement to prepare accounts under IFRS varies but the most common is having total assets in excess of $60 million or total revenue in excess of $30 million. In 2017 the External Reporting Board (XRB) identified 2,575 entities with IFRS reporting obligations based on 2015 data. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 2.

Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Inland Revenue Quality Assurance Assessment: The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 RIA and considers that the information and analysis summarised in it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: Comments from the review of earlier versions of this RIA have been incorporated into this version.

A lease involves one person (known as the lessor) who owns (or otherwise holds) an asset providing it to another person (known as the lessee) to use in exchange for payment over the term of the lease. For entities with IFRS 2 reporting obligations, the accounting treatment was previously determined under New Zealand Equivalent to International Accounting Standard 17 Leases (NZ IAS 17). This standard has been replaced by New Zealand Equivalent to International Financial Reporting Standard 16 Leases (NZ IFRS 16 or IFRS 16) for years starting on or after 1 January 2019. 3 Accounting treatment under NZ IAS 17 Under NZ IAS 17, there was a difference in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. NZ IAS 17 defines the distinction as follows: A lease is classified as a finance lease if it transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. A lease is classified as an operating lease if it does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership. For example, a lease would be classified as a finance lease if the lessee leased the asset for the majority of its estimated useful life then had the right to purchase it from the lessor for a fixed price at the end of the lease. In contrast, a lease would be classified as an operating lease if the lessee only leased the asset for a short portion of the estimated useful life then at the end of the lease it was returned to the lessor to lease or sell to someone else. Current tax treatment The Income Tax Act 2007 contains two separate sets of rules for finance and operating leases. These definitions are similar but not identical to the NZ IAS 17 definition. The largest difference is that all leases of real property 4 are operating leases for tax purposes. For finance leases, the lease payments are taxed under the financial arrangements rules and are treated like the repayment of a loan with interest. For operating leases, the lease payments are currently spread equally over the life of the lease. This treatment is similar to the NZ IAS 17 accounting treatment which reduces the need for tax adjustments. No changes to the tax treatment of tax finance leases are considered in this RIA. Accounting changes moving from NZ IAS 17 to IFRS 16 For lessees, IFRS 16 removes the distinction between operating and finance leases for accounting purposes. Under IFRS 16, lessees are required to recognise on their balance sheet a new asset, being the right to use the leased asset for the lease term, and a lease liability representing the obligation to pay rentals. 2 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 3 IFRS 16 can also be applied for earlier periods for entities that choose to do so and meet certain other criteria. 4 Real property is not specifically defined but generally relates to land and buildings. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE This RIA does not attempt to explain how accounting expenditure is calculated under IFRS 16; however, there is usually a slight acceleration of deductions compared to accounting under NZ IAS 17. This can be shown in the following si mplified example for a 5-year lease, that was an operating lease under NZ IAS 17, with $100,000 per year of lease payments and a 3.7237% 5 discount rate: Year NZ IAS 17 Expenses IFRS 16 Expenses 1 100,000 106,439 2 100,000 103,337 3 100,000 100,120 4 100,000 96,783 5 100,000 93,322 Total 500,000 500,000 The NZ IAS 17 treatment matches the cashflows of the lease, whereas IFRS 16 more closely matches the economic cost of the lease. The IFRS 16 treatment can be thought of similar to a typical fixed-rate mortgage where total payments are consistent over time, but the interest expenditure is higher in earlier periods when the loan is higher, and the interest expenditure is lower (and therefore capital repayments are higher) near the end of the loan when the amount outstanding is lower. Capital repayments are not deductible; however, for an IFRS 16 operating lease, the capital has been applied to acquire the right to use the asset which is deductible as depreciation over the term of the lease. IFRS 16 does not significantly change the accounting treatment of leases for the lessor. The lessor will continue to reflect the leased asset on their balance sheet for operating leases. This RIA does not consider changes to the tax treatment of the lessor. Policy opportunity The introduction of IFRS 16 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of lessees’ operating leases with the new accounting treatment. This has two main objectives: • Efficiency - As finance leases and debt used to purchase assets is already taxed under the financial arrangements rules deductions are accelerated similar to the IFRS 16 example above. Aligning the tax treatment of operating leases with the IFRS 16 treatment will make the tax treatment of all three methods of asset acquisition more similar which will reduce the tax incentive to choose one method over another to obtain a tax advantage. • Compliance costs - Unlike when entities followed NZ IAS 17, an entity following IFRS 16 will need to make tax adjustments to remove accounting deductions and claim tax deductions. By following IFRS 16 for tax the number of adjustments required could be reduced and therefore compliance costs would be lower as would be the possibility of inadvertent error. 5 This is the same rate used to forecast the fiscal impact of the proposals as discussed in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section of this RIA. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE Timing cost As shown in the example above, total deduct ions under both NZ IAS 17 and IFRS 16 are identical; however, when broken down they are slightly higher in earlier years and slightly lower in later years under IFRS 16. Accelerating the timing of deductions in this way results in a permanent fi scal cost to the Crown. The appendix to this RIA provides an example to explain how this cost arises. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Businesses seeking to acquire an asset have a choice of financing structures including outright purchase (often funded by borrowing), finance leases and operating leases. IFRS 16 6 provides an opportunity to more closely align the tax treatment of operating leases with how finance leases and debt funded asset purchases are treated. This will reduce the tax incentive for businesses to acquire assets under a particular str ucture due to their different tax treatment. More closely aligning tax and accounting treatments also reduces the compliance costs of having to make tax adjustments and reduces the chances that these adju stments will inadvertently be made incorrectly. All IFRS taxpayers consulted supported alignment of tax with accounting for these reasons, provided it was on an optional basis. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? There is a distinction in the tax treatment between operating and finance leases and there was previously a (slightly different) distinction in the accounting treatment between operating and finance leases. The adoption of IFRS 16 has removed this distinction for accounting purposes. Officials consider the tax distinction between operating and finance leases is well understood and working as intended so removing or amending this boundary has not been considered. Instead, the project has been limited to changes aimed at simplifying the tax treatment of leases that would have previously been, and will continue to be, classified as operating leases for tax. While there are undoubtedly benefits of aligning tax with IFRS 16 for affected taxpayers, early discussions with stakeholders identified that taxpayers wanted alignment to be optional rather than compulsory. As this project is intended to be a taxpayer favourable simplification all of the options in this RIA are for optional alignment rather than applying t o all IFRS taxpayers. While this will marginally reduce efficiency, officials do not expect this to be material, especially given the small number of IFRS taxpayers expected not to elect. 6 Refer to footnote 1 for an explanation of who is required to follow IFRS 16. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE While allowing non-IFRS taxpayers to follow an IFRS 16-type treatment for tax would also offer efficiency benefits, officials have not considered extending this treatment to non-IFRS taxpayers. This is because IFRS 16 calculations are relatively complicated a nd are not required for accounting purposes for non-IFRS taxpayers so requiring or allowing them for tax would require complex calculations s olely for tax purposes. This would have a high compliance cost that would outweigh any efficiency benefit available. Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? The following criteria were used to assess the options considered: • Efficiency: the option should align with the economic substance and the accounting treatment of tax operating leases as much as possible. • Sustainability: the option should follow existing income tax deductibility principles and should not offer a more favourable treatment compared with that available to non- IFRS taxpayers. • Compliance costs: the compliance cost should be minimised as far as possible. Option 1: Status quo This option would retain the existing cashflow treatment of operating leases for lessees who are IFRS taxpayers. Once IFRS taxpayers adopted IFRS 16 they would be required to make tax adjustments to reverse accounting expenses and claim deductions consistent with the current treatment. This would not provide any of the benefits of alignment. Compliance costs may (depending on specific decisions and taxpayer circumstances) be lower than under some variants of option 3 but would be higher than under option 2 or option 4. Option 2: Full alignment This option would allow lessees to claim tax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases. This would provide the highest level of efficiency, and compliance cost savings, as it would fully align tax and accounting. However, it would not be sustainable – it would offer a signifi cant more favourable treatment that that available to non-IFRS taxpayers and would have a significant fiscal cost (estimated at approximately $400 million 7 ). 7 As with the cost estimates for Option 3 and Option 4 th is cost is the total cost of this option over all time periods. The time period is dependent on the transitional period chosen which has agreed to be 5 years. Changing the transitional period changes the period the cost arises over but doesn’t change the total cost. There are no costs beyond this transitional period. Refer to the appendix of this RIA for a more detailed explanation. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 7 IN CONFIDENCE Option 3: Full alignment with adjustments This option would allow lessees to mostly claim tax deductions equal to their accounting expenditure under tax operating leases but would require them to make adjustments to recognise the tax principle that tax deductions should (generally) be available only when expenditure is incurred. This is in contrast to a number of items included in IFRS 16 lease expenditure, such as fair value impairments 8 – which are closer to a provision and provisions are not usually deductible – and make good costs 9 – which are spread over the (remaining) term of the lease rather than when the expenditure is incurred. This would have similar, or slightly lower, sustainability than option 4. However, it would have a fiscal cost of approximately $89 million assuming all IFRS taxpayers elected to align tax and accounting. It would significantly increase compliance costs as the calculation of adjustments would be complex and would have to be regularly updated. This increase in compliance costs would likely result in many taxpayers choosing not to align tax and accounting as the compliance costs could outweigh the benefits. If the proportion of taxpayers choosing to align tax and accounting was similar to option 4 then this option would have higher efficiency (due to the coverage of more leases); however, due to the increased compliance costs its likely less taxpayers would choose to align resulting in lower efficiency than option 4. Option 4: Partial alignment with adjustments This option is the same as option 3 except it would exclude operating leases for real property which would continue to be deductible under the current tax treatment. Real property is a term within the leasing rules and takes its ordinary legal meaning. It can be thought of as land and buildings. A lease of real property cannot be a finance lease for tax purposes even when the terms of the lease would otherwise make it so. Many businesses will have more non-real property leases than real property leases. However, real property leases are typically for longer terms and over higher value assets, so the total value of real property leases is expected to be far higher. This option does not capture the full efficiency benefits due to its narrower scope of covered leases so is worse than option 2 based on this cri terion but still higher than option 1 (which does not align at all) and option 3 (due to the expected low take-up of the optional alignment). This option has significantly lower compliance costs than option 3 as most of the adjustments that would be required under option 3 would not frequently arise in non-real property leases (for example, businesses often must restore a commercial building at or before the end of the lease whereas they don’t have to do this with a vehicle lease). It is the most sustainable as it is not significantly more favourable compared with the treatment by non-IFRS taxpayers and also has the lowest cost (approximately $9 million) of any option other than the status quo. 8 Fair value impairments are recorded as an accounting expense when the value of the asset to the business is less than that recognised in the accounts. For example, when a business is contracted to keep making lease payments on a building but no longer wants to operate from that site. 9 Make good costs are the estimated costs of restoring an asset before it can be returned to the lessor. For example, rem oving fitout from a building. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Option 4 is the preferred option. It will align tax and accounting for the greatest number of leases given the constraints of not creating a significantly more favourable set of rules for IFRS taxpayers that is not available to other businesses. This option will minimise compliance costs to the extent possible as it is expected that a high proportion of eligible taxpayers will elect to follow it. We have not attempted to estimate what proportion would choose to align tax and accounting but as the rules will reduce compliance costs and marginally bring forward deductions there will be few reasons not to elect to align. The forecasts conservatively assume that 100% of eligible taxpayers will elect to do so. There are no areas of incompatibility with the Government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’.

Non-monetised costs Ongoing monitori ng of tax adjustments Low 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 9 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? None identified. Section 5: Stakeholder views 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Officials undertook targeted consultation with large corporates who enter into operating leases, their advisors, and relevant representative groups. Stakeholders were supportive of the simplification benefits of more closely aligning tax and accounting for operating leases for IFRS taxpayers provided this was on an optional basis (as the preferred option does and as discussed in section 2.3 above). Stakeholders generally sought a full alignment with few, and preferably no, adjustments from the accounting position on the basis this would minimise compliance costs. For the reasons 10 This cost is permanent to the Crown as it considers the economy as a whole where new leases are always entered into (refer to the appendix of this RIA for more explanation). In contrast, taxpayers enter individual leases where the benefit is only the slight acceleration of deductions but the same total deductions over the life of the lease, so this has only a timing benefit. Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Lessees who follow IFRS and elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax Removal of need to adjust between accounting and tax deductions Timing benefit from deductions being brought forward so tax will be paid slightly lat er 10 Reduction in tax incentive to enter into different acquisition structures Medium Medium Medium Inland Revenue Reduction in monitoring of tax adjustments for operati ng leases Low – some adjustments will still be required but the number of adjustments will be significantly reduced. Total Monetised Benefit None N/A Non-monetised benefits Marginal acceleration of lease deductions Reduction in compliance costs for lessees to comply with tax obligations and reduction in administration costs for Inland Revenue reviewing this treatment. Figure unable to be quantified on an individual lesse e basis Medium 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 10 IN CONFIDENCE set out above we do not recommend a full alignment. However, the exclusion of real property leases is likely to significantly reduce the number of adjustments that will be required. There have been varying degrees of support from individual stakeholders on the decision to exclude real property. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 11 IN CONFIDENCE Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals will require amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 which could be included in the next available tax omnibus bill expected to be introduced in early 2020. This bill is unlikely to be enacted before late 2020 or early 2021 which is after the application date of IFRS 16 – on or after 1 January 2019. For the earliest possible balance date that IFRS 16 would apply to, of 31 December, the first tax year following IFRS 16 will end on 31 December 2019. This is the 2019/20 tax year and the relevant return will be due to be filed by 31 March 2021 for taxpayers with an extension of time for filing their returns. Therefore, in most instances, affected taxpayers will have started their first-year accounting under IFRS 16 before the enactment of the bill containing the proposals but will not file a tax return until shortly after the enactment of that bill. For a taxpayer who chooses not to elect to align tax and accounting in the 2019/20 year, they should be able to elect to do so in any subsequent year. But all taxpayers, once they elect to align tax and accounting treatment, should be required to do so in all future years where they follow IFRS for accounting purposes. When a taxpayer chooses to elect to follow the accounting treatment for tax purposes this will usually result in a one-off deduction (arising from deductions that would have been available had the taxpayer been able to follow IFRS 16 in previous periods but were not available under the previous treatment). In order to manage the fiscal cost of this transition to the Crown, we suggest this deduction is spread over the year of adoption and the following four years. Consulted stakeholders have been supportive of this approach. Inland Revenue will release details of the Cabinet decision once it is made and further detail will be provided in a commentary released when the Bill is introduced and will also be included in the Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Inl and Revenue will be responsible for the ongoing monitoring and enforcement of the rules. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 12 IN CONFIDENCE Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? No specific data collection or monitoring is expected. Inland Revenue maintains a close relationship with many of the small number of affected large taxpayers and has a specific contact for IFRS issues. Any issues with the proposals or their post enactment implementation are expected to be identified through these channels or through contact with Policy staff. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? • How will the arrangements be reviewed? How often will this happen and by whom will it be done? If there are no plans for review, state so and explain why. • What sort of results (that may become apparent from the monitoring or feedback) might prompt an earlier review of this legislation? • What opportunities will stakeholders have to raise concerns? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislati on, and the identification of remedial issues. A post implementation review could occur around 12 months after implementation. Any recommended changes identified from the review would be considered for potential inclusion on the Government's tax policy work programme. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 Impact Summary: Income tax treatment of leases subject to NZ IFRS 16 | 13 IN CONFIDENCE Appendix: Timing cost example As referred to in section 2.1, this example explains how a permanent reduction in tax revenue arises from the acceleration of lease deductions even where total deductions for each lease are unchanged. Assume, each year a three-year lease is entered into with $100 of deductions each year. The total deductions will be $300 each year as follows: Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 100 100 100 Lease 5 100 100 100 Lease 6 100 100 Lease 7 100 Total 300 300 300 300 300 Instead, assume the timing of deductions is changed to $105, $100 and $95 for all leases starting from lease 4. Year 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Lease 1 100 100 100 Lease 2 100 100 100 Lease 3 100 100 100 Lease 4 105 100 95 Lease 5 105 100 95 Lease 6 105 100 Lease 7 105 Total 300 305 305 300 300 This shows that annual deductions start at $300 and return to $300 in year 6 onwards but in years 4 and 5 increase to $305. This $5 increase in deductions, if taxable at 28%, would permanently decrease tax revenue by $1.40 for both year 4 and year 5. If, in a future year, leases were no longer entered into this cost would reverse as there would be less deductions available. However, on an economy wide basis it is reasonable to assume that leases will continue to be entered into so this cost should be treated as permanent. Detail decisions such as whether to apply to existing leases or to spread a transitional adjustment over multiple years will affect the year the fiscal cost arises in but will not alter the total cost of the decisions in this RIA. Due to inflation and economic growth it would be more accurate to assume a small increase in lease payments each year rather than this example’s static lease payments. The consequence of such an assumption would be to create a small ongoing cost from an acceleration of lease deductions. However, this effect is not expected to be significant so has been omitted from the analysis. 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-18 11:48:01 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0299 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

Officials have concluded negotiations for protocols to amend New Zealand’s existing double tax agreement (DTA) with Switzerland, which was signed in 1980, and existing tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with Guernsey, which was signed in 2009. 2. The protocols relate to the inclusion of model treaty provisions in the parent agreements arising out of the international Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the G20. The OECD/G20 15-point BEPS Action Plan is designed to address international concerns that multinationals often seem to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. 3. This report asks you to approve and lodge the attached Cabinet paper with the Cabinet External Relat ions and Security Committee for its meeting on Tuesday 25 June 2019. The Cabinet paper and enclosed attachments need to be lodged with Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 20 June 2019. 4. The Cabinet paper notes the conclusio n of negotiations for an amending protocol to the DTA with Switzerland, and an amending protocol to the TIEA with Guernsey. Copies of the full text of the amending protocols are enclosed. Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan 5. The BEPS Action Plan included several work streams that looked into the ways that multinational enterprises have misused tax treaties. These work streams resulted in the development of model treaty provisions to be included in future and existing tax treaties. Many of these provisions are referred to as “minimum standards”, and their inclusion will be monitored by an international peer review process.

To facilitate the inclusion of these model treaty provisions in existing DTAs, Action 15 of the BEPS Action Plan focused on the development of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Multilateral Instrument or MLI), which New Zealand signed in 2017 and ratified in 2018. 7. A few of New Zealand’s DTAs will not be amended by the MLI, and tax treaties that are not full DTAs are outside the scope of the MLI. Where this is the case, bilateral negotiations will need to be undertaken in order to meet the appropriate minimum standards. The protocols with Switzerland and Guernsey have been negotiated for this purpose. 8. The provisions in the amending protocols relate to the inclusion of the BEPS minimum standards and to best practice. The provisions are primarily intended to protect the tax base of each treaty partner by reducing the ability of non-residents to use the treaty to engage in tax- avoidance behaviour. The provisions are also intended to improve existing dispute- resolut io n mechanisms to make them more effective for taxpayers and reduce uncertainty. 9. The features of the two amending protocols are discussed in detail in the appendix to the Cabinet paper and the accompanying draft national interest analysis (NIA) prepared in respect of each protocol. Next steps 10. The Cabinet paper recommends that Cabinet authorise the signing of the two amending protocols with Switzerland and Guernsey, and requests authorisation for the protocols to be submitted for Parliamentary treaty examination, under Standing Orders 397-400 of the House of Representatives, as the next step towards entry into force. This process requires each amending protocol, with its acco mpanying NIA, to be tabled in the House of Representatives and referred to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee. The NIAs are enclosed as attachments to the Cabinet paper. 11. Subject to the successful completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination process, the Cabinet paper also seeks approval for the drafting of Orders in Council to give effect to each amending protocol, submission of the Orders in Council to Cabinet, and the subsequent exchange of diplomatic notes to bring the amending protocols into force. 12. The Cabinet Manual requires Cabinet approval for any treaty action to be sought by the relevant Minister of the department with the main policy interest in the treaty either jointly, or in consultation with the Minister of Foreign Affairs for consultation. Once the agreement of the Minister of Foreign Affairs is obtained, we recommend that the paper, along with the full text of the amending protocols and the NIAs, is referred to the Cabinet Office before 10am on Thursday 20 June 2019. 13. You will need to decide who will sign each of the amending protocols on New Zealand’s behalf. Recent New Zealand DTAs have been signed at both Ministerial and Ambassadorial levels. For example, the Hong Kong DTA (2010) was signed by the Minister of Finance; the Japan DTA (2012) was signed by the New Zealand Ambassador to Japan; the Canada DTA (2012, and 2014 for an amending protocol) was signed by the Minister of Revenue; and the Samoa DTA (2015) was signed by the Prime Minister. Sensitive IR2019/258: Cabinet Paper: Amending Protocol to Tax Treaties with Switzerland and Guernsey: Approval for Signature Page 3 SENSITIVE 14. If the chosen signatory is a person other than the Prime Minister, the Governor General, or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, an Instrument of Full Powers will need to be obtained to allow them to sign the amending protocols. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade will prepare this Instrument and arrange for its signature. 15. Although there are no concrete signing opportunities at present, our Swiss counterparts have asked for the amending protocol with Switzerland to be signed in Wellington in late July 2019. This will enable the amending protocol to enter into force in 2020. The person signing on behalf of Switzerland would be the Swiss Ambassador to New Zealand. 16. As Guernsey is a dependency of the British Crown, one possibility would be for the New Zealand High Commissioner to the United Kingdom to sign the amending protocol in London. Alternatively, a Minister could sign the protocol, if any visits are planned in the foreseeable future. 17. We will liaise with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade to arrange appropriate signing opportunities. Consultation 18. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, were consulted during the preparation of the attached Cabinet paper and NIAs. These agencies agree with the recommendations. Proactive release considerations 19. Officials recommend that the proactive release of the attached Cabinet paper should be delayed unt il the appropriate signatures have been obtained, and our tax counterparts in Switzerland and Guernsey have agreed to the release. The release will be subject to redaction as appropriate under the Official Information Act 1982.

Executive Summary 2.Officials have concluded negotiations for protocols to amend New Zealand’s existing do uble tax agreement (DTA) with Switzerland, which was signed in 1980, and existing tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with Guernsey, which was signed in 2009. The protocols relate to the inclusion of model treaty provisions in the parent agreements arising out of the international Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20. The BEPS initiative consisted of a 15-point Action Plan, designed to address international concerns that multinationals often seem to pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. Several items on the BEPS Action Plan resulted in the development of model treaty provisions to be included in future and existing tax treaties – in particular, anti-abuse provisions, arising from Action 6 (Preventing the Granting of Treaty Benefits in Inappropriate Circumstances), and provisions to improve treaty dispute resolution mechanisms, arising from Action 14 (Making Dispute Resolution Mechanisms More Effective). Many of these provisions are referred to as “minimum standards”, and their adoption will be monitored by an international peer review process. 3.To facilitate the inclusion of these model treaty provisions in existing DTAs, Action 15 of the BEPS Action Plan focused on the development of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Multilateral Instrument, or MLI), which New Zealand signed in 2017 and ratified in 2018. 4.A few of New Zealand’s DTAs will not be amended by the MLI, and tax treaties that are not full DTAs are outside the scope of the MLI. Where this is the case, bilateral negotiations will need to be undertaken in order to meet the appropriate minimum 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE 2. standards. The protocols with Switzerland and Guernsey have been negotiated for this purpose. 5. This paper seeks Cabinet’s approval for the two protocols to be signed. The full text of each protocol is appended to this paper as Annexes I and II. This paper also seeks approval of an extended national interest analysis (NIA) prepared for each agreement. The extended NIAs will help guide Cabinet consideration and, after signing, will also be present in the House when the protocols are submitted for parliamentary treaty examination. The extended NIAs are attached as Annexes III and IV. 6. After treaty examination, each protocol will be given the force of law in New Zealand by Order in Council, made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This paper seeks Cabinet approval for me to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the respective Orders in Council. Finally, this paper seeks approval for officials to bring the protocols into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes with Switzerland and Guernsey. Comment 7. This paper submits, for Cabinet’s consideration, two recently concluded protocols and an extended national interest analysis (NIA) for each. This paper seeks approval for the protocols to be signed, and approval for the next steps for entry into force. The two protocols are: 7.1 the Protocol Amending the Convention between New Zealand and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (“Amending Protocol with Switzerland”); and 7.2 theProtocol Amending the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the States of Guernsey for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals (“Amending Protocol with Guernsey”). 8. The full text of the Amending Protocol with Switzerland is appended to this paper as Annex I. The full text of the Amending Protocol with Guernsey is appended as Annex II. The accompanying extended NIAs are appended, respectively, as Annexes III and IV. 9. The protocols have both been negotiated as part of New Zealand’s programme of updating existing tax agreements to include model treaty provisions arising out of the recent international work on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS). The Amending Protocol with Switzerland amends New Zealand’s 1980 double tax agreement (DTA) with Switzerland (the Swiss DTA). The Amending Protocol with Guernsey amends New Zealand’s 2009 tax information exchange agreement (TIEA) with Guernsey (the Guernsey TIEA). 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE Tax treaty background 10. DTAs are bilateral international treaties designed to foster economic relations between countries by reducing tax impediments to trade, investment, and other cross-border economic activity. More specifically, DTAs aid taxpayers by providing greater certainty of tax treatment, eliminating double taxation, reducing withholding taxes on cross-border investment returns, and exempting certain short-term activities in the host state from income tax. 11. DTAs also enable the tax administrations of the treaty countries to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion by establishing a mechanism for exchanging information. New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs in force. 12. Tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs) are bilateral international treaties that are only designed to enable the tax administrations of the treaty countries to assist each other in the detection and prevention of tax avoidance and evasion. TIEAs do this by establishing a mechanism for exchanging information. TIEAs authorise tax assistance with jurisdictions with whom a full DTA may not be appropriate, such as low-tax jurisdictions. New Zealand currently has 19 TIEAs in force. 13. Many TIEAs are accompanied by supplementary agreements, which include a limited selection of DTA articles and are known as limited-scope DTAs. The TIEA with Guernsey is a limited-scope DTA but includes the limited selection of additional DTA Articles within the TIEA itself, rather than in a separate agreement. 14. The selection of DTA articles included in the Guernsey TIEA provide for the allocation of taxing rights in respect of government service and students, and establish a dispute resolution mechanism for transfer pricing adjustments. Base Erosion and Profit Shifting 15. The international Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative, led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20, has been a global focus since 2013. The BEPS initiative arose from international concerns that multinationals often seem able to not pay tax anywhere in the world. The G20 and the OECD initiated work to identify the mechanisms and techniques being used, and to formulate appropriate multilateral and bilateral responses. 16. This work led to the development of the BEPS 15-point Action Plan. Due to the global nature of BEPS, an international forum (the BEPS Inclusive Framework) was established to undertake this work. The BEPS Inclusive Framework currently has 129 members, including New Zealand. 17. The BEPS Action Plan included several work streams that looked into the ways that multinational enterprises have misused tax treaties. Action 6 focused on the granting of treaty benefits in inappropriate circumstances, and developed model treaty anti- abuse provisions. Action 14 focused on ways to make treaty dispute resolution mechanisms more effective, as anti-abuse provisions can increase uncertainty for taxpayers and investors. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24. 25. The model treaty provisions that emerged from the BEPS work were formally included in the OECD and United Nations Model Tax Conventions (on which almost all DTAs worldwide are based) in their respective 2017 updates. Some of these model provisions constitute “minimum standards” that all members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework are required to include in their tax treaties. The implementation of these minimum standards in tax treaties is being monitored and assessed through an OECD-led international peer review process. The peer review for the Action 6 minimum standards will only monitor implementation of the standards in full DTAs. Most of the Action 14 minimum standards apply to both full DTAs and limited-scope DTAs. Model treaty provisions that are not minimum standards are referred to as “best practice”, and their inclusion in treaties will not be peer reviewed. New Zealand will only be able to include these best practice provisions to the extent that the other jurisdiction concerned agrees to include them. To facilitate the inclusion of these model treaty provisions in existing DTAs without the need for thousands of bilateral negotiations, Action 15 of the BEPS Action Plan focused on the development of the Multilateral Convention to Implement Tax Treaty Related Measures to Prevent Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Multilateral Instrument, or MLI), which New Zealand signed in 2017 and ratified in 2018. As of 9 April 2019, the MLI had been signed by 87 jurisdictions and ratified by 25 signatories, including New Zealand. When two parties to an existing bilateral DTA sign the MLI and both include the DTA in their respective lists of treaties to be covered by the MLI, the DTA will be updated to include the BEPS model treaty provisions. The update must include all of the minimum standards, but either party can choose to include some or none of the best practice provisions, which will only be included where both parties have done so. At this stage, 30 of New Zealand’s 40 DTAs will be updated by the MLI. With Switzerland, differences in our respective legal structures require our DTA to be updated bilaterally rather than through the MLI. The Guernsey TIEA will not be updated because the MLI only applies to full DTAs, and not limited-scope DTAs or TIEAs. Inland Revenue has therefore already negotiated bilateral protocols with these jurisdictions. Other bilateral negotiations will also be required, but the actual number is yet to be determined. The protocols that have been negotiated with Switzerland and Guernsey relate to the inclusion of the BEPS minimum standards, and some of the best practice provisions. If needed, more detailed information on the specific changes made to the parent agreement by each protocol is set out in an Appendix at the end of this paper. The extended NIAs attached in Annexes III and IV also contain additional detail. Given the limited application of the existing TIEA with Guernsey to certain income derived by students and government employees, the direct impact of the Amending Protocol with Guernsey is expected to be small, as the existing TIEA provides very little scope for treaty abuse. The main advantages of the Amending Protocol with Guernsey will be to assist in maintaining New Zealand’s reputation in the international tax community and build a precedent for future tax treaty negotiations. 4 SENSITIVE 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 Next steps 26. In addition to seeking Cabinet approval for the two protocols to be signed, this paper also seeks approval for the necessary steps to be taken to bring each protocol into force after it has been signed. This will involve: 26.1 Parliamentary treaty examination. Pursuant to previous Cabinet decisions as to the application of Standing Orders 397-400 to DTAs, all DTAs, limited- scope DTAs, TIEAs, and protocols that amend these agreements must undergo parliamentary treaty examination. Each protocol and its associated extended NIA will therefore need to be present in the House for consideration by Select Committee. 26.2 An Order in Council. After treaty examination is complete, and pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, each protocol will be given the force of law in New Zealand by Order in Council. 26.3 Exchange of diplomatic notes. After the completion of the previous steps, and pursuant to requirements set out in the Entry into Force Article of each protocol, diplomatic notes will be exchanged with Switzerland and Guernsey, respectively. This will bring each protocol into force. Consultation 27. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury, were consulted in the preparation of this Cabinet paper. The extended NIAs were prepared by Inland Revenue in consultation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Treasury. 28. The BEPS measures arose from an international process which involved considerable private-sector consultation. No additional private-sector consultation was entered into in the preparation of this paper. Consistent with international practice, officials generally do not consult on the content of tax treaties. As the protocols with Switzerland and Guernsey follow international decisions made in the course of the BEPS work, and New Zealand’s signing and ratification of the MLI, the contents of the Amending Protocols are unlikely to be unexpected. Financial Implications 29. The BEPS model treaty provisions are primarily intended to protect the tax base of each treaty partner, by reducing the ability of non-residents investing or operating in a jurisdiction to use the treaty to engage in tax avoidance behaviour. Overall, this will have a positive impact on tax revenue in New Zealand, particularly as the provisions start to take effect across New Zealand’s treaty network. The provisions are reciprocal, so the amount of foreign income tax paid by New Zealand taxpayers may increase if they are engaging in BEPS behaviour overseas. This would reduce the amount of tax paid in New Zealand through increased foreign tax credits. 30. Data limitations mean that the specific impact for Switzerland cannot be quantified, although it is expected to be small, albeit positive, because New Zealand is a net capital importer. In the year to March 2018, total New Zealand investment in Switzerland was approximately $246 million, while total Swiss investment in New Zealand was $2,290 million. Breaking this down into direct investment, there was 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE $621 million of Swiss direct investment in New Zealand, and negligible direct investment by New Zealand investors in Switzerland (Statistics New Zealand). 31. The specific impact of the Guernsey TIEA is also unquantifiable, but will be negligible. This is because the Guernsey TIEA has limited application to certain government employees and students, but not businesses or investors. It is therefore unlikely that the Guernsey TIEA could be used to facilitate BEPS, even without the inclusion of the new provisions. 32. The model dispute resolution provisions complement the treaty-abuse provisions by improving the dispute resolution mechanisms available to taxpayers and investors. This is to reduce uncertainty arising from the new provisions. Inland Revenue will face increased costs in administering the updated dispute resolution provisions under both Amending Protocols. However, these costs will be marginal and will be absorbed within existing funding baselines. 33. The proposed changes will not fundamentally alter the existing dispute resolution mechanisms, but will improve access to them. For Guernsey, government employees and students affected by the TIEA will be able to access the standard dispute resolution mechanism under the TIEA, which they are currently unable to do. In the case of Switzerland, the costs may be slightly higher, as arbitration will be available to taxpayers if the two authorities are unable to resolve a dispute within three years. However, New Zealand’s experience is that arbitration very rarely needs to be invoked, as it creates an incentive for tax authorities to come to an agreement in a timely manner. Legislative Implications 34. As is usual practice for tax treaties, the protocols will each be given effect by Order in Council made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Once in force, each protocol will then override specified domestic legislation (the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993). The override only applies in respect of tax. 35. Each Order in Council will be submitted to Cabinet following the signing of the respective protocol and the successful completion of parliamentary treaty examination. Impact Analysis 36. As the proposal has regulatory implications (the protocols each require an Order in Council), Cabinet’s Impact Analysis Requirements apply. However, as this paper relates to international treaties for which extended NIAs have been prepared (see Annexes III and IV), separate Regulatory Impact Statements are not required. The NIAs substitute for Regulatory Impact Assessments. 37. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the extended NIAs Protocol to amend Double Tax Agreement with Switzerland and Protocol to amend Tax Information Exchange Agreement with Guernsey prepared by Inland Revenue and considers that it meets the quality assurance criteria of the Regulatory Impact Analysis framework. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE Human Rights 38. No inconsistencies with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993 have been identified. Publicity 39. The text of each protocol will be made available on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website after it has been signed. The extended NIAs will be publicly available on the Parliament website following parliamentary treaty examination. Appropriate media statements and announcements will be made at key steps during the entry into force process. Proactive Release 40. I propose to delay the proactive release of this paper until the appropriate signatures have been obtained, and Switzerland and Guernsey have agreed to the release. The release will be subject to redaction as appropriate under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet External Relations and Security Committee: 1. note that, to ensure the underlying agreements meet minimum international standards relating to base erosion and profit shifting, officials have negotiated: 1.1 Protocol Amending the Convention between New Zealand and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income (Amending Protocol with Switzerland), attached as Annex I; 1.2 Protocol Amending the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the States of Guernsey for the Exchange of Information with Respect to Taxes and the Allocation of Taxing Rights with Respect to Certain Income of Individuals (Amending Protocol with Guernsey), attached as Annex II; 2. approve the text of each Amending Protocol, subject to any minor or technical changes arising from the process of legal verification; 3. agree that New Zealand signs each Amending Protocol; 4. approve the extended National Interest Analyses (NIAs) prepared in relation to each of the Amending Protocols, attached as Annexes III and IV; 5. note that, following signature, the texts of each Amending Protocol and its accompanying extended NIA will be presented to the House of Representatives for parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 397-400; 6. note that the Amending Protocols will each be incorporated into New Zealand domestic law through an Order in Council, pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 7. invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Orders in Council to give effect to the Amending Protocols; 7 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE 8. note that, following the signing and satisfactory completion of parliamentary treaty examination, the Orders in Council will be submitted to Cabinet for approval; 9. authorise officials, following signature, satisfactory completion of parliamentary treaty examination and promulgation of the Orders in Council, to bring the Amending Protocols into force by exchanging diplomatic notes with Switzerland and Guernsey. Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 8 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE Appendix Switzerland Minimum standards 1. Article I of the protocol updates the preamble of the Swiss DTA to clarify that the DTA intends to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non- taxation or reduced taxation. This is important because preambles play an important role in treaty interpretation. For example, court cases on tax evasion and tax avoidance can turn to the preamble of a DTA to clarify the intention of the parties. 2. One of the minimum standards under Action 14 is for DTAs to require solutions reached under the mutual agreements procedure (MAP) to be implemented, notwithstanding any domestic time limits. However, as this may not be possible for all jurisdictions under domestic law settings, the minimum standard can be met in an alternative way (by imposing time limits on making adjustments). This is the case for Switzerland, and Articles II and III of the protocol reflect the alternative approach. They introduce a five-year limit beyond which the tax authorities may not adjust the profits attributable to associated enterprises or permanent establishments. As a safeguard, this restriction will not apply in the case of fraud, gross negligence, or wilful default. New Zealand tax legislation is already broadly consistent with this approach (by virtue of our four-year domestic time bar for making tax adjustments), so this provision will have little impact on New Zealand. 3. Article III also introduces a requirement that when a transfer pricing adjustment is made by one tax authority, the other tax authority is required to make a corresponding adjustment. This provision is intended to ensure that taxpayers are not double taxed on their profits. The provision has actually been in the OECD Model Tax Convention for several years and already features in most of New Zealand’s DTAs, with the Swiss DTA being an exception. 4. Article V of the Amending Protocol will allow taxpayers to present a dispute resolution case to either tax authority. At present, the DTA requires a taxpayer to present their case to the tax authority of the jurisdiction where they are resident. This change is intended to provide flexibility for taxpayers. 5. Article VII introduces a “principal purpose test” (PPT) as new Article 25A into the Swiss DTA. The PPT operates by denying benefits if one of the principal purposes of an arrangement is to benefit from the DTA. The PPT is an important tool in the fight against BEPS, and reduces the risk that the DTA can be misused in abusive arrangements and transactions to eliminate tax in New Zealand. Best practice provisions 6. Article IV of the Amending Protocol will update the provisions in the DTA that relate to the elimination of double taxation, to ensure that Switzerland is not required to provide an exemption from Swiss income tax for New Zealand-sourced income that was exempt from income tax or subject to a lower withholding rate because of the provisions of the DTA. The aim of this provision is to prevent double non-taxation 9 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE and is a recommendation arising from Action 2 of the BEPS Action Plan (Hybrid Mismatch Arrangements). 7. This provision only applies for Switzerland, because Switzerland uses the “exemption method” to relieve double taxation, whereas New Zealand uses the “credit method”. Under the credit method, New Zealand provides a foreign tax credit for foreign income tax paid to offset against the taxpayer’s New Zealand income tax liability, so the same risk of double non-taxation does not arise. 8. Articles VI and VIII of the Amending Protocol introduce arbitration provisions into the DTA, to support the existing MAP dispute-resolution mechanism. Under these provisions, if the two tax authorities are unable to resolve a MAP case within three years, the taxpayer concerned will be able to ask for the case to be submitted to arbitration. New Zealand already has arbitration in its DTAs with Australia (signed in 2009) and Japan (signed in 2012), and has signed up to arbitration under the MLI. Officials advise that the existence of arbitration provides a strong incentive for tax authorities to resolve issues under MAP before arbitration can be triggered. In practice, arbitration only needs to be invoked on extremely rare occasions and, to date, New Zealand has not yet had a case. 9. Arbitration is not available if a decision has already been rendered by a court or administrative tribunal, or in cases involving the application of New Zealand’s general anti-avoidance rule (Section BG 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007), permanent establishment anti-avoidance rule (Section GB 54 of the Income Tax Act 2007), or in specified circumstances in which hard-to-value intangibles are involved. Guernse Minimum standards 10. The Action 14 minimum standards on dispute resolution are required for limited- scope DTAs. The TIEA with Guernsey was identified as a deficiency in New Zealand’s treaty network when the first-stage peer review for Action 14 was completed. Article 2 of the Amending Protocol therefore updates Article 11 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the TIEA to ensure that the agreement meets the Action 14 minimum standards. These changes are taxpayer-friendly measures. 11. MAP will no longer be limited to cases concerning transfer pricing adjustments. MAP will also be available in relation to the allocative Articles concerning the taxation of government service income and students, to ensure that New Zealand government employees or students based in Guernsey (and vice versa) will be able to present a case if they believe that they are not being taxed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 12. As with the Amending Protocol with Switzerland, the Amending Protocol with Guernsey relaxes the requirement that the MAP case needs to be presented to the competent authority of the jurisdiction where the taxpayer concerned is tax resident. MAP will enable the taxpayer to present their case to either competent authority. 13. Finally, the Amending Protocol will require the competent authorities to implement any agreement arising out of the MAP, notwithstanding time limits in domestic law. 10 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE This ensures that tax authorities are unable to “run down the clock” on MAP cases and claim that they are unable to implement a MAP decision due to domestic time limits. 14. As noted, the TIEA with Guernsey is a limited-scope DTA. This means that the TIEA will not be subject to peer review under Action 6. This is because such agreements either do not have provisions that allocate taxing rights, or only allocate taxing rights in extremely limited circumstances (in the case of Guernsey, the TIEA only allocates taxing rights with respect to government employees and students). There is very limited scope for treaty abuse in such cases. 15. Nevertheless, members of the BEPS Inclusive Framework still need to satisfy the requirements of the minimum standard if requested by another Inclusive Framework member. Guernsey has requested the inclusion of the two Action 6 minimum standard provisions. The inclusion of these provisions is not necessary from a base protection perspective due to the limited application of the TIEA, but they will not be harmful. 16. Similar to the Amending Protocol with Switzerland, Article 1 of the Amending Protocol with Guernsey will update the preamble to the TIEA to clarify that the TIEA intends to eliminate double taxation without creating opportunities for non-taxation or reduced taxation through tax evasion or avoidance. Article 3 of the Amending Protocol introduces a new Article 11A into the TIEA to provide for a PPT, which operates by denying benefits if one of the principal purposes of an arrangement was to benefit from the agreement. 11 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 13:06:32 SENSITIVE Protocol amending the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the States of Guernsey for the exchange of information with respect to taxes and the allocation of taxing rights with respect to certain income of individuals done at London on 21 July, 2009 Withheld under s 18(d) as the information is already publicly available.

Executive Summary 2.I am proposing to create a new withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act that would allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions (a condition they are born with) to withdraw their savings early. It is important for people with these conditions to have the opportunity to use KiwiSaver to save for their retirement and to access their savings at a point that would allow them to spend a reasonable amount of their adult life in retirement. 3.Currently KiwiSaver is not an appropriate product for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. The majority of people in these circumstances would be advised not to join KiwiSaver and therefore they miss out on the benefits that are specific to KiwiSaver, notably the Government contribution and compulsory employer contributions. 4.The existing serious illness withdrawal category is not useful for people with life- shortening congenital conditions because withdrawal can only be made on the basis of imminent risk of death or permanent incapacity to work. 5.The new withdrawal category would establish a set list of conditions named in regulations that would automatically qualify for withdrawal. An alternative process would also be available to people that have a life-shortening congenital condition that is not named in the regulations to apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal. Background 6.People with life-shortening congenital conditions can join KiwiSaver to save for their retirement but under the current withdrawal settings cannot access their savings before the lock-in date of 65 years old (being the age of qualification for New Zealand superannuation). Having such a condition means a person may not live until 65 years old and will not be able to use their KiwiSaver savings to support their financial wellbeing in retirement. Therefore, the majority of people with life-shortening congenital conditions would be advised not to join KiwiSaver. 7.This issue was brought to my attention last year when Tim Fairhall and his mother Joan Fairhall wrote to me raising concerns that the current withdrawal provisions in KiwiSaver discriminate against people with Down syndrome. Tim Fairhall has Down syndrome and an effect of this condition is that he is aging prematurely. His life expectancy is approximately 57 years. He has been contributing to KiwiSaver for a number of years, but under the current withdrawal settings, Mr Fairhall may not live long enough to gain access to those savings. Tim and Joan Fairhall then made a submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax 1 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 1. Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 to this effect. 8.There is an existing serious illness withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act but it would not be useful for Mr Fairhall and others with life-shortening congenital conditions. Withdrawal under the serious illness category can only be made on the basis that a person is totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which they are suited or has a condition that poses a serious and imminent risk of death. This withdrawal category would not allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their KiwiSaver at a point that would allow them to spend a reasonable portion of their adult life in retirement. A new KiwiSaver withdrawal category for life-shortening congenital conditions 9.I propose to create a new withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act allowing people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings before the age of 65. I believe that it is important that these people have an opportunity to have a positive retirement and to support their financial wellbeing in retirement through KiwiSaver. 10.It is particularly important for KiwiSaver to work for these New Zealanders because there are some benefits that are specific to KiwiSaver that cannot be accessed through privately run retirement savings schemes, notably the Government contribution and compulsory employer contributions. 11.These changes will also apply to complying superannuation funds. Complying superannuation funds are retirement savings schemes that have similar benefits to KiwiSaver funds (the Government contribution and compulsory employer contribution) because savings are locked-in until a person is 65. They are typically workplace savings schemes like those run by the Fire Service or New Zealand Post. Details of how the new withdrawal category would work 12.The KiwiSaver Act’s purpose is to support saving for retirement. To preserve this purpose there are a limited number of situations where a person can make a withdrawal before the age of 65. I have taken care to create a withdrawal category that is sufficiently targeted to those it is intending to serve and make it relatively easy to administer. Targeting the withdrawal category also mitigates the impact a broad withdrawal category might have on the purpose of KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle. KiwiSaver is designed so that the majority of people will access their funds once they are 65 years old. A set list of conditions would trigger withdrawal and there would be flexibility to apply for other congenital conditions not on the set list 13.In order to define who would be eligible for withdrawal under the new category a set list of life-shortening congenital conditions would be established through regulations allowing a person to withdraw their retirement savings before the age of 65. This list would be limited to congenital conditions where it is known the condition is likely to shorten a person’s life below the age of 65. The list of set conditions is being developed by officials in consultation with the medical profession. The list would also be subject to review to ensure it stays up-to-date. 14.Establishing a set list of conditions that qualify for withdrawal will give certainty to people with those conditions about their ability to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings. It also provides clarity to KiwiSaver providers about the types of conditions that will typically form 2 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 the basis of the majority of applications and make the administration process a relatively simple task. 15.There would also be a process where a person could apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal for a life-shortening congenital condition that is not on the set list. This flexibility is needed because this is a complex area. This alternative process would be appropriate for people with rare congenital conditions that shorten their life below the age of 65. 16.I consider the proposed administrative process for the new withdrawal category provides certainty about who can apply for withdrawal in the majority of cases, and flexibility for other conditions to be considered for withdrawal. Discretion to choose a retirement date 17.The new category would allow the individual to choose the age at which they retire. Whilst this discretion would be unusual in the context of how KiwiSaver currently operates, I consider it is appropriate for these circumstances. Two individuals with the same condition may have very different life expectancies due to the severity of their condition and a number of other influencing factors. Because of this variation in life expectancy I believe it is appropriate to allow those with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their KiwiSaver at the point at which they choose to retire. Process for withdrawal 18.To apply for withdrawal a person with a life-shortening congenital condition would go through a similar process to the current serious illness withdrawal process. 19.In the case of a person that has a condition named on the set list, they would: a.Apply in writing to their KiwiSaver supervisor or manager with accompanying medical evidence verifying that they have a life-shortening condition named in the regulations. b.Supply a statutory declaration that they are intending to retire and wish to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings. c.Supply any additional information that the KiwiSaver supervisor or manager requires to reasonably satisfy themselves that the person has a condition qualifying for withdrawal. 20.In the case of a person that has a life-shortening congenital condition that is not on the set list, they would: a.Apply in writing to their KiwiSaver supervisor or manager stating that they have a congenital condition with medical evidence verifying that the condition is expected to reduce their life below the age at which funds are locked-in under the KiwiSaver Act. b.Supply a statutory declaration that they are intending to retire and wish to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings. c.Supply any additional information that the KiwiSaver supervisor or manager requires to reasonably satisfy themselves that the person has a condition qualifying for 3 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 w ithdraw al. 2 1. In regards to the set list of conditions named in regulations, I propose that these w ould be subject to review . I do not propose a set review period, instead I would expect that the information gained through the alternative process for application - namely the frequency w ith w hich other congenital conditions are being granted access - w ould inform the need for a review . Partial retirement 22. I propose that follow ing approval of withdrawal under this new category a person could continue to contribute to Kiw iSaver if they decide to stay in some form of employment, or decide to resume employment at a later date. I believe this is consistent w ith allow ing people the opportunity to have a positive retirement. They w ould also have the ability to make immediate w ithdraw als on these savings. 23. I am al so proposing that if a person continues to contribute to KiwiSaver during partial retirement then they would not be eligible for the Government and compulsory employer contributions. This is consistent w ith how other KiwiSaver members are treated w hen w ithdraw ing for the purpose of retirement. Impact on social assistance 24. Once Kiw iSaver funds are no longer 'locked-in' they are treated as an available asset for the purpose of social assistance, and income earned from that asset is treated as income. Therefore if people w ithdr aw their KiwiSaver savings under the new category their funds are 'unlocked' and it w ill most likely reduce or stop any social assistance they are e ligible to receive. The effect of this is that a person w ith a life-shortening congenital condition may actually be made w orse-off if they w ithdraw their Kiw iSaver relative to a person retiring at age 65. 25. The issue outlined above is related to other questions about how the early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds interacts w ith asset and income tests under the social assistance regulations. Early w ithdraw al of Kiw iSaver for significant financial hardship, serious illness and fi rst home w ithdraw al can impact on the amount of social assistance a person is e ntitled to receive. W ork w ill be undertaken to investigate the 'interface issues' between early w ithdraw al of Kiw iSaver and social assisJance reaulat\[ons. c;tnd anv~==---- recommendations for change w ill be made Confidential aavice 10 Govemmen Consultation 26. In order to scope the problem and to seek advice on possible solutions a report w as commissioned from two independent advisers: Dr Claire Matthews of Massey University and Donna Mitchell from IHC. In formulating their report they undertook a range of targeted consultation w ith people that have health and disability know ledge and expertise, and those within the Kiw iSaver industry. The majority of those consulted expressed 'in principle support' for a new withdraw al category to be created for people w ith life- shortening congenital conditions. 27. There w ill also be an opportunity for further public consultation through the Select Committee process. 28. The follow ing agencies and departments have been consulted the Treasury, Inland 4 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the Financial Markets Authority, the Commission for Financial Capability and the Ministry of Justice. 29.The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. Financial Implications 30.The purpose of the proposed changes is to make KiwiSaver an appropriate retirement savings vehicle for a larger number of New Zealanders. As a result, there would likely be a small increase on the total amount of Government contribution made towards KiwiSaver. 31.As noted above, work will be undertaken to assess how the early withdrawal of KiwiSaver interacts with eligibility for social assistance. If changes are made to the way in which early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds are treated for the purpose of asset and income tests relating to assessments for social assistance then this could increase the amount of social assistance spending. Legislative Implications 32.Changes to the KiwiSaver Act will be required to implement the proposals. These changes will be made through a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill which is scheduled for introduction at the end of June 2019. It holds a category 3 priority on the 2019 Legislation Programme. 33.Associated changes to the KiwiSaver Regulations 2006 will also be required in order to specify the list of conditions that qualify for withdrawal. A regulation making power will need to be inserted into the KiwiSaver Act in order to enable this. 34.To apply the changes to complying superannuation funds, changes will also be required to the Income Tax Act 2007. Impact Analysis 35.The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE) Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed the attached Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by MBIE. The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement partially meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions on proposals in this paper. This is because there has been limited consultation on the proposal which may mean that the potential consequences identified in the Regulatory Impact Statement are not fully understood. Human Rights 36.This policy seeks to positively discriminate for people with life-shortening congenital conditions so that KiwiSaver becomes a viable retirement savings vehicle for them by allowing them to withdraw their savings at a point that would allow them to have a positive retirement. 37.Creating a withdrawal category that names certain conditions as qualifying for withdrawal could have discriminatory effects upon those people that also have a life-shortening congenital condition that is not on the named list because the evidence burden may be higher under the alternative process for withdrawal. However the policy is seeking to 5 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 provide certainty for the majority of people that will utilise this withdrawal category whilst still providing an avenue for people with other life-shortening congenital conditions to also withdraw their KiwiSaver for early retirement. 38.There are also potential discriminatory effects for people that have a non-congenital life- shortening condition. The existing serious illness withdrawal category can be relied upon by people in these circumstances. However the proposed changes may raise questions about the current scope of the serious illness category. There may be reasons to reconsider the existing serious illness withdrawal provisions in the future. Gender Implications 39.There are no gender implications arising from the policy proposals in this paper. Disability Perspective 40.The proposals in this paper seek to positively influence the wellbeing of people with disabilities in retirement. 41.The advice provided to me has been informed by people with knowledge of intellectual disability, health and disability experts, a legal expert specialising in health and disability, and further consultation with Tim Fairhall and his mother Joan Fairhall. Publicity 42.Subject to Cabinet’s agreement to the recommendations in this paper, I intend to issue a press release announcing Cabinet’s decisions. Proactive Release 43.I intend to release the paper proactively in whole within 30 days. MBIE will publish a copy of this paper on its website. Recommendations The Minister for Commerce and Consumer Affairs recommends that the Committee: 1note that the majority of New Zealanders are able to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings at the time they qualify for New Zealand superannuation. 2note that there are currently a limited number of situations where a person can withdraw their savings before the age of 65, being first home withdrawal, serious illness and financial hardship, and permanent emigration. 3agree that a new withdrawal category will be created in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 allowing people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings before the lock-in date specified in the KiwiSaver Act, being the New Zealand superannuation qualification age. 4note that the new category has been designed with the specific needs of those with life- shortening congenital conditions in mind. 5agree that the withdrawal category allow the individual applying for withdrawal to determine their date of withdrawal. 6 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 6agree a set list of congenital conditions be specified as guaranteeing withdrawal established through regulations under the KiwiSaver Act 2006. 7note that the list of congenital conditions to be detailed in regulations is being developed by officials in consultation with the medical profession and that these will be finalised through the drafting process. 8agree that individuals that have a congenital condition that is not on the set list named in regulations may also apply for withdrawal. 9 note that making a withdrawal under the new category does not prevent a person from continuing in paid employment. 10 agree that a person who has made a withdrawal under the new category may continue to keep contributing to KiwiSaver. 11 agree that the process for withdrawal for a person that has a congenital condition named in the regulations will be: 11.1apply in writing to the KiwiSaver manager or supervisor with accompanying medical evidence verifying that they have a life-shortening condition named in the regulations; 11.2supply a statutory declaration that they are intending to retire and wish to withdraw their KiwiSaver savings; and 11.3supply any additional information that the KiwiSaver manager or supervisor requires to reasonably satisfy themselves that the person has a condition qualifying for withdrawal. 12 agree that the process for withdrawal for a person that has a life-shortening congenital condition that is not named in the regulations will be: 12.1apply in writing to the KiwiSaver manager or supervisor stating that they have a congenital condition with medical evidence verifying that the condition is expected to reduce their life below the New Zealand superannuation qualification age; 12.2supply a statutory declaration that they are intending to retire and wish to withdraw their KiwiSaver saving; and 12.3supply any additional information that the KiwiSaver manager or supervisor requires to reasonably satisfy themselves that the person has a condition qualifying for withdrawal. 13 agree that the amount that can be withdrawn by a person that qualifies for withdrawal under the new category described in recommendation 3 above may be up to the value of the KiwiSaver member’s accumulation. 14 agree that a regulation making power will be inserted into the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to allow for a list of congenital conditions to be specified in regulations. 15 agree that these changes will be made through a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 7 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 16 note that work will be undertaken to examine the interface issues between early withdrawal of KiwiSaver and asset and income tests for the purpose of eligibility for social assistance under social assistance regulations. 17authorise the Minister of Revenue to issue drafting instructions to Inland Revenue to give effect to the above recommendations. 18authorise the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs to release exposure drafts of the legislative amendments and regulations for targeted consultation as required. 19 authorise the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs and the Minister of Revenue the power to make decisions consistent with the policy proposals in this paper on minor issues that arise during the drafting process. Authorised for lodgement Hon Kris Faafoi Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs 8 aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:18:28 1 Coversheet: Withdrawal of KiwiSaver due to life-shortening congenital conditions Advising agencies Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Decision sought Policy decisions relating to the creation of a new early withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 Proposing Ministers Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs Summary: Problem and Proposed Approach Problem Definition What problem or opportunity does this proposal seek to address? Why is Government intervention required? People with life-shortening congenital conditions (a condition a person is born with) can join KiwiSaver to save for their retirement but, under current settings, cannot access their savings before the age of 65. Having such a condition means a person may not live until 65 years old. This means that either: people with life-shortening congenital conditions are not joining KiwiSaver because they are aware it is unsuitable for them as a retirement savings product, or people with life-shortening congenital conditions have contributed money to KiwiSaver and cannot withdraw their money. In both of these cases, people with life-shortening congenital conditions cannot use KiwiSaver to save for their retirement and so are missing out on the particular benefits associated with KiwiSaver that do not come with other privately-run retirement savings schemes. The withdrawal settings are dictated by the KiwiSaver Act 2006 and supporting regulations. Changes to the Act would be required to allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions to access their savings to support their financial wellbeing in retirement. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 2. 2 Proposed Approach How will government intervention work to bring about the desired change? How is this the best option? We propose a new withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act allowing people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings at a time they choose to retire. Allowing people to establish their own retirement date under this new category should almost guarantee that people with life-shortening congenital conditions will be able to access their KiwiSaver to support a positive retirement. Giving people discretion to choose a withdrawal date acknowledges that there is a wide range of life expectancies associated with certain conditions, depending on the severity of the condition and other associated medical conditions. A set list of conditions in regulations would trigger withdrawal, providing clarity and certainty about the new category in the majority of cases. An alternative process would also be established where a person whose congenital condition is not on the set list could apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal, with supporting medical evidence. We consider the process for withdrawal outlined above provides:  certainty about who the new category will apply to  flexibility for (perhaps rare) conditions that have not been caught by the set list. Section B: Summary Impacts: Benefits and costs Who are the main expected beneficiaries and what is the nature of the expected benefit? The main beneficiaries will be people with life-shortening congenital conditions as KiwiSaver will now be an appropriate retirement savings vehicle for them. They will be able to access the specific benefits available through KiwiSaver that do not come with other retirement savings schemes. Where do the costs fall? In order to qualify for withdrawal under the new category we are proposing that people will have to supply medical certification (and perhaps other medical evidence if required) in support of their application. There will be costs to the individual in obtaining this information. There will be administration costs for KiwiSaver providers in processing these applications. What are the likely risks and unintended impacts, how significant are they and how will they be minimised or mitigated? The proposal to create an early withdrawal category in KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening congenital conditions for the purpose of early retirement seeks to address an existing inconsistency between people that have life-shortening congenital conditions and people that have a normal life expectancy. In seeking to address an existing inconsistency in KiwiSaver, a new inconsistency is generated and questions could be raised about how people with non-congenital life-shortening conditions are treated in terms of KiwiSaver withdrawal. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 3 There is an existing serious illness category in the Act that can be relied upon in cases of imminent death (guidance produced by the KiwiSaver industry takes this to be that a person would have 12 months or less to live) or permanent incapacity to work. However the serious illness category does not capture situations where a person may want to retire early due to a non-congenital life- shortening condition. The work on life-shortening congenital conditions may spur calls for the scope of the proposed withdrawal category to be considered again. This is a risk because of the complicated nature of medically-related reasons for withdrawal. In order to create any additional withdrawal categories, a line would need to be drawn to establish what conditions are likely to qualify for withdrawal. Due to the complexity associated with medical conditions it is likely that no matter where you ‘draw the line’ it would introduce some form of inconsistency or inequity relative to other conditions that might have been included. The alternative would be to have a reasonably broad withdrawal category allowing for early withdrawal for non-congenital conditions. This is also a risk because the current design of the KiwiSaver Act restricts early withdrawal to a limited number of circumstances in order to ensure that, for most New Zealanders, their savings will be available for them in retirement. Introducing a withdrawal category with a broad scope increases the number of people that could potentially withdraw their money before the age of 65 and risks undermining KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle. The risk of undermining KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle for the majority of New Zealanders has been managed through the current policy process by tightly defining the scope of the proposed withdrawal category. We are seeking to address a particular issue in relation to people that are born with a condition that means they have a shortened life expectancy. In regards to further calls for change to the early withdrawal categories, MBIE will monitor the feedback received as part of its regulatory stewardship obligations. Further detail on this is provided below. Identify any significant incompatibility with the government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’. Allowing withdrawal of KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening congenital conditions raises questions about the treatment of non-congenital life-shortening conditions. MBIE will monitor the feedback on this point from the industry and from the public as part of its ongoing regulatory stewardship activities. Any work would need to be undertaken with the broader purpose of KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle in mind. As noted above, the current design of the KiwiSaver Act restricts early withdrawal to a limited number of circumstances in order to ensure that, for most New Zealanders, their savings will be available to them for use in retirement. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 4 Section C: Evidence certainty and quality assurance Agency rating of evidence certainty? There are some gaps in the evidence base. To inform the scoping of the problem and to provide advice on possible solutions, MBIE commissioned a report on the issue of withdrawal from KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening conditions from two independent advisers. In the generation of that advice the authors created a list of congenital conditions that are recognised as being associated with a shortened life expectancy. To compile that list the authors drew on a wide literature search and the institutional knowledge of IHC Advocacy, IDEA Services and the associated library teams. However, whilst the search was extensive, the authors acknowledged that there may be other congenital conditions that are less common or unknown that could also have an impact on a person’s life expectancy. Furthermore the authors noted that the data available about incidence rates of certain conditions is scarce, and in a number of cases they relied upon overseas evidence to infer incidence rates for New Zealand. To be completed by quality assurers: Quality Assurance Reviewing Agency: Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Quality Assurance Assessment: MBIE’s Regulatory Impact Analysis Review Panel has reviewed the attached Regulatory Impact Statement prepared by MBIE. The Panel considers that the information and analysis summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement partially meets the criteria necessary for Ministers to make informed decisions on proposals in this paper. This is because there has been limited consultation on the proposal which may mean that the potential consequences identified in the Regulatory Impact Statement are not fully understood. Reviewer Comments and Recommendations: RIARP confirms that its feedback is reflected in the Regulatory Impact Statement. The Regulatory Impact Statement has undergone moderate changes as a result of the RIARP process. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 5 Full Impact Summary: Withdrawal of KiwiSaver due to life-shortening congenital conditions Section 1: General information Purpose The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis This RIS addresses the problem of early withdrawal for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. We have been directed by Ministers to address this specific problem and we have not considered changing the early withdrawal categories in the KiwiSaver Act for any other reason, including for life-shortening conditions that are not congenital. The existing serious illness withdrawal category aims to provide a mechanism for non-congenital life-shortening conditions and it is beyond the scope of this project to consider how this withdrawal category is functioning. The analysis in this RIS relies upon the work undertaken by two independent advisers commissioned by MBIE in order to scope the scale of the problem in relation to KiwiSaver and life-shortening conditions and to seek advice on possible solutions. The Report, ‘Possible Changes to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 in relation to members with life-shortening congenital conditions’ authored by Dr Claire Matthews and Ms Donna Mitchell, has heavily informed the analysis in this RIS. The approach to establishing a set list of congenital conditions in regulations, and what conditions should be included in that list, has been developed on the basis of recommendations made in that Report. We are also relying on the targeted consultation that was undertaken as part of the development of the Report and have not undertaken full public consultation. Limited consultation is not ideal from a policy development perspective as it means that the proposals have been developed with the specific views of key interest groups incorporated but have not been subject to full public consultation. We do not have reliable data about the number of people that are impacted by this problem. The Report noted above used the available (and sometimes incomplete) data from New Zealand sources and also drew on international evidence to determine incidence rates for particular conditions. Despite the gaps in evidence, we are assuming that the problem impacts a relatively small section of New Zealand’s population. We are relying on the anecdotal evidence of one individual, Tim Fairhall, to determine the impact aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 6 that the problem has at an individual level. We have assumed that Mr Fairhall’s experience informs us of the impact the problem has on people that have already started contributing to KiwiSaver. We do not have any anecdotal evidence about the impact the problem is having on people that have not joined KiwiSaver because they have determined it is not an appropriate retirement savings vehicle for them because of their shortened life expectancy. Responsible Manager Authorised by: Sharon Corbett Financial Markets Policy Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment Section 2: Problem definition and objectives 2.1 What is the context within which action is proposed? Proposed new withdrawal category in KiwiSaver Act 2006 KiwiSaver is a voluntary, work-based retirement savings scheme. Individuals are automatically enrolled in KiwiSaver when they start a new job (when this happens, you do have an opportunity to opt out within eight weeks). Equally, individuals can choose to join KiwiSaver through a KiwiSaver provider or through their employer. KiwiSaver is designed to help New Zealanders with their long-term saving for retirement. Withdrawals for retirement can be made from the age of 65. The KiwiSaver Act provides certain limited situations in which a member can withdraw KiwiSaver funds before they reach the age of 65. These include withdrawing money for your first home, moving overseas permanently, suffering significant financial hardship and serious illness. Counterfactual: If we do not make any changes to the withdrawal categories then the majority of KiwiSaver members would need to wait until the age of 65 to withdraw their money (typically taken to be the point at which they retire, although some people do choose to continue in paid employment after this age). The situations where people could withdraw their money before the age of 65 years old would remain the same. Some people have a life-shortening congenital condition that reduces their life-expectancy below 65 years. The current withdrawal categories are not supporting these people to access their savings for retirement. 2.2 What regulatory system, or systems, are already in place? KiwiSaver is one of a number of government initiatives aimed at increasing private retirement savings aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 7 Money contributed to KiwiSaver accounts is for the purpose of private retirement savings. The purpose of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is to: “encourage a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals who are not in a position to enjoy standards of living in retirement similar to those in pre-retirement. The Act aims to increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits.” The Act “provides for schemes (KiwiSaver schemes) to facilitate individuals’ savings, principally through the workplace.” There are also other government measures designed to support the accumulation of individual retirement savings. The Commission for Financial Capability is funded by the Crown to undertake a number of measures aimed at improving levels of financial capability and wellbeing, and increasing the numbers of people that are financially equipped for retirement. It does this through initiatives like education programmes in schools and in the community. It also has a number of online resources that directly link to KiwiSaver, notably the KiwiSaver Fund finder that helps people select the right KiwiSaver provider and fund for their particular circumstances. The governance of KiwiSaver sits within the financial markets regulatory system The Financial Markets Authority’s substantive role in relation to KiwiSaver is as the conduct regulator in financial markets. Money contributed to KiwiSaver is invested in managed funds that are invested on behalf of the individual KiwiSaver member by an investment manager. The managed investment schemes are privately run and their operation is governed by the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013. The Financial Markets Authority also produces educational material relating to KiwiSaver that seeks to guide New Zealanders into active decisions about their KiwiSaver investments. 2.3 What is the policy problem or opportunity? People with life-shortening congenital conditions can join and save through KiwiSaver but cannot access their savings People with life-shortening congenital conditions (a condition a person is born with) can join KiwiSaver to save for their retirement but under current settings cannot access their savings before the age of 65. Having such a condition means a person may not live until 65 years old. This means that either:  People with life-shortening congenital conditions are not joining KiwiSaver because they are aware it is unsuitable for them as a retirement savings product  Or, people with life-shortening congenital conditions have contributed money to KiwiSaver and cannot withdraw their money. There are other privately run retirement savings schemes where individuals can withdraw their savings before the age of 65. However there are some benefits specific to KiwiSaver, notably the Government contribution and compulsory employer contributions, that are not available through other privately run retirement savings schemes. People with life-shortening congenital conditions are missing out on these additional benefits. Existing serious illness withdrawal category does not allow withdrawal in these circumstances The existing serious illness withdrawal category is not appropriate to address this problem. This category can only be accessed on the basis that a person is totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which they are suited, or has a condition that poses a serious and imminent risk of death. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 8 Extent of the problem Incidence rates would ultimately be determined by the definition of what is taken to be a life- shortening congenital condition for the purposes of withdrawal from KiwiSaver. However, even given this qualification the information we do have about certain conditions is not complete, and is often based on international evidence. Based on what we do know, we are assuming a relatively small number of people may be affected by this problem with the KiwiSaver withdrawal categories. Whilst the incidence rates may be low, the impact at an individual level is significant. The evidence relating to the impact this problem has at an individual level is anecdotal in nature. The problem was initially scoped on the basis of a submission from Tim and Joan Fairhall to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Tim Fairhall has Down syndrome and an effect of this condition is that he is aging prematurely. His life expectancy is approximately 57 years of age. He has been contributing to KiwiSaver for a number of years, but under the current withdrawal settings, Mr Fairhall may not live long enough to gain access to those savings. There are also likely people with life-shortening congenital conditions that have not joined KiwiSaver because they have established that it would not be a suitable retirement savings vehicle for them. We do not have data about the numbers of people that would fall within this category. 2.4 Are there any constraints on the scope for the decision making? Ministers have committed to address the concern that KiwiSaver does not currently work for people born with life-shortening congenital conditions that have a life expectancy below the age of 65. 2.5 What do stakeholders think? Targeted consultation was undertaken by Dr Matthews and Ms Mitchell during the process of generating their Report. They undertook a range of consultation with people and groups that would have an interest in the outcome of this work and those that could provide expertise in formulating the problem definition and possible solutions. Consultation was undertaken with:  KiwiSaver trustees (trustees and supervisors are the decision-making body for the existing serious hardship and terminal illness withdrawal category)  KiwiSaver scheme providers (providers have an interest as there may be additional administration costs associated with any new withdrawal category)  health and disability experts (including a legal expert who specialises in the area of health and disability)  Tim Fairhall, and his mother, Joan Fairhall  actuaries in relation to life expectancy The majority of those consulted expressed general ‘in principle support’ for there to be a new withdrawal category created for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 9 Section 3: Options identification 3.1 What options have been considered? Policy objectives Overarching policy objective: Ensure that the KiwiSaver settings are designed in a way that makes KiwiSaver an appropriate retirement savings vehicle for New Zealanders. We have identified the following objectives that are specific to the problem of access to KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening congenital conditions: Objective one: KiwiSaver is a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life- shortening congenital conditions with the aim of supporting a positive retirement. This objective specifically addresses the problem definition. We are seeking a solution that would allow people with life-shortening conditions to access their KiwiSaver in order to spend a reasonable portion of their adult life in retirement. This objective has the highest priority in the analysis of the options because it directly addresses the problem we are intending to solve. Objective two: KiwiSaver withdrawal settings support the primary purpose of saving for retirement. The current withdrawal criteria are tightly defined so as to preserve the principal purpose of KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle. There are a limited number of current circumstances that allow withdrawal before the age of 65. Objective three: The costs associated with administering any new withdrawal category are reasonable. We are seeking an option that does not result in unreasonable costs for both the individual KiwiSaver member applying for withdrawal and the KiwiSaver provider administering the application. Options Option One: Allow people with a life-shortening congenital condition (one they are born with) to withdraw their savings at a set age, specific to the type of condition the person has. Under this option a set list of life-shortening congenital conditions would be established through regulations allowing a person to withdraw their retirement savings before the age of 65. The list would have a review period (timeframe for this to be determined) so that the list is not limited to currently known conditions, and where medical advances mean a condition is no longer life-shortening, it can be removed. There would also be a process whereby a person could apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal for a congenital condition that is not on the set list. The process for this would be similar aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 10 to that of the current serious illness withdrawal provisions in that the person would provide a medical certificate with supporting evidence as to why withdrawal should be granted despite the fact that the person does not have a named condition. For each life shortening condition a specific age of withdrawal would be determined. That age would be based on the average life expectancy for those with the specific condition, allowing for an equivalent expected retirement period as a KiwiSaver member who does not have a life-shortening condition (this is taken to be 25% as a proportion of adult life from the age of 18). This option fulfils the objectives by:  KiwiSaver is a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life-shortening congenital conditions with the aim of supporting a positive retirement. This option partially fulfils the objective relating to the availability of KiwiSaver as a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. The likelihood that a person with a life-shortening congenital condition can access their savings to support a positive retirement is higher under this option compared to the status quo. However, establishing a set retirement age for each condition based on the average life expectancy for people with that condition risks some people not gaining access to their KiwiSaver at a time that is appropriate to support a positive retirement. This is based on the fact that life expectancy and quality of life can vary greatly for people with the same condition. If a retirement withdrawal age is set for all people with the same condition then some people may not be able to withdraw their KiwiSaver despite their readiness and intention to retire. Therefore, it may not improve access to KiwiSaver for all people with a life-shortening congenital condition to support a positive retirement.  KiwiSaver withdrawal settings support the primary purpose of saving for retirement. This option would be consistent with the existing design of the withdrawal criteria in the KiwiSaver Act. Setting a prescribed list of life-shortening congenital conditions would appropriately target the withdrawal criteria to the group it is intending to serve. The process for allowing people that have a life-shortening congenital condition to apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal where their condition is not included in the set list is consistent with the application for withdrawal under the serious illness category. Setting a date of withdrawal for each condition is also consistent with the current design of KiwiSaver. The set withdrawal age mirrors the existing provision that people can withdraw their savings at 65 years old, but adjusts for the average life expectancy of the person’s congenital condition.  The costs associated with administering any new withdrawal category are reasonable. This option partially fulfils the objective of reasonable costs. The costs associated with this option for the individual are likely to be similar to that of the serious illness withdrawal category. It is proposed that in order to apply for withdrawal, an individual must supply medical certification confirming that they have a life-shortening congenital condition named in the set list of conditions (or through the alternative process if their condition is not included on the list). In terms of associated costs for KiwiSaver providers, it is intended that the set list of conditions would remove the discretion in the decision-making process and therefore limit the administration time needed to process applications. There would be greater administration associated with applications that are not on the named list, but requiring medical certification and evidence should place some reasonable limits around the administration process. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 11 Option two: Allow people that have a life-shortening congenital condition (one they have been born with) to access their retirement savings at a date determined by them. This option would be the same as the option above except the end payment date would be determined by the individual member at the point at which they choose to retire. This option recognises that the impact a particular condition has upon an individual can vary greatly depending on the severity of their condition and influencing factors such as associated medical conditions. Two people with the same condition will likely have a different quality of life and life expectancy and this recognises that two people with the same condition may have different preferred retirement dates. This option fulfils the objectives by:  KiwiSaver is a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life-shortening congenital conditions with the aim of supporting a positive retirement. This option fulfils the objective relating to the availability of KiwiSaver as a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. As people with life-shortening congenital conditions can determine a retirement date that suits their circumstances, there is a very high likelihood that they will be able to access those savings to support a positive retirement.  KiwiSaver withdrawal settings support the primary purpose of saving for retirement. This option is less consistent with the design of KiwiSaver because rather than setting a withdrawal age (mirroring the retirement age in the KiwiSaver Act) it allows individuals flexibility to set their own retirement date. This discretion would be unusual in the context of the KiwiSaver Act.  The costs associated with administering any new withdrawal category are reasonable. This option is the same as Option One in terms of associated costs. 3.2 What criteria, in addition to monetary costs and benefits have been used to assess the likely impacts of the options under consideration? KiwiSaver is a suitable retirement savings vehicle for people with life-shortening congenital conditions with the aim of supporting a positive retirement.  Access: KiwiSaver is open to all New Zealanders to join, however it does not allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions to access their savings at a point that would allow them to spend a reasonable amount of their adult life in retirement, thus supporting a positive retirement. KiwiSaver withdrawal settings support the primary purpose of saving for retirement.  Targeted: Scope of withdrawal category is sufficiently targeted to people with life-shortening congenital conditions and is not so wide as to potentially undermine the primary purpose of retirement savings.  Consistent design: any new withdrawal category would be consistent with the overall purpose of aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 12 KiwiSaver and the design of the existing withdrawal categories. The costs of administering any new withdrawal category would be reasonable.  Costs to KiwiSaver providers are reasonable.  Costs to KiwiSaver members seeking to apply for a withdrawal are reasonable. 3.3 What other options have been ruled out of scope, or not considered, and why? No other options have been considered to address the problem of access to KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 13 Section 4: Impact Analysis 4.1 How does each of the options compare with the counterfactual No action Option One Access determined by a set list of conditions and defined age of retirement Option Two Access determined by a set list of conditions and self-selected age of retirement Access (criteria with highest priority) 0 + For some people, determining an age of access would allow them to access their savings at the point they want to retire. ++ Allowing people to determine the date they want to retire - and access their KiwiSaver from that date - should allow access for all people with a congenital life- shortening condition.

Our preferred option is option two: Allow people that have a life-shortening congenital condition (one they have been born with) to access their retirement savings at a date determined by them. This option is preferred because it offers a much greater opportunity for people with life-shortening congenital conditions to access their KiwiSaver to support a positive retirement. Whilst the design of the category is unusual within the design of KiwiSaver in that it gives discretion to the individual to decide on a retirement date, it is still preferable because it almost guarantees access to KiwiSaver for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. If a retirement date is set for a particular condition it does not take into account the potential for wide variation in retirement age of those with the same condition. 5.2 Summary table of costs and benefits of the preferred approach Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non-monetised impacts Evidence certainty (High, medium or low) Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action KiwiSaver members with life-shortening congenital conditions Costs associated with gaining medical certification to apply under the withdrawal category. Actual dollar amounts are unknown, but we are assuming they will be similar to the cost of going to the doctor. low KiwiSaver providers Administration costs Actual dollar amounts are unknown, but we are assuming they will be similar to the administration costs associated with the serious illness withdrawal category. low Total Monetised Cost Unknown, but assessment modelled on existing costs within the system. Low Non-monetised costs Low Low aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 15 5.3 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The problem identified in relation to KiwiSaver and life-shortening congenital conditions raises a separate problem about whether KiwiSaver is designed in a way that best serves those with other life-shortening conditions. Questions relating to non-congenital life-shortening conditions are outside the scope of this policy work. However the impact that the introduction of the proposed new withdrawal category has, including any calls for change in relation to non-congenital conditions will be monitored as part of MBIE’s regulatory stewardship activities. A question relating to other life-shortening conditions would require more research and evidence gathering in order to substantiate the evidence base. We do not currently have a good understanding of the people that might be impacted and the types of conditions that would need to be considered for withdrawal. This broader question would also require consideration of how the serious illness provisions are currently operating and to what degree these are already capturing people with other life-shortening conditions in order to make a further case for change. The discretion provided to people to choose their own retirement date may also spur calls for more discretion in regards to access to KiwiSaver for other members. However, we are of the view that because NZ Superannuation is available from the age of 65 it is fair to assume that the majority of New Zealanders will retire from this date. Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action KiwiSaver members with life-shortening congenital conditions For those in KiwiSaver the changes will ensure they can access their savings. For those yet to join, they will be able to access the scheme and the additional benefits (Government contribution and compulsory employer contributions) that KiwiSaver provides. High High KiwiSaver providers We expect that a relatively small number of current and prospective members of KiwiSaver have life- shortening congenital conditions, so any change that makes KiwiSaver accessible for people with life- shortening conditions will have a low impact on the total size and value of funds under management for a particular KiwiSaver provider Low Medium Total Monetised Benefit Unknown Unknown Non-monetised benefits Medium Medium aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 16 5.4 Is the preferred option compatible with the government’s ‘Expectations for the design of regulatory systems’? We consider the option is targeted at the group it is intending to serve, whilst also providing flexibility in approach. We consider the administration costs to be reasonable. MBIE will monitor the changes in line with its existing regulatory stewardship activities. Section 6: Implementation and operation 6.1 How will the new arrangements work in practice? Changes will be required under the KiwiSaver Act and supporting regulations. KiwiSaver providers will need to add to and change their current administration practices to accommodate assessment of the new withdrawal category. This will likely include things like the generation of application forms and industry wide guidance (currently issued by the industry body Workplace Savings) to ensure the application and assessment process is consistent across providers. Sufficient time will also be needed for KiwiSaver providers to change their disclosure documentation noting the new withdrawal category. Individuals applying for withdrawal will need to first obtain medical certification providing evidence that they have a condition that would qualify for withdrawal under the new category. The withdrawal category would be available for both existing members of KiwiSaver that have a congenital life-shortening condition, and prospective members of KiwiSaver. Media statements will be issued to publicise the changes. MBIE will contact interest groups directly to notify them of the changes. 6.2 What are the implementation risks? The intention of creating a set list of conditions that would guarantee withdrawal is so that there is certainty about who the withdrawal category applies to. This is partly to reduce the potential for excess administration costs associated with assessing all applications on a case-by-case basis. However, this approach relies on capturing the majority of conditions within this set list. Because this is a complex area, there remains a degree of uncertainty in relation to the evidence base about the type and incidence of conditions that should qualify for withdrawal, for this reason the alternative process for application has been proposed where a person applies for a withdrawal for a condition that is not on the set list. If it eventuates that there are a reasonable number of applications that get assessed under the alternative process then the administration costs for KiwiSaver providers would increase. A mitigation strategy for this is that the list of set conditions is proposed to be created in regulations so that it can be amended in cases where there are a number of applications (and approvals) for withdrawal for conditions that are not on the set list. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 17 Section 7: Monitoring, evaluation and review 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? The alternative process for assessing applications for withdrawal (in relation to conditions that are not on the set list) should provide a good evidence base regarding conditions that might also be included on the set list (so as to provide certainty for those seeking withdrawal and those administering applications for withdrawal). We have a good working relationship with those in the KiwiSaver industry that will process these applications (supervisors of KiwiSaver schemes) and so we can seek informal feedback about how the administration of the new category is working in practice. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? We do not propose a set review period for the list of congenital conditions to be reviewed and will instead rely on the information provided from the KiwiSaver industry to inform us of whether the list of congenital conditions in regulations should be reviewed. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-07-04 16:19:53 I N C O N F I D E N C E DEV-19-MIN-0176 Cabinet Economic Development Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

Introduction Under the KiwiSaver Act 2006, unless funds are withdrawn for the purchase of a first home, a member cannot access the funds in their KiwiSaver account until the later of reaching the age of eligibility for NZ Superannuation or completing five years membership of the fund \[Clause 4(2), Schedule 1\] 1 . During the public consultation phase on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, a submission was received raising the situation of Tim Fairhall. Mr Fairhall has Down syndrome, with one effect being that he is aging prematurely, which means it is unlikely he will live to 65. Instead, his life expectancy is approximately 57 and he currently expects to retire around the age of 45-48. This means that he is not expected to live long enough to be able to access the funds in his KiwiSaver account under the current restrictions on when access is permitted. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment requested a short report to address the issues raised by Mr Fairhall, covering: • Options for creating a new/different withdrawal category – including specific suggestions and advice on (1) how to word those options and (2) what/who it would capture. • A recommended process for establishing whether individuals fall within the category, and other checks and balances that should apply. 2. Consultation In preparing this report we have spoken to a number of people with an interest in KiwiSaver, as well as people able to provide guidance around congenital conditions. These include: • KiwiSaver Trustees • KiwiSaver Scheme providers • Health and disability experts • Mr Tim Fairhall, and his mother, Mrs Joan Fairhall • Actuaries in relation to life expectancy • IRD staff in relation to technical matters related to KiwiSaver • A legal expert who specialises in the area of health and disability 1 Access to KiwiSaver funds is possible in the case of serious illness or financial hardship \[Clauses 10-12, Schedule 1\] 3 In general, there was support in principle for providing earlier access than is currently permitted for KiwiSaver members with life-shortening congenital conditions. However, it is important to note that not all those spoken to were supportive of any change in access to KiwiSaver funds. During the discussions, information was provided to the authors to assist in formulating appropriate recommendations, and points raised about possible technical issues that need to be considered. 3. Background The KiwiSaver Act 2006 came into force on 1 July 2007 to provide a government-mandated scheme to assist New Zealanders to save for their retirement. While the primary purpose of the scheme is to fund a KiwiSaver member’s retirement, the scheme rules mandated by the legislation include a provision for early withdrawal in the event of serious illness, where serious illness is defined as: “an injury, illness, or disability— (a) that results in the member being totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which he or she is suited by reason of experience, education, or training, or any combination of those things; or (b) that poses a serious and imminent risk of death.” \[Clause 12(3), Schedule 1\] This provision is not suitable for the issue being considered here because it restricts the withdrawal to a point at which the KiwiSaver member is seriously incapacitated and/or facing imminent death. This means the member is unlikely to be able to utilise the funds to support an active and positive retirement, as intended by the scheme. In some cases, KiwiSaver members face a likely death before reaching the end payment date, being the later of the age of eligibility for NZ Superannuation or five years membership, as a result of a congenital condition. If they do survive to the end payment date, their quality of life will likely have deteriorated so that access to their KiwiSaver funds will offer limited value in terms of being able to enjoy an active and positive retirement. Equity suggests that members with life-shortening congenital conditions should be able to withdraw their funds at an age when they can still expect to enjoy an active and positive retirement, as do other KiwiSaver members. The population group of concern are people: • with potentially life shortening conditions that are present from birth, although they may become evident or first occur in adulthood; 4 • who have signed up to KiwiSaver with the expectation of being able to use their savings to contribute to their financial security, standard of living and quality of life when they retire; and • who will have to/want to stop work before 65 in order to enjoy these benefits but under current rules cannot access their savings. In order to address the issues raised by Mr Fairhall, we need to address the following questions: • What do we know about conditions associated with a shortened life expectancy and their prevalence? • What are some of the criteria that could/should be considered so that individuals can apply for early access to their funds? • What evidence would people be asked to provide to support an application? • What further information is needed to get a better understanding of prevalence of identified impairments, premature ageing, causes of death and impact on wellbeing and functional ability? It is important to note that this report is solely focussed on the issue of access to a member’s own KiwiSaver funds, and does not give any consideration to possible changes to NZ Superannuation entitlements. 4. Context As we consider possible changes to the KiwiSaver scheme to address the situation of members with life-shortening congenital conditions, there are a number of contextual matters that need to be considered. 4.1 UN Convention on the Rights for People with Disabilities New Zealand is a signatory to the UN Convention on the Rights for People with Disabilities (UNCPRD). The principles of the UNCRPD include non-discrimination, full and effective participation and inclusion in society, and equality of opportunity. It is important that our obligations under the convention are met under any changes that are made. 4.2 Life expectancy There is a difference in assessment of life expectancy for individuals and for cohorts, with average cohort life expectancy able to be measured with a reasonable level of accuracy; however, it is virtually impossible to do the same for an individual. Life expectancy can be assessed at any point in time, and is influenced by a range of factors, including genetics and lifestyle as well as socio-economic factors. 5 4.2.1 Increases in Life Expectancy Advances in medicine, health, genetic and molecular research have resulted in marked increases in life expectancy. Although not as easily quantifiable, changing attitudes, greater inclusion and improved social and community care have also contributed. As with all New Zealanders, people with intellectual impairments are living longer although their average age is still significantly lower than the general population. For people with Down syndrome there has been an extraordinary increase in age of death, particularly over the last 30 years. (Bittles & Glasson, 2004; Coppus et al 2013; Emerson & Hatton 2014; Stancliffe et al, 2012). Reported increases in age of death have gone from nine years in 1929 to an increase in the median age of death from 25 years to 49 years in the period from 1983-1997. The life expectancy of a child born with Down syndrome in the first decade of this century is predicted to exceed 60 years (Yang et al., 2002). 4.3 Life -shortening conditions A person’s life expectancy may be shortened by a range of conditions, some of which are congenital, such as cystic fibrosis, while others appear unexpectedly during their life-time, such as cancer. This report is restricted solely to the question of congenital conditions, including adult onset congenital conditions. 4.3.1 Poor Health and Earlier Mortality Life expectancy for any one individual varies with the nature, severity and course of the condition, and related situational and environmental factors. These include the age of diagnosis of the condition and comorbidities, access to and availability of treatment and support services. “Our observation of excess cause-specific mortality in individuals with ASD \[Autism Spectrum Disorder\] may signify an increased biological vulnerability, as well as insufficient awareness, diagnoses and treatment of comorbid diseases. In other words, people may be more vulnerable to getting certain diseases that can lead to death and doctors may not be as good a diagnosing and treating these diseases in \[this population group\].” (Hirvikoski et al, 2016) The above statement applies equally to many of the conditions that fall into the group of people with conditions associated with a shortened life span. Additionally, there is growing evidence that the social determinants of health and wellbeing – education, employment, income/poverty and social supports - are strongly associated with poorer health outcomes, lower life expectancy and higher mortality rates (Rickard and Donkin, 2018; UK Trade Union paper, 2013). Many within the group of concern will have compounded and greater risk due to increased vulnerability associated with poorer social determinants of health such as inequalities in access to education, low income and low rates of employment (Rickard & Donkin, 2018). 6 Race and ethnicity are also critical factors with Māori and Pasifika people being over- represented in groups with high rates of potentially preventable diseases and lower life expectancy. Th e Social Report 2016 produced by the Ministry for Social Development explains that the lower life expectancy for Māori reflects higher death rates than for non - Māori at nearly all ages, and notes there are a number of explanatory factors including smoking rates and socio-economic factors – the report also notes that there “is a difference \[in life expectancy\] of 7.5 years for males and 6.1 years for females” between the most and least deprived areas of New Zealand. 4.4 Positive Retirement Financial security, health, wellbeing, lifestyle, and adapting to change are key areas of consideration when thinking about retirement (Stancliffe, 2018; University of Otago Economics discussion paper No. 1703). Retiring voluntarily, planning for retirement, and engaging in a gradual transition to full retirement through bridge employment have all been associated with positive outcomes in general population studies (Wang & Shultz, 2010). To understand retirement for people with the conditions that are the focus of this discussion, consideration has to be given to their employment experiences. Many of this group will have significantly lower rates of participation in employment and very different experiences to those of the general population. Despite policy initiatives to increase participation in work for particular population groups there has been little, if any, change. While there is a lack of disability and impairment specific data, recent information illustrates the gap and extent of the problem. The Household Labour Force data for the June 2017 quarter reports a labour force participation rate of 25.2% for disabled people and 72.6% for the not disabled group. Recent research that explored retirement for individuals with intellectual and developmental impairments found that older adults with intellectual and developmental impairments do decrease their participation in paid employment as they age (Stancliffe et al., 2018). However, most adults with intellectual impairment are not in paid employment and if they are, their retirement tends to be sudden rather than a gradual reduction in work hours. These findings indicate a need for connected and coherent policies across government, including reasonable accommodations in services, what is counted as income and possible impact on entitlements to benefits. While exact circumstances may vary for those with intellectual and developmental impairments, inherited conditions, illness, injury in adulthood and so on, many of the issues will be the same. 7 5. Co nditions with a Potential for Shortened Life Expectancy There are a number of conditions that have the potential to limit life expectancy or are associated with a shortened life span. How this translates for a particular individual will vary according to a number of factors. However, there are common features associated with higher rates of earlier death and premature ageing. These include: • Greater severity of the condition (impairment/disability/disorder/disease) • Having multiple conditions/comorbidities • Where the condition is associated with a nervous system disorder (neurological, neurodevelopment impairment), particularly epilepsy • Where the condition has an increased risk of respiratory aspiration and secondary disease • Making comparisons with the right cohort/age band. The difference that this makes was illustrated earlier, as a child born with Down syndrome today has a considerably greater from birth life expectancy than of 30 years ago (see section 3.2.1 above). This applies across all the conditions discussed in this report. The impacts of these factors are illustrated in the following sections. Many of the conditions listed are congenital (present at or before birth), however, for many people the cause of their condition is unknown. 5.1 Developmental Impairments Available New Zealand information (MoH Health Indicators, 2011) on life expectancy from birth for people with intellectual impairments found males’ average life expectancy to be 59.7 years, 18 years below that of the male general population average of 78.4 and females almost 23 years below that of the female population average of 82.4 years. This is consistent with findings in similar countries. People with an intellectual impairment die 15- 20 years earlier than the average age in UK (Rickard & Donkin, 2018). As a population group, people with an intellectual impairment have a shorter life expectancy from birth and increased age specific mortality rates across all age bands. A significant downward trend in over-time mortality rates for people with intellectual impairments was reported with an equivalent to a 1.2% year-on-year reduction. For the same period in the general population in England and Wales, the decline was 2.2% for men and 1.7% for women. As such the relative inequality in mortality rates showed a modest increase (Emerson and Hatten, 2014). Mortality rates are higher for people with more severe impairments. In a UK sample of 247 people with intellectual impairments (Heslop et al, 2013), the average age of death varied by severity of impairment – 67.5 years for people with a mild learning impairment, 64 years for people with moderate, 59 years for severe, 46 years for people with profound and 8 multiple impairments. Young adults, women, people with epilepsy, people with Down syndrome and other congenital causes of intellectual impairment have also been found to have higher mortality rates. Ageing is commonly reported as starting earlier for many people with intellectual impairment. T his is seen in an earlier age of onset of medical problems related to the natural history of the specific impairment and earlier onset of some age-related diseases and frailty (Coppus, 2013). Commonly associated conditions experienced by people with intellectual impairments at higher rates than the general population include epilepsy, physical and sensory impairment, respiratory disease and dementia. People with intellectual impairment also have high rates of mental health disorders which in turn are associated with poor health and earlier death. 5.1.1 Down Syndrome A review (O’Leary et al., 2018) of early death and causes of death for people with Down syndrome found a life expectancy 28 years younger than the general population. Congenital heart anomalies and respiratory conditions were the leading cause of death and more common than in the general population. People with Down syndrome have a greater chance of developing dementia at an earlier age than people with intellectual impairment without Down syndrome and the general population. An Irish study (McCarron et al., 2014) found that 15.8% of over 40s with Down syndrome had dementia or other serious memory impairment. This compared with 6% of over 60s in the general population. In another Irish study (McCarron et al, 2011) 26.1% had developed dementia by the age of 50, 79.6% by 60 and 95.7% by age 68. 5.1.2 Fragile X Fragile X is the most commonly known inherited form of intellectual impairment. People with Fragile X have higher rates of epilepsy than the general population. Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a progressive neurological impairment that can affect some male carriers over the age of 50 (Forster-Gibson & Holden, 2017). Life expectancy for people with Fragile X is normal, and therefore it is not a life-shortening congenital condition and outside the scope of this report. 5.1.3 Cerebral Palsy For people with cerebral palsy who are able to walk and do not have complications, life expectancy is similar to that in the general population. For those who have hard to control seizures, significant respiratory difficulties, severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and who are not ambulant, there is an increased risk of early mortality with life expectancy ranging from late 20s to early 50s. (Fehlings & Hunt 2017) 9 5.2 Adult Onset Conditions 5.2.1 Multiple Sclerosis Using data from similar countries, it is estimated that one in every thousand New Zealanders has Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or approximately 4,000 people (Multiple Sclerosis Research Trust). Symptoms usually appear between the ages of 20 and 50 with a peak in the early 30’s. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people are minimally affected while others rapidly progress to being severely disabled. Most people with MS fall in between the two extremes. MS is more prevalent in people who have Northern European ancestry. MSNZ suggests that “on average, a person with MS can expect to live 7-10 years fewer than those without MS” ( https://www.msnz.org.nz/prognosis/). A small New Zealand study (Multiple Sclerosis NZ incidence study) to determine the numbers of people presenting with a first demyelinating event or new diagnosis of MS between June 1st, 2012 and May 31st, 2014 found the average age at which people developed their first symptoms was 37.8 ±11.8 years. This is older than the average age recorded in previous studies. The mean age at diagnosis was 42.2 years indicating that there is a significant delay between the onset of first symptoms and diagnosis of MS. 5.2.2 Motor Neurone Disease Motor neurone disease (MND) is the umbrella term for a group of degenerative diseases that kill muscle nerve cells, affecting people’s movement, speech and ability to breath. The incidence of MND is around 2 per 100,000 with median survival time approximately three years from symptom onset (Scotter, 2015). The study found that New Zealand had the highest mortality rate from MND of any participating country with 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people. The mortality rate is just ahead of Australia and the United Kingdom, and while further research is needed to understand what is contributing to the high death rate, it is believed there may be links to genetic predispositions, especially among Māori and Pasifika people. Waiting times for a neurology consultation can be more than a year (Professor Valery Feigin, AUT quoted in James Ensor, Newshub, 2018). A recent global study (Global Burden of Disease), in which New Zealand participated, reported the risk of developing the disease as one in 300 with most people dying within 15- 20 months of diagnosis. As a result, the current serious illness provisions are more appropriate for someone with MND. 10 5.2.3 Other Relevant Conditions Other relevant conditions that may be life-shortening and should therefore also be considered for inclusion as allowing early access to KiwiSaver funds are Huntington’s chorea and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder (FASD). There are other conditions that may result in death at an earlier age than the general population, including dementia and sequelae following different levels of severity of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). These are not congenital conditions and are therefore outside the scope of this report. Another condition outside the scope of this report is early onset (before 65) Parkinson’s disease, as there is uncertainty as to whether it is a congenital condition or the result of environmental factors. There may be value in follow up work on conditions such as these. 6. Recommendations 6.1 Early access allowed Some KiwiSaver members have congenital conditions that result in a shortened life span. Delaying access to their KiwiSaver funds until the legislated end payment date can be seen as inequitable since it means they are unable to enjoy the active and positive retirement available to ordinary members. As a signatory to the UNCRPD, New Zealand is expected to enable full and effective participation and inclusion in society and equality of opportunity for people with disabilities. Recommendation 1: The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to allow for an earlier end payment date for members with life shortening congenital conditions. 6.2 Consequential effects of early access The purpose of allowing early access is to allow the KiwiSaver member with a life-shortening congenital condition to enjoy an active and positive retirement similar to an ordinary member. In practice, the member is in effect ‘retiring’, in the same way that an ordinary member ‘retires’ on reaching the age of eligibility for NZ Superannuation. This means that the changes that occur to a member’s KiwiSaver scheme entitlements on reaching the end payment date should also apply in cases of early access, in particular ending the entitlement to the Member Tax Credit and Compulsory Employer Contributions. Recommendation 2: The introduction of an earlier end payment date should be accompanied by changes to remove the entitlement to Member Tax Credit and Compulsory Employer Contributions. 6.3 Life shortening congenital conditions There are several known congenital conditions that are recognised as being associated with a shortened life-span. Enabling early access for such conditions should be made as simple as possible. However, there may be other congenital conditions, which are less common or not yet identified, that may also be associated with a shortened life span. The range of congenital conditions that may permit early access should not be limited to currently known 11 conditions. In addition, it should be possible to remove conditions from allowing early access where medical advances mean that the condition is no longer considered life- shortening. Recommendation 3: The KiwiSaver Act 2006 should be amended to permit the making of a regulation that (a) Specifies the congenital conditions that allow early access, which may be revised from time to time. (b) Specify the end payment date associated with each condition included in the regulation. (c) Prescribes a process for assessing other congenital conditions to determine whether the condition should be added to or removed from the list of conditions permitting early access and/or permitting early access for an individual. A person with Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Huntington’s Chorea or Foetal Alcohol Syndrome is born with it. The basis of our recommendation on Multiple Sclerosis is that no one knows for certain what causes Multiple Sclerosis and more work is being done. However, Multiple Sclerosis New Zealand reports there may a risk factor at birth (which contributes to it being congenital) and environmental factors (Vitamin D, smoking or obesity) as contributors to adult onset of the condition. Recommendation 4: The congenital conditions that permit early access should include Down Syndrome, Cerebral Palsy, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington’s chorea, and Foetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder. An individual with one of these conditions who is applying for early access must apply in writing to their provider. • The application must include a medical certificate that confirms the member has a congenital condition listed in the regulation. • The medical certificate must be from a New Zealand registered medical specialist with a relevant area of expertise that includes the member’s congenital condition. • The medical conditions included in the regulations should be verified by a medical professional. Recommendation 5: An individual wishing to apply for early access to their KiwiSaver funds under this regulation as a result of a congenital condition that is not listed in the regulation must apply in writing to the manager (in the case of a restricted KiwiSaver scheme) or the supervisor (in the case of any other KiwiSaver scheme). • The application must include a medical certificate from a New Zealand registered medical specialist with a relevant area of expertise that includes the member’s congenital condition. • The medical certificate must specify what the member’s congenital condition is, it must confirm that the condition is associated with a shortened life expectancy, and it must detail the life expectancy from age 18 associated with the condition. • The medical certificate should outline the existing national or international research that forms the basis for the life expectancy assessment. 12 • A congenital condition must reduce life expectancy by at least 15 years compared to an ordinary New Zealander of the same gender to permit early access. • The date for early access will be calculated in line with recommendation 7 (see section 6.4 below). • If the life expectancy associated with the condition is such that the member’s death is likely to be within five years of the date of application, the member should consider whether it would be more appropriate to apply under the serious illness provision. Recommendation 6: The list of congenital conditions which allow early access to a member’s KiwiSaver funds should be reviewed every five years. At the time of the review, submissions from relevant support groups and/or medical experts should be invited and considered. • Submissions must include a letter of support from a New Zealand registered medical specialist with a relevant area of expertise that includes the congenital condition that is the subject of the submission. • The letter of support must confirm that the condition is associated with a shortened life expectancy, and it must detail the life expectancy from age 18 associated with the condition. • The letter of support must outline the national or international research that forms the basis for the life expectancy assessment. • A congenital condition must reduce life expectancy by at least 15 years compared to an ordinary New Zealander of the same gender to be added to the list. 6.4 End payment date for early access A key consideration is the age at which early access should be permitted for KiwiSaver members with a life-shortening congenital condition. Currently the standard end payment date for an ordinary KiwiSaver member is age 65. Using the life expectancy tables produced by Statistics NZ, a male born in 1951 at age 18 had a life expectancy of 81, which equated to an expected retirement period of 16 years, or 25% of his adult life. We suggest it would be reasonable to assess the end payment date for a KiwiSaver member with a life-shortening congenital condition to provide an equivalent proportion of time in retirement. As an example, if the life expectancy of the member is 57 years, then allowing access to their KiwiSaver funds at age 47 would provide for a retirement period of 10 years, representing 26% of their adult life. Recommendation 7: The age at which early access is permitted for any condition should be calculated to provide a retirement period that is equivalent to the expected retirement period of an ordinary member, expressed as a proportion of adult life (from age 18). • Currently the proportion of adult life that is spent in retirement for an ordinary member should be specified as 25%. 13 Recommendation 8: The proportion of adult life (from age 18) that is spent in retirement for an ordinary member should be reviewed every ten years to take account of changes in life expectancy, and the end payment date for congenital conditions revised to maintain alignment if it changes. 6.5 Application process All withdrawals from a KiwiSaver account require an application. The process associated with withdrawals for serious illness provides a foundation for a suitable process for withdrawals by members with a life-shortening congenital condition, as there is a medical element. KiwiSaver providers and trustees cannot be expected to have the requisite expertise to determine whether a member has a congenital condition that permits early withdrawal, therefore it is appropriate to require verification by an appropriate medical expert. Recommendation 9: The process to apply for the earlier end payment date will require an application by the member, including a statutory declaration, accompanied by confirmation by an appropriate registered medical specialist that the member has a condition on the regulatory list. 6.6. KiwiSaver withdrawals are not income KiwiSaver members with a life-shortening congenital condition who are not working may be in receipt of a government benefit to provide financial support. Some benefits are affected by income earned by the recipient. An ordinary KiwiSaver member, who reaches the end payment date, will usually receive NZ Superannuation which is a universal government payment, that is unaffected by the withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds. For equity reasons, it is appropriate that a member who has an earlier end payment date should be treated similarly. Recommendation 10: The withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds by a member with a life- shortening congenital condition should not be treated as income. 7. Other Issues In the course of preparing this report, we have identified a range of issues that are beyond the scope of this report, but are worth noting for possible future investigation and consideration. 7.1 Legal Capacity In some cases, the congenital conditions that are life-shortening are associated with a degree of intellectual impairment. Article 12 of the UNCRPD, ‘Equal recognition before the law’ , is relevant here. This article recognises that persons with disabilities should enjoy legal capacity on an equal basis with others in all aspects of life. This makes provisions for supports and safeguards for decision making, prevention of abuse and control of financial affairs. New Zealand is in the process of reporting to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities for our combined second and third periodic review. The UN Committee has asked the government to identify ‘measures taken to ensure that responsive 14 and tailored supports are available and affordable to all persons with disabilities to exercise their legal capacity and to manage their financial affairs, particularly for persons with psychosocial and/or intellectual disabilities (NZ Govt. draft response current to 15 August 2018, p.32). The government has also been asked to provide information about measures taken to revise the relevant laws on supported decision making that are in full conformity with Article 12. This relates to making a shift from substitute to supported decision making and impacts on how consent, competence and mental capacity are defined and operationalised in policy and practice. We note as an update on the government’s draft response on the implementation of the UNCRPD, that the Office of Disability Issues has undertaken a stocktake to identify any legislation that is not consistent with the UNCRPD. This work yielded 59 pieces of legislation, 31 of which were identified as likely contravening the Convention. Further work should be undertaken to • Consider how New Zealand’s commitment to the UNCRPD can be best reflected in the KiwiSaver framework, both currently and in relation to any changes • Consider how someone with impairments affecting their mental capacity can be appropriately safeguarded in regards to informed consent and appropriately authorised legal representatives (e.g. welfare guardian or enduring power of attorney) acting on their behalf where necessary. 7.2 Provision of Information and Advice The ability for someone like Mr Fairhall to become a KiwiSaver member under current scheme regulations raises a concern about the information and advice provided to pending and new members about the appropriateness of KiwiSaver for them. While KiwiSaver membership is generally seen as a positive option for most New Zealanders, there will always be exception. P eople must have sufficient information to be able to make a fully informed decision as to whether membership is the best decision for their particular circumstances. The exception to this would be if membership was compulsory for particular New Zealanders, such as those over the age of 18. 7.3 Prevalence of Different Conditions The most common responses to questions about prevalence rates of different impairments in New Zealand reports and literature are “we don’t know”, “it is limited and more research is needed,” “it’s too old to use” or “that it is not publicly available”. Most prevalence and incidence rates given are based on overseas research. As an example, there is no New Zealand data on prevalence and/or incidence of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome Disorder \[FASD\] but international studies suggest that around 3% of births may be affected. Further consideration could be given to: • What data is available that could be analysed to get a better understanding of age of death, cause of death, life expectancy from birth for different age bands (cohorts) for different impairments/population groups? • This information may be available and could be analysed further from MoH, MSD, ACC and integrated data sets. 15 7.4 Serious Illness Provisions The current provisions for early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds include that of “serious illness”. This raises questions as to how the criteria for serious illness are defined and operationalised. For example, does ‘permanently affects your ability to work’ include unpaid/voluntary work? 16 8.

I seek the Committee’s approval of a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) making changes to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The SOP creates a new early withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act 2006 for people with life-shortening congenital conditions. 2. The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill (the Bill) has had its first reading and is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Subject to Cabinet approval, when I publicly release a copy of the SOP, I will invite the Chair of the Finance and Expenditure to include the SOP as part of its consideration of the Bill. Policy 3. The policy to be implemented through the SOP creates a new withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act that would allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions (a condition they are born with) to withdraw their savings early for the purpose of retirement This policy was approved by the Cabinet Economic Development Committee on 26 June 2019 \[DEV-19-MIN-0176 refers\]. 4. People with life-shortening congenital conditions can join KiwiSaver to save for their retirement but, under the current withdrawal settings, cannot access their savings before the lock-in date of 65 years old (being the age of qualification for New Zealand superannuation). Having such a condition means a person may not live until 65 years old and will not be able to use their KiwiSaver savings to support their financial wellbeing in retirement. 5. There is an existing serious illness withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act but withdrawal under this category can only be made on the basis that a person is totally and permanently unable to engage in work for which they are suited or has a condition that poses a serious and imminent risk of death. This existing category would not allow people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their KiwiSaver at a point that would allow them to spend a reasonable portion of their adult life in retirement. 6. The SOP creates a new withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act allowing people with life-shortening congenital conditions to withdraw their savings before the aqc6zgqqp6 2019-08-27 15:15:40 5. age of 65. There would be two ways that a person with such a condition could qualify for early withdrawal under the new category: 6.1. A set list of conditions would be named in regulations as qualifying for withdrawal. Establishing a set list is intended to give certainty to the majority of applicants that they are eligible for withdrawal. 6.2. There would also be a process where a person could apply to their KiwiSaver provider for withdrawal for a life-shortening congenital condition that is not on the set list. This flexibility is needed because this is a complex area. This alternative process would be appropriate for people with rare congenital conditions that shorten their life below the age of 65. 7. People withdrawing under this new category will have discretion to choose their retirement date. This discretion is needed because people with life-shortening congenital conditions can have a wide variation in life expectancy. Even two people with the same condition can have very different life expectancies due to the severity of their condition and other associated medical conditions. 8. People withdrawing under this category may continue to contribute to KiwiSaver as working part-time or resuming some form of employment can be considered part of a positive retirement. However following withdrawal under this new category a person will no longer receive the government contribution or compulsory employer contribution. This is consistent with how other KiwiSaver members are treated when they reach 65 years old. Matters that may be contentious 9. The new withdrawal category is for people that are born with a condition that shortens their life Questions may be raised about whether the category should be broadened to capture a wider range of conditions. 10. I believe that opening up a broad withdrawal category in the KiwiSaver Act risks undermining KiwiSaver as a retirement savings vehicle. The current design of the KiwiSaver Act restricts early withdrawal to a limited number of circumstances in order to ensure that, for most New Zealanders, their savings will be available for them in retirement. Outstanding policy issues 11. The list of congenital conditions to be named in regulations as qualifying for withdrawal is still under development in consultation with members of the medical profession. 12. The early withdrawal of KiwiSaver funds interacts with cash asset and income tests under social assistance regulations. Early withdrawal of KiwiSaver for significant financial hardship, serious illness and first home withdrawal can impact on the amount of social assistance a person is entitled to receive. Work will be undertaken to investigate the interface issues between early withdrawal of KiwiSaver and social assistance regulations and any recommendations for change will be made by aqc6zgqqp6 2019-08-27 15:15:40 Confidential advice to Government Impact analysis 13. A Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared and submitted at the time that Cabinet considered and approved the policy to be implemented through the SOP \[DEV-19-MIN-0176 refers\]. Compliance 14. The SOP complies with the following: 14.1. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 14.2. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993. However, it should be noted that: 14.2.1. the changes to be implemented through the SOP seek to positively discriminate for people with life-shortening congenital conditions (so that KiwiSaver becomes a viable retirement for them). However, creating a withdrawal category which names certain conditions could have discriminatory effects upon those who have a congenital life- shortening condition that is not named, because the evidence burden for withdrawal may be higher. This approach has been taken to provide certainty for the majority of people, while still providing an avenue for those with other life-shortening conditions to withdraw their KiwiSaver for early retirement; 14.2.2. there are also potential discriminatory effects for those who have a non-congenital life-shortening condition. It is likely that in creating a new category for early withdrawal, it would introduce some form of inconsistency relative to other conditions that might have been included. The existing serious illness withdrawal category can be relied on by people in certain circumstances, although there may be reasons to reconsider the existing serious illness withdrawal provisions in the future; 14.3. the disclosure statement requirements (a draft revised disclosure statement for the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters Bill has been prepared and is attached to this paper); 14.4. the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 14.5. relevant international standards and obligations; and 14.6. the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation Relevant Government departments and other public bodies 15. The following agencies and departments have been consulted: the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (the Policy Advisory Group), the Treasury, Inland aqc6zgqqp6 2019-08-27 15:15:40 Revenue, the Ministry of Social Development, the Financial Markets Authority, the Commission for Financial Capability and the Ministry of Justice on the SOP as well as the policy that informed it. 16. The Office of Disability Issues, within the Ministry of Social Development, is supportive of the intent that those with life-shortening congenital conditions should be able to access their KiwiSaver funds early. However, they are concerned to ensure fairness in how this works and, as far as possible, to reduce anomalies between the treatment of different congenital life-shortening conditions. Officials will continue to work with the Office of Disability Issues on these points. The government and other parties represented in Parliament 17. Both Government caucus and coalition and support parties will be consulted on this SOP prior to its proposed release. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation process 18. The policy in the SOP was informed by a report written by two independent advisers: Dr Claire Matthews of Massey University and Ms Donna Mitchell of IHC. In developing that report, they carried out targeted consultation with people that have health and disability knowledge and expertise and those within the KiwiSaver industry. Binding on the Crown 19. The SOP makes changes to the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This Bill amends the KiwiSaver Act 2006, together with a number of other Acts. Some, but not all, of these Acts currently bind the Crown. This SOP does not alter the status quo in this respect – the amendments will follow the position of the principal Acts. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 20. The SOP will not create a new agency. 21. The SOP will not amend existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of decision making powers 22. The SOP does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated regulations 23. Regulations will be needed to ensure that all aspects of the changes are operating. These will comply with the 28 day rule. They are likely to be of small size and low complexity. aqc6zgqqp6 2019-08-27 15:15:40 Other instruments 24. The SOP does not contain any provisions empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments. Definition of Minister/department 25. The SOP does not contain any definitions of Ministers and departments because the KiwiSaver Act already does this. Commencement of legislation 26. The proposal will come into force when the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill is passed, which is intended to be by March 2020. Parliamentary stages/publicity 27. The Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill was introduced on 27 June 2019, and is intended to be passed by March 2020. It has been referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. 28. Subject to Cabinet approval, I will publicly release a copy of the SOP, and invite the Chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee to include the SOP as part of its consideration of the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, Remedial Matters) Bill. The letter to the Chair of the Finance and Expenditure Committee notes the Committee may wish to call for public submissions on the SOP. Disability Perspective 29. The SOP seeks to positively influence the wellbeing of people with disabilities in retirement. Proactive Release 30. I intend to release this paper proactively in within 30 days, subject to withholdings that are consistent with the Official Information Act 1982. The Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment will publish a copy of this paper on its website.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee NEW DUE DATE FOR NEW AND INCREASED ASSESSMENTS: ORDER IN COUNCIL Proposal 1. This paper proposes that the Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Order in Council, which will set a date that section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of income tax will come into force. Background 2. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 (the Act) was enacted on the 29 th of March 2018. This legislation included a provision to align the due date of default assessments whether these are electronically or manually issued. 2.1 The date the provision comes into force is set by Order in Council for particular tax types as they are migrated to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform START 1 and where incremental penalties have been removed from the tax type. 2.2 Once Business Transformation release 3 goes live in April 2019, income tax will meet those two requirements. This paper requests that Cabinet approve by Order in Council that the provision to align the due dates for default assessments comes into force on 8 July 2019 2 . Default assessments and due dates 3. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 (the Act) was enacted on the 29 th of March 2018. This legislation included a provision to align the due date of Commissioner initiated assessments in the absence of a return (default assessments) whether these are electronically or manually issued. 4. Where a taxpayer fails to file a tax return with Inland Revenue the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has the power to issue an assessment for the tax that she believes the taxpayer would have owed had they filed their return. This is called a default assessment. 1 Simplified Tax and Revenue Technology – Inland Revenue’s new technology platform 2 This date is the first day of the week that default assessments using the new rule could be issued. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 15:41:28 IN CONFIDENCE 4.1 There are two types of default assessment: 4.1.1 one that is system generated – this is an electronic default assessment (EDA) that is automatically issued by the computer system based on a standard formula; and 4.1.2 one that is manually issued by a staff member - this is termed a non- electronic default assessment (NDA) and is issued after consideration by an Inland Revenue staff member who uses information to make a more considered assessment of a taxpayer’s liability. 4.2 There are a number of different rules that apply to default assessments depending on whether these are EDAs or NDAs. One of these differences is the due date for payment. The due date is contained in section 142A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 4.3 The due date can range between the original due date for payment for the period in question to a new due date which is set 30 days after the issue of the default assessment depending on the type of default assessment and any subsequent amendments. This can be confusing for taxpayers and agents. 4.4 This change will simplify and standardise due dates for default assessments. The Act inserted a new section 142AB to the Tax Administration Act 1994. This section will come into force from the date appointed by the Governor- General through Order in Council, and one or more orders may be made setting different application dates for different tax types. 4.5 This provision sets all due dates in respect of default assessments and any amendments to the original due date of tax for the period. 4.6 During consultation on this change in the select committee process it was outlined that there would be two criteria to be met before a tax type could have the new provision apply: 4.6.1 the tax type must be one that had migrated to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform, START; and 4.6.2 the tax type did not have incremental penalties applying to it. The reason for this latter condition was that it could be particularly harsh to apply an original due date to taxes that continued to have incremental penalties applying. 4.7 Currently three tax types do not have incremental penalties applying: GST; income tax; and working for families debt. Working for families assessments are treated as income tax and are included in the proposed Order in Council. From April 2019 all of these will have been migrated to the START platform. GST was made subject to this provision with effect from April 2018. 4.8 The proposed Order in Council sets a date that for section 142AB in relation to income tax and comes into force on the 8 th of July 2019. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 15:41:28 IN CONFIDENCE 4.9 Other taxes will move to use this new provision as those two criteria are met and an Order in Council is made or by 1 April 2023 at the latest. Consultation 5. The provision was consulted on as part of the select committee process on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018. 5.1 The 28-day rule requires that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 5.2 I propose that the Order in Council be in accordance with this rule. Financial Implications 6. There are no financial implications to the Order in Council. Legislative Implications 7. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 8. The Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements do not apply to the proposal as it provides solely for the commencement of an existing legislative provision. Section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 was designed to come into force using an Order in Council. Human Rights 9. There are no human rights implications to this Order in Council. Gender Implications 10. There are no specific gender implications to this Order in Council. Disability Perspective 11. There are no specific disability implications to this Order in Council. Publicity 12. Following the making of the Order in Council by the Executive Council, a media statement will be issued. 13. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Order in Council is made. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 15:41:28 IN CONFIDENCE Proactive Release 14. I propose to release this Cabinet paper, and associated Order in Council, in full shortly following the publication of the signed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the attached Order in Council prescribes when section 142AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of income tax comes into force, on the 8 th of July 2019. 2. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Taxation (New Due Date for New and Increased Assessments) Commencement Order 2019.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee APPROVAL FOR RELEASE OF SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPERS Proposal 1.This paper seeks the approval of the Cabinet Legislation Committee for the release o f two Supplementary Order Papers (SOPs) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018– 19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill prior to the Bill’s Committee of the whole House stage. The proposed SOPs introduce amendments to the following legislation: Income Tax Act 2007; Tax Administration Act 1994; and Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Act 2018. 2.The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Re medial Matters) Bill (the Bill) is currently awaiting its second reading. Policy 3.The first SOP for consideration is in relation to theNe w Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy policy item. The other SOP (“other policy matters SOP”) is in relation to the other policy items listed below. The SOPs are necessary as amendments to existing legislation are required to implement the proposed policy changes in a timely manner. Policy item with prior Cabinet approval New Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: Tax benefits for monetary donations (CAB-1 8-MIN-0535, 29 October 2018) 4.Cabinet agreed on 29 October 2018 to grant theNew Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy overseas donee status to support its fundraising efforts to develop a war memorial museum and accommodation complex in Le Quesnoy, France. The Trust’s purposes are to raise awareness of New Zealand’s participation in and contribution to the First World War, through the memorial museum, and develop a programme of cultural and educational exchanges between New Zealand and France. Granting overseas donee status allows monetary donations to the Trust to be eligible for tax benefits, such as the donations tax credit for individuals or tax deductions for companies and Māori authorities. 5.In the Le Quesnoy SOP it is proposed that the Trust will have overseas donee status sta rting from 1 April 2018 and ending three years after the Taxation (Annual Rates 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-04-04 13:23:49 IN CONFIDENCE 1. for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill is enacted (expected to be March 2019). 1 Disability Support System Transformation: Policy and Regulatory Issues (SWC-18-MIN- 0107, 15 August 2018) 6. Cabinet agreed on 20 August 2018 to the direct funding of disability support pa yments, which are payments made directly to a disabled person (or a person on their behalf) to purchase disability support services or products, being treated as exempt income in the hands of the disabled person for income tax purposes. This decision was made in the context of a wider disability support system transformation agreed to by Cabinet (SWC-18-MIN-0029). The direct funding disability support payments currently covered by this income tax exemption would be: “Enabling Good Lives” Waikato payments which have been made to disabled pe ople since mid-2015; “MidCentral prototype” payments which have been made to disabled people si nce October 2018 (these payments are expected to be rolled-out nationwide post 2020); and “Flexible Respite Budgets” which will be made to unpaid full-time caregivers of disabled people to purchase relief disability support services, enabling them to take a short break from their role as full-time carer, from early 2019. 7.Exempting these payments from income tax as proposed in the other policy matters SOP ensures that recipients are not financially worse-off than they would be under other existing disability support arrangements (which are not subject to income tax as they do not involve disabled people receiving funding directly). Items not requiring Cabinet approval in the second SOP 8.I also propose that a number of other remedial changes in relation to policy issues be in cluded in the other policy matters SOP. These changes described below are consistent with their policy intent. 9.The changes are not considered significant in nature, and do not have any revenue or other fiscal effect, so reference to Cabinet is not considered necessary to confirm these changes – rather they have been approved in my capacity as the Minister of Revenue. 10.The changes of this nature that have been approved for inclusion in the other policy mat ters SOP are as noted below. Company demerger rules 11.The other policy matters SOP proposes remedial changes to the company demerger rul es, enacted by the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017–18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018. The company demerger rules are intended to provide tax relief for New Zealand taxpayers who receive shares 1 Advice from the Legislatve Design and Advisory Commitee in 2016 to Inland Revenue confrmed that the use of legislaton to implement Cabinet decisions giving overseas donee status to organisatons is appropriate. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-04-04 13:23:49 IN CONFIDENCE because of a demerger by an ASX-listed Australian company. Tax practitioners have raised technical concerns regarding the efficacy of the rules and the amendments in the other policy matters SOP are intended to ensure the demerger rules operate as intended. START tax types 12. The other policy matters SOP proposes an amendment to the definition of START t ax types in the Tax Administration Act to accommodate income tax, Working for Families tax credits and donations tax credits in the START use of money interest regime set out in s 183 of the Tax Administration Act. The proposed addition of these tax types to the definition will align with the transfer of the administration of these tax types from the FIRST computer system to the START computer system. Hybrids grandfathering 13. The other policy matters SOP proposes to broaden the grandparenting protection for ce rtain cross border debt issued by registered banks. It was always intended that where a banking group issued capital for regulatory purposes before the introduction of the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, that capital would not be subject to the hybrid rules introduced by enactment of that Bill. However, the grandparenting protection in section 35(3) of the corresponding Act are not sufficiently broad, and amendments the other policy matters SOP are intended to correct this. Updating the list of organisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 14. The other policy matters SOP also proposes remedial changes to update the list of o rganisations in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 by replacing the name “Partners Relief and Development New Zealand” with “Circuit International”, with effect from 10 April 2016. This is a housekeeping matter and provides certainty and clarity to donors who wish to check whether the charity has overseas donee status. Minor remedial and maintenance items and minor clarifications of items in the Bill 15. The other policy matters SOP proposes a number of minor remedial and ma intenance items and minor clarifications of items in the Bill. These include minor changes to clarify the remedial amendments relating to the hybrid and branch mismatch rules and the rules relating to honoraria payments received by Fire and Emergency volunteers that were recommended to be included in the Bill by officials and accepted by the Finance and Expenditure Committee, minor amendments to clarify the KiwiSaver provisions in the Bill, a minor amendment to clarify the application of the tax write off rules for qualifying individuals, and two minor amendments to the information collection and disclosure provisions inadvertently omitted in the rewrite of these provisions to ensure that the current position is maintained. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-04-04 13:23:49 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Analysis 16.A regulatory impact assessment was prepared forNew Zealand Memorial Museum Trust – Le Quesnoy: Tax benefits for monetary donations and is attached to this paper. 17.The regulatory impact analysis requirements do not apply to the other items in the SOPs, as the proposed changes result in little or no change to the policy position and/or impact on effected individuals. Compliance 18.The proposed SOPs comply with: 18.1. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 18.2. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 an d the Human Rights Act 1993; 18.3. disclosure statement requirements (a draft revised disclosure statement for th e Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018–19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill has been prepared and is attached to this paper); 18.4. principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 18.5. relevant international standards and obligations; and 18.6. the LegislationGu idelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee.

Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 21.A number of the proposals in the SOPs were subject to public consultation, which wa s undertaken in various forms. 22.Various private sector organisations were consulted on the specific matters of relevance to them. The feedback provided by these stakeholders was taken into account when finalising the proposals. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-04-04 13:23:49 IN CONFIDENCE 23.The attached draft revised disclosure statement for the wider Bill provides further information on the various parties consulted and the form in which consultation was undertaken. The government caucus and other parties represented in Parliament 24.Caucus, coalition and support party consultation will be undertaken on these SOPs pr ior to their proposed release. Binding on the Crown 25.A number of Inland Revenue Acts currently bind the Crown (including the Income Ta x Act 2007). The provisions in these SOPs do not alter the status quo in this respect. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 26.The SOPs will not create a new agency. 27.

Sensitive Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee ORDER IN COUNCIL: TAX ADMINISTRATION (REPORTABLE JURISDICTIONS FOR APPLICATION OF CRS STANDARD) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2019 Proposal 1.This paper seeks approval to submit the attached draft Order in Council (the T ax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2019) to the Executive Council. Executive Summary 2.The draft Order in Council attached to this Cabinet paper will add 30 jurisdictions to N ew Zealand’s existing list of 60 reportable jurisdictions. The reportable jurisdictions list applies for the purposes of the G20/OECD Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for Tax Purposes (AEOI) initiative. Reportable jurisdictions are those that New Zealand can exchange AEOI information with (see Annex A for details of the jurisdictions concerned). Pursuant to section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, additions to and deletions from the reportable jurisdictions list must be confirmed by Order in Council. 3.AEOI is an international initiative for cooperation between jurisdictions in the d etection and prevention of tax evasion that occurs when a person hides their wealth in offshore accounts. The ‘AEOI standard’, developed by the OECD in 2014 for this purpose and which implementing jurisdictions must incorporate into their domestic law, requires financial institutions to (i) identify accounts held or controlled by non-residents and (ii) annually report information on those non-residents to their local tax authority. The reported information is then exchanged with the tax authorities of the relevant jurisdictions under applicable tax treaties, for use in verifying that tax residents have complied with their tax obligations. 4.The G20 and OECD had set a general deadline of 30 September 2018 for j urisdictions to implement the AEOI standard and complete their first exchanges. New Zealand met that deadline, exchanging in September last year with 60 other reportable jurisdictions that had also completed all required steps for implementation. Our reportable jurisdictions list now needs to be updated in preparation for the next round of exchanges, which will take place in September 2019. 5.Updating our list to include the additional 30 jurisdictions that we expect we will need t o provide AEOI information to in September will enable New Zealand to continue to meet its treaty obligations and comply with G20/OECD requirements. 6.The Order in Council updating the list will come into force before 1 April 2019, which i s the date on which financial institutions will begin reporting to Inland Revenue for the September exchanges. However, the additions to the list will have minimal 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE impact on financial institutions. The principal effects of the expanded list will fall on Inland Revenue. This is not expected to have staffing or systems implications. Background 7. In September 2013, in response to growing concerns over the problem of offshore tax evasion, G20 Leaders tasked the OECD with managing the swift development and global implementation of a Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information for Tax Purposes (the AEOI standard or AEOI 1 ). Offshore tax evasion occurs when a person intentionally evades tax obligations by hiding their wealth in offshore accounts. 8. The OECD developed and published the AEOI standard in 2014. Broadly, the standard requires financial institutions to: 8.1 review the financial accounts they maintain (using specified due diligence procedures) to identify those held or, in certain circumstances, controlled by non-residents, and 8.2 report identity and financial account information, in respect of those non-residents, to their local tax administration. 9. Tax administrations are required to exchange the reported information with the relevant jurisdictions of residence under applicable tax treaties. Those jurisdictions will then use the information to verify that their residents have fully complied with their tax obligations. 10. The cycle of reporting and exchange is to be repeated on an annual basis. 11. 99 jurisdictions were required by the G20 and OECD to implement the AEOI standard in time to complete first exchanges of information by 30 September 2018 at the latest. This includes all G20 and OECD member countries (therefore including New Zealand) and all other jurisdictions identified as having or operating as an international finance centre. The OECD’s monitoring agency, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes (the Global Forum), is conducting peer reviews and other monitoring to ensure compliance with these commitments. 12. To date, two such jurisdictions committed to complete first exchanges in 2018, three more have Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 committed to 2019, four to 2020, and a further 45 have made commitments without any specific timeframe. 13. New Zealand completed its implementation (enacting legislation to incorporate the AEOI standard Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 1 The AEOI standard comprises several elements. The elements that are relevant to financial institutions are often collectively referred to as the ‘Common Reporting Standard’, CRS, or CRS standard. A reference to the CRS standard appears in the title of the draft Order in Council that this paper refers to. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE into the Tax Administration Act 1994, building Inland Revenue’s administrative systems and processes, and arranging for financial institutions to comply with their new obligations and report information) and conducted its first exchanges before the imposed deadline. Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 14. The AEOI standard requires an implementing jurisdiction to establish and maintain a list of the jurisdictions that it will provide AEOI information to. These are known as reportable jurisdictions. Pursuant to section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, additions to and deletions from New Zealand’s reportable jurisdictions list must be confirmed by Order in Council. It was always envisaged that maintaining the list using this approach would require periodic amending Orders, particularly in the first few years of AEOI exchanges. 15. Importantly: 15.1 Because of the way the implementation legislation and various legal instruments for exchange are structured, New Zealand can only provide AEOI information to jurisdictions that are included on its reportable jurisdictions list. 15.2 Conversely, New Zealand has a prima facie treaty obligation to exchange AEOI information with every listed jurisdiction for which information on residents of the jurisdiction has been reported to us by our financial institutions. 15.3 However, built in safeguards in the legal instruments apply to effectively ‘switch off’ the treaty obligation to exchange in prescribed circumstances – for example if OECD monitoring detects that a jurisdiction has failed to fully implement the AEOI standard and is therefore not able to send us information on a reciprocal basis. 15.4 Moreover, as a final safeguard, our legislation provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to immediately suspend a jurisdiction from the reportable jurisdictions list if necessary. This power could be exercised, for example, if evidence of a privacy breach occurring in a particular jurisdiction came to light just prior to our annual exchange deadline (leaving insufficient time to remove the jurisdiction from the list by Order in Council). 15.5 Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE 16. Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 17. The next round of exchanges is due to be completed by 30 September 2019. In preparation, we have now conducted a further review to determine which additional jurisdictions should be added. Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 18. This approach will involve adding 30 jurisdictions to the list of reportable jurisdictions, increasing the total number up from 60 to 90 (see Appendix A for details, and for a reconciliation of the numbers). 19. The additions to the list should be made and publicised prior to 1 April 2019, which is the date on which by financial institutions commence their AEOI reporting to Inland Revenue this year. Implications of the change 20. The addition of 30 jurisdictions will primarily only have implications for Inland Revenue (It will increase the number of jurisdictions that Inland Revenue is able to provide information to in September this year). No change to Inland Revenue’s systems or staffing levels is required to administer this increased number of outward exchanges. 21. Note that the reportable jurisdictions list is only relevant for the purposes of sending information to other jurisdictions. Withheld under section 6(a) of the Official Information Act 1982 22. For the majority of New Zealand financial institutions, the additions to the list will have no implications. This is because New Zealand financial institutions are currently collecting information in respect of all non-resident account holders and controlling persons, rather than focussing on identifying residents of reportable jurisdictions. Moreover, our rules provide financial institutions with a choice of reporting solely on residents of reportable jurisdictions or, as a compliance cost 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE reduction measure, of reporting all information that they have collected on non-residents. We understand that all banks and most other financial institutions are adopting this wider (all non-residents) reporting option. 23. For financial institutions, the changes to the list of reportable jurisdictions will therefore only have implications for those that choose to report information to Inland Revenue solely in respect of residents of reportable jurisdictions. 24. My officials have previously sought feedback from such financial institutions and other AEOI stakeholders as to whether the changes to the list of reportable jurisdictions would create difficulties or concerns. Only two responses were received, both of which stated that the additions would not create any issues. 25. Further changes to the reportable jurisdictions list will be required in the foreseeable future, as additional jurisdictions join the AEOI initiative or, if necessary, to remove recalcitrant jurisdictions. Such changes will necessitate at least one additional Order in Council per year for the next few years. Timing and 28-day rule 26. As noted, the attached Order in Council needs to come into force before 1 April 2019. The additions to the list will then apply for the purposes of reporting to Inland Revenue from that date by those New Zealand financial institutions that choose to report information to Inland Revenue solely in respect of residents of reportable jurisdictions. It will also apply for the purposes of the exchanges to be undertaken by Inland Revenue in September 2019. 27. No waiver of the 28-day rule needs to be sought. Compliance 28. The Order complies with: 28.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 28.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 28.3 relevant international standards and obligations; and 28.4 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 29. The Order generally complies with principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993. However, all exchange of information under tax treaties inherently conflicts with some of the privacy principles set out in that Act (such as the limitation imposed, at section 6 of the Act, on the disclosure of personal information). For this reason, section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has historically authorised the Privacy Act 1993 to be overridden for exchanges of information under tax treaties. Regulations Review Committee 30. I am not aware of any grounds on which the Regulations Review Committee might draw the Orders to the attention of the House under Standing Order 318. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 31. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order is ready to be submitted to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 32. A Regulatory Impact Assessment is not required. The Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements do not apply as this Order in Council will not involve creating, amending or repealing legislation and provides solely for the operation of existing legislative provisions. Publicity 33. Notification of new Orders in Council is given in the New Zealand Gazette. In addition, section 226D requires the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to publicise changes to the New Zealand list of reportable jurisdictions. The Commissioner will update the list of reportable jurisdictions on the Inland Revenue website and notify by email financial institutions and other AEOI stakeholders who have registered. Proactive Release 34. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in part within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Certain information will be withheld to protect New Zealand’s international relationships. Consultation 35. Consultation on the reportable jurisdictions list was undertaken during the development of the initial list of reportable jurisdictions in 2017. When the list was previously amended financial institutions and AEOI stakeholders were asked to provide feedback on whether adding additional reportable jurisdictions would create any difficulties or concerns. No issues were raised with us. The Treasury, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet have been informed of the proposed amendment. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note the New Zealand legislation incorporating the G20/OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information in Tax Matters (the AEOI standard) requires that a list of reportable jurisdictions be maintained, and amended as needed by Order in Council; 2. note that, pursuant to section 226D of the Tax Administration Act 1994, additions to the reportable jurisdictions list must be made by Order in Council; 3. note that New Zealand’s existing list of reportable jurisdictions comprises 60 jurisdictions; 4. note that 30 additional jurisdictions now need to be added, for the exchanges that New Zealand will need to make in September this year; and 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 10:24:53 SENSITIVE 5. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Reportable Jurisdictions for Application of CRS Standard) Amendment Regulations 2019.

It is proposed that the Order in Council applies to income tax (including ancillary taxes, such as PAYE) and gaming machine duty refunds made from 1 April 2019. Policy 3. On 3 April 2018 the Cabinet agreed to implementing mandatory direct crediting of income tax refunds (CAB-18-MIN-0122.01 refers). 4. This proposal would be implemented through an Order in Council under the existing legislative framework in sections 184A and 184B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA). This framework provides for progressive implementation of mandatory direct crediting for tax types administered by Inland Revenue. It was enacted with effect of 1 April 2000 to benefit taxpayers by eliminating time delays associated with the postal system and costs related to the banking of cheques. Inland Revenue would also benefit from reduced administration costs. 5. Section 184A of the TAA allows for exemptions when direct crediting would cause undue hardship or is impracticable. 6. Progressive implementation for the various tax types through Orders in Council was to allow Inland Revenue the necessary flexibility to determine the dates when direct crediting of refunds relating to different tax types could best be implemented in terms of system readiness and to give taxpayers time to provide Inland Revenue with up - to-date bank account details and taxpayers with complex business activities more time to make arrangements and adapt their processes. The intend was that the Commissioner would eventually be required to direct credit all refunds into taxpayers’ bank accounts. 7. Compulsory direct crediting was implemented for goods and services tax (GST) refunds as part of moving the administration of GST to Inland Revenue’s new technology platform in the first stage of its Business Transformation programme, as the new technology platform has modernised and improved information flows, self- service online services and more automated processes. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 15:53:10 IN CONFIDENCE 8. The administration of income tax is to be moved to the new technology platform in the next release planned for April 2019. The administration of ancillary taxes, such as PAYE and fringe benefit tax, was moved to the new platform in April 2018. It is therefore a good opportunity to implement direct crediting for income tax refunds (including ancillary taxes) as part of this transition. 9. In addition, the administration of gaming machine duty has already been moved to the new technology platform in April 2018. However, direct crediting under section 184A of the TAA was not implemented at this time as ancillary taxes are a subset of income tax. 10. I recommend that the Committee agree to including gaming machine duty refunds in the scope of the Order in Council, so that direct crediting under section 184A of the TAA applies to all tax types administered in the new technology platform. 11. I also recommend that the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Income Tax and Gaming Machine Duty Refunds) Order 2019 is made implementing direct crediting under section 184A of the TAA for income tax and gaming machine duty refunds made from 1 April 2019. Timing and 28-day rule 12. I propose that direct crediting of income tax and gaming machine duty refunds under section 184A of the TAA applies to refunds made from 1 April 2019. The Order would therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 13. The Order complies with: 13.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 13.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 13.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 13.4 relevant international standards and obligations; and 13.5 the Legislation Guidelines, which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 14. No statutory prerequisite exists for making the Order. Regulations Review Committee 15. There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 16. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 15:53:10 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Analysis 17. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the regulatory decisions sought in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not for profit entities. Publicity 18. I intent to issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 19. The new Order in Council will be published in the New Zealand Gazette and on Inland Revenue’s website. Inland Revenue will also publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 20. I propose to release this Cabinet paper, and associated Order in Council, in full shortly following the publication of the signed Order in Council in the New Zealand Gazette. Consultation 21. The Treasury, Inland Revenue and the Parliamentary Counsel Office have been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that on 3 April 2018 the Cabinet agreed that Inland Revenue should issue income tax refunds by direct credit, unless that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable (CAB-18-MIN-0122.01 refers); 2. agree that Inland Revenue should issue gaming machine duty refunds by direct credit, unless that would result in undue hardship or is not practicable; 3. note that the Tax Administration (Direct Credit of Income Tax and Gaming Machine Duty Refunds) Order 2019 will give effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 1 and 2 above; 4. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the (Direct Credit of Income Tax and Gaming Machine Duty Refunds) Order 2019; 5. note that the (Direct Credit of Income Tax and Gaming Machine Duty Refunds) Order 2019 will come into force on 1 April 2019.

Office of the Minister Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee EXTENDING THE COMMISSIONER OF INLAND REVENUE’S CARE AND MANAGEMENT ROLE Proposal 1. This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to introduce a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. The Supplementary Order Paper re-introduces a proposal to extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s care and management role by enabling her to resolve legislative anomalies. 2. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill has had its first reading and is currently being considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee. Policy 3. The proposal provides the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with the ability to temporarily mitigate the effect of legislative anomalies (being circumstances where tax legislation cannot be interpreted in a manner which is consistent with the policy intent) by seeking a modification (through an Order in Council process) or through using an exemption-making power. 4. Cabinet agreed to the original proposal as part of a suite of changes to modernise core components of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (CAB-18-MIN-0103 refers). The original proposal was then included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill as introduced. It was removed from the bill at the recommendation of the Finance and Expenditure Committee pending further work on the draft legislation between Inland Revenue and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 5. The revised legislative drafting contained in the attached Supplementary Order Paper, which has been developed with input from the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee, reflects the original policy recommendations agreed to by Cabinet but with minor changes. I propose the following changes as a result of further work between my officials, submitters from the private sector, and the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee: 1.1 Removing the Commissioner’s determination-making power. The Order in Council process and ability for the Commissioner to resolve legislative anomalies using an exemption-making power is still proposed. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 In Confidence 1.2Making exemptions issued under the proposed power for the Commissioner legislative instruments and disallowable instruments. This means that any changes proposed under the power will be subject to review by the Regulations Review Committee and can be disallowed by the House of Representatives. 1.3Allowing an Order in Council to modify the application of a tax law for up to four income years before it comes into force. The previous legislative drafting did not specify what period taxpayers could apply a modification for before it came into force. 6.For taxpayers, policy outcomes remain largely unchanged from the original proposal. Background 7.New Zealand’s tax system is very complex, and it undergoes significant change regularly. The nature and volume of the tax law changes mean that unforeseen or unintended outcomes (legislative anomalies) often arise. This is likely to continue to be the case into the future given the increasing complexity of tax law and rapidly evolving business practices. 8.Ideally, any such anomalies would be remedied by an amending Act, given the constitutional importance of tax and the certainty that primary legislation gives to both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. In some cases, this will be both necessary and achievable. However, under the current approach, it takes on average 670 days to remedy a legislative anomaly through primary legislation once it has been identified as needing legislative change. During the time it takes for an anomaly to be remedied, it is possible taxpayers may be required to file different returns spanning multiple periods. This can cause uncertainty and increases compliance costs for taxpayers. 9.The Commissioner is charged with the care and management of the tax system. A key aspect of the care and management of the tax system is applying and explaining the law to taxpayers. Generally, tax law can be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the policy intent. Sometimes when tax law cannot be interpreted consistently with the policy intent, this can tie up Commissioner and taxpayer resources in cases and outcomes that are inconsistent with both parties’ practices and outcomes. This situation is also inconsistent with the objective of helping taxpayers to get it right from the start. 10.The Commissioner’s care and management role has been interpreted as limited to providing her with administrative flexibility regarding allocating her resources to fulfil her statutory duties. Care and management does not provide flexibility regarding legislative anomalies, being instances when the policy intent is not properly reflected in the legislation. 11.I propose a more flexible approach to dealing with situations when the legislation does not align with the intended policy (that is, there is a legislative anomaly). Specifically, I propose extending the Commissioner’s care and management role by providing the ability to have the legislative anomaly resolved using an Order in Council process or allowing the Commissioner to issue exemptions to mitigate the 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 effect of a legislative anomaly. This will reduce taxpayers’ compliance costs in dealing with these legislative anomalies. 12.As with the original proposal, the Order in Council process would be used where the issue was sensitive or had fiscal implications. The exemption making power would be used where there were negligible fiscal implications and the issue was not sensitive, but it was still important to provide certainty for taxpayers. Exemptions would be for provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts, and would specify an alternative means of complying with the provisions from which taxpayers are being exempted from. 13.Examples of when the discretion could be used include: when a drafting error means that the provision is inconsistent with the intended policy, and when a gap in the legislation is discovered that means there is uncertainty as to whether the legislation is consistent with the policy intent. In these situations, the discretion would provide a temporary bridge to allow taxpayers to adopt an approach that is consistent with the intended policy. This would avoid the Commissioner and taxpayers having to commit resources to the unintended outcomes. 14.Consistent with the original proposal, the power would be subject to the following safeguards: 1.4Changes made under the power must not be inconsistent with the policy intent. I consider this an appropriate limitation on the power as it ensures that it cannot be used to create new policy settings without going through the full policy process. 1.5Optional application by taxpayers. Taxpayers are in the best position to determine whether a modification or an exemption provides them with a more favourable outcome than the black-letter law. I note this approach is supported the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee and submitters on the proposal. 1.6Modifications and exemptions would apply generally for a class of taxpayers or set of circumstances. The power would not be able to modify the application of a tax law for a particular taxpayer, but rather is limited to groups or classes of taxpayers to ensure it is only used to remedy objectively determined legislative anomalies. 1.7Automatic expiration of changes made using the power after three years. I consider this strikes an appropriate balance between providing taxpayers with certainty and allowing sufficient time for matters to be resolved through amendments to primary legislation. 1.8Consistency with the existing care and management principles. This means that, in the first instance, the exercise would have regard to the importance of promoting voluntary compliance, and the compliance costs that would otherwise be incurred by taxpayers. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 1.9Before a modification or exemption is made, a public consultation process must be undertaken on the proposed modification or exemption. I recommend that the consultation process can be dispensed with in cases of urgency. Impact Analysis 15.A Regulatory Impact Analysis was completed for the original proposal. However, as minor changes have been made to the preferred option, a revised version of the original Regulatory Impact Analysis is attached. 16.The internal reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the revised Regulatory Impact Analysis prepared by Inland Revenue and associated supporting material. The reviewer considers that the revised Regulatory Impact Analysis meets the quality assurance requirements. Compliance 17.The proposed Supplementary Order Paper complies with: 17.1the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 17.2the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 17.3disclosure statement requirements (a draft revised disclosure statement for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill has been prepared and is attached to this paper); 17.4principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 17.5relevant international standards and obligations; and 17.6the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation 18.The proposal has been subject to public and other consultations in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process as part of its original introduction to the previous bill. Relevant government departments and other public bodies 19.The Legislation Design and Advisory Committee (LDAC) have been involved extensively in the revised legislative drafting of the proposal and have seen the proposed legislative drafting. LDAC have provided the following comment: Clauses 6D and 6E propose to delegate powers to modify the application of the Inland Revenue Acts, which are commonly referred to as Henry VIII provisions. Further, in the case of modification by Order in Council, the modifications can have retrospective effect of up to 4 years. As a consequence, the powers are highly unusual. We note the policy rationale for these powers stated at paragraphs 7 to 11. LDAC’s view is that the proposal seeks to limit the scope of the powers to that which is necessary to achieve their policy objective of addressing remedial issues with Inland Revenue legislation and to 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 ensure fair outcomes for taxpayers. Key limits are that the modifications and exemptions must be minor and consistent with Parliament’s intention (rather than allowing substantive changes to policy). Appropriate safeguards on the exercise of the powers have been included, including ensuring the right person exercises the powers, ensuring the instruments are time limited and optional for taxpayers to apply, and providing clear consultation obligations. Given that the remedial modifications may apply to past income years, it is particularly important that they will be optional for taxpayers to apply. LDAC notes that there is a risk that, if the powers are overused in practice, they would undermine the rule of law, good legislative design, and stewardship of Inland Revenue’s primary legislation. Retrospective effect in particular has the potential to increase complexity in application, undermine the accessibility of the law, and have unintended effects. LDAC considers that the requirement to consider, in each case, whether the power is the most appropriate way of addressing or resolving the issue, and to limit the modification to what is needed to address the issue, limits these risks. LDAC, however, recommends in addition that the use of these powers is closely monitored over time to ensure these risks are managed effectively. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation process 20.Since the proposal was removed from the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, my officials have undertaken further consultation with Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the New Zealand Law Society, Corporate Taxpayers Group and Russell McVeagh on the revised drafting. The additional consultation resulted in a number of changes outlined in this paper. The government caucus and other parties represented in Parliament 21.Caucus, coalition and support party consultation will be undertaken on this Supplementary Order Paper prior to its proposed release. Binding on the Crown 22.A number, but not all, of the Inland Revenue Acts currently bind the Crown. This Supplementary Order Paper does not alter the status quo in this respect – the amendments will follow the position of the principal Acts. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 23.The Supplementary Order Paper will not create a new agency. 24.The Supplementary Order Paper will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of decision-making powers 25.The Supplementary Order Paper does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 Associated regulations 26.No regulations are required to bring the proposed legislation into operation. Other instruments 27.The Supplementary Order Paper does include provisions empowering the making of legislative instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments and disallowable instruments. This is because the proposal relies on the ability for the Commissioner to seek (via an Order in Council process on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue) modifications or issue exemptions relating to provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts. 28.As the proposal relies on the ability to make modifications to the application of, or exempt taxpayers from, provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts, I consider it appropriate that Parliament has the ability to disallow modifications or exemptions made under the powers proposed. Definition of Minister/department 29.The Supplementary Order Paper does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Parliamentary stages 30.I propose the Supplementary Order Paper should be released as soon as possible following Cabinet approval and before the 6 th of March 2019, which is the date that my officials provide a briefing to the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 31.Releasing the Supplementary Order Paper before the 6 th of March will allow the Finance and Expenditure Committee to consider the Supplementary Order Paper as part of the Bill. It will also allow the Committee to call for public submissions if they choose to. 32.The provisions that extend the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s care and management role are proposed to come into force on the date the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill receives Royal assent. Financial Implications 33.The proposed amendment will have no fiscal impact. Any fiscal impact of regulations or exemptions made under the empowering provision will need to be considered at the time, but are expected to be minor. Legislative Implications 34.Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994. 35.If approved, I propose including the legislative changes resulting from these recommendations in a Supplementary Order Paper to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. Human Rights 36.There are no human rights implications associated with the proposed amendment. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-05 10:42:38 Proactive Release 37.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1.note that Cabinet previously agreed to a proposal to enable new processes to allow exemptions to be issued to address legislative anomalies, either by way of an Order in Council, a determination or an administrative power of the Commissioner (recommendation 14 in DEV-18-MIN-0019 refers); 38.agree to rescind the decision referred to in paragraph 1; and instead replace it with agreement to a proposal to enable new processes to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to address legislative anomalies by way of an Order in Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, or through the use of an exemption- making power; 39.agree that exemptions issued by the Commissioner under the proposed power should be legislative instruments and disallowable instruments to ensure that these are subject to review by the Regulations Review Committee and can be disallowed by the House of Representatives; 40.agree that modifications made by an Order in Council can, depending on the circumstances, apply to taxpayers for a period including up to the most four recently completed income years from when the modification comes into force; 41.note that the attached Supplementary Order Paper is proposed to be released and considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill; 42.note that the Supplementary Order Paper makes substantive amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994; 43.approve the Supplementary Order Paper for release, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 44.delegate the Minister of Revenue authority to make minor amendments of a technical nature to the measures recommended in this paper without further reference to Cabinet; 45.agree that the Supplementary Order Paper should be released as soon as practicable following Cabinet agreement, and at the latest before the 6 th of March 2019; 46.note that this Cabinet paper, and the associated Cabinet minute will be released on Inland Revenue’s website.

It: •summarises the feedback from the consultation undertaken on the draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information; and •introduces a paper for you to present to the Cabinet Legislation Committee requesting approval of the regulations. Why the regulations are needed 2.These regulations form part of the recent changes to the provision of PAYE information to Inland Revenue which generally requires employers to submit their employment income information within two to ten working days of each payday (payday reporting). Payday reporting changes will become mandatory for employers from 1 April 2019. 3.The changes will provide Inland Revenue with more timely information on employment income for employees, however it will also reduce the time available to employers to identify and correct any errors in this information before it is sent to Inland Revenue. 4.The regulations support the payday reporting changes by providing for the methods for employers to make adjustments and correct errors in employment income information. 5.A consultative draft version of the regulations was provided to a group of stakeholders for feedback on the workability of the regulations in September 2018. 6.The main themes of these submissions are summarised in the body of this report. 7.These regulations have been drafted to bring into effect related proposed legislation that is included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. To ensure the regulations appropriately reflect the proposed legislation we have had experienced delays in finalising the draft regulations. 8.A draft copy of the regulations is attached to the draft Cabinet paper, these regulations are still subject to PCO’s proof-reading process ahead of certification and lodgement alongside the Cabinet paper. 9.We consider that it is appropriate to seek a waiver in order to allow the regulations to enter into force on 1 April 2019. This will provide the option for employers to use In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 2 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE the additional methods of error correction from the same time that payday reporting become mandatory. The current guidance given to employers is to correct any errors in the original submission of information; this remains an option for all types of errors under the regulations. Next steps 10. The draft regulations will be finalised and submitted to Cabinet Legislation Committee for their meeting on 19 March 2019. Following Cabinet Legislation Committee, the regulations will be submitted to Cabinet for approval, and Executive Council for signing. 11. You may wish to issue a media statement once the regulations have been signed. 12. The regulations will come into force on 1 April 2019.

Agreed/ Not agreed Mike Nutsford Policy Manager, Policy and Strategy 28 February 2019 Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 4 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE Background 13. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 included changes to the way employers reported employment income information to Inland Revenue. 14. The amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA) include a regulation- making power that enables the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue, to make regulations to provide for the correction of errors in employment income information, following appropriate consultation. This occurred as part of the release of the officials’ issues paper “PAYE error correction and adjustment” in August 2017. 15. We previously reported to you in February 2018 seeking Cabinet approval for the policy settings for the permitted means of error correction for employment income information (IR2018/006 refers). We also sought approval to carry out consultation with a limited group of stakeholders on a draft copy of these regulations. 16. The policy principles underlying the error correction regulations were approved by Cabinet in March 2018. The regulations also reflect changes to the taxable status of PAYE overpayments included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Modernising Tax and Remedial Matters) Bill 2018. 17. The regulations also take into account proposed changes to the treatment of PAYE overpayments contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the ARMTARM Bill). Due to the timing of this Bill, these provisions of the regulations were drafted subsequent to the draft version provided for consultation. 18. During drafting we identified a subset of errors which require specific treatment. This is for errors which affect the amount of a student loan repayment obligation, KiwiSaver contributions or child support deductions that have not resulted from an incorrect interpretation and calculation of the gross PAYE income payment. In order to mitigate system errors due to corrections involving social policy deductions, we have restricted the ability to correct in subsequent periods for interpretation errors involving social policy deductions which don’t follow from an error in the gross PAYE income payment. 19. The consultation version of the regulations was drafted on this basis. An updated regulatory impact statement is attached to this report. 20. The key changes to the regulations following feedback on consultation is to provide more clarity between which provisions apply for different types of errors. The regulations have been amended to include examples and a flowchart in the ex planatory note to assist in the application of the regulations. 21. The empowering provision for regulations Section 23N of the TAA comes into force 1 April 2019, section 11 of the Interpretation Act permits regulations to be made in advance of the power coming into force if the exercise of power is “necessary or desirable to bring, or in connection with bringing, an enactment into operation”. To have the regulations in place by 1 April 2019, it is necessary to exercise the power in section 23N ahead of its commencement date. It is desirable to bring the regulations into effect at the same time as mandatory payday reporting requirements to provide clarity for employers on how to correct errors. 22. A further set of speaking notes has been attached for your use in support and coalition party consultation. In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 5 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE Feedback from consultation 23. We sent a copy of the draft regulations to 13 organisations. We received responses from 11, with the points raised generally fitting under one of the below categories: • clarity between the types of errors; • when an error may be reported in a subsequent period; • concerns around implementation and application timing; and • minor drafting points. 24. The key feedback was: a perceived lack of clarity around what regulations apply to each type of error, whether there was more scope for correction in subsequent returns, and a concern that the proposed application date of 1 April 2019 did not allow enough implementation time. Feedback received not resulting in changes 25. Two submitters were concerned that the application date is the same as the move to mandatory payday reporting. One suggested that it would be better for error correction to come into force after the payday reporting changes have bedded in. 26. Two submitters expressed concern around the timing for the regulations to come into effect and the software development that would be required to support them. One submitter raised a concern that there is no allowance for payroll software that does not allow original returns to be amended. 27. The regulations continue the status quo of error correction, allowing all errors to be corrected in the original submission. The ability to include adjustments in subsequent returns (the “netting off” approach) is an option but is not required. Employers can continue correcting the original return after 1 April 2019 and use the option to net off adjustments in subsequent returns when software provides for that option. 28. We do not recommend delaying the application date of the regulations, as they are intended to provide clarity to employers and reduce compliance costs. Adjustments in a subsequent period 29. Three submitters queried the threshold that determines whether an adjustment in a subsequent return is a permitted method of correction in relation to interpretation errors. The rationale for capping the amount of adjustments which may be made in a subsequent period is to draw a distinction between significant errors and small errors which may be corrected in a subsequent return to reduce compliance costs. 30. Two of those submitters suggested revisiting this threshold in two to three years’ time to ensure it meets the right balance between reducing compliance costs and ensuring significant errors are allocated to the right period. Officials will monitor this threshold. There is scope to amend the regulations in the future to increase this if the compliance costs are seen to outweigh the impact of correcting larger errors in subsequent returns. 31. Two submitters asked if it would be possible to make adjustments to incorrectly deducted social policy obligations in subsequent periods. Social policy errors should be corrected in the original period to ensure that they are allocated to the right period and that existing rules (for example, significant under or over-deductions for student loans) are not affected. However, officials will revisit whether it is In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 6 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE appropriate to allow adjustments in future periods for some circumstances once social policy has been incorporated into Inland Revenue’s new computer system. Feedback received resulting in changes 32. The main changes to the regulations following consultation are: • clarifying which regulations apply to different error types; • inclusion of a flowchart and examples in the explanatory notes; and • minor drafting clarifications 33. In addition to the changes arising from consultation, we have revised the regulation section regarding when an employer makes an overpayment of PAYE income. This reflects a change proposed in the ARMTARM Bill regarding the status of overpayments of PAYE-related payments. Clarity on how to apply regulations 34. Five submitters queried how different regulations would apply to different errors. To clarify the regulations, we have made several changes to help ensure the they are easy to follow and apply to different error types. 35. The regulations distinguish error type on the basis of which category of employment income information is affected. The categories which affect which methods are available are whether: • the PAYE income payment amount is incorrect • the PAYE and ACC levy deducted is incorrect • student loan repayment, KiwiSaver or Child Support deductions are incorrect, and • any of the amounts reported to us in the employment income information do not accurately reflect the amount that was deducted and/or paid to Inland Revenue. 36. If an error includes amounts relating to KiwiSaver, student loan repayments or child support deductions, the original submission must be amended. This is to ensure these deductions are allocated to the appropriate period. 37. We consider there should be more clarity in the regulations by way of a flowchart and key examples in the explanatory note to the regulations. In addition, guidance will be released by Inland Revenue in a Tax Information Bulletin once the regulations are made. 38. The legislative changes to the taxable treatment of PAYE overpayments will also have guidance included in the Tax Information Bulletin. Clarifications to be addressed in further guidance 39. One submitter also sought clarification on how the regulations would intersect with current penalty provisions in the TAA. 40. The regulations specify that an employer must correct an error as soon as “reasonably practicable”. This is intended to provide guidance in the regulations as to when an employer should correct an error without providing a specific deadline. This is because it may be difficult to determine when an error as discovered by the In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 7 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE employer and some errors may take more time to correct than others if they are more complex. 41. If an earlier return is amended to correct for when PAYE was under-withheld, this would count as a voluntary disclosure under section 141G of the TAA. Further guidance and examples about how this will apply will be included in a Tax Information Bulletin. 42. New Schedule 3 specifies the record-keeping requirements for employers and PAYE intermediaries. This includes the details of a PAYE income payment and the amount of any tax or other deductions that are withheld. 43. Additional points raised in the feedback included wanting clarification around how the regulations worked with penalties and record-keeping provisions, and queries around the timing provision. 44. Submitters were generally supportive of the use of regulations to provide clarity for how to correct errors. Minor drafting changes 45. Following consultation, we have made several minor drafting changes to aid in the clarity of the regulations. Inclusion of a new overpayments provision 46. The regulations have been amended to incorporate changes to the taxable treatment of PAYE overpayments included in the ARMTARM bill . This bill amends the Income Tax Act 2007 and the TAA to clarify that overpayments of PAYE income should be subject to PAYE. This bill is currently still going through parliamentary processes, but is expected to be enacted in March 2019. 47. Making PAYE income overpayments subject to PAYE ensures that any overpayments made to employees and not recovered by the employer are subject to tax and any other applicable deductions under PAYE. The proposed amendment leaves the unrepaid amount on the employee’s record of income with Inland Revenue, which is used in determining obligations such as the rate of tax on secondary income and entitlements such as Working for Families tax credits. The overpayment would have been taxable if it had been correctly paid and if it is not repaid it remains available to the recipient to spend. 48. The regulations permit the employer to choose one of the following ways to report an overpayment which was treated as a PAYE income payment by: 48.1 amending the original return to record the correct values; or 48.2 adjusting in a subsequent period by netting off the overpayments and any associated deductions against the values in a later payday. 49. The provision also allows for the employer to treat an overpaid amount as repaid, provided it is repayable to the employer under an agreement between the employer and the employee. Where this is the case, the employer may choose which option to correct the error. 50. If the employer wishes to correct the overpayment in one lump sum, for example by correcting the original submission, the regulations permit this approach. However, if the employee subsequently breaches the agreement to repay, the employer must make an additional correction to increase the PAYE income payment by the amount of the remaining unpaid overpayment (an upwards adjustment). In Confidence IR2019/006: Cabinet paper -Draft regulations for the Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information Page 8 of 13 IN CONFIDENCE 51. The amendments to the TAA and the regulations describe what constitutes a breach of repayment obligations. A breach is considered to be when the employee has breached the agreement (e.g. not complied with the repayment schedule) and not remedied this within two months, or if the employer considers that the employee will not comply with the agreement in the future. This provides flexibility for the employer’s discretion as to when it is appropriate to consider the agreement as breached. Consultative requirement 52. The regulation-making power under section 23N of the TAA provides that appropriate consultation should be undertaken before making a recommendation to make regulations under this provision. 53. Consultation took place in 2017 in the form of the officials’ issues paper PAYE error correction and adjustment. This consultation helped to inform the policy principles underlying the regulations; these principles were agreed to by Cabinet in March 2018. 54. In addition, subsequent consultation with a small group of stakeholders was undertaken in the last quarter of 2018 to ensure the regulations were able to be used to give effect to the policy decisions. 55. Officials consider that appropriate consultation has taken place to make the regulations under section 23Q of the TAA. Release of Cabinet paper 56. We recommend releasing the attached Cabinet paper once the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 has been gazetted. We also recommend the release of this covering report as additional supporting material. We note that previous policy reports and Cabinet papers on PAYE error correction have been released as part of the information release for the introduction of the ARMTARM Bill. 57. We recommend the documents are released in full, subject to official’s contact numbers and the names of junior officials. This is consistent with withholding information under section 9(2)(a) of the Official Information Act to protect the privacy of natural persons.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAX ADMINISTRATION (CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN EMPLOYMENT INCOME INFORMATION) REGULATIONS 2019 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order in Coun cil creating the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 to the Executive Council. 2.In order to bring these regulations into effect for 1 April 2019, I am seeking a waiver of the 2 8-day rule on the grounds that its application date should coincide with the mandatory application of payday filing for employers. These regulations have been drafted to accompany related proposed legislation that is included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. To ensure the regulations appropriately reflect the proposed legislation we have had a delayed ability to finalise the draft regulations. Executive Summary 3.The regulations provide the methods employers may use to correct errors in employmen t income information submitted to Inland Revenue. 4.These regulations form part of the recent changes to the provision of PAYE information to Inland Revenue which generally requires employers to submit their employment income information within two or ten working days of each payday (payday reporting). Payday reporting changes will become mandatory for employers from 1 April 2019 under changes to the Tax Administration Act. 5.The changes will provide Inland Revenue with more timely information on employmen t income for employees. However, they will also reduce the time available to employers to identify and correct any errors in this information before it is sent to Inland Revenue. 6.The regulations support the payday reporting changes by specifying the nature and type of e rrors that are able to be corrected by an employer and the manner in which errors in employment income information may be corrected. 7.The policy principles underlying the error correction regulations were approved by Cabine t in March 2018. The regulations also reflect changes to the taxable status of PAYE overpayments included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. 8.A consultative draft version of the regulations was provided to a group of stakeholders for feedback on the workability of the regulations in September 2018. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE . 9. This paper reports on the feedback received as part of this consultation, the key changes made to the regulations, and seeks approval to submit the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 to the Executive Council. Background 10. The Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill amended the filing requirements for employers withholding PAYE. This requires employers to report information on payments made to and PAYE and other deductions withheld from employees (employment income information) on a payday basis. For employers who file PAYE online, this generally means they must report information to within two or ten working days following an employee’s payday. 11. These changes modernise the way employers provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue. Under payday reporting, many employers will be providing income information to Inland Revenue more frequently, which aligns more closely with employer’s processes. Payday reporting will establish a foundation for more accurate withholding and improved delivery of social policy. 12. The move towards more frequent information provision will also, in turn, reduce the amount of time available to employers to identify and correct information before it is sent to Inland Revenue. To help mitigate the potential administrative and compliance issues associated with error reporting, legislative changes included an empowering provision which gives the Minister of Revenue the ability to make an Order in Council to prescribe how errors in employment income information may be corrected. 13. Legislation has previously been silent on how errors in PAYE information are to be corrected. Inland Revenue’s advice to employers has been that all corrections to PAYE information must be made by amending the original returns which contained the error. 14. An officials’ issues paper, PAYE error correction and adjustment, released in August 2017, which sought feedback from affected parties on what mechanisms should be available for error correction \[CAB-17-MIN-0404 refers\]. This paper received 13 submissions. 15. The underlying policy principles were approved by Cabinet in March 2018. \[CAB-18- MIN-0122\]: 15.1 Reporting errors (where the amount actually withheld and/or paid is not accurately reported to Inland Revenue) must be corrected by amending the return that contained the error. Amending the original return is necessary to ensure that the payment can be correctly processed. 15.2 Payroll corrections, which occur where an employee was overpaid, will be able to be made either by amending the original return or by correcting the errors in a subsequent return. Due to the principle that salary and wages are taxed when paid, underpayments do not require correction. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE 15.3 Interpretation errors (where the wrong tax treatment has been applied) may be corrected in a subsequent return if PAYE on the correction is less than a threshold of 10% of the relevant employee’s PAYE for the payday. The threshold is required to avoid unfair social policy impacts on the employee. 16. In addition, the legislative proposal to clarify that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid is taxable as PAYE income was also approved by Cabinet in February 2018. The legislative change is included in the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This bill is expected to be enacted in March 2019. 17. An additional subset of errors require specific treatment. This is for errors which affect the amount of a student loan repayment obligation, KiwiSaver contributions or child support deductions that have not resulted from an incorrect interpretation and calculation of the gross PAYE income payment. To mitigate system errors due to corrections involving social policy deductions, we have restricted the ability to correct in subsequent periods for interpretation errors involving social policy deductions which don’t follow from an error in the gross PAYE income payment. 18. The consultation version of the regulations that was released in September 2018 was drafted on this basis. Officials have updated the regulatory impact statement; this is attached. Outcome of consultation 19. Inland Revenue provided a copy of the draft regulations to 13 stakeholders who were a mix of professional bodies, payroll software providers and intermediaries, and accounting firms. 20. Key messages received during this consultation related to a preference for more ability to make adjustment in subsequent returns, clarity around which provisions relate to which type of errors, and concerns about implementation and timing. Inland Revenue also received some minor drafting points for clarification. Clarity between types of errors 21. Several submitters considered that there could be improved clarity in the regulations, to help employers and payroll staff apply the regulations to a particular error. 22. Two submitters were concerned that employers and payroll staff would find it difficult to differentiate errors sufficiently in order to apply the right treatment prescribed by the regulations. Another submitter commented that they considered the information provided to be “fairly straightforward and should be sufficient for any payroll specialist to understand and be able to follow when such errors occurred and require amending”. 23. The regulations draw a distinction between when it is permitted to make any changes to correct errors in information in a subsequent return (netting off in a subsequent return) and when these changes must be made by correcting the information that was provided (amending the original return). In order to distinguish between what treatment is appropriate, errors have been categorised according to the following types: 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE  reporting error: when the return does not reflect what was paid or withheld  payroll correction: underpayment  payroll correction: overpayment, and  interpretation errors: when there is a mistake with the tax treatment, and 24. Five submitters raised concerns regarding the distinction between error types and the clarity provided in the regulations as to which section would apply to what type of error. More clarity will be provided in the regulations with a flowchart and key examples included in the regulations. In addition, guidance will be released in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin once the regulations are made. 25. The legislative changes to the taxable treatment of PAYE overpayments will also have guidance included in the Tax Information Bulletin. When an error may be reported in a subsequent period 26. The policy settings previously agreed to by Cabinet provide that employers will have the option of correcting interpretation errors in a subsequent return, subject to the restriction that PAYE on the error is less than 10% of the relevant employee’s PAYE for the payday in which the correction would be made. 27. Some submitters queried whether the 10% threshold could be raised. Two submitters suggested that it could, at the minimum be monitored and re-assessed in two or three years’ time. 28. Social policy errors that aren’t the result of an incorrect calculation of the PAYE income payment, should be corrected in the original period to ensure that they are allocated to the right period and that existing rules (for example, significant under or over-deductions for student loans) are not affected. 29. In addition, the ability to include adjusted values in a subsequent period is limited in the short term, to restrict the filing of negative values. This is due to the inability of Inland Revenue’s current computer system to received negative values. This restriction will be lifted once co-existence of Inland Revenue’s two systems ends for PAYE, this is expected in April 2020. 30. Officials will monitor and review the 10% threshold once social policy products (student loans, child support and KiwiSaver) are brought into Inland Revenue’s new computer system. Implementation timing and application date 31. Two submitters expressed concern about the timing for the regulations to come into effect, and the software development that would be required to support them. 32. The regulations continue the status quo for error correction, allowing all errors to be corrected in the original submission. The ability to include adjustments in subsequent returns is an option for some types of errors but it is not required. Employers can continue correcting the original return after 1 April 2019 and use the option to net off adjustments in subsequent returns in the future. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE 33. Delaying the application date of the regulations to provide for the implementation time requested is not recommended as they are intended to provide clarity to employers and reduce compliance costs by introducing additional mechanisms for correction. Overpayment changes following recent legislation 34. The proposed treatment for overpayments follows that considered by the Finance and Expenditure Committee and set out in the officials’ report on the Bill. This aligns with the policy decisions made in the Cabinet paper PAYE Error Correction Regulations and Legislative Amendments previously considered by Cabinet on 3 April 2018 \[CAB-18-MIN-0122\]. 35. As drafted, the regulation for overpayments allows employers several options in how to correct these errors when they are not immediately repaid by the employee and instead subject to an agreement to repay over time. Employers may adjust each payday as the overpayment is paid back (that is to make adjustments over several paydays) or they may make a full adjustment of the overpaid amount once agreement to repay has been reached with the employee. 36. However, if the employee breaches the agreement to repay with their employer, the employer must make a second adjustment in relation to the overpaid amount, and add back the outstanding portion of the overpayment and associated PAYE. 37. If the agreement is breached the amount of the overpayment that remains unrepaid is added back to the employee’s record of income. Timing and 28-day rule 38. The regulations are set to come into effect on 1 April 2019. This is required to coincide with the mandatory date set by the Act for employers adopting the new payday reporting requirements for filing their employment income information with Inland Revenue. I am seeking a waiver of the 28-day rule, to ensure the methods of correction under these regulations are available for employers from the commencement of the mandatory payday reporting. Compliance 39. The regulations comply with the following: 39.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 39.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993 39.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 39.4 relevant international standards and obligations and 39.5 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition). 40. Section 23N(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the making of regulations to provide for error correction. This provision requires that the responsible Minister be satisfied that consultation that is appropriate and reasonable has occurred before recommending the making of an Order in Council under section 23N. 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE 41. This consultation took the form of an officials’ issues paper, PAYE Error Correction and Adjustments, which was released in August 2017. Thirteen submissions were received. This consultation also included release of a consultative draft version of the regulations in September 2018. 42. The empowering provision for the making of these regulations comes into force on 1 April 2019. Section 11 of the Interpretation Act 1999 permits regulations to be made in advance of the power coming into force if the exercise of power is “necessary of desirable to bring, or in connection with bringing, and enactment into operation”. 43. To have the regulations in place by 1 April 2019, it is necessary to exercise the power in section 23N ahead of its commencement date. It is desirable to bring the regulations into effect at the same time as the mandatory adoption of payday reporting in the Act to provide clarity for employers on the methods they may use to correct errors. Regulations Review Committee 44. Officials do not believe that there are any grounds under Standing Order 319 for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the regulations to the attention of the House of Representatives. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 45. The regulations have been certified by the Parliamentary Counsel Office as being in order for submission to Cabinet subject to the enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Bill, the consultation requirement, and the waiver of the 28-day rule, as all mentioned above. Impact Analysis 46. The Quality Assurance reviewer at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Modernising the correction of errors in PAYE information RIA prepared by Inland Revenue, and considers that the information and analysis summarised in the RIA meets the quality assurance criteria. 47. This RIA updates an earlier version completed on 7 February 2018 to reflect decisions around social policy obligations for student loan repayments, KiwiSaver employee contributions and child support. Additional information to reflect these decisions has been included in section 2.1 and 3.1 with all other parts substantively unchanged since the original RIA. Publicity 48. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 49. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Financial implications 50. The cost of implementing the changes will be met as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE Proactive Release 51. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 52. Treasury were consulted on this paper. A copy of the draft regulations was provided to ACC and MSD at the same time as external stakeholders. Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that on 21 March 2018 the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed to the following decisions on which methods should be available to employers in the regulations: 1.1 Employers should continue to be required to correct reporting errors by amending the original returns 1.2 Employers should be able to correct overpayment errors by: 1.2.1 Amending the original returns in which the error occurred; or 1.2.2 Recalculating the original pays by netting off the changes against the values in a subsequent return. This option will be subject to a restriction preventing employers from lodging negative values until PAYE is entirely managed within Inland Revenue’s new computer system. 1.3 Employers should have an option to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent period provided PAYE on the error is less than 10% of the relevant employee’s PAYE for the payday in which the correction is made. 1.4 Employers should have the option to correct overpayment and interpretation errors (subject to the employee threshold) from a previous tax year in a subsequent year. 2. note that on 21 March 2018, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee also agreed to the amendment to primary legislation providing that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income should be included in the next taxation omnibus bill \[CAB-18-MIN-0122\]; 3. note that the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 will give effect to the decisions referred to in paragraph 1 above, and provides methods of correction to support the decision referred to in paragraph 2; 4. note that the regulations include guidance material in the explanatory note to assist in the application of the provisions to relevant errors. 5. note that section 23N(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires that the responsible Minister be satisfied that consultation that is appropriate and reasonable has occurred before recommending the making of an Order in Council under section 23N; 7 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE 6. note the advice of the Minister of Revenue that this requirement has been met. 7. note that regulatory impact analysis has been prepared by Inland Revenue and is attached to this Cabinet paper. 8. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019; 9. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: 9.1 so that the regulations can come into force on 1 April 2019 coinciding with the requirement for payday reporting of employment income information and the commencement date of the provisions relating to the taxable status of overpayments of PAYE income payments in the Tax Administration Act 1994 and the Income Tax Act 2007. 9.2 on the grounds that it continues the status quo for how employers correct errors in employment income information, and provides additional options to reduce compliance costs. 10. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on 1 April 2019; Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 8 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:44 IN CONFIDENCE 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Modernising the correction of errors in PAYE information Sec tio n 1 : G en er a l in fo r ma tion Purpose Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Impact Summary, except as otherwise explicitly indicated. This analysis and advice has been produced for the purpose of informing final decisions to proceed with a policy change to be taken by Cabinet. This Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) updates an earlier version completed on 7 February 2018 to reflect decisions around social policy obligations for student loan repayments, KiwiSaver employee contributions and child support. Additional information to reflect these decisions has been included in sections 2.1 and 3.1 with all other parts substantively unchanged since the original RIA. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis that follows are: •Consultation and testing: Although there has been consultation with employers and payroll providers, employers with small payrolls who do not use payroll software were underrepresented in submissions. •Quality of data used for impact analysis: We have been unable to accurately estimate the monetary value of expected changes in administrative costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for employers and payroll software developers. Neither limitation materially affects the analysis. Responsible Manager Mike Nutsford Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 28 February 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 3. 2 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 2 : Pro b le m de fin itio n an d o bjec tiv es 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? PAYE error correction “PAYE error correction” describes the process by which employers advise Inland Revenue of changes to income, PAYE and other deductions, such as KiwiSaver when an error has been made in, or an adjustment is required to, the information originally filed with Inland Revenue. For many reasons, including human error and late receipt of information, payroll errors 1 are inevitable. There are three types of errors that require amendment to PAYE information: 1. Reporting errors arise when the employee(s) were paid and taxed correctly but reporting to Inland Revenue does not accurately reflect what was paid and/or withheld. 2. Payroll overpayment errors arise when an employee is overpaid, correcting the overpayment requires consequential change to the amounts withheld for PAYE and related deductions such as KiwiSaver. 3. Interpretation errors arise when the employee receives the correct pay but an incorrect tax treatment is applied, for example a benefit is treated as tax free when it should have been subject to PAYE. Because salary and wage earners are taxed when they are paid underpayments are taxed when they are paid and so there is no requirement to correct the information already provided to Inland Revenue. The current PAYE error correction process is set out in operational guidance from Inland Revenue and is largely manual. The current PAYE error correction guidelines require all errors to be corrected by filing an amendment to the original return. This requirement imposes considerable compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. The guidelines would need to be updated to reflect the changes proposed in the Taxation (Annual rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Bill (The Bill). This Bill introduces “payday reporting” 2 . In general, payday reporting would require employers to file “employment income information” with Inland Revenue within 2 to 10 working days of payday. This information is currently provided to Inland Revenue on a monthly basis. Payday reporting will allow some errors to be identified and corrected more 1 Payroll staff often distinguish between “errors” and “adjustments” with the latter category arising from timing events such as the late receipt of information. For simplicity these are all referred to in this document as errors. 2 This Bill is currently before the Finance and Expenditure Committee and the proposed changes are due to be mandatory from April 2019, employers can voluntarily adopt payday filing from April 2018.. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 3 IN CONFIDENCE quickly but it will reduce the amount of time available to employers to correct information before it is sent to Inland Revenue and, when an error has continued for several pay periods, it will require more returns to be amended. Therefore, in the absence of any other changes, payday reporting will increase the overall number of errors reported to Inland Revenue. This is the status quo position. Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme provides an opportunity to reduce compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue by modernising the PAYE error correction process using employers’ payroll software and taking advantage of the capabilities in Inland Revenue’s new computer system. This could be achieved by revising some of Inland Revenue’s requirements and coding PAYE error correction requirements into payroll software and Inland Revenue’s system. To achieve this outcome the requirements would need to provide certainty and must be accessible to employers and developers of payroll software. The requirements must also cater for those organisations which do not use payroll software. We note that the Bill proposes that the requirements for PAYE error correction can be set out in regulations. The PAYE system is also used to help administer social policy obligations. • Student loan repayments: employees with a student loan have repayment deductions made from PAYE income over the student loan threshold amount. Additional student repayment rates may also apply if they have requested by the employee or required by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. • KiwiSaver: for employees enrolled in KiwiSaver, employers must make deductions from the employee’s PAYE income for employee contributions, pay employer contributions and withhold and pay ESCT on that amount. • Child support: in some cases, child support obligations are administered via deductions from PAYE income which is then paid to Inland Revenue. We have identified a subset of interpretation errors which require alternate treatment. This is for errors which affect the amount of a student loan repayment obligation, KiwiSaver contributions or child support deductions that have not resulted from an incorrect interpretation and calculation of the gross PAYE income payment. Other problems with PAYE error correction In addition, a matter affecting PAYE error correction has arisen which relates to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007. The objective of providing certainty in relation to the requirements for PAYE error correction requires that this issue should be resolved as soon as possible so that it can be included in advice to providers of payroll software and employers. The problem concerns the taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid. Inland Revenue’s legal position is that an overpayment which is not repaid is not taxable unless it has been obtained fraudulently or has become a bonus or salary advance. Consultation with employers suggests that at least some employers treat this income as 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 4 IN CONFIDENCE taxable and that any change to their approach would incur additional compliance costs and could reduce the likelihood of the employee agreeing to repay the net amount overpaid. Some employers who treat overpaid income which is not repaid as subject to PAYE seek a refund of PAYE and other deductions, when they obtain agreement from the employee that the net amount will be repaid 3 , others wait until the net amount is fully repaid. 3 If the employee subsequently defaults on the repayment these employers submit a further error correction to reinstate the outstanding amount as income and pay PAYE on it. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 5 IN CONFIDENCE 2.2 Who is affected and how? Employers would be most affected by the current situation and those who responded to consultation generally supported the proposed changes on the basis that they would help to reduce their compliance costs. Payroll software developers would also be affected by the proposals for PAYE error correction. They generally support the proposed changes because they would provide certainty and would simplify reporting. Employees could be potentially affected. If the requirements for PAYE error correction are unclear or too complex employers could ignore them and adopt approaches which could be unfair for employees whose records of income and deductions might be affected. Some tax professionals do not support the proposed change to the status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid because it would tax an amount which is not currently defined as PAYE income and denies the employer the refund of PAYE that is currently available. The individual employers who responded to consultation on this point nevertheless supported the proposed change. 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The common law principle that wage and salary earners are taxed when they are paid is a constraint. This principle means that underpayments are taxed when they are paid; there is therefore no “error” from a tax perspective and no requirement on the employer to amend earlier tax returns. No change is proposed and this issue is not analysed further in this impact summary. The Bill’s changes to PAYE reporting are a constraint as they require more frequent filing of PAYE information. These changes form part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. One objective of this programme is to, as much as possible; integrate tax obligations with normal business processes by using business software to automate processes. Automation requires the rules to be set out clearly and centrally so that they can be coded. The proposed changes would be consistent with a largely automated approach to error correction. In most cases, this would allow an employer using payroll software to generate the information required by Inland Revenue as a consequence of updating their own records. Because a significant group of employers do not use payroll software the requirements for PAYE error correction should also cater for employers who would manually correct their PAYE information. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 6 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 3: O p tio n s id e n tificatio n 3.1 What options have been considered? Modernising PAYE error correction Criteria • Minimise compliance costs to the extent possible for employers and payroll software developers: • Minimise administrative costs for Inland Revenue, including consistency with the objectives of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. • Maintain the equity of the tax system. This means allowable approaches to PAYE error correction should not disadvantage employees to whom the income and deductions belong. • Maintain the integrity of the tax system. Options for error correction • Option 1: All corrections would be made by amending the original return (status quo). • Option 2: Employers would be able to make corrections by either; amending the original return or reporting the correction in a subsequent return. The ability to amend in a subsequent return would exist even if the error occurred in a previous tax year. Additional sub-options have been considered for interpretation errors and these are discussed below. Analysis of options for each error type against the stated criteria 1. Reporting errors Option 1 is preferred over option 2 for dealing with reporting errors. If reporting errors were not corrected in the original return there could be a mismatch in the reported information and the amount paid. This would give rise to reconciliation problems which give rise to compliance costs and administrative costs. Amending the original return would also ensure that employees would not be disadvantaged by the income or deductions actually received being reported in a later period. Option 2 does not address the problem. 2. Overpayment errors Option 1 would involve higher compliance costs for users of payroll software, compared with option 2. This is particularly true in the context of payday reporting - that is, if an error has continued for more than one payday, an employer who pays more often than monthly would have more returns to correct. Option 2 would involve a reduction in compliance costs for employers using payroll software, compared with option 1. These reductions would arise because employers would be able to report overpayment errors in a subsequent return which would 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 7 IN CONFIDENCE eliminate the requirement for a separate error correction return. Because it provides choices option 2 would also cater for employers who do not use payroll software and who prefer to make corrections by amending the original return. Option 2 would not give rise to integrity concerns. If the overpayment error occurred in a previous tax year option 2 would more often ensure that the reduction in an employee’s income feeds through into their annual assessment and social policy position. For this reason option 2 is also preferred on equity grounds as fewer employees would need to seek a reassessment to ensure the reduction in their income feeds through to an assessment. Option 2 would not be fully available to employers until Inland Revenue’s new computer system takes over the full processing of PAYE; this is not expected until 2020. Until then employers would only report overpayment errors in a subsequent return if the net amount reported were a positive number. 3. Interpretation errors Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. There would not be equity or integrity of the tax system concerns with this option. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. However if the ability to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return is unconstrained employees could be disadvantaged by having a significant increase in their income reported in a single payday return when they have not had an increase in available cash 4 . This concern led to consideration of sub option 2a below. In addition, concern for the integrity of the tax system led to consideration of a further sub option as set out in sub option 2b below. Option 2a This sub option would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s). Option 2a would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees but it would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. 4 This situation could arise if a taxable benefit such as subsidised accommodation had been treated as tax free, if the value of this benefit is all reported in one payday return the employee has higher income reported but no more cash. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 8 IN CONFIDENCE Option 2b In addition to the 10% threshold proposed in sub option 2a concern for the integrity of the tax system lead to a further proposal: that an employer could only correct interpretation errors in a subsequent return if they had made less than $10,000 of upward reassessments in that tax year. This sub option would have significantly higher compliance costs that options 2 and 2a but it has the advantage of reducing the likelihood that the correcting interpretation errors in a subsequent return could conceal widespread non-compliance. 4. Interpretation errors which affect student loans, KiwiSaver or child support Option 1 Requiring all interpretation errors to be corrected by amending the original return (the status quo) would impose higher compliance and administrative costs than option 2. Option 2 Allowing the employer to choose to correct the error either by amending the original return or by including the correction in a subsequent return would have lower compliance and administrative costs than option 1. Option 2 would permit employers to choose to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return up to a threshold of PAYE on the error being less than 10% of the employee’s PAYE in the payday return. Larger interpretation errors would need to be corrected by amending the original return(s). Option 2 would mitigate the risk of disadvantaging employees, however it still requires employers to distinguish between whether PAYE on an error exceeds 10% of the PAYE on the employee’s PAYE for the subsequent payday. When an error is corrected by netting off the relevant values in a subsequent period, Inland Revenue won’t be aware that it includes a portion which relates to a previous period. Given that there are system rules which are linked to the gross PAYE income amount, there is a concern that if a subsequent return included social policy deductions which related to a previous period, these would cause errors and might not be accepted by Inland Revenue’s system. This problem is less likely to occur if the PAYE income is also corrected as proportionality in deductions will be preserved. Options for amending definition of PAYE income Three options are considered using the criteria set out at the beginning of this section. • Option 1: no amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. This is the status quo option. • Option 2: no amendment to the Income Tax Act and a significant investment by Inland Revenue in employer education in an effort to change employer behaviour. • Option 3: amend the Income Tax Act 2007 so that overpaid PAYE income that is not 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 9 IN CONFIDENCE repaid remains subject to PAYE. Analysis of options Option 1 This option retains the current definition of PAYE income. Some employer submissions indicated that this option would be inconsistent with current employer practice and with how their payroll software is currently configured. Continuing with the status quo may undermine the objective of automating error correction through software and is likely to result in continuing non-compliance which undermines the integrity of the tax system. This option could also be seen as inequitable because it treats an employee who repays overpaid PAYE income as having the same income as an employee who does not repay it. Option 2 Under this option there would be no change to the definition of PAYE income in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Inland Revenue would widely publicise its view of the law in an effort to change employer practice and how payroll software is configured. The objective would be to enable payroll software to be used to report such errors to Inland Revenue and recover overpaid PAYE and other deductions as soon as an overpayment is identified and regardless of whether it is repaid or not. This option would have significant one-off educational costs for Inland Revenue and might not be successful. Those employers consulted view the status of overpaid PAYE income as wages or salary subject to PAYE. In addition, employers have reasons under employment law for not coding the amount as an overpayment in their payroll system until agreement to repay has been reached. If this option resulted in a change in employer behaviour employers would benefit by being able to recover PAYE and other deductions from Inland Revenue regardless of whether they had recovered the net amount from the employee. Option 3 This option would expand the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income not repaid would be subject to PAYE. This option would have lower compliance and administrative costs than the alternatives as it accords with how (some) employers currently treat such income and with how their software is configured. This option supports the integrity of the tax system as overpayments not repaid may become taxable as debt remittance income. However, because employees would be unlikely to be aware of this obligation it is unlikely that tax would be paid on such income. Option 3 would expand the definition of PAYE income and could be seen as unfair for employers because it denies employers refunds of PAYE and related deductions that they are currently entitled to. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 10 IN CONFIDENCE It could also be seen as unfair to employees who have been overpaid because the overpaid amount would be taxed. As noted above, there are countervailing equity arguments that suggest that Option 3 is preferable on equity grounds because for social policy purposes it would recognise an employer who repaid overpaid income as on a lower income than someone who received an equivalent overpayment but did not repay it. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 11 IN CONFIDENCE 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Error Correction 1. Reporting errors: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the proposed approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2. Overpayment errors: Option 2 (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period) is the proposed approach as it reduces compliance and administrative costs and is preferable on equity grounds. 3. Interpretation errors: Option 2a (allowing the employer the choice between amending the original return and correcting in a subsequent period subject to PAYE on the correction being less than 10 percent of the employee’s PAYE in the return) is the preferred approach. This option represents the best trade-off between reducing compliance costs for employers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue without the possibility of unfair impacts on employees. 4. Social policy errors which do not result from an error in gross taxable income: Option 1 (all corrections to be made by amending the original return) is the preferred option as it ensures these errors won’t cause an exception in the information submitted to Inland Revenue. This should be re-considered once student loans, KiwiSaver and child support has been moved into Inland Revenue’s new computer system. (Student loans and KiwiSaver are planned for 2020, child support is planned for 2021). If an amount is in error due to an incorrectly calculated PAYE income payment then it is appropriate to allow corrections in a subsequent period, subject to the 10% threshold restriction outlined in option 2a for interpretation errors. Definition of PAYE income The taxable status of overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid: Option 3 (amending the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid PAYE income which is not repaid remains subject to PAYE) is the preferred approach as it is preferable on all criteria. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 12 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 4: Imp ac t An a ly s is (Pr o po se d ap p r oa ch) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits PAYE Error correction: the error correction items are considered together as costs are principally driven by the requirement to amend original returns. When there is a continuing requirement to correct errors by amending the original return employers who use software should experience reduced compliance costs owing to automation. Employers who do not use payroll software but who have internet connectivity would be able to access their already filed and processed returns through myIR and self-correct earlier returns; this should reduce costs for this segment. Employers who report PAYE on paper would continue to have access to a paper form for PAYE error corrections and for simple corrections should be able to make them over the telephone. Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Providers of payroll software would need to upgrade their products to support the electronic submission of error corrections in line with the proposed methods for error correction. Software providers could integrate this change into the regular update cycle. Work to create an automated channel for the status quo position is already underway in advance of the proposed regulations, as part of business transformation changes. These are transitional costs. Employers would have transitional costs of understanding the new approach in order to take advantage of it. Very low Very low Regulators Inland Revenue would need to ensure that employers and payroll providers are provided with appropriate education and support and that its new computer system is effectively set up and tested in order to receive negative values from 2020. These are transitional costs.

The ability to correct small interpretation errors in a subsequent return should reduce costs of reporting these errors. These benefits are ongoing. Regulators Inland Revenue once the new system has bedded in and employers can use their payroll systems to correct overpayment errors and minor interpretation errors in a subsequent return, including those showing negative values the cost of administering the PAYE system should reduce. Low Wider government Government employers are expected to have the same experience as private sector employers. The changes are also expected to benefit the Ministry of Social Development and the Accident Compensation Corporation which pay PAYE income to beneficiaries and to recipients of New Zealand superannuation and accident compensation. Medium Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit NA NA Non-monetised benefits . Low/medium Overpaid PAYE income subject to PAYE Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Software providers would have no costs as we understand their systems currently support the proposed approach. Employers: we understand that what is proposed aligns with how (some) employers currently treat this income and reflects how their systems work. Even though the proposed change would preclude employers from receiving a refund of PAYE on the overpaid income (some) employers are not currently claiming this refund. Unless this practice changed the increased cost would be theoretical, rather than real. Further, employers argue that continuing to treat overpaid income as subject to PAYE would make it more likely that the employee would repay the employer because repayment would be the only way their record of income for social policy purposes is corrected. To the extent this view is valid the theoretical increase in costs 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 14 IN CONFIDENCE identified below would reduce. Employer costs have been estimated as very low; this reflects the fact that the situation is not a common one and assumes that some employers do seek a refund of PAYE on overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid. Very low Regulators Inland Revenue: the proposal reflects the way the system is currently operating so no additional costs would be incurred. No change Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Cost NA NA Non-monetised costs As noted above (some) employers have advised us that what is proposed is how they currently operate. For these employers there would be no increase in costs. The costs have been entered as very low on the assumption that some employers are recovering PAYE on overpaid income not repaid. Very low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties Payroll providers will have certainty that their systems could be used as currently configured to seek a refund of overpaid income when repayment is agreed or made. Employers would have certainty that the widespread current approach, that treats this income as subject to PAYE, is consistent with the law. Employees would be freed of any obligation to pay tax on the overpaid PAYE income when and if it becomes debt remittance income. Low Regulators Inland Revenue would no longer have to deal with ambiguity around the current position. Low Wider government NA NA Other parties NA NA Total Monetised Benefit Non-monetised benefits The primary benefit is increased certainty around how this income should be treated for tax purposes. Low 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 15 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? The proposed legislative change to deem overpaid PAYE that is not repaid as subject to PAYE would improve equity between overpaid employees. Under existing law two employees who are overpaid the same amount of PAYE income would be treated as having the same income for social policy purposes (for example working for families payments, student loan repayments and child support payments) despite one employee having repaid the money and the other not having done so. Sec tio n 5: Stak e h old er vie ws 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? Inland Revenue consulted with a number of providers of payroll software and employers and with the Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand prior to releasing an official issues paper in August 2017. An officials’ issues paper, PAYE error correction and adjustment, was released through Inland Revenue’s normal channels and in addition was sent to the members of the Payroll Practitioner’s Association, to providers of payroll software and to representatives of more than thirty employers who had indicated interest in the subject. Thirteen submitters responded some representing more than one employer. Submitters generally agreed with the problem analysis and the proposed regulatory approach with the exception of the original proposal for an employer level threshold for interpretation errors. Submitters argued that the employer level threshold could not be automated and that manual tracking would involve disproportionate compliance costs. In response to feedback the employer level threshold has been dropped. Concern was also expressed by some respondents that the 10% threshold for interpretation errors at the employee level was unduly low. This threshold has been retained at 10% because the amount could be material for someone on a low income. One respondent felt that the proposals were unduly complex. However an employer who wishes to minimise complexity will have the option to correct all errors by amending the original returns. No change has been made in response to this submission. Most respondents agreed with the proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007, deeming overpaid PAYE income not repaid as subject to PAYE. The Corporate Taxpayers Group and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand however disagreed. The Corporate Taxpayers Group considered that the proposal would disadvantage employers by taxing an amount that is not employment income. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand submitted that whether the net amount was recovered or not was a private matter between the employer and employee and the amount should not be taxed unless it became debt remittance income. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 16 IN CONFIDENCE In addition, one software provider submitted that if an employer had made an adjustment when agreement to repay the overpaid amount was repaid they should not be required to make a further adjustment if the employee subsequently defaulted on the repayment. No changes were made in response to the submissions received on the proposal to amend the definition of PAYE income so that overpaid income not repaid is subject to PAYE. A number of technical questions were raised by payroll software providers and these will be considered in the process of developing the technical specifications. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 17 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 6: Imp le men ta tio n a n d op er a tio n 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? The proposals relating to reporting errors, overpayment errors and interpretation errors would be given effect through regulations. Clause 235C of the Taxation (Annual Rates 2017 -18, Employment and Investment Income and Remedial Matters) Bill proposes that the Governor General may, by Order-in- Council on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue and following appropriate consultation, make regulations for the correction of errors in employment income information. The proposed timing provides adequate time for employers to understand the proposed changes and become familiar with the new options. In general the proposed regulations introduce additional options, with continuing to file amendments on the current basis being one option. Having options provides a means of managing implementation risk including risks that arise from a relative lack of engagement with employers with small payrolls. Inland Revenue’s systems are being upgraded to accept automatic error correction schedules from 1 April 2018. Issues relating to the effectiveness of the automated process should be resolved by the time the regulations, which permit a greater number of errors to be correcting in a subsequent return, come into effect on 1 April 2019. The proposal relating to the tax status of overpaid PAYE income not repaid will be managed through a proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007. It is intended that the amendment will be included in the next available taxation omnibus bill with a proposed effective date of 1 April 2019. Consultation by select committee is expected to provide a further opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. The proposed change to the legislation reflects how many employers are understood to currently treat such income, implementation risks are not therefore considered to be material. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 18 IN CONFIDENCE Sec tio n 7 : M o n itor in g, ev a lua tio n a n d re v ie w 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Information on the number of errors and adjustments to employment income information that are corrected at the employer’s request is currently available. There is no way to deconstruct the totals into different error types. Once the systems changes are made and the regulations are in place Inland Revenue will know how many automated error correction schedules are filed and the number of changes made. If the system is working as intended the number of changes that are made by amending earlier returns should reduce after it becomes possible for employers to file returns which include negative values (estimated as 2020). Inland Revenue will not know how many employers exercise the option of correcting overpayment and small interpretation errors in a subsequent return as this option eliminates the need to separately file error correction information. Implementation and operational issues will be identified through feedback from payroll software providers and through our call centres, account managers and specialised units such as those established to support large enterprises. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The arrangements will be reviewed as part of the post implementation review of phases three and four of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. In addition if monitoring shows unanticipated spikes in the numbers of error corrections being made to employment income information Inland Revenue will investigate the reasons and consider whether the issue: • is insufficient education; • reflects a problem with the specifications for payroll software or with Inland Revenue’s processing of error correction information; • stems from the regulations. Employers will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with our call centres and account managers and payroll software providers can do so through Inland Revenue’s Software Liaison Unit. If employees consider that they are unfairly affected by the actions of employers pursuant to the proposed regulations or legislative change they will be able to make their concerns known through our call centres or by asking the Commissioner to reassess their income. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:31:49 I N C O N F I D E N C E LEG-19-MIN-0027 Cabinet Legislation Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 Portfolio Revenue On 19 March 2019, the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1 noted that on 28 March 2018, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee (DEV) agreed to the following decisions on which methods should be available to employers in the regulations: 1.1 employers should continue to be required to correct reporting errors by amending the original returns; 1.2 employers should be able to correct overpayment errors by: 1.2.1 amending the original returns in which the error occurred; or 1.2.2 recalculating the original pays by netting off the changes against the values i n a subsequent return. This option will be subject to a restriction preventing employers from lodging negative values until PAYE is entirely managed within Inland Revenue’s new computer system; 1.3 employers should have an option to correct interpretation errors in a subsequent pe riod provided PAYE on the error is less than 10 percent of the relevant employee’s PAYE for the payday in which the correction is made; 1.4 employers should have the option to correct overpayment and interpretation errors (s ubject to the employee threshold) from a previous tax year in a subsequent year; 2 noted that on 28 March 2018, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee also agreed to the amendment to primary legislation providing that overpaid PAYE income that is not repaid remains taxable as PAYE income should be included in the next taxation omnibus bill; \[DEV-18-MIN-0030\] 3 n oted that the Tax Administration (Correction of Errors in Employment Income Information) Regulations 2019 will give effect to the decisions referred to in paragraph 1 above, and provides methods of correction to support the decision referred to in paragraph 2; 4 n oted that the regulations include guidance material in the explanatory note to assist in the application of the provisions to relevant errors; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:32:13 I N C O N F I D E N C E 1 4.

IN-CONFIDENCE Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair Cabinet Legislation Committee ORDERS IN COUNCIL FOR NEW ZEALAND GREEN INVESTMENT FINANCE LIMITED Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Committee’s authorisation to submit the attached Orders in Council to the Executive Council to: a. add New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited (NZGIF) to Sch edule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 (PFA); and b. add NZGIF to schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Background The Public Finance (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) O rder 2019 2.On 7 November 2018 the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed that NZGIF be established as an independent 100% Crown-owned company listed in Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 (DEV-18- MIN-0257). The purpose of the company will be to accelerate domestic, lower emissions investment. 3.The Company was incorporated and registered with the Companies Office on 12 April 2019. 4.The Order in Council will add NZGIF to Schedule 4A of the PFA and apply to NZGIF certain financial powers restrictions under section 161 to 164 of the Crown Entities Act 2004. 5.NZGIF will need the ability to invest in equity and debt securities, may need to borrow, give guarantees and/or indemnities and possibly use derivatives. Once NZGIF has established appropriate risk management frameworks it will apply to its shareholding Ministers for joint approval to exercise the financial powers it requires. 6.Schedule 4A companies must comply with certain provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004, as set out in section 45OA of the PFA. These include obligations to provide information to shareholding Ministers, to prepare a statement of intent, to be a good employer, to give effect to directions to 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 1 1. support a whole of government approach, and reporting obligations. The provisions of the Official Information Act 1982 and the Ombudsmen Act 1975 will also apply to NZGIF. 7. The Public Finance (NZGIF) Order 2019 is necessary to implement previous Cabinet decisions and does not require any new policy decisions to be made. The Income Tax (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 8. On 29 March 2019 I agreed that NZGIF should be added to Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007 on the basis that it met the necessary criteria outlined in that Act (see paragraph 15). 9. The effect of NZGIF’s addition to Schedule 35 is that it will be exempt from income tax, better enabled to claim back the goods and services tax paid on its purchases and be eligible for a resident withholding tax exemption certificate. 10. The Income Tax (NZGIF) Order 2019 is necessary to implement the NZGIF’s addition to Schedule 35 and does not require any new policy decisions to be made. The Public Finance (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 11. Section 3AB(1) of the PFA authorises the Governor-General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance to add the name of a company to Schedule 4A to the PFA and to apply to the company any provision of the Crown Entities Act 2004 that appears in Schedule 4A of the PFA. 12. Section 3AB(1) of the PFA provides that such an Order in Council may be made only if the following requirements are met: a. more than 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company to which the Order relates are held by Ministers of the Crown on behalf of the Crown; b. shares in the company are not listed on a registered market (within the meaning of the Securities Markets Act 1988); and c. the company is not a Crown entity or a State enterprise named in Schedule 1 of the State-Owned Enterprises Act 1986. 13. These requirements have been met. NZGIF was incorporated under the Companies Act 1993 on 12 April 2019, with the Minister of Finance and Minister for Climate Change, on behalf of the Crown, each holding 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 2 The Income Tax (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 14. Section CW 38B of the Income Tax Act 2007 authorises the Governor- General by Order in Council made on the recommendation of the Minister of Revenue to add the name of a company to Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 15. Certain criteria must be met before a company is added to Schedule 35. These criteria are that: a. the company is listed in Schedule 4A or it is a subsidiary of a company listed in Schedule 4A; b. Ministers of the Crown hold, on behalf of the Crown, more than 50% of the voting interests in the company; c. all other voting interests, if any, in the company are held by local authorities; and d. the company’s primary purpose is the carrying out of a public policy objective of the Government of New Zealand. 16. The first criterion will have been met by the time the Income Tax (NZGIF) Order 2019 is made, as the Public Finance (NZGIF) Order 2019 will have inserted NZGIF into the list in Schedule 4A of the PFA. The other criteria have already been met, with the Minister of Finance and Minister for Climate Change each holding, on behalf of the Crown, 50% of the voting shares in NZGIF. NZGIF has the primary purpose of accelerating and facilitating low emissions investment, a public policy objective of the Government. Timing and 28-day rule 17. It is proposed that the 28-day rule be waived for both Orders, on the grounds that the Orders have little or no effect on the public and that the establishment of NZGIF has already been well publicised, including by proactive release of the relevant Cabinet Economic Development Committee paper. Compliance 18. The Orders comply with the: a. LAC guidelines: Guidelines on Process and Content of Legislation, a publication by the Legislation Advisory Committee; b. New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; c. principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 3 d. relevant international standards and obligations; and e. principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. Regulations Review Committee 19. There are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Orders to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel The Public Finance (NZGIF) Order 2019 20. Parliamentary Counsel has certified the Order as being in order for submission to Cabinet: a. except that the Order will come into force earlier than the 28th day after its notification in the Gazette (as explained at paragraph 17 above); and b. provided that a recommendation has been given in accordance with section 3AB of the PFA – the Minister of Finance will provide such a recommendation to the Governor General. The Income Tax (NZGIF) Order 2019 21. Parliamentary Counsel has certified the Order as being in order for submission to Cabinet: a. except that the Order will come into force earlier than the 28th day after its notification in the Gazette (as explained at paragraph 17 above); and b. provided that a recommendation has been given in accordance with section CW 38B of the Income Tax Act 2007 – the Minister of Revenue will provide such a recommendation to the Governor General; and c. provided that the Order will not be made until after the Public Finance (NZGIF) Order 2019 has been made (as explained at paragraphs 15 and 16) Regulatory Impact Analysis 22. A Regulatory Impact Statement has not been prepared because the proposals are exempt from Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements. Publicity 23. The Orders will be notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 4 Proactive release 24. We plan to proactively release this Cabinet paper, without redaction, and associated Cabinet minutes once the Orders in Council have been gazetted. Consultation 25. The following agencies have been informed of this paper: The Auditor General, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the State Services Commission. Financial implications 26. The Orders have no financial implications. Legislative implications 27. The Orders amend the Public Finance Act 1989 and the Income Tax Act 2007. Recommendations It is recommended that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that on 7 November 2018 the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed that NZGIF be established as an independent 100% Crown-owned company listed in Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 (DEV-18-MIN-0257); 2. note that NZGIF will initially be subject to the financial powers restrictions in sections 161 to 164 of the Crown Entities Act 2004; 3. note that once NZGIF has established appropriate risk management frameworks it will apply to its shareholding Ministers for joint approval to exercise the financial powers it requires; 4. note that the Public Finance (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 gives effect to the decisions referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 above; 5. note that section 3AB(1) of the Public Finance Act 1989 provides that an Order in Council may be made under that section only if: more than 50% of the issued ordinary shares in the capital of the company to which the Order relates are held by Ministers of the Crown on behalf of the Crown; shares in the company are not listed on a registered market (within the meaning of the Securities Markets Act 1988); and the company is not a 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 5 Crown entity or a State enterprise named in Schedule 1 of the State- Owned Enterprises Act 1986; 6. note that the requirements in paragraph 5 above have been met by NZGIF and accordingly the Minister of Finance has recommended that the company be added to schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989; 7. note that Schedule 4A companies must comply with certain provisions of the Crown Entities Act 2004, the Official Information Act 1982 and the Ombudsmen Act 1975; 8. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Public Finance (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 inserting the name of NZGIF into Schedule 4A of the Public Finance Act 1989 and applying sections 161,162,163 and 164 of the Crown Entities Act 2004 to NZGIF; 9. note that on 29 March 2019 the Minister of Revenue agreed that NZGIF should be added to Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 10. note that the Income Tax (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 gives effect to the decision referred to in paragraph 9; 11. note that section CW 38B of Income Tax Act 2007 provides that an Order in Council may be made under that section only if: the company is listed in Schedule 4A or it is a subsidiary of a company listed in Schedule 4A; Ministers of the Crown hold, on behalf of the Crown, more than 50% of the voting interests in the company; all other voting interests, if any, in the company are held by local authorities; and the company's primary purpose is the carrying out of a public policy objective of the Government; 12. note that NZGIF meets the criteria in paragraph 11; 13. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (New Zealand Green Investment Finance Limited) Order 2019 inserting the name of NZGIF into Schedule 35 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 14. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought: a. so that the Orders can come into force as soon as possible; b. on the grounds that the Orders have little or no effect on the public; and 2r4hxlcklw 2019-05-31 12:43:04 IN CONFIDENCE 6 15. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the Orders can come into force on the day after the date of their notification in the Gazette.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (ANNUAL RATES FOR 2019–20, GST OFFSHORE SUPPLIER REGISTRATION, AND REMEDIAL MATTERS) BILL: APPROVAL FOR RELEASE OF SUPPLEMENTARY ORDER PAPER Proposal 1.This paper seeks the agreement of the Cabinet Legislation Committee (the C ommittee) to release a Supplementary Order Paper (SOP) to the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019–20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill (the Bill) prior to the Bill’s Committee of the whole House stage. The SOP primarily gives effect to removing an existing exemption from the requirement to provide a person’s IRD number and any tax identification number, which currently applies when the transfer of property relates to the person’s main home. 2.The proposed SOP introduces amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017, the I ncome Tax Act 2007 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. 3.The Bill is currently expected to receive its second reading in the week beginning 10 Ju ne, and its Committee of the whole House stage in the week beginning 17 June 2019. Policy Policy item with prior Cabinet approval Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes (CAB-19-MIN-0240, 27 May) 4.The attached SOP includes a proposal to require transferors and transferees to d isclose their IRD number and, if applicable, any tax identification numbers (TINs) and jurisdictions of tax residence, for a property transfer involving their main home. 5.Currently, transferors (sellers) and transferees (purchasers) must each complete a L and Transfer Tax Statement when a property is transferred. This Statement generally requires them to provide their IRD number and if applicable, any TINs, except in those cases where the transfer is non-notifiable. The most common non- notifiable reason is when the transfer involves a person’s main home. 6.This exception impacts on Inland Revenue’s ability to enforce compliance with b rightline and other property tax rules, including making it more difficult to identify property speculators. In addition, it impacts on Inland Revenue’s ability to provide TINs to treaty partners for these transfers. 7.The Tax Working Group recommended requiring the disclosure of IRD numbers on t he Land Transfer Tax Statement when the transfer involves a main home. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-11 17:09:07 IN CONFIDENCE 1. 8. Cabinet has agreed to amend the tax statement provisions in the Land Transfer Act 2017 to require transferors and transferees to provide their IRD number and, if applicable, any TINs and jurisdictions of tax residence, when there is a property transfer involving their main home. 9. The proposed amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 include requiring an indicator as to whether the property has or is intended to be the person’s home. This indicator will assist Inland Revenue to appropriately target its compliance activities. 10. The sale of a person’s main home is not usually taxable due to the main home exemption in the brightline and other property tax rules. Having an indicator will therefore assist Inland Revenue to appropriately target its follow-up compliance actions to taxpayers who are more likely to have tax to pay. Overall, this is likely to reduce administration costs for Inland Revenue and compliance costs for people who have sold their main home. 11. The main home exemption in the property tax rules is available to individuals, and is also available in relation to homes that are held by a trust in certain circumstances. Accordingly, I consider that the main home indicator should apply to transfers of residential property held in trusts, in addition to transfers of property involving natural person transferors or transferees. I therefore seek Cabinet’s approval to this change in this paper. 12. The proposed amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 have the potential to increase compliance costs for conveyancers and their clients, due to the need to ask additional questions on the relevant forms. The Cabinet paper which sought policy approval for the proposed amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 noted the need to mitigate increases in compliance costs as a result of collecting IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes. Inland Revenue will consult with Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) to ensure that the amendments to the Land Transfer Act 2017 extending the main home indicator to cover trust transfers will minimise additional compliance costs. 13. These amendments have a proposed commencement date of 1 January 2020. Transitional provisions will allow for transferors and transferees to continue to apply for a non-notifiable transfer of the main home if the contract for sale is entered into prior to 1 January 2020 and the contract is completed by 1 July 2020. Items not requiring Cabinet approval (approved by the Minister of Revenue) 14. I propose that three technical changes in relation to the GST on low-value imported goods proposals in the Bill be included in the SOP. These changes relate to tax invoicing requirements, currency conversion rates and safe harbour rules, and are consistent with the policy intent of the wider changes. I also propose that minor technical changes in relation to the ring-fencing of residential property deductions proposal and applications for RWT exemption certificates by charitable trusts be included in the SOP. 15. The changes are not considered significant in nature, and do not have any revenue or other fiscal effect, so reference to Cabinet is not considered necessary to confirm 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-11 17:09:07 IN CONFIDENCE these changes – rather they have been approved in my capacity as the Minister of Revenue. Impact Analysis 16. A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) for the Collection of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes policy item was prepared and was submitted to Cabinet at the time the approval for this policy was sought. 17. The regulatory impact analysis requirements do not apply to the remaining items in the SOP, as the proposed changes result in little or no change to the policy in the Bill. These items involve technical “revisions” to improve legislative clarity and understanding to provide taxpayers with certainty (including the fixing of errors and oversights, the clarification of the existing legislative intent, and the reconciliation of inconsistencies). Compliance 18. The proposed SOP complies with: 18.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 18.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 18.3 disclosure statement requirements (a draft revised disclosure statement for the Taxation (Annual Rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill has been prepared and is attached to this paper); 18.4 principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 18.5 relevant international standards and obligations; and 18.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation Relevant government departments or other public bodies 19. The Treasury, Land Information New Zealand, Statistics New Zealand and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner were consulted on the proposal to require the disclosure of IRD numbers and TINs when transferring main homes. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 20. Officials are undertaking consultation with key stakeholders on the proposal to require the disclosure of IRD numbers and any TINs when transferring a main home. These stakeholders include the New Zealand Law Society, Auckland District Law Society and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ). The government caucus and other parties represented in Parliament 21. Caucus, coalition and support party consultation will be undertaken on the SOP prior to its proposed release. 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-11 17:09:07 IN CONFIDENCE Binding on the Crown 22. The Land Transfer Act 2017, Income Tax Act 2007 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 are binding on the Crown. The SOP does not alter the status quo in this respect – the amendments will follow the position of the principal Acts. Creating new agencies or amending law relating to existing agencies 23. The SOP will not create a new agency. 24. The SOP will not amend the existing coverage of the Ombudsman Act 1975, the Official Information Act 1982, or the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987. Allocation of decision-making powers 25. The SOP does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated regulations 26. No regulations are required to bring the proposed legislation into operation. Other instruments 27. The SOP does not include provisions empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments (or both). Definition of Minister/department 28. The SOP does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Commencement of legislation 29. Each provision of the SOP comes into force on the date specified for the particular provision. The proposal to require the disclosure of IRD numbers for the transfer of main homes would come into force on 1 January 2020. Parliamentary stages 30. I propose the SOP should be released as soon as possible following Cabinet approval, ideally on 18 June. The Bill is expected to have its Committee of the whole House stage between 18 and 20 June. Gender and Disability implications 31. The proposals do not have gender or disability implications. Publicity 32. The Minister of Revenue will make an announcement on the contents of the SOP when the SOP is released. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. Proactive Release 33. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, and associated minutes in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-11 17:09:07 IN CONFIDENCE 1. Note that to improve property tax compliance and enforcement, Cabinet has agreed to remove an exemption from the requirement to provide a person’s IRD number or tax identification number (and jurisdiction of tax residence) when the transfer of property relates to the person’s main home (CAB-19-MIN-0240 refers). 2.

This report also seeks your approval to include a number of additional remedial amendments in the Bill and your approval to seek a minor amendment to a policy change that Cabinet has already approved. 2.The Cabinet paper seeks approval to introduce the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Studen t L oans and Remedial Matters) Bill on or after 26 June 2019 and recommends that a t i ts first reading the Bill is referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. We have drafted the paper on the basis that you agree to the recommendations to this report. Please advise if there are any changes to the Cabinet paper or Bill that you wish to make. 3.A draft disclosure statement is attached to accompany the Cabinet Paper in accordance with Cabinet guidelines. This document is still subject to some change. The draft disclosure statement is referred to Cabinet along with the Cabinet paper. The draft statement is finalised by Inland Revenue with the Parliamentary Counsel Office three days before the introduction of the Bill, and is made public when the Bill is introduced. 4.The Bill contains the items listed below. Policy items approved by Cabinet •Business Transformation: KiwiSaver Changes (DEV-19-MIN-0038.01 and CAB-19-MIN-0109 refer) •Student Loan Business Transformation Policy Changes ( SWC-19-MIN-0014 a nd CAB-19-MIN-0085 r efer) •Granting overseas donee status to four charities (DEV-19-MIN-0055 and CAB-19-MIN-0142 refer) •Extending the refundability of research and development tax credits, subjec t t o Cabinet approval in late May. Policy/remedial items approved by Minister of Revenue 5.The Bill contains several remedial amendments to Inland Revenue Acts (4 March 2019, IR2019/099, refers). These relate to: •Income attribution rules •Tax treatment of trusts •Disclosure of information about the misconduct of bookkeepers •Tax treatment of non-resident international aircraft operators In Confidence IR2019/186: Draft Cabinet paper – Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill: Approval for introduction Page 2 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE •Māori authority tax credits •Resident withholding tax for registered charities •Consideration for grant of an easement •Employee Share Schemes. 6.The Bill also contains a number of provisional tax remedial amendments (10 April 2019, IR2019/170 refers). 7.Your approval is also sought in this report for the following changes to previously approved remedial items: •We propose that the application date for the amendment allowing the granting of an income tax exemption to non-resident aircraft carriers be 1 A pril 1984, this being the original application date of the law, rather than the application date of the oldest active agreement under the legislation (1 June 1990). 8.A number of minor maintenance items have also arisen during the Bill’s compilation . Th ese correct minor faults of expression, reader’s aids, and incorrect cross- references. It is proposed that these be included in the Bill. Further remedial items requiring approval by the Minister of Revenue 9.Approval is additionally sought in this report for the following new remedial items. 10.Inland Revenue will be able to issue short-process binding rulings from 1 October 2019. This is a new form of binding ruling service targeted at small-to-medium sized taxpayers. We propose an amendment to allow the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings, based on the exiting provision which allows her to withdraw private binding rulings. This will allow the Commissioner to withdraw a ruling where there has been a change in the interpretation of the law (either by the courts or the Commissioner). Withdrawals will apply prospectively, meaning that if taxpayers have entered into an arrangement before the ruling is withdrawn, the Commissioner is still bound by the ruling. We propose that this amendment applies from 1 October 2019 to align with beginning of the short-process rulings process. The Commissioner will not need to apply this provision before the Bill passes into law. 11.Recent changes made to the binding rulings rules also enable the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on matters without the need for an arrangement (for example, on a person’s New Zealand tax residence). We propose an amendment to ensure that where a binding ruling is withdrawn, taxpayers can continue to rely on the ruling for the duration specified in the ruling. We propose this amendment applies from 18 March 2019, which is the date from which the Commissioner can issue binding rulings without the need for an arrangement. 12.The main home exclusion for the bright-line test requires that a person use the land as their main home for most of the time they own the land. The term “own” is defined in the Act. However, the period that a person owns land under this general definition can differ from the period that the bright-line test applies to. This means s 9(2)(f)(iv) In Confidence IR2019 /186: Draft Cabinet paper – Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill: Approval for introduction Page 3 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE that it is possible that taxpayers may not be eligible for the main home exclusion because, although they have used land as their main home for most of the bright- line period, they have not used it as their main home for most of the time they owned the land. The opposite could also occur. An amendment is recommended to align the period of ownership for the main home exclusion for the bright-line test with the bright-line period. 13. Under the current law a New Zealand taxpayer does not have to make adjustments for being over the thin capitalisation threshold provided they have less than $1 million of group finance costs (and have a reduced adjustment if their group finance cost is less than $2 million). This de minimis was not intended to be available if the New Zealand taxpayer borrowed from a non-resident related party; however, the legislation currently only removes access to the de minimis if the taxpayer has owner-linked debt (which is debt borrowed from an owner who is not a member of the same group). An amendment is recommended to reduce access to the de minimis for non-resident related party borrowing, to apply for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018 to align with the introduction of the de minimis. 14. The PIE tax rules apply to collective investment vehicles, including KiwiSaver funds. Investors in a PIE fund are expected to elect a tax rate, called a Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR). If an investor does not notify the PIE of their PIR the top rate will apply by default. Unless the investor has nominated a lower PIR than they should have the tax is final and the investor will not get a refund for any overpayments. Inland Revenue is able to provide an alternative PIR for an investor where the investor has provided a tax rate to the PIE that is different from what it should be. However, Inland Revenue cannot currently use this power where an investor has not notified the PIE of a PIR to use. Officials recommend that the existing rule that allows Inland Revenue to correct an investors PIR be extended to investors who have been defaulted on to the top rate. This would reduce the overpayment of PIR tax. It is proposed that this would apply from 1 April 2020. 15. The impact of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme is already accounted for in the Government’s fiscal forecasts. These forecasts take into account the broad direction of policy intent, including the better use of income information and analytics to determine individuals’ tax rates, in addition to the further changes that will be delivered as part of Business Transformation. The recommended amendment to the Commissioner’s power to correct an investor’s PIR does not alter the amount already accounted for in these fiscal forecasts. Items requiring Cabinet approval 16. The attached Cabinet paper seeks cabinet approval for a minor change to a previously agreed policy change. Previously, Cabinet agreed to reduce the period in which a KiwiSaver provider must provide member information and transfer funds to a new provider if a member changes schemes from 35 days to 10 days \[DEV-19- MIN-0038.01 and CAB-19-MIN-0109 refer\]. Approval is sought to specify that the 10-day period would be measured in working days, rather than calendar days. New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 17. Officials believe the provisions in the proposed Bill are consistent with the rights and freedoms affirmed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990. The Bill will be sent to the Ministry of Justice today for its BORA vet. While it is not expected that there would be any problems, we will advise if any issues arise. In Confidence IR2019/186: Draft Cabinet paper – Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans and Remedial Matters) Bill: Approval for introduction Page 4 of 5 IN CONFIDENCE Support party and caucus consultation 18. We recommend that the Bill is introduced on or after 26 June 2019. To achieve this, support party and caucus consultation will need to occur in advance of Cabinet’s final decision. Officials can provide any further briefing material required on the content of the Bill to support your caucus, coalition and support party consultation in relation to the introduction of the Bill.

Signed and referred/Not signed and referred Bill Manager Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 s 9(2)(a) IN CONFIDENCE In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill: Approval for Introduction Proposal 1.This paper seeks Cabinet approval to introduce the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill to parliament. This Bill introduces amendments to the following legislation: 1.1. KiwiSaver Act 2006 1.2. Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 1.3. Income Tax Act 2007 1.4. Income Tax Act 2004 1.5. Income Tax Act 1994 1.6. Income Tax Act 1976 1.7. Tax Administration Act 1994 1.8. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2018-19, Modernising Tax Administration, and Remedial Matters) Act 2019 1.9. Taxation (Annual Rates for 2017-18, Employment and Investment Income, and Remedial Matters) Act 2018 1.10. Taxation (Research and Development Tax Credits) Act 2019 1.11. Accident Compensation Act 2001 1.12. Income Tax (Adverse Event Income Equalisation Scheme Rate of Interest) Regulations 1995 Policy 2.The Bill contains a number of legislative changes to the KiwiSaver Act and Student Loan Scheme Act, to give effect to policy changes previously agreed by Cabinet. The Bill also contains a number of remedial changes that do not require Cabinet approval and have been approved in my capacity as the Minister of Revenue. 3.The KiwiSaver and Student Loan policy changes lay the foundations for Release 4 of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, scheduled for 1 April 2020, 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 2. IN CONFIDENCE and enhance the administration of these schemes. The changes would ensure that New Zealanders receive the correct entitlements and find it easier to meet their obligations, in a timelier manner. Policy items requiring Cabinet approval 4.Cabinet previously agreed to reduce the period within which a KiwiSaver scheme provider must provide member information and transfer funds to a new provider upon a member changing schemes from 35 days to 10 days \[DEV-19-MIN-0038.01 and CAB-19-MIN-0109 refer\]. Approval is now sought to specify that the reduced 10-day period would only apply to working days rather than calendar days. 5.The existing 35-day transfer period relates to calendar not working days and in practice only applies to non-default KiwiSaver scheme providers, as the transfer period that applies to default scheme providers is regulated. Default scheme providers’ Instruments of Appointment specify that they must fulfil transfer requirements within a period of 10 working days. The rationale for reducing the legislatively mandated transfer period for non-default scheme providers was to align transfer timeframes across all KiwiSaver scheme providers. Therefore, to ensure that the timeframe for default and non-default scheme providers is consistent, it is proposed that the legislatively mandated transfer time should be “10 working days” as opposed to the “10 days” that was previously agreed to by Cabinet. Policy items with prior Cabinet approval 6.The Bill contains legislative changes to give effect to a number of policy changes that have prior cabinet approval. 7.There are eight KiwiSaver changes with prior Cabinet approval \[DEV-19-MIN-0038.01 and CAB-19-MIN-0109\]. These changes require amending the KiwiSaver Act 2006, to apply from 1 April 2020, to take effect at the same time as Business Transformation Release 4. These changes are as follows: 7.1. Allowing Inland Revenue to use Crown funds to pass employer contribution amounts to KiwiSaver scheme providers, before the contribution amount is received by Inland Revenue. 7.2. Calculating interest on employer and employee contributions held by Inland Revenue from a member’s pay day as reported by their employer. 7.3. Reducing the KiwiSaver provisional period from three months to two months. 7.4. Reducing the period that Inland Revenue must hold initial KiwiSaver employee and employer contributions from three months to two months. 7.5. Allowing KiwiSaver members to change contribution rates through their scheme provider or Inland Revenue (rather than only through their employer). 7.6. Removing the three-month grace period, for people who were invalidly enrolled in KiwiSaver, to gain New Zealand residence. 7.7. Requiring employers to provide information to Inland Revenue on the: 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 7.7.1. income on which contributions are calculated; and 7.7.2. the employees employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT) rate. 8. The Bill also contains five student loan policy changes with prior approval \[SWC-19- MIN-0014 and CAB-19-MIN-0085 refers\]. These changes require amendments to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, to apply from 1 April 2020 to take effect at the same time as Business Transformation Release 4. These changes will: 8.1. limit the changes in a borrower’s repayment obligations prior to 1 April 2013 to changes in residency status, where fraud is involved, or where a tax return has not been filed and it is cost effective to make changes. The Bill also proposes an exception to allow the Commissioner to correct the position of any borrower made worse off as a result of this change; 8.2. rename the student loan repayment holiday to student loan temporary repayment suspension; 8.3. give Inland Revenue the ability to write-off student loans taken out before 2000, in cases where borrowers have been able to prove that they did not take out the loan; 8.4. allow Inland Revenue to notify a borrower’s employer when the borrower’s loan is close to being fully repaid; and 8.5. treat overseas-based borrowers with serious illnesses or disabilities as New Zealand-based. 9. The Bill also contains legislative changes to extend the refundability of Research and Development tax credits, as previously agreed by Cabinet \[DEV-19-MIN-0119 and CAB-19-MIN-0240 refer\]. These changes will make tax credits more broadly refundable from the 2020/21 income year. 10. The Bill grants overseas donee status to four charities as previously agreed by Cabinet \[DEV-19-MIN-0055 and CAB-19-MIN-0142 refer\]. The charities are: 10.1. Little Brother and Sisters International. 10.2. Partners Relief and Development – New Zealand. 10.3. Project Moroto. 10.4. UN Women National Committee Aotearoa New Zealand Incorporated. Items not requiring Cabinet approval (approved by the Minister of Revenue) 11. The Bill includes a range of remedial amendments. The changes described cover a range of issues and typically ensure the relevant tax laws are consistent with their policy intent. The changes are not significant in nature, and do not have any revenue or other fiscal effect. Because of the nature of the changes, Cabinet does not need to confirm these changes – they are approved in my capacity as Minister of Revenue. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE Main home exclusion for bright-line test 12. The main home exclusion for the bright-line test requires that a person use the land as their main home for most of the time they own the land. The term “own” is defined in the Act. However, the period that a person owns land under this general definition can differ from the period that the bright-line test applies to. This means that it is possible that taxpayers may not be eligible for the main home exclusion because, although they have used land as their main home for most of the bright-line period, they have not used it as their main home for most of the time they owned the land. The opposite could also occur. The Bill proposes an amendment to align the period of ownership for the main home exclusion for the bright-line test with the bright-line period, to apply from the date of royal assent. Allowing the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings 13. Inland Revenue will be able to issue short-process rulings for small-to-medium sized taxpayers from 1 October 2019. An oversight in the drafting of the legislation means that the Commissioner is unable to withdraw short-process rulings. The Bill proposes an amendment to the Tax Administration Act to enable the Commissioner to withdraw short-process rulings, which would mirror the existing rule that allows her to withdraw private binding rulings. The Commissioner relies on this ability in circumstances where there is a change in the interpretation of the law. The proposal would mean that taxpayers cannot rely on binding rulings for arrangements entered into from the date of notification of the withdrawal. The Bill proposes that this applies from 1 October 2019, being the date short process rulings can apply from. The Commissioner will not need to apply this provision before this bill passes into law. Allowing taxpayers to rely on withdrawn binding rulings on matters not involving an arrangement for the duration of the ruling 14. Recent changes to binding rulings allow the Commissioner to issue binding rulings on matters, without the need for an arrangement (eg, on whether a person meets New Zealand tax residence requirements). The Bill proposes an amendment to ensure that where a binging ruling is withdrawn, taxpayers can continue to rely on the ruling for the duration specified in the ruling where there is no arrangement. The application date of this would be 18 March 2019, which is the date from which the Commissioner can issue binding rulings without the need for an arrangement. Research and Development tax credits (approved by the Minister of Research, Science and Innovation and the Minister of Revenue) 15. There are a small number of cases where the legislation supporting the new R&D tax credit does not align with the policy intent. Issues relate to allocating tax credits to members of joint ventures, the timeframe for businesses to complete the disputes process and the certifier regime, clarifying the definition of internal software development, and removing the ability to challenge decisions of the Commissioner in certain circumstances so as to align with the rest of the scheme. The Bill proposes remedial changes for these issues, to apply from the beginning of the regime in the 2019/20 income year. The Bill also makes a remedial change to the refundability policy recently agreed by Cabinet to clarify that where a firm is part of a group, the payroll tax cap would be assessed at the group level rather than the individual firm. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE Allowing IR to correct the PIR rate of PIE investors on the default rate 16. Currently, investors in PIE funds are expected to elect a tax rate, called a Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR). If they do not notify the PIE fund of a PIR, the top rate will apply by default. Unless the investor has nominated a lower PIR than they should have the tax is final, and the investor will not be able to get a refund for any overpayment. Inland Revenue can correct the rate for an investor who has provided an incorrect PIR but cannot use this power where an investor has been defaulted onto the top rate. The bill proposes an amendment to allow Inland Revenue to correct an investor’s PIR if they have been defaulted onto the top rate. This would apply from 1 April 2020. Income attribution rules 17. Income attribution rules apply when an individual earns income from providing their own services through an entity that has one main source of such income. The rules disregard the entity and tax the income directly to the person performing the services to prevent lower tax being paid. The Bill addresses two issues relating to these rules: 17.1. If the entity provides services to a foreign party and pays tax overseas, a foreign tax credit may not be available to the working person, contrary to policy intent. The Bill includes an amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to clarify that a foreign tax credit is available to the individual, to prevent double taxation. This amendment would have retrospective application from 1 April 2008 to ensure that the law reflects current practice. 17.2. When the income attribution rules are applied, dividends paid to the working person by the entity are exempt from tax, to prevent double taxation of income that has already been taxed to the working person. However, these dividends are exempt even if paid out of income that has not been attributed under these rules, which could result in some income never being taxed. The Bill contains an amendment so that the dividends are only exempt from tax if they have been taxed under the income attribution rules. This would also apply retrospectively to 1 April 2008, this being the original application date of these rules. Trusts 18. Following an administrative review of the income tax treatment of trusts, a number of technical matters for remedial amendment have been identified. These changes will improve the clarity of the law and better reflect the policy intent. These amendments: 18.1. ensure there is consistency within the trust rules on the treatment of distributions when a trustee elects to pay New Zealand tax on world-wide trustee income; 18.2. clarify the relationship of the residence rules to trustees and their obligations under the Income Tax Act 2007; 18.3. clarify rules relating to the value of a settlement; 18.4. ensure there is internal consistency between the treatment of distributions, beneficiary income, taxable distributions and the ordering rules; and 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 18.5. address housekeeping matters such as terminology and notice requirements. Disclosure of information about the misconduct of bookkeepers 19. An existing permitted disclosure allows Inland Revenue to disclose information about the misconduct of tax agents to their industry bodies. The Bill contains a change to the Tax Administration Act which introduces an additional permitted disclosure to allow Inland Revenue to disclose information about the misconduct of bookkeepers with their industry bodies. The Bill proposes an amendment to allow Inland Revenue to make these disclosures and requires that the same test must be met for both bookkeepers and tax agents before Inland Revenue can disclose information. This would apply from the date of enactment. Tax treatment of non-resident international aircraft operators 20. The Income Tax Act allows New Zealand to grant a reciprocal income tax exemption to non-resident international aircraft operators, but the wording of the legislation limits the exemption to outbound aircraft. In practice, the exemption has been granted for both outbound and inbound transport. The Bill proposes an amendment to the Income Tax Act to align the legislation with the policy intent and current operational practice, with retrospective application from 1 April 1984, this being the date that the provisions allowing exemption applied from. Māori authority tax credits 21. Under the current legislation, Māori authority tax credits are able to be attached retrospectively to any distribution from a Māori authority. The intention and current practice is that they can only be retrospectively attached to non-cash distributions under the transfer pricing rules. The Bill proposes an amendment to the Income Tax Act to align the law with policy intent and departmental practice, with retrospective application from 1 April 2008 as this will validate Inland Revenue’s operational practice. Consideration for grant of an easement 22. Under the current law, there are some cases where consideration for the grant of a permanent easement could be considered income. The policy intent is that consideration for the grant of a non-permanent easement is income and consideration for the grant of a permanent easement is capital. The Bill contains an amendment to ensure that the law fulfils this intent. This will apply retrospectively from 1 April 2015, this being the application date of the original provision. Availability of GST tax credits 23. Under the current legislation, a GST tax credit becomes available to a taxpayer the day after the GST tax credit arises. This timing is problematic for Inland Revenue’s systems. The Bill proposes amendments to allow GST tax credits to be available on the date that the credit arises. This will align the legislation with current practice and will be slightly favourable to the taxpayer. The application date proposed for this change is 1 April 2018 to align the legislation with the date the system changes applied from. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE Inbound Thin Capitalisation de minimis 24. Under the current law a New Zealand taxpayer does not have to make adjustments for being over the thin capitalisation threshold provided they have less than $1 million of group finance costs (and have a reduced adjustment if their group finance cost is less than $2 million). This de minimis was not intended to be available if the New Zealand taxpayer borrowed from a non-resident related party; however, the legislation currently only removes access to the de minimis if the taxpayer has borrowed from an owner who is not a member of the same group. The Bill proposes to align the legislation with the intent for income years starting on or after 1 July 2018, to align with the introduction of the de minimis. Employee Share Schemes 25. The Bill contains three changes to the Employee Share Schemes (ESS) rules. The application date of these changes is 29 March 2018, the original application date of the ESS reforms. Definition of market value 26. Under the current legislation, the ‘market value’ of listed shares is defined as being the ‘middle market quotation’. Obtaining this ‘middle market quotation’ is difficult in practice. From a policy perspective, there are a range of methods that are sensible approximations of market value. The Bill proposes an amendment to allow companies to use a wider range of methods to value shares for the purposes of the ESS rules. Takeovers and similar reorganisations under employee share schemes 27. Currently, the exempt ESS rules require shares to be held by a trustee for a ‘restricted period’ (generally three years) before they can be released to employees. This is to prevent the rules being used to confer a tax-exempt cash benefit to employees. Exempt ESS trust deeds often provide for takeovers and other corporate re- organisations. If a takeover occurs, which can include the shares of minority interests being compulsorily acquired, this could breach the restricted period and mean the scheme fails to meet the statutory criteria, making the shares taxable. 28. Providing an exemption to the restricted period in the case of takeovers or other re- organisations that are outside the control of the employee would not significantly undermine the policy intent behind the restricted period. The Bill proposes that takeovers and similar re-organisations and acquisitions do not disturb the exempt status of benefits provided under ESS even if this occurs within the restricted period, provided it is outside the control of the employee. Flexibility to allow employees to retain their shares if they leave employment 29. Currently, employees who leave employment within the restricted period in the exempt ESS rules must have their shares bought back for the lesser of cost or market value, except in limited cases. These limited cases include employees retiring, being made redundant or if the employee dies. These employees are able to keep their shares or have them bought back for the lesser of cost or market value. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 30. The ESS rules were amended in 2018 to allow trans-Tasman companies to offer Australian exempt schemes to their New Zealand employees. Australian ESS rules requires that all employees leaving employment must be able to keep their shares. Since this conflicts with New Zealand’s rules, it is difficult for trans-Tasman companies to offer the same scheme in both countries. 31. The Bill proposes that companies have the option to choose whether their trust deed allows either: 31.1. That all employees can keep their shares or have them bought back for the lesser of cost or market value; or 31.2. That the trustee must buy the shares back for the lesser of cost or market value. Provisional tax 32. The Bill includes a number of remedial amendments to align tax legislation with Inland Revenue’s systems. This has arisen following the development and design of release 3 of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. The changes either have no or a positive impact on taxpayers or are necessary to maintain the integrity of the tax system. Removing the ability of taxpayers to make an estimate on their final instalment and receive the interest concessions for the standard uplift method. 33. This is an integrity measure to ensure that taxpayers cannot take advantage of the design of the system to both reduce their obligations under the provisional tax rules and obtain an interest concession. The Bill proposes that this amendment apply from the 2019-20 income year. Clarify the calculation of interest for standard uplift method taxpayers 34. This amendment aligns the legislation with the policy intent and system design. This change will apply retrospectively from 1 April 2017 to align with the treatment in the system and provide certainty to taxpayers. The amendment is beneficial to taxpayers. Clarify the application of late payment penalties applicable from the final instalment date for standard method taxpayers 35. This corrects an error in the legislation as originally enacted. Inland Revenue’s systems have been applying the rule as it was intended to apply, which is beneficial to taxpayers. The Bill recommends this amendment apply from 1 April 2017 to provide certainty to taxpayers. Remove the ability for taxpayers to choose the provisional tax instalment to which a payment is applied 36. This change will remove the ability for taxpayers to direct a payment to a particular instalment of provisional tax. It will prevent non-compliant taxpayers from reducing their exposure to late payment penalties and gaining an advantage compared to compliant taxpayers. In addition, Inland Revenue’s systems have not been configured to allow for such payment directions. The proposed amendment will apply from 1 April 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 2017 to stop taxpayers revisiting prior periods to gain a retrospective advantage. A savings provision will cover the unlikely position where a taxpayer has requested the allocation of a payment. Clarify the way in which provisional tax is truncated to whole dollars 37. The Bill proposes an amendment to confirm the current system approach of truncating cents. The application date proposed for this change is 1 April 2017 to provide certainty to taxpayers and ensure no taxpayer is disadvantaged by this technicality. Clarify the wording in the interest concession rules to more clearly indicate how the interest rules apply to the final instalment of provisional tax 38. Some of the wording in the legislation for the current interest concession rules is unclear. This amendment will not have any practical impact on taxpayers. The proposed application date is 1 April 2017 to provide taxpayers with certainty. Amend section 139B(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure it correctly covers taxpayers who have a non-standard number of instalments 39. The provisions that cover the interest concession rules do not allow for taxpayers with more or less than three instalments of provisional tax. The Bill proposes an amendment to ensure that these taxpayers are able to access the interest concession rules. This amendment should apply from the 2019-20 income year, to ensure that no taxpayers are disadvantaged. Impact analysis 40. Regulatory Impact Assessments were prepared for the policy items in the Bill that required impact assessment. These were submitted at the time that the Cabinet Committee approval for the relevant policy items in the Bill was sought. 41. The regulatory impact assessments prepared cover: 41.1. Business Transformation related KiwiSaver refinements. 41.2. Student Loans: Back-year reassessments prior to 2013. 41.3. Extending the refundability of research and development tax credits. 42. The regulatory impact requirements do not apply to the remaining items in the Bill. A number of items involve technical “revisions” or consolidations that substantially re- enact the current law to improve legislative clarity and understanding (including the fixing of errors, the clarification of the existing legislative intent and the reconciliation of inconsistencies). Other items have no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. Compliance 43. The Bill complies with: 43.1. the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 43.2. the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; 43.3. the disclosure statement requirements (a disclosure statement has been prepared and is attached to this paper); 43.4. the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; 43.5. relevant international standards and obligations; 43.6. the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Consultation 44. The substantive policy initiatives to which this Bill is intended to give effect were subject to public and other consultation in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. Relevant government departments or other public bodies 45. The Treasury was consulted in the development of many of the proposals in the Bill. Other government departments and public bodies consulted on relevant aspects of the proposals include the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Social Development, the Office for Disability Issues, the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. The Financial Markets Authority and Office of the Privacy Commissioner have also been consulted on relevant proposals. Relevant private sector organisations and public consultation processes 46. KiwiSaver scheme providers have been consulted on the KiwiSaver proposals and are supportive. 47. A wide range of organisations have been consulted on the development of the research and development tax credits policy. Officials have discussed the proposals with the Corporate Taxpayers’ Group; Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand; representatives from PwC, KPMG, Deloitte and EY; approximately 25 representatives from R&D performing businesses in tax loss or with insufficient taxable income to fully utilise non-refundable R&D tax credits; some large established R&D performers; levy bodies; charities; cooperatives; Federation of Maori Authorities; and Māori business representatives. The refundability proposals have been shaped through these discussions. The government caucus and other parties represented in Parliament 48. Both Government caucus and coalition and support parties will be consulted on this Bill prior to its proposed introduction. Binding on the Crown 49. A number of the Acts being amended by this Bill currently bind the Crown. This Bill does not change this. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE Allocation of decision making powers 50. The Bill does not involve the allocation of decision-making powers between the executive, the courts, and tribunals. Associated regulations 51. No regulations are required to bring the proposed Bill into operation. Other instruments 52. The Bill does not include any provision empowering the making of other instruments that are deemed to be legislative instruments or disallowable instruments (or both). Definition of Minister/department 53. The Bill does not contain a definition of Minister, department, or chief executive. Commencement of legislation 54. As an omnibus taxation Bill, each provision of the Bill comes into force on the date specified in the Bill for that particular provision. Parliamentary stages 55. The Bill should be introduced on or after 26 June 2019, referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee, and ideally reported back to the house by the end of 2019. Because the Bill contains changes necessary for Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation release 4, the Bill should be passed no later than February 2020. Proactive Release 56. I propose that this paper, alongside associated policy and Cabinet papers, be proactively released when the Bill is introduced, subject to redactions considered under the provisions of the Official Information Act 1982. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends the Committee: 1. note that on 20 March 2019, the Cabinet Economic Development Committee agreed that the period a scheme provider has to share information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes be reduced from 35 days to 10 days \[DEV-19-MIN-0038.1\]; 2. agree to recommend that Cabinet rescind the decision referred to in recommendation 1; and instead replace it with agreement that the period a scheme provider has to share member information and transfer funds to a new provider when a member transfers schemes be reduced from 35 days to 10 working days; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-06-16 18:01:56 IN CONFIDENCE 3. note that the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill holds a category 3 priority on the 2019 Legislation Programme (to be passed if possible in the year); 4. note that the Bill contains legislative changes that give effect to KiwiSaver and Student loan policy changes agreed by Cabinet to enable Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Release 4, changes that extend the refundability of Research and Development tax credits and grant overseas donee status to four charities and a number of remedial amendments; 5. approve the Taxation (KiwiSaver, Student Loans, and Remedial Matters) Bill for introduction, subject to the final approval of the government caucus and sufficient support in the House of Representatives; 6. agree that the Bill be introduced on or after 26 June 2019; 7. agree that the government propose that the Bill be: 7.1. referred to the Finance and Expenditure Committee for consideration; 7.2. passed no later than February 2020.

In Confidence IR2019/280: Use of money interest rates review Page 1 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 6 June 2019 M inister of Revenue Use of money interest rates review Executive summary 1.This report seeks your agreement to adjust the use of money interest rates (UOMI) as part of the regular review of the UOMI rates. 2.The UOMI rates are reviewed regularly to ensure that they align with market interes t r ates. The UOMI rates are calculated using formulae based on the results of the Reserve Bank (RBNZ) survey of interest rates. These formulae are set down in regulations. 3.The current underpayment UOMI rate is 8.22% and the overpayment UOMI rate is 1.02%. We recommend that the underpayment rate be increased to 8.35%, and that the overpayment rate be reduced to 0.81%, in line with movements in market rates. Your approval is sought to make these rate changes, and for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft an Order in Council to set the new rates. 4.If you agree, the new rates will come into force on 29 August 2019, the day after the due date for the first standard instalment of provisional tax. We confirm that this complies with the 28-day rule. 5.In anticipation of your approval, officials have advised the Parliamentary Counsel Office that a draft Order in Council changing the rates will need to be prepared. 6.Attached is a paper to the Cabinet Legislation Committee recommending that it approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to Cabinet and the Executive Council. For the paper to be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee at its meeting on 25 June 2019, it should be referred to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 20 June 2019. 7.A draft press statement will be forwarded for your consideration once the Order in Council has been made. 8.The Treasury has been consulted and agrees with the recommendations in this report. A copy should be referred to the Minister of Finance for his information.

Referred J ess Rowe Team Lead Policy and Strategy H on Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence IR2019/280: Use of money interest rates review Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Background 9.The UOMI rates are an important component of the tax compliance rules. By changing in line with underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayer s w ith the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. They apply to all revenue and duties. 10.The UOMI rates are set according to the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997. The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for underpaid tax is the latest Reserve Bank New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 11.The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate is a proxy for a debt that a taxpayer might prioritise over their tax obligations. In the absence of a UOMI charge, a taxpayer wanting to borrow money could simply underpay their tax and use Inland Revenue as a bank rather than borrow from a bank at a commercial interest rate. A conservative margin of 250 basis points is added to the mortgage rate in calculating the underpayment UOMI rate because the Commissioner does not have information about the likelihood of any individual taxpayer paying the UOMI charged to them (i.e. the taxpayer’s credit-worthiness). 12.The Regulations provide that the methodology for setting the interest rate for overpaid tax is the latest RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates, and approximates the return a taxpayer might expect on a low-risk investment in the New Zealand Government. Ensuring that the Commissioner pays less interest to the taxpayer on overpaid tax than the taxpayer would receive as a return from a low- risk bond aims to prevent Inland Revenue being used as an investment. 13.Because the two UOMI rates are based on two different Reserve Bank interest rate measures that can move independently of each other, the underpayment rate can increase while the overpayment rate decreases, as is the case in this rates review. 14.The current underpayment rate is 8.22% and the current overpayment rate is 1.02%. Principles to be applied in resetting UOMI rates 15.I n 2010 the Minister of Revenue agreed that the following principles be applied in setting new UOMI rates (PAD 2010/287 refers): •adjust both UOMI rates where there has been a 1% increase or 1% decrease (since the time the rates were last set) in the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate or the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate; •adjust both UOMI rates every 12 months where there has been an increase or decrease in the Reserve Bank 90-day bank bill rate or the floating firs t m ortgage new customer housing rate of 20 basis points or more (since the time the rates were last set), if the previous 12-month movement has not been sufficient to trigger a change, in order to avoid long-term misalignmen t o f the rates; and •apply the adjustment from the next standard provisional tax payment date. In Confidence IR2019/280: Use of money interest rates review Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 16.Inland Revenue officials are responsible for monitoring the RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate and the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate throughout the year. 17.The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 8 May 2017 and were based on the interest rates for February 2017. Annual review of UOMI rates 18.The Reserve Bank’s survey results for the relevant market interest rates in February 2017 and April 2019 are below: Month ended Floating first mortgage new customer housing rate (%) 90-day bank bill rate (%) February 2017 5.72 2.02 April 2019 5.85 1.81 Note: add 250 basis points to the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate to get the UOMI under-payment interest rate and subtract 100 basis points from the 90-day bank bill rate to get the UOMI overpayment rate. 19.The results for April 2019 indicate that, since the rates were last set, the floating mortgage new customer housing rate has increased by 13 basis points, and the 90- day bank bill rate has decreased by 21 basis points. To avoid a long-term misalignment, officials consider an adjustment to the UOMI rates is necessary. 20.Officials recommend that the underpayment and overpayment rates be changed to 8.35% and 0.81% respectively. Approval for drafting 21.The UOMI rates are set at regular intervals by Order in Council and it has become a routine matter to amend them. Paragraph 7.91(d) of the Cabinet Office Manual provides that where the making of an Order in Council will not involve any further policy considerations, the Minister may authorise drafting without reference to Cabinet. 22.Your approval is sufficient for the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the Order in Council. Financial implications 23.UOMI applies to both overpayments and underpayments of tax. Although more is charged by the Commissioner on underpayments than is paid to the taxpayer on overpayments, the charges to underpayments are impaired by 80% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid, and therefore must be written-off . This means that an increase in the underpayment rate also produces an increase in impairment expenditure. In Confidence IR2019/280: Use of money interest rates review Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 24.The full year net saving for the 2019/20 fiscal year is estimated to be $6 million, and $7 million per annum for 2020/21 and later years. These savings comprise a revenue increase of $9 million in 2019/20 and $10 million per annum for 2020/21 and later years, and an increase in impairment expenditure of $3 million per annum. This is shown in the following tables: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue - 9.000 10.000 10.000 10.000 Total Operating - 9.000 10.000 10.000 10.000 $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/ 20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Non- Departmental Other Expense: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs (funded by Revenue Crown) - 3.000 3.000 3.000 3.000 Total Operating - 3.000 3.000 3.000 3.000 25.W e note that these revenue implications are a forecasting change only as they result from an existing policy; therefore there is no impact on the scorecard from the proposed adjustment to the UOMI rates. Consultation 26.The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and agrees with its contents. Next steps 27.To enable the UOMI rates to come into force on 29 August 2019 it is proposed that the Order in Council be submitted to Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 20 June 2019 for the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on Tuesday 25 June 2019 an d t o Cabinet and the Executive Council for approval on Monday 1 July 2019. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee TAXATION (USE OF MONEY INTEREST RATES) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2019 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order i n Council amending the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates) Regulations 1998 to the Executive Council. 2.It is proposed to amend the regulation so the underpayment use-of-money (UOMI) i nterest rate is set at 8.35% and the overpayment UOMI rate is set at 0.81%. Policy 3.The UOMI rates play an important role in the tax compliance rules. By moving in line w ith underlying market rates, the UOMI rates provide taxpayers with the incentive to pay the right amount of tax at the right time. The rates apply to all revenue and duties. 4.The Tax Administration Act 1994 provides for the UOMI underpayment and o verpayment interest rates to be set by Order in Council. Once the rates are set, they remain the prescribed UOMI rates unless subsequently changed by Order in Council. 5.The methodology for calculating the rates is set out in the Taxation (Use of Money Interest Rates Setting Process) Regulations 1997 (the Regulations). The Regulations provide that the interest rate for underpaid tax should be set at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) floating first mortgage new customer housing rate plus 250 basis points. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate reflects the variable interest rate offered by surveyed institutions to new borrowers for residential property, weighted by each surveyed institution’s total lending outstanding for housing purposes. 6.The Regulations provide that the interest rate for overpaid tax is set at the latest R BNZ 90-day bank bill rate less 100 basis points. The RBNZ 90-day bank bill rate is the monthly average of the daily standard rates. 7.The current underpayment and overpayment rates are 8.22% and 1.02% re spectively. The UOMI rates were last changed by Order in Council with effect from 8 May 2017 and were based on the interest rates for February 2017. 8.The RBNZ interest rates for April 2019 indicate that the floating first mortgage new cu stomer housing rate and the 90-day bank bill rate have changed by 13 and 21 basis points respectively since the rates were last adjusted. I consider that an adjustment of the UOMI rates is necessary to avoid a long-term misalignment. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 12:26:34 IN CONFIDENCE 2. 9.Therefore, I recommend that the underpayment rate be changed to 8.35% and the overpayment rate be changed to 0.81%. Timing and 28-day rule 10.I propose to submit the Order in Council giving effect to the changes in UOMI rates t o Cabinet for approval and submission to the Executive Council at its meeting on 1 July 2019. In order to minimise compliance costs it is proposed that the new UOMI rates come into force on 29 August 2019, the day after the due date for the first standard instalment of provisional tax. This also complies with the 28-day rule. Compliance 11.The regulations comply with the principles, Acts, guidelines, and requirements set o ut below as follows: 11.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi N ot applicable 11.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 11.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 N ot applicable 11.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 11.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 11.6 the L egislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee Complies Regulations Review Committee 12.There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 13.The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the attached Order in Council is i n order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 14.A regulatory impact assessment is not required as the proposal is of a minor and ro utine nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-07-09 12:26:34 IN CONFIDENCE Financial Implications 15.The proposal is estimated to result in net positive revenue of $27 million over the forecast period, with the effective date of 29 August 2019. The increase in tax revenue arises due to both a decrease in the Commissioner’s paying rate and an increase in the underpayment rate for taxpayers. The tax revenue implications are shown below: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue Minister of Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Crown Revenue and Receipts: Tax Revenue -9.000 10.000 10.000 10.000 Total Operating -9.000 10.000 10.000 10.000 16.The tax revenue increase is offset by an increase in expenditure for impairment of debt and debt write-off costs, arising from an increase in the underpayment rate. Revenue from the underpayment rate is impaired by 80% in the Crown accounts to reflect that most UOMI charged is never paid. This impact on appropriations is shown in the table below: $ millions increase / (decrease) Vote Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Minister of Revenue Outyears Non-Departmental -3.000 3.000 3.000 3.000 Other Expense: Impairment of debt and debt write-offs (funded by Revenue Crown) Total Operating -3.000 3.000 3.000 3.000 Publicity 17.I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 18.Inland Revenue will publish an item about these changes in its T ax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 19.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions.

In Confidence IR2019/350: Setting the deemed rate of return for the 2018–19 income year: Order in Council for the Cabinet Legislation Committee Page 1 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE 15 July 2019 Mi nister of Revenue Setting the deemed rate of return for the 2018–19 income year: Order in Council for the Cabinet Legislation Committee Background 1.The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the deemed rate of return under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules for each income year be set by Order in Council. 2.New Zealand’s FIF rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non- controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. Since 1 April 2014, most interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed on transfer, rather than under the FIF rules. 3.The Income Tax Act 2007 provides a number of different methods to calculate FIF income (or loss) for tax purposes, one of which is the deemed rate of return method. An investor must use the deemed rate of return method where: •the interest consists of certain non-ordinary shares that have debt characteristics; and •the comparative value method cannot be used because the end-of-year market value of the interest cannot be determined. 4.Under the deemed rate of return method, income from a FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by the rate set annually by Order in Council. 5.An Order in Council is now required to set the deemed rate of return for the 2018– 19 income year. Calculation 6.The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. If the last day of the quarter falls on a weekend or statutory holiday, the rate on the next business day is used. 7.Officials recommend that the current method for calculating the deemed rate of return be used again for the 2018–19 income year. It is a simple way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities, incorporating a four percentage-point risk premium over the return on “risk-free” debt, such as Government stock. The method has been used for every income year since 1994. 8.The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2018– 19 income year is 1.86%. This means that the deemed rate of return for the 2018– 19 income year will be 5.86% (1.86% plus four percentage points). This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 6.44%. In Confidence IR2019/350: Setting the deemed rate of return for the 2018–19 income year: Order in Council for the Cabinet Legislation Committee Page 2 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE Regulatory Impact Analysis 9.A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB (94) M 35/3 C(vi) refers). Timing 10.The Order in Council will enable taxpayers using the deemed rate of return method to calculate their FIF income for the 2018–19 income year and will therefore effectively apply from 1 April 2018. However, because the deemed rate calculation is based on the 2018–19 five-year Government bond rates, the Order in Council will have retrospective effect. 11.A waiver of the 28-day rule for this regulation coming into force will not be sought this year. This departs from the approach taken in previous years. Cabinet paper and associated materials 12.The Cabinet paper and the advice sheet for the Order in Council have been prepared and are attached to this report. These two documents should be signed and referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday, 15 August 2019, for consideration at the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s meeting on Tuesday, 20 August 2019. 13.The Parliamentary Counsel Office will provide copies of the finalised Order in Council directly to the Cabinet Office. 14.A media statement will be issued once the Order in Council has been made. Proactive Release 15.I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982.

P revious rates •2017–18 rate: 6.44% •2016–17 rate: 6.28% •2015–16 rate: 6.77% In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (DEEMED RATE OF RETURN ON ATTRIBUTING INTERESTS IN FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS, 2018–19 INCOME YEAR) ORDER 2019 Proposal 1.This paper proposes that Cabinet Legislation Committee authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Order in Council, which will set the deemed rate of return at 5.86% for attributing interests in foreign investment funds for the 2018–19 income year. Background 2.New Zealand’s foreign investment fund (FIF) rules tax New Zealand residents on attributed income from non-controlling investments in foreign companies, life insurance policies, and certain superannuation schemes. The Income Tax Act 2007 provides a number of methods for calculating the amount of income or loss to be attributed to the taxpayer. One of these methods is the deemed rate of return method. 3.The deemed rate of return method is used to calculate FIF income or loss for non- ordinary shares with debt-like properties, if the market value of the FIF interest cannot be determined at the end of the income year. 4.Under the deemed rate of return method, income from an FIF is calculated each year by multiplying the opening book value of the investment by a deemed rate set annually by Order in Council. 5.The method for calculating the annual deemed rate of return was established and approved in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers) and published in Inland Revenue’s October 1994 Tax Information Bulletin. The calculation involves taking an average of the five-year “risk-free” Government bond rates at the end of each quarter of the income year and then adding a risk premium margin of four percentage points. 6.The current method is a suitable way of approximating the expected return on foreign equities and has been used for every income year since 1994. Comment 7.The average of the quarterly five-year Government bond interest rates for the 2018– 19 income year is 1.86%. The attached Income Tax (Deemed Rate of Return on Attributing Interests in Foreign Investment Funds, 2018–19 Income Year) Order 2019 1 IN CONFIDENCE 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-09-03 12:13:58 3 . therefore sets the deemed rate of return for the 2018–19 income year at 5.86% (1.86% plus four percentage points) in accordance with the current method of calculation. This is a decrease from last year’s deemed rate of return, which was 6.44%. 8.The Order also revokes the previous year’s corresponding Order, which set the deemed rate of return for the 2017–18 income year. Timing and 28-day rule 9.The 28-day rule requires that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. 10.Although the attached Order in Council is to apply retrospectively, a waiver for the 28-day rule is not being sought. This is a departure from the approach taken for making this regulation in previous years. Consultation 11.The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper and agrees with its recommendations. Human rights 12.The attached Order in Council complies with: a)the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; b)the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993; c)the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; d)relevant international standards and obligations; and e)the guidelines in the Legislation Advisory Committee report Guidelines on Process and Content of Legislation (May 2001). Legislative implications 13.The proposal of this Cabinet paper is that the attached Order in Council be submitted to the Executive Council. Regulatory Impact Analysis 14.A Regulatory Impact Analysis is not required because no policy decision is being sought. The deemed rate of return has been calculated in accordance with a formula that was approved by Cabinet in 1994 (CAB Min (94) 35/3 C(vi) refers). Regulations Review Committee 15.There are no anticipated grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House.

This report seeks your signature and referral to Cabinet Office of the attached Cabinet paper which, in turn, seeks Cabinet approval to submit to the Executive Council the Double Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019. 2. The Order will give effect under New Zealand law to a new Double Tax Agreement (DTA) signed with China on 1 April 2019. The new DTA replaces a previous DTA that has been in force with China since 1986. 3. The timeline we are working to is for the paper to be considered by the Cabinet Legislation Committee (LEG) on 24 September 2019, and Cabinet on 30 September 2019. To meet these meeting dates, the paper will need to be lodged with Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 19 September 2019. 4. In addition to signing the Cabinet paper, you are requested to sign the attached Order in Council “goatskin” cover sheet, for submission to Cabinet office with the Cabinet paper. 5. A draft copy of the Order in Council is attached for your information. The certificate and signature copies of the Order will be sent direct to Cabinet Office by the Parliamentary Counsel Office, for associating with the Cabinet paper. 6. Cabinet has already considered the new DTA, when it approved the signing of the DTA on 19 March 2018 (CAB-18-MIN-0087 refers). Parliamentary treaty examination has now been completed, with the Finance and Expenditure Committee reporting to the House on 25 July 2019 that it “welcomed the treaty” and “encouraged the Government to speedily bring it into force”. 7. The making of an Order in Council is one of the two remaining steps required for entry into force under New Zealand law. After the Order has been made, the final step will be to exchange with China diplomatic notes that confirm each country has completed all of its respective domestic steps for entry into force. The DTA will enter into force on the date of the later note. 8. China has not yet forwarded its diplomatic note, but we expect the exchange to be completed (and the DTA brought into force) either by the end of 2019 or in early 2020. 9. We will provide your office with suggested talking points for taking the paper through LEG. 10. It would be more normal to issue a press statement at the time the DTA enters into force rather than on the making of the Order in Council. We will discuss appropriate publicity with your office. 11. The attached Cabinet paper should be proactively released within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions. A redacted copy of this report is attached for reference. In Confidence IR2019 /409: Cabinet paper – Double Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019 Page 2 of 2 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: 12. Sign and refer the attached Cabinet paper and accompanying Order in Council cover sheet to the Cabinet Office by 10am, Thursday 19 September 2019, for consideration by the Cabinet Legislation Committee on Tuesday 24 September 2019. Signed and referred 13. Note that the Parliamentary Counsel Office will arrange for certificate and signature copies of the Order in Council to be sent directly to the Cabinet Office. Noted 14. Refer a copy of this report and the attached Cabinet paper to the Minister of Foreign Affairs for his information. Referred 15. Note that officials will discuss appropriate publicity with your office. Noted 16.

Agree/Disagree Carmel Peters Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee DOUBLE TAX AGREEMENTS (CHINA) ORDER 2019 Proposal 1.This paper proposes the submission of the accompanying draft Order in Council, the Do uble Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019, to the Executive Council. 2.Once made, the Order 2019 will incorporate into New Zealand law the recently sig ned Agreement between The Government of New Zealand and The Government of the People’s Republic of China For the Elimination of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income and the Prevention of Tax Evasion and Avoidance (the China DTA). Policy 3.This paper gives effect to policy decisions made by Cabinet on 19 March 2018 (C AB-18-MIN-0087 refers) when it approved the signing of the China DTA and the ensuing steps for entry into force. 4.Following signature, on 1 April 2019, and the successful completion of Parliamentary tre aty examination, the next step is for the making of an Order in Council to give legislative effect to the China DTA under New Zealand law. 5.DTAs are primarily entered into to foster increased trade, investment and other economic activity with other countries by reducing, and in some cases entirely eliminating, tax barriers to such cross-border activity. 6.New Zealand currently has 40 DTAs in force, covering the majority of New Zealand’s maj or trading and investment partners. This includes a DTA with China entered into in 1986. The new DTA with China replaces that existing DTA with a modernised agreement. 7.The Order in Council giving effect to the China DTA will be made under Section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which expressly authorises the making of such Orders for the purpose of giving overriding effect to DTAs. Previous consideration 8.As noted, Cabinet approved the signing of the China DTA in March 2018. Spe cifically, Cabinet: agreed that the text of the new China DTA and the accompanying \[N ational Interest Analysis\] NIA be tabled in the House of Representatives for Parliamentary treaty examination, in accordance with Standing Orders 397- 400; 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 10:15:04 IN CONFIDENCE 2.  noted that the China DTA will be incorporated into New Zealand domestic law through an Order in Council, made pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007;  invited the Minister of Revenue to issue drafting instructions to the Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the appropriate Order in Council to give effect to the new China DTA;  noted that, following satisfactory completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination, the Order in Council will be submitted to Cabinet for approval; and  authorised officials, following completion of the Parliamentary treaty examination and promulgation of the Order in Council, to bring the new China DTA into force by exchanging diplomatic notes with China. Entry into force of the China DTA 9. Pursuant to the above 2018 Cabinet decision, the China DTA was signed on 1 April 2019. It has also undergone Parliamentary treaty examination, with the Finance and Expenditure Committee reporting to the House on 25 July 2019 that it “welcomed the treaty” and “encouraged the Government to speedily bring it into force”. The remaining steps are to:  make an Order in Council incorporating the China DTA into New Zealand law; and  exchange diplomatic notes with China to bring the China DTA into force. 10. Once diplomatic notes have been exchanged, and the China DTA has entered into force, its provisions will generally have effect for New Zealand from the start of the next tax year. However, provisions that relate to withholding taxes will have effect for New Zealand from 1 January of the calendar year following entry into force. 11. China has not yet forwarded its diplomatic note to New Zealand. Once New Zealand has forwarded its note to China, enquiries will be made as to when China will be ready to send its diplomatic note. I expect that the China DTA will enter into force either by the end of 2019 or in early 2020. 12. As the provisions of the China DTA take effect, the corresponding provisions in the existing China DTA will cease to have effect. The 1986 Order in Council that gave effect to the existing China DTA will subsequently be revoked, under the terms of the attached Order in Council. Timing and 28-day rule 13. The 28-day rule requires that regulations be notified in the New Zealand Gazette 28 days prior to their coming into effect. No waiver of the 28-day rule is proposed. Compliance 14. The attached Order in Council complies with:  the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 10:15:04 IN CONFIDENCE  the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 and the Human Rights Act 1993;  relevant international standards and obligations; and  the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. 15. The Order generally complies with principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993. However, as is the case for all DTAs, the information-exchange provisions of the China DTA require an override of the Privacy Act 1993 to ensure that they are not constrained by certain privacy principles set out in that Act (such as the limitation imposed, at section 6 of the Act, on the disclosure of personal information). This is expressly provided for under section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Legislative implications 16. Once the China DTA is given legislative effect in New Zealand by Order in Council, it will have effect according to its terms despite anything to the contrary in the Inland Revenue Acts, the Official Information Act 1982, and the Privacy Act 1993. This overriding effect is standard for all DTAs and is the reason why DTAs are subjected to Parliamentary treaty examination. As noted, no concerns were identified by Select Committee during treaty examination consideration. 17. The override of the Inland Revenue Acts is necessary to give effect to the tax provisions in the China DTA (such as the allocation of taxing rights). 18. The override of the Official Information Act 1982 is to allow for confidential communications between jurisdictions to remain confidential. 19. The override of the Privacy Act 1993 is, as noted above, to permit the exchange of information provisions of the China DTA to operate without constraint. Regulations Review Committee 20. I am not aware of any grounds on which the Regulations Review Committee might draw the Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 318. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 21. The Parliamentary Counsel Office has certified that the Order in Council is in order for submission to Cabinet. Regulatory Impact Analysis 22. A regulatory impact statement is not required for the Order. The Double Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019 implements an international treaty for which a NIA has previously been prepared and considered by Cabinet (see section on previous consideration). The NIA constitutes an “extended NIA” (that is, it incorporates all of the requirements of a regulatory impact statement). The NIA was reviewed by Inland Revenue and was certified as meeting the adequacy criteria. Publicity 23. The new Order will be notified in the New Zealand Gazette. I will arrange appropriate additional publicity to announce the entry into force of the China DTA. The text of the China DTA, the NIA and the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s report following 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 10:15:04 IN CONFIDENCE Parliamentary treaty examination are already available to the public on Inland Revenue’s Tax Policy website. Proactive Release 24. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions, subject to minor redactions under the Official Information Act 1982. Consultation 25. The Parliamentary Counsel Office was consulted in the preparation of the Order in Council. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Treasury were consulted during the previous consideration of the China DTA but were not specifically consulted on this paper (which merely gives effect to previous decisions). The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has been informed. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-10-04 10:15:04 IN CONFIDENCE Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that following previous consideration of and approval by Cabinet (CAB-18-MIN- 0087 refers), a new double tax agreement (DTA) between New Zealand and China was signed on 1 April 2019; 2. note that the new DTA replaces a previous DTA with China that was signed in 1986; 3. note that the Double Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019 will incorporate the China DTA into New Zealand law pursuant to section BH 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 4. note that, subject to the successful promulgation of the Order, the China DTA will be brought into force through an exchange of diplomatic notes with China (CAB-18- MIN-0087 refers); 5. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the attached Double Tax Agreements (China) Order 2019.

In Confidence IR2019 /578: Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Page 1 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE 24 October 2019 Minister of Revenue Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Executive summary 1. This report sets out the annual review of the Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) and seeks your agreement to increase the MFTC threshold for the 2020/21 tax year. 2. The MFTC tops up the after-tax annual income of recipient families to a threshold level so that the amount of income someone can receive working part-time and receiving an abated benefit never exceeds what they could earn if they worked full- time, moved off-benefit and began to receive in-work support. 3. In the 2017/18 tax year 3,320 families received the MFTC at a fiscal cost of $12 million. Approximately 90% of MFTC recipients are sole parents, largely as a function of the lower work-hours requirement compared to coupled families. 4. As part of the Working for Families reforms between 2004-2007 it was decided to increase the rate of MFTC and adjust the threshold annually to ensure there is always a financial incentive for beneficiaries to increase their employment by guaranteeing a higher income when working full-time and moving off benefit. Since these changes, the MFTC has been increased every year to reflect relativities between in-work support and main benefits such as the CPI adjustment of benefit rates, minimum wage increases and marginal tax rate changes. 5. In line with current policy, officials recommend that you increase the MFTC threshold from $26,572 ($511 per week) to $27,768 ($534 per week) for the 2020/21 tax year. 6. Legislation requires the Order in Council to be made by 1 December 2019 for the change to apply from 1 April 2020. 7. A draft Cabinet paper and associated speaking notes have been attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 19 November. If you agree with the proposed change, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will be instructed to draft the necessary regulations and officials will provide these to you before consideration by Cabinet. In Confidence IR2019 /578: Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Page 2 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: a) Agree to increase the level of the Minimum Family Tax Credit for the 2020/21 tax year from $26,572 to $27,768 ($511 to $534 per week) after tax. Agreed/Not agreed b) Note that there are no funding implications from increasing the minimum family tax credit threshold for the 2019/20 tax year, as annual increases are built into existing appropriations. Noted c) Agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office be instructed to draft the necessary regulations to bring into effect the decision in recommendation (a), for consideration by Cabinet.

Referred Maraina Hak Policy Lead Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 24/10/2019 In Confidence IR2019 /578: Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Page 4 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Background Policy 8. The Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) evolved from the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income (1986-1999) and the Family Tax Credit (1999-2004) and is currently one payment within the system of Working for Families tax credits. 9. To be eligible to receive the MFTC a family must have annual income below the specified threshold amount, not be receiving a main benefit and work for at least 20 hours per week (sole parents) or a combined 30 hours (couples). 10. The payment tops up the after-tax annual income of eligible families to a threshold level, set at $26,572 for the 2019/2020 tax year. The net threshold remained largely unadjusted between 1990 and 2005, increasing from $13,936 to $15,080. However, the purpose of the payment was refined during the Working for Families reforms between 2004-2007 and it was decided to increase the MFTC and adjust its threshold annually from 1 April 2006 onwards. 11. The three key objectives of the Working for Families package were (CAB min (04) 13/4 refers): 11.1 make work pay by supporting families with dependent children, so that they are rewarded for their work effort; 11.2 ensure income adequacy, with a focus on low- and middle-income families with dependent children to address issues of poverty, especially child poverty; and 11.3 achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work, by making sure that people get the assistance they are entitled to, when they should, and with delivery that supports them into, and to remain in, employment. 12. Since these changes, the MFTC has been set annually to a level which resolves an integrity issue within the tax and transfer system whereby the in-work financial assistance provided to someone moving from part- to full-time employment, in addition to their higher market income, was potentially not sufficient to compensate for the amount of benefit income they lost. This means that in the absence of the MFTC someone could have less income in the hand as a result of moving off benefit and into full-time work. 13. The purpose of the MFTC can therefore be summarised as supporting the “make work pay” and “achieve a social assistance system that supports people into work” objectives of the Working for Families package by ensuring there is always a financial incentive for beneficiaries to increase their employment by guaranteeing a higher income when working full-time and moving off benefit. In Confidence IR2019 /578: Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Page 5 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Effect 14. The annual adjustment of the threshold since 2006 has ensured the MFTC has remained at a value which satisfies its fundamental intention. Despite this, there are significant drawbacks to both the design and operation of the payment. 15. The MFTC is primarily a transitional payment for families that are moving from receiving an MSD administered main benefit (and Winter Energy Payment) onto the Inland Revenue administered In-Work Tax Credit. Eligibility applies over a narrow range of income and approximately 90% of recipients are sole parents, largely as a function of the lower work-hours requirement compared to that for couples. 16. As a result, the MFTC is received by far fewer families than other Working for Families payments. Since 2006 the annual number of recipients has fluctuated between 2,300 and 5,200. In the 2017/18 tax year 3,320 families received the MFTC at a fiscal cost of $12 million. 17. Officials recommend maintaining the MFTC at a rate which satisfies its primary purpose, in line with the existing Cabinet direction. However, officials advise that the proposed consideration of Working for Families in the medium to long-term work programme of the welfare overhaul provides an opportunity to fundamentally evaluate the purpose, design and effectiveness of the MFTC. Setting the Minimum Family Tax Credit for the 2020/21 tax year 18. The MFTC considers a range of factors such as the rate of income taxes, main benefits, and the minimum wage to ensure that someone’s: are at least $1 more than 19. The annual MFTC rate from this calculation is then rounded up to the nearest $52 so that the weekly value of the credit is a whole dollar amount. 20. We recommend that the MFTC threshold for the 2020/21 tax year should be increased from $26,572 ($511 per week) to $27,768 ($534 per week). This value considers the wage indexation and higher abatement thresholds for main benefits that are applicable from 1 April 2020 and were announced in Budget 2019. 21. This rate is determined using the tax and welfare settings that will currently apply from 1 April 2020. If any changes to relevant settings occur prior to 1 April 2020 this MFTC threshold may not satisfy the requirement outlined above and another change to the threshold via a legislative amendment would be required to ensure the rate is entirely accurate for its purpose. 22. There is legislative requirement in the Income Tax Act 2007 for an Order in Council that adjusts the rate of MFTC to be made by December 1 for it to apply from 1 April the following year. after tax earnings from employment +In-Work Tax Credit +Family Tax Credit +Minimum Family tax Credit after tax earnings from employment +net income from an abated benefit +Family Tax credit +Winter Energy Payment In Confidence IR2019 /578: Minimum Family Tax Credit – annual review 2019 Page 6 of 6 IN CONFIDENCE Funding implications 23. There are no funding implications associated with this change as annual adjustments to the rate of MFTC are already built into existing appropriations. Compliance and administration implications 24. There are no compliance cost implications or changes in administration costs associated with increasing the value of the MFTC. Publications and systems will be updated with the new level as part of the Ministry of Social Development and Inland Revenue’s existing annual processes. Consultation 25. The Ministry of Social Development and the Treasury have been consulted during the preparation of this report and agree with its recommendations. Proactive release considerations 26. Officials recommend that this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers should be proactively released without redaction within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Next Steps 27. If you approve of the proposed increase of the MFTC threshold to $27,768 for the 2020/21 tax year, a draft Cabinet paper has been attached for you to take for consideration at the Cabinet Legislative Committee meeting on 19 November. 28. Pending your agreement, the Parliamentary Counsel Office will be instructed to draft the necessary regulations and officials will provide these to you prior to consideration by Cabinet. 29. Speaking notes have been prepared and are attached for you to take to the Cabinet Legislation Committee meeting on 3 December. In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (MINIMUM FAMILY TAX CREDIT) ORDER 2019 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to the submission t o the Executive Council of the attached Income Tax (Minimum Family Tax Credit) Order 2019 (the MFTC Order). The MFTC Order increases the after-tax value of the Minimum Family tax Credit from $26,572 to $27,768 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2020. This increase reflects the wage-growth adjustment of main benefit rates and the higher benefit abatement thresholds applying from 1 April 2020. Policy 2.The Minimum Family Tax Credit (MFTC) provides a guaranteed level of after-tax i ncome to households with dependent children who work full-time (defined as 20 hours per week for sole parents and 30 hours per week for couples) and do not receive a main benefit. 3.In 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the MFTC threshold and to adjust it annually f rom 1 April 2006 to ensure that the amount of income someone can receive from working part-time and receiving an abated benefit never exceeds what they could earn if they worked full-time, moved off-benefit and began to receive in-work support. 4.The MFTC has been increased every year since 2006 to reflect changes to the re lativities between in-work support and main benefits such as the CPI adjustment of benefit rates, minimum wage increases and marginal tax rate changes. 5.There are only a small number of households who receive the MFTC and a pproximately 90% of these are sole parents, reflecting the reduced hours-worked requirement for eligibility when compared to coupled households. In the 2017/18 tax year 3,320 households received the MFTC at a fiscal cost of $12 million. 6.In line with current policy, I recommend that the MFTC threshold should be increased f rom $26,572 ($511 per week) to $27,768 ($534 per week) for the 2020/21 tax year. This increase reflects the minimum wage, benefit abatement thresholds and wage indexed main benefit rates that will apply from 1 April 2020. Financial implications 7.There are no financial implications associated with adjusting the repayment threshold f or 2020/21 as annual adjustments are accounted for in existing appropriations. Timing and 28-day rule 8.The Income Tax Act 2007 requires the MFTC Order to be made no later than 1 December and to apply from 1 April following that date. The MFTC Order would 1 3jnp0i3ub4 2019-12-04 12:01:08 2. therefore be in accordance with the rule that regulations must not come into force until at least 28 days after they have been notified in the New Zealand Gazette. Compliance 9. The MFTC Order complies with: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi; 9.2 the rights and freedoms contained in the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 or the Human Rights Act 1993; 9.3 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993; and 9.4 relevant international standards and obligations. Regulations Review Committee 10. Officials consider that there are no grounds for the regulations Review Committee to draw the MFTC Order to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 11. The Regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact analysis 12. The Treasury’s Regulatory Quality Team has determined that the proposal is exempt from the Regulatory Impact Analysis requirements on the basis that it has no or only minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not-for-profit entities. Publicity 13. I intend to make an announcement regarding the increase in the amount of the MFTC after the Order has been signed. 14. Inland Revenue will publish an item in its Tax Information Bulletin series, and relevant publications and material will be updated to incorporate the new amount. 15. Existing recipients will be contacted in early 2019 with an updated estimate of their Working for Families tax credits entitlement for the tax year beginning 1 April 2020. Proactive release 16. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in full within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17. The Treasury and Ministry of Social Development have been consulted on this paper. Recommendations The Minister of Revenue recommends that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that in April 2004, Cabinet agreed to increase the Minimum Family Tax Credit from 1 April 2006 onwards by an amount sufficient to ensure that families do not 2 3jnp0i3ub4 2019-12-04 12:01:08 suffer a reduction in income when moving off a welfare benefit and into full-time paid work \[CAB Min (04) 13/4 refers\]; 2. note that the Income Tax (Minimum Family Tax Credit) Order 2019 increases the annual amount of the minimum family tax credit from $26,572 to $27,768 for the tax year beginning 1 April 2020, as allowed under section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007; 3. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Minimum Family Tax Credit) Order 2019; 4. note that there is a legislative requirement under section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 that requires the Income Tax (Minimum Family Tax Credit) Order 2019 to be made prior to 1 December for it to come into force on 1 April 2020.

IN CONFIDENCE POLICY AND STRATEGY Tax policy report: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Date: 21 October 2019 Priority: Medium Security level: In Confidence Report number: IR2019/575 Action sought Action sought Deadline Minister of Revenue Agree to recommendations Note the contents of this report 10am, Thursday 14 November Contact for telephone discussion (if required) Name Position Telephone Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Policy Advisor s 9(2)(a) s 9(2)(a) 1. In Confidence IR2019 /575: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 1 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE 21 October 2019 Minister of Revenue Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Purpose 1. This report seeks your agreement to lower the prescribed interest rate used to calculate fringe benefit tax (FBT) on low-interest loans provided by employers to employees from 5.77% to 5.26%. This change is required to align the rate with current market interest rates. Based on longstanding practice, the new rate – being taxpayer favourable – should apply from the beginning of the current quarter (1 October 2019). 2. An Order in Council is required to make this change. Therefore, this report also seeks your approval for the Parliamentary Counsel Office (PCO) to draft an Order in Council to lower the rate. As changes to the FBT prescribed interest rate have become a routine matter, we consider that your approval is sufficient for PCO to draft the Order. 3. To enable the new rate to apply from 1 October 2019, the Order in Council must be made – and be in force – by the end of November. PCO can provide the Order in Council directly to Cabinet Office. Background 4. The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. Included in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 5. The Income Tax Act 2007 permits the making of regulations by Order in Council to set a prescribed rate of interest for the purpose of calculating FBT on low-interest loans. Once a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. 6. The prescribed interest rate was last changed from 5.99% to 5.77% from the quarter beginning 1 January 2016, following a review of the rate in February 2016. Determination of appropriate prescribed rate 7. The Reserve Bank conducts a survey of first mortgage housing interest rates on the last day of each month, producing a ‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’. The rate is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, t he weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is a suitable indication of general market interest rates, and is therefore used as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate. 8. The floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 5.26% for August and September 2019 indicates that the current FBT prescribed rate of 5.77% is higher than the prevailing market rate. 5.26% could still be perceived as a high borrowing In Confidence IR2019 /575: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 2 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE rate in the context of the current low-interest environment, but this figure is consistent with floating rates offered by major banks. 9. Longstanding administrative policy has been to adjust the FBT prescribed interest rate when there has been a change in the floating first mortgage new customer housing rate of 20 basis points or more. We recommend that the rate be adjusted this quarter to ensure that there is no long-term misalignment. 10. If you agree that the prescribed interest rate should be decreased, the change should take effect from the start of the current quarter (1 October 2019). 11. The overall effect of the proposed change in the prescribed interest rate is that the rate for the quarter beginning 1 October 2019 will decrease from 5.77% to 5.26%. Process issues 12. When regulations are made declaring the rate of interest applying to employment- related loans, they apply to quarters starting from a date at least 1 month following the date the regulations were made. However, regulations that reduce the prescribed rate may apply to a quarter if made at least 1 month before the end of that quarter. If the prescribed interest rate is to be lowered from the start of the current quarter (1 October 2019), an Order in Council will therefore need to be made before 1 December 2019. 13. To meet this timetable, the Order in Council should be referred to the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 14 November, so that it can be considered by Cabinet Legislation Committee on 19 November 2019. PCO has arranged for the Order in Council to be provided directly to the Cabinet Office. 14. A Cabinet paper recommending that Cabinet approve the Order in Council and authorise its submission to the Executive Council is attached. We recommend that you lodge the Cabinet paper with the Cabinet Office by 10am on Thursday 14 November 2019. 15. A waiver of the 28-day rule is requested so that the regulation can come into force the day after its notification in the Gazette on 28 November 2019. This waiver is requested on the grounds that early commencement is necessary to enable the lower rate to apply from the beginning of this quarter, and early commencement will only confer a benefit on those affected. A waiver of the 28-day rule has been obtained for previous rate changes. Revenue implications 16. Lowering the FBT prescribed interest rate to 5.26% will decrease the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.27 million per quarter. This amounts to $5.16 million over the current forecast period (2019-20 to 2023-24). 17. A forecasting adjustment will be necessary, to account for the decrease in expected FBT revenue. It will not affect the balance of the tax policy work programme scorecard. Consultation 18. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this report and the attached Cabinet paper. In Confidence IR2019 /575: Decrease in FBT prescribed rate of interest Page 3 of 3 IN CONFIDENCE Recommended action We recommend that you: 19. agree that the FBT prescribed rate of interest for low-interest employment-related loans should be lowered to 5.26%, effective from 1 October 2019. Agreed/Not agreed 20. note that decreasing the prescribed rate to 5.26% will result in a decrease in revenue of approximately $0.27 million per quarter ($1.08 million per annum), which amounts to $5.16 million over the current forecast period (2019-20 to 2023- 24). Noted 21. agree that the Parliamentary Counsel Office should be instructed to draft an Order in Council to this effect. Agreed/Not referred Paul Fulton Principal Policy Advisor Policy and Strategy Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue / /2019 In Confidence Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Legislation Committee INCOME TAX (FRINGE BENEFIT TAX, INTEREST ON LOANS) AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2019 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Legislation Committee’s agreement to submit an Order i n Council amending the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2019 to the Executive Council. The proposal is to lower the FBT prescribed interest rate for low-interest, employment-related loans from 5.77% to 5.26%, in line with a decrease in market interest rates. 2.Changes to the prescribed interest rate are a routine matter and do not involve a ch ange of policy. The methodology used for setting the rate has been applied consistently since the early 1990s. Policy 3.The fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules tax non-cash benefits provided to employees. I ncluded in the definition of ‘fringe benefit’ is any employment-related loan on which the employer is charging a rate of interest that is below the market rate. The interest differential is taxable. A prescribed rate set by regulations is used as a proxy for the market rate of interest, to save employers the compliance costs associated with determining the market rate relevant to loans that they have provided to their employees. 4.The Income Tax Act 2007 allows regulations to be made to set the prescribed rate. O nce a rate is set, it remains the prescribed rate of interest until changed by a subsequent Order in Council. The current FBT prescribed rate, which has applied from 1 January 2016, is 5.77%. 5.The prescribed rate of interest is based on a Reserve Bank survey of first mortgage h ousing interest rates on the last day of each month (‘floating first mortgage new customer housing rate’). This is calculated as the weighted average interest rate for the surveyed institutions, the weightings being based on each institution’s share of total lending for housing purposes. This Reserve Bank series is selected as the benchmark for setting the FBT prescribed rate because it is seen as a good indication of market interest rates. 6.The proposed new FBT rate of 5.26%, despite being 51 basis points lower than the cu rrent rate, might still be perceived as a high borrowing rate in the current low- interest environment. However, this figure is consistent with floating rates offered by major banks. 1 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:33:53 2. Timing and 28-day rule 7. Lowering the rate is favourable for employers and should apply as soon as possible. I am therefore recommending that the lower rate apply from the beginning of the current quarter, that is, from 1 October 2019. When the prescribed interest rate is reduced, the lower rate is allowed to apply from the start of the quarter in which the change occurs, provided the regulation is made at least a month before the end of that quarter. This means that the new Order in Council has to be made (and be in force) by the end of November. 8. A waiver of the 28-day rule is requested so that the regulation can come into force the day after its notification in the Gazette on 28 November 2019. This waiver is requested on the grounds that early commencement is necessary to enable the lower rate to apply from the beginning of this quarter, and early commencement will only confer a benefit on those affected. A waiver of the 28-day rule has been obtained for previous rate changes. Compliance 9. The regulations comply with each of the following, where applicable: 9.1 the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi Not applicable 9.2 the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 Not applicable 9.3 the Human Rights Act 1993 Not applicable 9.4 the principles and guidelines set out in the Privacy Act 1993 Not applicable 9.5 relevant international standards and obligations Not applicable 9.6 the Legislation Guidelines (2018 edition), which are maintained by the Legislation Design and Advisory Committee. Complies Regulations Review Committee 10. Officials consider that there are no grounds for the Regulations Review Committee to draw the Order in Council to the attention of the House under Standing Order 319. Certification by Parliamentary Counsel 11. The regulations have been certified by Parliamentary Counsel as being in order for submission to Cabinet. Impact Analysis 12. The proposal is of a minor and mechanical nature and does not substantially alter existing arrangements. Therefore, a regulatory impact statement is not required. 13. The proposal will not increase compliance costs as it is simply a change in the prescribed interest rate. Publicity 14. I will issue a media statement once the Order in Council is made by the Executive Council. 2 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:33:53 15. Inland Revenue will publish an article about these changes in its Tax Information Bulletin. Proactive Release 16. I propose to proactively release this Cabinet paper, associated minutes, and key advice papers in whole within 30 working days of Cabinet making final decisions. Consultation 17. The Treasury has been consulted in the preparation of this paper. Revenue implications 18. Lowering the prescribed interest rate to 5.26% will decrease the amount of FBT that will be collected by approximately $0.27 million per quarter. This amounts to $5.16 million over the current forecast period (2018-19 to 2022-23). Recommendations I recommend that the Cabinet Legislation Committee: 1. note that the regulations set the prescribed rate of interest for calculating the taxable benefit of low-interest, employment-related loans. 2. agree that, consistent with the latest results of the Reserve Bank’s survey, the FBT prescribed rate of interest should be lowered from 5.77% to 5.26% for the quarter which commenced on 1 October 2019. 3. note that lowering the prescribed rate will have the following impact on Crown Revenue: $m, decrease Vote Revenue 2018/19 2019/20 2020/21 2021/22 2022/23 & Outyears Decreased FBT revenue (0.82) (1.09) (1.09) (1.09) (1.09) 4. note that the change is a forecast change and does not have appropriation implications. 5. authorise the submission to the Executive Council of the Income Tax (Fringe Benefit Tax, Interest on Loans) Amendment Regulations 2019. 6. note that a waiver of the 28-day rule is sought on the grounds that early commencement is necessary to enable the lower rate to apply from the start of the current quarter, and will only confer benefits on those affected. 7. agree to waive the 28-day rule so that the regulations can come into force on the day after their notification in the Gazette. 8. note that I will issue a press statement announcing the decrease once the Order in Council is made. 3 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:33:53 Authorised for lodgement Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 2bnpvvfw8u 2019-11-27 11:33:53 4 I N C O N F I D E N C E LEG-19-MIN-0180 Cabinet Legislation Committee Minute of Decision This document contains information for the New Zealand Cabinet.

In Confidence Office of the Minister of Education Office of the Minister of Revenue Chair, Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee STUDENT LOAN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION POLICY CHANGES FOR 2020 Proposal 1.This paper seeks the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee’s agreement to changes t o the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 enabled by Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme. These changes are largely administrative in nature. They are: 1.1 Limiting student loan scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years. 1.2 Renaming the student loan repayment holiday. 1.3 Writing off student loans in cases where borrowers have been able to prove t hey did not take out the loan. 1.4 Giving Inland Revenue the ability to notify employers when borrowers’ loans are close to being fully repaid. 1.5 Treating overseas based borrowers in exceptional circumstances as New Z ealand based. Executive Summary 2.Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme is enabled by changes to policy, process, technology, and organisation design. In April 2020, the management of student loans and KiwiSaver will move to new systems and processes. 3.Officials have identified several policy changes that will make it easier for borrowers t o meet their obligations and enhance the administration of the student loan scheme (the scheme). Some of these are currently being progressed as part of the Taxation (Annual rates for 2019-20, GST Offshore Supplier Registration, and Remedial Matters) Bill. This paper proposes further changes, being: 3.1 Limiting changes to borrowers’ repayment obligations prior to 1 April 2013 to ch anges in residency status, fraud, or where a tax return has not been filed and it is cost effective to do so. This would reduce the administrative complexity of the system. If this is not progressed, the new systems and processes would need to include a large number of historic changes to policy and legislation, some of which have since been repealed. 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE 1. 3.2 Renaming the student loan ‘repayment holiday’ to ‘repayment obligation suspension’. This will make it clearer to borrowers heading overseas that their repayment obligations are only temporarily on hold and they must start making payments again when their repayment obligation suspension ends (or they return to New Zealand). 3.3 Writing off student loans in a small number of cases pre-2000 where borrowers have been able to prove they did not take out the loan, and where the correct borrower cannot be identified. Cases post-2000 are managed by MSD, who already have the power to reverse such loans. 3.4 Giving Inland Revenue the ability to notify employers when borrowers’ loans are close to being fully repaid. This would allow employers to make final deductions equal to the remaining loan balance, preventing overpayments and borrowers having to contact Inland Revenue to get a refund. 3.5 Treating overseas based borrowers in exceptional circumstances as New Zealand based. There are a small number of overseas based borrowers living with a serious illness or disability, who are unlikely to repay their loans. Treating these borrowers as New Zealand based would mean the borrower has repayment obligations based on their income, and an interest free loan. 4. We propose progressing the necessary legislative changes in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill, for introduction in mid-2019. The proposals would apply from 1 April 2020. Background 5. Inland Revenue’s multi-year transformation programme will modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Once complete, customers will spend far less time and effort ensuring they meet their obligations and receive their correct social policy entitlements. 6. Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, process, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. 7. New Zealand’s revenue system is being transformed in four broad stages – digital services, tax, social policy, and a final wrap up. Modernisation of the revenue system is now well underway, with the first two releases having been successfully implemented. Release 3, which will move income tax and Working for Families to new systems and processes, is scheduled to go-live on 26 April 2019. Management of the student loan scheme will move to new systems and processes as part of Release 4 in April 2020. 8. Moving student loans to new systems and processes creates opportunities to make it easier for borrowers to meet their obligations and improve the administration of the scheme. 9. Legislation has already been introduced to deduct student loan repayments from schedular, election-day and casual agricultural income, and to not charge loan 2 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE interest for New Zealand based borrowers (currently, interest is charged and then written off). 10. The proposed policy changes in this paper seek to: 10.1 Reduce compliance effort and improve the borrower’s experience. 10.2 Reduce complexity. 10.3 Reduce administration costs. Limiting student loan scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years to simplify administration of the Scheme 11. From time to time, information comes to light that means Inland Revenue needs to change borrowers’ historical repayment obligations. Inland Revenue is currently required to maintain rules back to 1992 when the scheme was introduced in cases where either the Commissioner or borrower seek to review a borrower’s repayment obligation. 12. Retaining rules going back to 1992 has increased the complexity of the scheme. Compliance costs for borrowers are high, as understanding changes to their loan balance is difficult due to historical rules applying for previous years. Administration costs for Inland Revenue are also high, with little benefit. 13. To simplify the system going forward, we propose incorporating all student loan rules back to 1 April 2013 into the new systems and processes, and a simplified set of rules from 1992 to 1 April 2013. This will reduce compliance costs for borrowers, the administration costs for Inland Revenue, and the time and cost of implementing future changes to the student loan scheme. 14. Incorporating rules back to 1 April 2013 into the new system will capture 93% of all changes to repayment obligations and largely replicate the current scheme. For 1992 to 1 April 2013, we propose a simplified set of rules apply in cases where a borrower’s residency status changes, where a borrower has committed fraud, or where a tax return has not been filed and it is cost effective to make changes. These are the situations that have the greatest impact on a borrower’s repayment obligations and their loan balance. 15. For example, where a borrower has gone overseas in 2008 but has been treated as New Zealand based, interest would be calculated on the borrower’s loan from the date they went overseas in 2008. However, the borrower’s repayment obligations would only be changed from 1 April 2013 onwards. 16. Where a borrower has committed fraud or not declared income, a simplified calculation would be applied. Repayment obligations would only be calculated on the adjusted net income figure and the other rules that applied in that year would be disregarded. A one-off penalty would be imposed on the undeclared income in cases of fraud and may be imposed on unfiled returns. Late payment interest would only be imposed on unmet obligations for 1 April 2013 onwards. 17. The number of borrowers expected to be impacted by this change each year is small and reducing over time. In the 2018 year, only 1,314 borrowers had their repayment 3 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE obligation for the 2013 or prior years changed. This represents less than 0.2% of the 700,000 student loan borrowers and the repayment obligations involved was $1.2 million. These figures are expected to reduce further before the introduction of these changes in 2020. 18. This proposal would retain equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers. These changes could result in slight variations in a limited number of borrowers’ loan obligations and repayment period, which could either increase or decrease borrowers’ loan obligations. 19. This option reduces the complexity of the scheme, and therefore reduces compliance costs for borrowers and administration costs for Inland Revenue. This option has no material impact on the valuation of the scheme and improves the Government’s flexibility to make policy changes in the future. Renaming the repayment holiday 20. Currently, borrowers heading overseas can apply for a repayment holiday, which suspends their repayment obligation for up to one year. Interest continues to be charged on the loan. 21. We propose renaming the repayment holiday to repayment obligation suspension. This will make it clearer to borrowers that their obligations are only temporarily on hold and they must start making repayments again when their repayment obligation suspension ends (or they return to New Zealand). It will also remove the potentially positive association with the word ‘holiday’. Writing off loans in cases where borrowers have been able to prove that they did not take out the loan 22. Inland Revenue is aware of a very small number of cases where borrowers have been able to prove that they did not take out a loan, and it is likely that that their identity has been stolen. Inland Revenue manages cases occurring before 2000 and does not have the power to write these loans off if the correct borrower cannot be identified. Cases occurring after 2000 are managed by MSD, who do have the power to reverse loans if they cannot locate the correct borrower. 23. We propose that Inland Revenue should be able to write off loans where borrowers have been able to prove that they did not take out the loan and the correct borrower cannot be identified. This change will make the scheme fairer for borrowers in these situations. Giving Inland Revenue the ability to notify employers of a borrower’s loan balance, when the loan is close to being repaid 24. Currently, Inland Revenue can tell employers if an employee has a student loan or not, to ensure that they use the correct tax code, but cannot tell employers what the loan balance is. This results in overpayments and delays when loans are repaid, as employers currently make student loan deductions at 12% until they are told to stop. 25. Enabling Inland Revenue to notify employers of a borrower’s remaining loan balance, where the loan balance is close to being paid, will mean they can make a final deduction equal to the remaining loan balance. This will improve borrower experience by avoiding overpayments in many situations. 4 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE Treating overseas based borrowers in exceptional circumstances as New Zealand based 26. Overseas based borrowers’ repayment obligations are based on the size of their loan and they are charged interest on their student loans. Inland Revenue is aware of a few overseas based borrowers who are living with a serious illness or disability and are unlikely to ever be able to make loan repayments. 27. In some circumstances, borrowers can apply to be treated as New Zealand based. We believe it is appropriate to treat the above-mentioned borrowers as New Zealand based. This would seek to align their repayment obligations with their ability to repay and they would not be charged interest. This will also prevent loan balances from increasing due to interest. Consultation 28. The Ministry of Education and Inland Revenue have consulted with the following agencies in preparing this paper: The Treasury, the Ministry of Social Development, and the Office for Disability Issues. The Office of the Privacy Commissioner has also been consulted. Financial Implications 29. The costs of making these changes are included as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation programme, and no additional funding is sought. The impact of the changes on the future cash flows of the scheme has been considered and there are no material impacts on the valuation. Legislative Implications 30. Implementing these proposals requires changes to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 31. If approved, we propose that the changes be included in the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill, scheduled for introduction in mid-2019. The proposals would apply from 1 April 2020 for the 2020/21 tax year. This aligns with the transition of the management of student loans to the new systems and processes as part of Inland Revenue’s business transformation. Impact Analysis 32. The Quality Assurance Team at Inland Revenue has reviewed the Student Loans: Back-year reassessments prior to 2013 regulatory impact assessment prepared by Inland Revenue and: 32.1 Considers that the information and analysis summarised in the regulatory impact analysis partially meets the quality assurance criteria. 32.2 In light of the time constraints on the policy development process that are identified in the Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis section, the reviewer considers that the information in the RIA is as complete as could be expected and identifies the main risks and uncertainties. 32.3 However, the time constraint has meant that public consultation particularly with affected parties has not been carried out. Consequently, the reviewer cannot be sure that the full range of impacts have been identified or that the preferred 5 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE options are the best options to address the problem and achieve the desired objectives. 33. The Regulatory Quality Team at the Treasury has determined that the remaining decisions sought in this paper are exempt from the requirement to provide a Regulatory Impact Assessment as they have no or minor impacts on businesses, individuals or not for profit entities. Human Rights 34. This paper does not have any significant human rights implications. The proposal to notify an employer of a borrower’s remaining loan balance has minor privacy implications. Gender Implications 35. The proposals in this paper are generally administrative in nature. Officials are not aware of any significant gender implications arising from these proposals. Disability Perspective 36. Treating overseas based borrowers with serious illnesses or disabilities as New Zealand based will provide relief to borrowers who are unlikely to be able to repay their loans. It will better align their repayment obligation with their ability to repay, and their loans would be interest free. This will be beneficial for these borrowers. Publicity 37. An announcement on the contents of the Bill, including these proposals, will be made when the Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill is introduced. A commentary on the Bill will also be released at this time. Inland Revenue will include details of the new legislation in a Tax Information Bulletin after the Bill is enacted. 38. The proposals are unlikely to be controversial as they largely seek to make it easier for borrowers to repay their loans and to improve the administration of the scheme. Proactive Release 39. We propose to delay the release of the attached Cabinet paper in full and associated minutes until the proposed Taxation (1st 2019 Omnibus Issues, and Remedial Matters) Bill containing legislative amendments to give effect to the recommendations in this paper is introduced. Recommendations The Minister of Education and Minister of Revenue recommend that the Cabinet Social Wellbeing Committee: 1. note that Inland Revenue is planning to move the student loan scheme to new systems and processes in April 2020; 2. note that there are several policy changes requiring legislative change that can make it easier for borrowers to meet their obligations and improve the administration of the student loan scheme; 6 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE 3. agree that changes to borrower’s repayment obligations prior to 1 April 2013 be limited to changes in residency status, where fraud is involved, or where a tax return has not been filed and it is cost effective to make changes; 4. agree to rename the student loan repayment holiday to student loan obligation suspension; 5. agree that Inland Revenue have the ability to write-off student loans taken out before 2000, in cases where borrowers have been able to prove that they did not take out the loan; 6. agree that Inland Revenue have the ability to notify a borrower’s employer when the borrower’s student loan is close to being fully repaid; 7. agree that overseas based borrowers with serious illness or disabilities should be treated as New Zealand based; 8. agree that recommendations 3-7, if agreed, will apply from 1 April 2020; and 9. invite the Minister of Revenue to instruct Parliamentary Counsel Office to draft the necessary amendments to give effect to the changes recommended in this paper. Authorised for lodgement Hon Chris Hipkins Minister of Education Hon Stuart Nash Minister of Revenue 7 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:27:55 IN CONFIDENCE | 1 IN CONFIDENCE Impact Summary: Student Loans: Limiting Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years S ec ti on 1: G ene ral i nfo r ma ti on Purpose This analysis and advice informs key policy decisions to be taken by the Minister of Revenue ahead of final decisions by Cabinet on whether to proceed with a policy change to reduce the need to amend pre-2013 student loan obligations after April 2020. Inland Revenue is solely responsible for the analysis and advice set out in this Regulatory Impact Summary. Key Limitations or Constraints on Analysis The key limitations on the analysis are as follows. Time to enact legislation As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will be moved to new systems and processes with effect from April 2020. This transfer provides an opportunity to reduce the current complexity of the scheme caused by having to administer rules for previous years that have subsequently been repealed. Any legislative changes that are to apply from 2020 would need to be introduced into Parliament by mid-2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to develop and analyse the options and to consult with stakeholders. No consultation with external stakeholders Inland Revenue has not consulted with affected borrowers as the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the proposed option is small and the legislative process provides an opportunity for the public to make submissions on the proposals as the Bill progresses through Parliament. Scale of the problem The scale of the problem in terms of the impact of the status quo on borrower compliance has not been accurately identified. Research suggests that borrowers do not understand how the student loan rules for previous years impact any changes their loan obligations. Impact of proposals on the student loan valuation Proposals that have a material impact on the valuation require a Budget bid and would need to be prioritised alongside other bids for Government funding. In order to proceed with reducing the complexity of changes to prior years’ repayment obligations, officials focussed on options that would not materially impact the student loan valuation. None of the limitations materially affect the analysis. Responsible Manager (signature and date): Melody Guy Policy Manager Policy and Strategy Inland Revenue 31 January 2019 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 2. | 2 IN CONFIDENCE S ec ti on 2: P robl e m de fi ni ti on and obj ec ti ves 2.1 What is the policy problem or opportunity? The underlying problem is the complexity of the student loan rules relating to previous years that no longer feature in the current scheme. This complexity means there is a lack of understanding by borrowers of the rules prior to 1 April 2013. As part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, the Student Loan Scheme will move to new systems and processes in April 2020. This transfer process provides an opportunity to make legislative changes to reduce the complexity of the student loan rules prior to April 2013, make it cheaper and easier to make changes to the scheme in the future, reduce compliance costs (by increasing understanding of rules) for borrowers, and increase consistency between tax and student loans. April 2013 has been chosen as this date captures 93% of all changes to student loan obligations for previous years and is the point where the rules are largely the same as apply today. The Student Loan Scheme was introduced in 1992 and is governed by the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, and loan contracts between the government and each borrower. A significant number of changes have been made to the Student Loan Scheme since its introduction with changes being made in 21 of the last 26 years. Under current legislation, the importance of accurate borrower’s obligations outweighs compliance and administrative costs. For example, either the borrower or Inland Revenue can seek to amend a prior year’s loan obligation, regardless of the amount of money involved. A repayment obligation is changed where an error is identified in the calculation of a borrower’s repayment obligation for a year. Unlike income tax, which generally has a period of 4 years from the date a return is filed to make changes to a tax obligation, student loan obligations can be changed back to the date the loan was taken out, which could be as far back as 1992 when the loan scheme was introduced. Therefore, where a student loan obligation for a previous year changes, the rules relating to that year apply. This requirement to retain rules for previous years has increased the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme administration, reduced the overall customer experience by making it difficult for borrowers to understand changes to their loan balance, and increased the administration costs. A significant number of the rules relating to previous years have since been repealed. Decisions on whether to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are required by March in order for any legislative changes to be enacted in time for an April 2020 application. 2.2 Who is affected and how? Borrowers affected are those whose obligations prior to 2013 are amended. In the 2018 year, of the 700,000 student loan borrowers, less than 0.2 percent had their repayment obligations prior to April 2013 amended (1,314) resulting in increased repayment obligations of $1.2 million. The number of borrows affected is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 3 IN CONFIDENCE 2.3 Are there any constraints on the scope for decision making? The major constraint on our analysis is the time to enact legislation. Inland Revenue is part way through a multi-year transformation programme to modernise New Zealand’s revenue system. Business transformation is enabled by a combination of changes to policy, processes, technology and the organisation design of Inland Revenue. It is far more than an upgrade of technology and has provided the opportunity to fundamentally review how the revenue system is administered and consider what changes may be needed. Options to simplify the prior years’ student loan rules require a legislative change. For legislation to be enacted by April 2020, changes would need to be introduced into Parliament in mid-2019 and therefore Cabinet decisions on policy changes are required in March 2019. The timeframe to enact legislation has reduced the time available to consult with stakeholders. Inland Revenue does not intend to consult separately with affected borrowers. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted by the preferred option is small and public submissions can be made on the proposals at the Select Committee stage as the Bill progresses though Parliament. Another constraint is the impact on the student loan valuation. Options that have an impact on the valuation would require a Budget bid as part of Budget 2019. These options would have to be prioritised together with other Government initiatives. Officials do not propose pursuing options that materially impact on the student loan valuation. S ec ti on 3: O p ti ons i d enti fi ca ti on 3.1 What options have been considered? Transferring the Student Loan Scheme to the new systems and processes provides an opportunity to reduce the administrative complexity of the Student Loan Scheme. Reducing the complexity of the Student Loan Scheme can only be resolved through legislative changes. Officials have considered non-legislative options, such as manually undertaking changes to prior year obligations, but these options may reduce but will not resolve the complexity issue. Therefore, the options proposed to simplify the Student Loan Scheme are legislative only. The options considered are retaining the status quo and two options to simplify the Student Loan Scheme rules relating to the 2013 and prior years. The policy objective is to implement the Student Loan Scheme into the new systems and processes within the timeline (April 2020) and reduce the complexity of the scheme, whilst ensuring equity among borrowers, and no material impact on the student loan valuation. In considering the options, officials evaluated the options against the following criteria: • equity between borrowers (current versus past borrowers, compliant versus non- compliant borrowers, and New Zealand based versus overseas based borrowers); • the impact of the complexity of the scheme on both the compliance costs of borrowers and administrative costs for Inland Revenue; 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 4 IN CONFIDENCE • the impact of the options on the valuation of the Student Loan Scheme; and • the cost and time to make policy changes in the future. Option One: Status quo – implement the rules back to 1992 This option involves implementing all the prior years’ student loan rules back to 1992 into new systems and processes. However, as student loans repayments for New Zealand based borrows are based on income for tax purposes, and as income tax generally has a period of 4 years for making changes to tax obligations, there will be no income generated student loan changes prior to 2013. Changes to loan obligations prior to 2013 would be those where fraud or non-filing of tax returns is involved and it is cost effective to do so, changes in residence status, or changes due to other student loan rules such as repayment holiday entitlement, or entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus. This option would have no material impact on the student loan valuation and retains the current equity among borrowers. However, it retains the current complex rules prior to April 2013 which would need to be built into new systems and processes. This complexity imposes administration costs on the government and would impact very few borrowers.. Also, future policy changes should still accommodate the rules prior to 1 April 2013. This option is not preferred by officials. Option Two: No new changes to repayment obligations prior to April 2013 Under this option the student loan rules would only be incorporated into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. This date was chosen as it captures almost all changes to student loan repayment obligations and the rules applying from April 2013 are largely the same as apply today. The rules relating to policy changes prior to 2013 will not be built into new systems and processes. Changes to repayment obligations prior to this date would only occur in exceptional circumstances such as cases of tax or student loan fraud or non- filing of tax returns showing a significant liability. These cases would be processed manually. This option simplifies the current rules, removes the need to build the rules prior to 1 April 2013 into the new systems and processes, and reduces both compliance and administrative costs. However, there are instances where equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers would not be retained, such as where a borrower who Inland Revenue considers is New Zealand based is found to have gone overseas prior to April 2013 without notifying Inland Revenue as required in their loan contract. Under this option the borrower would only have interest imposed back to 1 April 2013 not the earlier date when they became overseas based. This option would reduce the cost and time to implement policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. However, it would also have a material impact on the student loan valuation and for this reason is not preferred by officials. Option Three: Limited changes to loan obligations in relation to the 2013 and prior years (preferred option) This option would incorporate the student loan rules into new systems and processes back to 1 April 2013. For periods prior to 1 April 2013, changes to repayment obligations would only occur where a borrower changes their residence status, for example, Inland Revenue receive new information that a borrower had gone overseas, or in cases of unfiled returns where it is cost effective to do so, or fraud. Where a borrower’s residency status changes, interest would be calculated on their loan balance from the date the borrower’s status changed at the interest rates that applied in the relevant years. Changes in the borrower’s repayment obligation for the period up to 1 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 5 IN CONFIDENCE April 2013 would be ignored. However, changes to obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards would be assessed as they are now. In cases of fraud, or unfiled tax returns where the obligation is material, a simplified calculation would be used by applying the student loan repayment rate to the amended income figure. A one-off penalty may also apply to penalise the non-compliant action. Late payment interest will only be imposed on adjusted repayment obligations from 1 April 2013 onwards. Imposing late payment interest on repayment obligations for the period 1992 to 2013 can disproportionately increase the debt owed to Inland Revenue to the point where the borrower cannot repay the debt and disengages with the Student Loan Scheme. Adjustments to residency status and the associated interest impact together with situations where under-declared income or fraud is involved have the greatest impact on the loan balance and time to repay the loan. This option incorporates these situations. This option simplifies the calculation of repayment obligations prior to April 2013, removes the need to build these rules into the new systems and processes, reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore reduces both compliance costs and administrative costs. As this option takes account of residency changes and applies the historical loan interest rates, equity between compliant and non-compliant overseas-based borrowers would be preserved. Also, the inclusion of borrowers who fail to file returns of a material value or commit fraud also retains equity between compliant and non-compliant borrowers. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future as changes would not have to accommodate rules prior to April 2013. This option is preferred by officials. How each option would work The following examples illustrate the differences in treatment of a borrower under each option. Example 1 A borrower went overseas in 2008, did not advise Inland Revenue and was not picked up through the passenger movement match with NZ Customs. The borrower has been treated as New Zealand-based and therefore not charged loan interest. In 2021 the borrower returns to New Zealand. Inland Revenue identifies that the borrower has been overseas for the preceding years and updates the borrower’s residency status for the time they were away. Under Option One, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest, repayment obligations and late payment interest would be imposed from that date. Under Option Three, the borrower’s residency status will be changed with effect from the date they went overseas in 2008 and loan interest will be imposed from that date. However, repayment obligations and late payment interest would only be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. Under Option Two no changes would be made to the borrower’s residency status prior to April 2013 but loan interest, repayment obligations, and late payment interest would be imposed from 1 April 2013 onwards. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 6 IN CONFIDENCE Example 2 In 2009 the voluntary repayment bonus feature was introduced which rewarded borrowers for making voluntary repayments above what they were required to repay. The bonus applied for 5 years (2009-2013) before being repealed. In 2020 a borrower identifies an error in the calculation of their voluntary repayment bonus for the 2010 year although their income remains unchanged. They apply to have the voluntary repayment bonus recalculated for the 2010 year. Under Option One, the borrower would be able to receive the bonus but under Options Two and Three, they would not. We do not expect lack of retrospective entitlement to the voluntary repayment bonus to be a significant issue, given that few people took it up and there has been a long period during which any affected borrowers could have sought a recalculation of their entitlement. Example 3 A taxpayer has committed fraud through not declaring a large source of income for the 2008 year. This has implications for both their income tax and student loan obligations. The four-year period for making changes to an income tax obligation after a return is filed does not apply where fraud is involved. Therefore, the Commissioner amends the taxpayer’s income tax liability for the 2008 year. Under Options One, Two, and Three, the student loan repayment obligation would also be changed. Under Options One and Two, the student loan repayment obligation would be calculated on both the adjusted income for the year and the relevant student loan rules for that year. Under Option Three, the repayment obligation would only be calculated on the adjusted income and late payment interest would only apply from 1 April 2013 onwards. 3.2 Which of these options is the proposed approach? Officials consider Option Three to be the preferred option. This option addresses the policy problem set out in 2.1 and has advantages in terms of ensuring equity between compliant borrowers and non-compliant overseas borrowers, those who under declare income, or those who commit fraud. It also reduces the complexity of the scheme and therefore makes it easier for borrowers to understand their loan obligations and reduces the administration costs for Inland Revenue over the status quo. This option has no material impact on the student loan valuation and reduces the time and cost of making policy changes in the future. S ec ti on 4: I mpa ct A n al ysi s (P r opo sed ap pro ach) 4.1 Summary table of costs and benefits Affected parties (identify) Comment: nature of cost or benefit (eg ongoing, one-off), evidence and assumption (eg compliance rates), risks Impact $m present value, for monetised impacts; high, medium or low for non- monetised impacts Additional costs of proposed approach, compared to taking no action 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 7 IN CONFIDENCE 1 In the 2018 year, of the 700,000 student loan borrowers, less than two percent had their repayment obligations prior to April 2013 amended (1,314). This number is expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s efforts in recent years to reduce the number of outstanding student loan returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulated parties (affected borrowers) 1 The cost to borrowers in reduced accuracy of prior years’ obligations may increase or decrease a borrower’s repayment liability and reduce or increase the time period to repay the loan accordingly. Changes to repayment obligations by Inland Revenue would tend to increase a borrower’s repayment liability. Borrowers not being able to receive the voluntary repayment that they may have been entitled to prior to this change (pre- April 2020). The extent of the impact is dependent on the amount of the assessed obligation, but any impact on a borrower’s repayment time period is expected to be low. Low Regulators (Inland Revenue) None None Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Cost Financial impact for borrowers Borrowers face either an increased or decreased repayment obligation Non-monetised costs Compliance costs for borrowers Low Expected benefits of proposed approach, compared to taking no action Regulated parties (affected borrowers) Ongoing compliance costs savings for borrowers affected by a prior year’s repayment obligation. The proposal reduces the need for affected borrowers to understand how the old rules impact their student loan liability. By way of example, borrowers with changes to prior year’s obligations will no longer be required to understand the impact of the voluntary repayment bonus or 3-year repayment holiday on their loan balance. However, they may have had a higher loan balance through not receiving the voluntary repayment bonus. Borrowers who may have been required to pay late payment interest due to a changed repayment obligation prior to 1 April 2013 would not be required to pay this after this change (April 2020) Low/Medium depending on the extent of the changes to repayment obligations and number of years involved Low 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 8 IN CONFIDENCE 4.2 What other impacts is this approach likely to have? Two different borrowers may be treated differently in the same situation, depending on when the change is identified. For example, assuming no fraud or non-filing of a material amount is involved, a change in a borrower’s income that occurred prior to April 2013 would be included in the borrower’s repayment obligation if the change was identified last year but would not occur if the change was identified after April 2020. The amended repayment obligation would result in the time to repay the loan being varied slightly either earlier (if the repayment obligation increases) or later (if the repayment obligation reduces). The greater the adjustment in repayment obligation the greater the impact on the loan repayment period. Most changes to borrowers’ obligations occur in the first 3-4 years following the tax year. After that the number of changes falls dramatically. In the 2018 year the number of borrowers who had changes to their repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years was 1,314, and the total increased repayments obligations was $1.2 million (although the amount expected to be collected is less than this). These figures are expected to reduce significantly by 2020 due to Inland Revenue’s continued efforts to reduce the number of outstanding tax returns and to contact non-compliant overseas based borrowers. Regulators (Inland Revenue) Reduced implementation costs for IR. Reduced ongoing costs of changing prior years’ obligations, training staff and retaining administrative processes. These costs will form part of the savings from Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation Programme. Low/Medium Wider government None None Other parties None None Total Monetised Benefit None None Non-monetised benefits Reduced compliance costs for borrowers and administrative benefits for Inland Revenue Low/Medium 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 9 IN CONFIDENCE S ec ti on 5: S ta kehol d er vi ew s 5.1 What do stakeholders think about the problem and the proposed solution? The timeframe to enact legislation and implement student loans into the new systems and processes has limited Inland Revenue’s ability to consult with those borrowers affected by the preferred option. This means that the problem identification, options identification, and impacts have been generated by officials based on the information available. It is recognised that consultation with those affected by a change is an important part of the Generic Tax Policy Process. However, mitigating factors are that the number of borrowers likely to be impacted in future by the preferred option is small and expected to reduce in future. Also, there will be an opportunity for the public to submit on the measure during the Select Committee process and feedback will be considered at that point. The Ministry of Education have been consulted in developing the options and agree with the recommended proposal. S ec ti on 6: I mpl e men ta ti on a nd op era ti on 6.1 How will the new arrangements be given effect? It is intended that the preferred option be included in the next available taxation bill which is expected to be introduced into Parliament later in the year. Inland Revenue will be responsible for the operation of this preferred option and this will form part of its business as usual function. The preferred option will reduce the implementation risks associated with transferring the Student Loan Scheme from the current computer platform to the new systems and processes. It is proposed that legislation apply to limit changes in repayment obligations for the 2013 or prior years where the change occurs on or after April 2020. This will enable sufficient preparation time for Inland Revenue to implement the changes. The proposed approach will be included in the commentary on the taxation bill and consultation by select committee is expected to provide an opportunity for interested parties to express their views on this proposed change. S ec ti on 7: M oni to ri ng, eval uati o n and r evi ew 7.1 How will the impact of the new arrangements be monitored? Inland Revenue would monitor the effectiveness of the proposed legislation in the first 12 months of operation. If we identify anything that suggests the legislation is not operating as intended, then we will undertake a review. 2r4hxlcklw 2019-03-25 16:28:01 | 10 IN CONFIDENCE Inland Revenue currently have metrics to monitor the administration of the Student Loan Scheme. Work is progressing on designing the new system and processes and although work on the metrics to enable ongoing monitoring of volumes of changes to repayment obligations prior to 2013 has not commenced yet, officials expect the new systems and processes to replicate the existing metrics. 7.2 When and how will the new arrangements be reviewed? The final step in the Generic Tax Policy Process is the implementation and review stage, which involves post implementation review of legislation, and the identification of remedial issues.
