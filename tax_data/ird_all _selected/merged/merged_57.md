1 April 2014 A special report from Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue Taxation of foreign superannuation This special report provides early information on changes to the tax rules that deal with interests in foreign superannuation schemes held by New Zealand tax residents. The changes were introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill enacted on 27 February. Information in this special report precedes full coverage of the new legislation that will be published in the May edition of the Tax Information Bulletin. Sections CD 36B, CF 3, CQ 5, CW 28B, CW 28C, CZ 21B, DN 6, EX 29, EX 42B, HC 15, HC 27, YA 1 and schedule 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007, section CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004, section CC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and clause 14C of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 Changes to the Income Tax Act 2007 have been made in relation to the taxation of interests in foreign superannuation schemes held by New Zealand residents. From 1 April 2014, a new set of rules replaces the previous rules applying to interests in, and amounts derived from, foreign superannuation schemes. The new rules are intended to bring greater clarity and cohesion to the rules, making it easier for taxpayers to understand and comply with their obligations. Key features From 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally cease to apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless the interest was first acquired while the individual was a New Zealand tax resident or if it is grandparented. Instead, from 1 April 2014, interests in foreign superannuation schemes are taxed only when:  an amount has actually been received by the individual (either as a pension or as a cash lump sum);  a transfer has been made into a New Zealand or an Australian superannuation scheme; or  a transfer of an interest is made to another person (unless rollover relief is available). Lump sums received or transferred in the first four years of New Zealand tax residence are generally exempt from tax. 2 Lump sums are taxed using one of two methods:  The schedule method is the default method. It is designed to approximate the tax that would have been paid on accrual while the person was a New Zealand tax resident, in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt.  The formula method taxes the person based on the actual gains that have been earned by their scheme while they were a New Zealand tax resident, again in conjunction with an interest charge that recognises that the payment of tax has been deferred until receipt. This is subject to certain criteria. The new rules do not generally affect the taxation of foreign pensions received by New Zealand tax residents which continue to be taxed as most were before 1 April 2014 – that is, in full on receipt. A low-compliance option is available to individuals who received (or applied to receive) a lump sum from their foreign superannuation scheme (either as a cash withdrawal or a transfer to another scheme) between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 but did not comply with their tax obligations relating to the interest in their scheme. To remedy their non-compliance, an individual has the option of including 15 percent of the lump sum in their 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return and paying tax on that amount. A new type of permitted withdrawal has been introduced into the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to allow individuals who have transferred their foreign superannuation into a KiwiSaver scheme to pay their tax liability resulting from the transfer. The individual may also use the withdrawal mechanism to pay their student loan repayment obligation, to the extent that it arises from the transfer being assessed as income. Circumstances when the FIF rules continue to apply from 1 April 2014 A person who has already met their tax obligations in relation to their foreign superannuation interest under the FIF rules before the introduction of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill on 20 May 2013 has the option to continue using the FIF rules after 1 April 2014. This is known as “grandparenting”. To remain grandparented, they must treat their interest as an attributing interest in a FIF in all subsequent returns of income following the return filed before 20 May 2013. If they miss one year, they are no longer grandparented and are subject to taxation on receipt under the new rules. Credit will not be available for previous tax paid on income arising under the FIF rules. A person who first acquired their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while they were a New Zealand tax resident must generally use the FIF rules in relation to their interest. This is irrespective of whether the interest was acquired before or after 1 April 2014. The following flow charts show how the rules apply. 3 Diagram 1: What is the tax treatment of a foreign superannuation interest in a given income year from 1 April 2014? The following diagram provides information about which rules apply to a foreign superannuation interest held in a given income year by a New Zealand resident beginning on or after 1 April 2014. When was the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme acquired? While New Zealand tax resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 While non-tax resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 Was the interest an attributing interest in a FIF for an income year ending before 1 April 2014 and was it treated as an attributing interest in an income tax return filed before 20 May 2013? (The qualifying year) Yes No Was the interest treated as an attributing interest in a FIF in all income tax returns for income years after the qualifying year before the current year? Yes You have a “FIF superannuation interest”. Account for income under the foreign investment fund rules Has a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” that is income under section CF 3(1) been received? No No action required Yes No Account for income using the regime in section CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 You have a “FIF superannuation interest”. Account for income under the foreign investment fund rules 4 Diagram 2: What is the tax treatment of a lump sum received or transferred from a foreign superannuation scheme by a New Zealand resident? Note that if the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme was acquired in a transaction described in section CF 3(18)(b) or (d) from a person who acquired the interest while non- resident, there may be other considerations to take into account. When was the lump-sum withdrawal or transfer received? Before 1 April 2014 (Including where an application has been made before 1 April 2014) On or after 1 April 2014 Is your foreign superannuation interest a “FIF superannuation interest”? Yes No Consider under FIF rules. Lump sum is not included as income Was it received during your exemption period in section CF 3(3) and (4)? No Yes Did you comply with the New Zealand tax rules that applied to your foreign superannuation interest (and distributions from it) at the time? No action required Yes No Calculate income using the New Zealand tax rules that applied to your foreign superannuation interest (and distributions from it) at the time Include 15% of the lump sum in your 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return No action required (no New Zealand tax to pay) Is the foreign superannuation scheme a “defined contribution” scheme and do you have the information required to use the formula method? No Use the “schedule method” to calculate your assessable income Yes Have you used the “schedule method” in relation to the scheme before? Did you receive a distribution from the scheme other than a pension or annuity before 1 April 2014? If yes to one or more Use either the “schedule method” or “formula method” to calculate your assessable income No 5 Background New Zealand residents are taxable on their worldwide income, including income from interests in foreign superannuation schemes. The previous rules for taxing New Zealand residents on their foreign superannuation were complex and difficult for taxpayers to understand. In some cases, superannuation interests were subject to tax on accrual under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. In other cases, a person was taxed on receipt of their superannuation interest depending on the legal structure of the foreign scheme (such as whether the scheme is structured as a company or a trust). The tax treatment differed according to which set of rules applied. As a result, it was not always clear that the rules resulted in a fair outcome, particularly for lump-sum amounts. A review of the taxation of foreign superannuation was announced in November 2011. The policy review focused on the application of the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules to foreign superannuation, and the taxation of lump sums received from foreign schemes, including both transfers and withdrawals. As there were no concerns about the current tax treatment of pensions, no changes to pensions were proposed, except insofar as those interests were taxed under the FIF rules. As a result of this review, an officials’ issues paper, Taxation of foreign superannuation, was released in July 2012. The issues paper proposed that the FIF rules would no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes. Instead, all foreign superannuation interests would be taxed on receipt, either as a periodic pension under the existing rules, or as a lump sum using a specific method proposed in the issues paper referred to as the “inclusion-rate approach”. The inclusion-rate approach proposed in the issues paper is the predecessor to what is now known as the “schedule method”. The intention was to ensure that New Zealand-resident taxpayers pay a reasonable amount on their foreign superannuation, while also ensuring that the rules were relatively simple to apply. The solution also needed to take into account that individuals generally cannot access their superannuation scheme until retirement age. The solution proposed in the issues paper had two key elements. First, payment of tax would be deferred until the person receives a distribution from their scheme or transfers it to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. The reason for taxing upon receipt rather than upon accrual was based on the fact that most foreign schemes are locked in to some extent. Further, because many other countries tax foreign superannuation when an amount is distributed to an individual (rather than taxing contributions to a fund and earnings derived by the fund), aligning the point at which tax is paid also reduces the likelihood of being effectively overtaxed in both tax jurisdictions. Secondly, the issues paper provided for a special rule for taxing lump-sum transfers and withdrawals made from a foreign superannuation scheme – the inclusion-rate approach (now known as the schedule method). 6 The rationale behind the inclusion-rate approach (and now the schedule method) is that from a New Zealand tax perspective, the tax outcome for a person who migrates to New Zealand with a foreign superannuation should be broadly the same irrespective of whether the person transferred their funds to a New Zealand superannuation scheme on day one, or left it with the foreign scheme provider. This reflects the principle that tax should not distort a person’s economic decision-making. If a person transferred their funds into a New Zealand bank account or KiwiSaver scheme, for example, they would be paying tax on the interest that the bank account earns or on the gains made by the KiwiSaver scheme (that is, they would be paying tax on accrual). This is because New Zealand has a taxed tax-exempt (TTE) system, whereby contributions are generally made from post-tax income, gains that accrue are also taxed, but any payments made from the scheme or account are exempt from tax. In designing New Zealand’s tax rules, an important aim is to ensure that, where possible, taxpayers’ decisions about their affairs – such as when to draw down on their superannuation – are not driven by tax considerations. Therefore, the amount of tax that a person pays on their foreign superannuation interest should mirror what would have been paid on accrual, to ensure that people do not transfer their funds solely because of any tax advantage. The rates under the schedule method/inclusion-rate approach were calculated to do this, based on how long the person was a New Zealand tax resident before bringing their funds to New Zealand. These rates tell a person how much of their lump sum they should include as income in their tax return, and increase with the number of years of residence. Funds that accumulated before the person migrated to New Zealand (both contributions and gains) are not taxed. The issues paper also proposed a simple option for individuals who had already received a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2011, but did not comply with their tax obligations in relation to the lump sum. It proposed that these individuals would have the option to pay tax on only 15 percent of the lump sum. It was proposed that the FIF rules would remain available in very limited circumstances to those who had returned FIF income in relation to their foreign superannuation interest in their 2011–12 income tax return filed by 31 March 2012. This is known as “grandparenting”. The issues paper received 59 submissions from a variety of interested parties, including legal and accounting firms, pension transfer agents, and individuals. In response to these submissions, a number of modifications were made to the proposals in the issues paper, which were then introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Bill on 20 May 2013. The inclusion-rate approach was renamed the “schedule method” in the bill. The main modifications to the proposals in the issues paper were to:  defer the application date from 1 April 2011 to 1 April 2014;  extend the availability of the 15 percent option to lump sums derived by 31 March 2014;  extend the filing date required for grandparenting under the FIF rules to 20 May 2013; 7  extend a tax-free window during which a person may receive a lump with no New Zealand tax to pay from two years to four years, and make it available to returning residents, as well as new migrants;  change the timing of the schedule method so that income earned by the scheme during the four-year window would not be taxed if a person receives their lump sum after the four-year tax-free window;  provide separate rates for each year of residence under the schedule method, rather than one rate for a band of several years;  introduce a method that allows individuals to calculate the actual gains derived by their scheme while they have been New Zealand tax resident, if they have the information available (known as the formula method); and  introduce a KiwiSaver withdrawal mechanism to allow those who transfer their foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver to withdraw funds to pay their tax liability arising from the transfer. Further refinements to the proposals were recommended by the Finance and Expenditure Committee in response to submissions made at the select committee stage of the bill. The Committee’s report was published in November 2013. The main recommendations were to:  restrict the availability of the new regime (the schedule method and formula method) to when the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme is acquired while the person was non-tax resident;  extend the KiwiSaver withdrawal mechanism to allow a person a withdrawal to pay their student loan repayment obligation, to the extent it arises from the transfer into KiwiSaver being assessed as income;  provide rollover relief to transfers made from one person to another upon death of a spouse or relationship split; and  use a lower tax rate when calculating the deferral benefit under the formula method. Supplementary order paper 413 was introduced at the committee of the whole House stage. Supplementary order paper 413 proposed that the 15 percent option should be available to individuals who have applied to their foreign superannuation scheme provider to withdraw or transfer their funds by 31 March 2014, even if they have not actually received the funds by 31 March 2014. The new legislation received Royal assent on 27 February 2014. Application date The new rules generally apply from 1 April 2014. A minor change to the definition of superannuation scheme that corrects an unintended change that occurred during the rewrite of the Income Tax Act in 2004 applies from 1 April 2005. 8 Detailed analysis New rules for interests in foreign superannuation schemes New rules apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes from 1 April 2014. The new rules apply to interests in a “foreign superannuation scheme” which is already defined in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. A new definition of “FIF superannuation interest” is included in section YA 1. This does two things. First, it specifies when a person may use the FIF rules in relation to a foreign superannuation interest from 1 April 2014. Individuals who have complied with the FIF rules and treated their foreign superannuation interest as an attributing interest in a FIF in a return of income filed before 20 May 2013 have the option to continue using the FIF rules (known as grandparenting). To be grandparented, an individual must treat their interest as an attributing interest in a FIF in all returns of income following that return filed before 20 May 2013. Any distributions from the scheme are not treated as income of the individual at the time they are derived as the income has been taken into account under the FIF rules. Secondly, the definition of “FIF superannuation interests” also specifies that individuals who acquire an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while already tax-resident in New Zealand are required to use the FIF rules and are not permitted to use the new rules. This applies to interests first acquired both before and after 1 April 2014. The FIF rules are not available to foreign superannuation interests that do not meet the definition of “FIF superannuation interest”. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes which are not FIF superannuation interests are excluded from the FIF rules through amendments to section EX 29 and a broad new FIF exemption in section EX 42B. New section EX 42B provides that interests in or rights to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme are not subject to the FIF rules for income years beginning on or after 1 April 2014, unless it is a FIF superannuation interest. Accordingly, sections CQ 5, DN 6, EX 29, EX 33, and EX 42 have been amended or repealed to remove references to the FIF rules that are no longer required. New section CD 36B clarifies that foreign superannuation withdrawals and pensions are not taxed as dividends under the company tax rules. Similarly, amendments to sections HC 15 and HC 27 provide that foreign superannuation withdrawals and pensions are not subject to the trust tax rules. Instead, all amounts received from interests in foreign superannuation schemes that were acquired while the holder was non-tax resident – whether in the form of lump sums or pensions − are taxed on receipt. The tax treatment of periodic pensions has not been altered. Periodic pensions continue to be taxed as most currently are – that is, in full at a person’s marginal tax rate. 9 New section CF 3 introduces new rules for taxing “foreign superannuation withdrawals” – or lump sums – received from foreign superannuation schemes on or after 1 April 2014. A “foreign superannuation withdrawal” is defined as being a benefit other than a pension or annuity, and is income of the person, if it is a lump-sum withdrawal, a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme, or a transfer of a foreign superannuation interest to another person. Lump sums received on or after 1 April 2014 are taxed either under the “schedule method” or the “formula method”. Any reference to a “lump sum” throughout this special report generally means a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” that is income of a person, as defined in the new legislation. The new regime in section CF 3 is available only to taxpayers who acquired their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. As long as this requirement has been met and the interest is not a FIF superannuation interest, the regime in section CF 3 is available irrespective of whether the person became a New Zealand tax resident before or after 1 April 2014. New section CF 3(22) ensures that an individual who was non-compliant with the FIF rules before 1 April 2014 and receives a lump sum after 1 April 2014 that is taxed under the schedule or formula approach, is not assessed for that previously un-assessed FIF income. This to ensure that these people are not double taxed as both the schedule and formula methods take account of income earned by the scheme during the period that the scheme should have been treated as an attributing interest in a FIF. However, as section CF 3 only applies to people who first acquired their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident, section CF 3(22) does not apply to those who were already New Zealand tax-resident when they first acquired the rights in their foreign superannuation scheme. These people would be assessed for any previously unpaid tax on FIF income and are also required to account for FIF income in relation to their interest for all income years after 1 April 2014. As with other forms of income, the portion of the lump sum that is assessable income may affect a person’s entitlements and obligations for that tax year, such as child support, Working for Families tax credits, and student loan repayment obligations. Schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 has been amended to provide that where a transfer is made to a KiwiSaver scheme, the individual can withdraw an amount that represents the tax liability that arises in relation to the transfer. What is a foreign superannuation scheme? For the tax treatment of the new rules in section CF 3 to apply, section CF 3(1)(b) provides that a lump sum must arise from an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. A “foreign superannuation scheme” is defined in section YA 1 as a superannuation scheme constituted outside New Zealand. A superannuation scheme is a trust, company, or legislative arrangement established mainly for the purposes of providing retirement benefits to natural persons. 10 Most foreign employment-related retirement schemes that individuals contribute to while working overseas satisfy the definition of a “foreign superannuation scheme”. This is because these schemes usually will have been established by an individual’s employer to be used by the employer’s eligible employees. Investments in these schemes are usually held by trustees for the benefit of the participating employees. Similarly, retirement entitlements originating from arrangements made under foreign legislation also usually satisfy the definition of a foreign superannuation scheme. A retirement scheme will satisfy the definition of a foreign superannuation scheme so long as the scheme is either a trust, company, or arrangement established under the other country’s legislation, and is established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits. Sometimes savings in an individual’s retirement scheme can be used for purposes unrelated to retirement. For example, in the United States, individuals are able to establish a retirement savings account known as an Individual Retirement Account (IRA). An IRA is a savings account set up for the exclusive benefit of the individual or the individual’s beneficiaries. To discourage the use of IRAs for purposes other than retirement, a 10% penalty tax is imposed on any withdrawals made from the account before retirement. Some withdrawals can be made without penalty – for example, when withdrawals are made to meet higher education expenses, first home purchases or medical expenses, no penalty tax is imposed. Nevertheless, IRAs are established mainly for the purpose of providing retirement benefits and therefore on the face of it, such accounts are likely to be “foreign superannuation schemes” for New Zealand tax purposes. Where a retirement scheme is merely a “bare trustee” or similar arrangement for an individual, the scheme is unlikely to meet the definition for being a foreign superannuation scheme. If retirement savings are held by a bare trustee, section YB 21 provides that the underlying savings are deemed to be held by the individual personally. In those circumstances, New Zealand would generally tax the individual as if the individual is holding the underlying investments of the “scheme” directly. The Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 also makes a minor change to the definition of “superannuation scheme” that corrects an unintended change that occurred during the rewrite of the Income Tax Act in 2004. This correction clarifies that the definition of superannuation scheme does not include schemes that pay a foreign social security pension that resembles New Zealand Superannuation and applies from 1 April 2005. This amendment ensures that the current rules for taxing such payments continue. Tax treatment of foreign pensions and annuities The tax treatment provided by section CF 3 does not apply to pensions and annuities paid from foreign superannuation schemes to New Zealand residents. Section CF 3(1)(a) provides this by defining a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” as a benefit that is not a pension or an annuity. 11 The tax treatment of pensions and annuities has not changed. Section CC 5 provides for the taxation of annuities, section CF 1(1)(g) provides for the taxation of pensions. Most pensions and annuities are taxable unless there is a specific exemption. “A pension” is not defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. However, case law suggests that a payment from a superannuation scheme is generally a pension where:  the payments are periodic;  the amounts of the payments are fixed or ascertainable in advance; or  the entitlement to the payments is for life or a fixed term. New section CD 36B clarifies that pensions are not taxed as dividends under the company tax rules. Similarly, amendments to sections HC 15 and HC 27 provide that pensions are not taxed under the trust tax rules. Example 1 Lisa worked for a few years in Hong Kong and has an interest in her employer’s private superannuation scheme. She moves to New Zealand and, upon her retirement, begins to receive a monthly pension payment of NZ$500 ($6,000 per year) from the scheme. These payments continue at the same amount (with an increase to account for inflation each year) until her death, at which point they will stop. From these facts, it appears that her monthly payments are a pension. She needs to include $6,000 in her New Zealand tax return each year and pay tax on that amount. If her marginal tax rate is 33%, she will pay tax of $1,980 each year. Taxable lump-sum withdrawals or transfers The rules set out in new section CF 3 apply to “foreign superannuation withdrawals” received from 1 April 2014 onwards, where the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme was first acquired at a time when the person was not a New Zealand tax resident. Providing that this condition has been met, it does not matter whether the person first became a New Zealand tax resident while holding the interest before or after 1 April 2014. When is a person not a New Zealand tax resident? New Zealand tax residence is determined by section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which states that a person is a New Zealand tax resident if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If a person does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. It is possible for a person to be a tax resident of more than one country. New Zealand has a number of special agreements with other countries called “double tax agreements”, or DTAs. These agreements allocate taxing rights to ensure that a person is not double-taxed when an item of income is sourced in one country and the person deriving it is a tax resident of the other, and also when a person is a tax resident in both countries. When a person is a tax resident of both countries, DTAs contain what is known as a “tie-breaker test” to determine where the person is tax-resident for the purposes of that DTA. 12 Consider a person who is a tax resident under domestic law of both country X and New Zealand. If the person tie-breaks to country X in the DTA, they are not considered to be a resident of New Zealand for the purposes of allocating taxing rights over certain income under that DTA. However, they are still considered to be a tax resident of New Zealand under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. When is a lump sum taxable? A lump sum is taxable if it meets the definition of a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” and if it is received during the person’s “assessable period”. The rules for calculating when a person’s assessable period begins and ends are discussed below. New section CF 3(2) states that a “foreign superannuation withdrawal” is income of the person when the amount is in the form of one of the following:  a cash withdrawal (section CF 3(2)(a));  a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme (section CF 3(2)(b));  a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme outside Australia into an Australian superannuation scheme (section CF 3(2)(c)); or  a transfer of a superannuation interest to another person (section CF 3(2)(d)). Example 2 James worked in the United Kingdom and has an interest in a UK pension scheme. He moves to New Zealand and transfers part of his interest into a KiwiSaver scheme under the UK’s QROPS 1 legislation. The amount that is transferred comes within the definition of a foreign superannuation withdrawal, so James must calculate his tax liability on the transfer under the new rules. A foreign superannuation withdrawal received during the person’s assessable period is taxable under one of two methods – the schedule method or the formula method. These methods are discussed below. Non-taxable lump-sum withdrawals and transfers In certain circumstances, transfers or withdrawals will not be taxable. These are described below. 1 Qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme. 13 Withdrawals and transfers from Australian superannuation schemes Withdrawals from Australian schemes, and transfers from Australian schemes to New Zealand schemes, are generally not taxed in New Zealand under the Australia-New Zealand double tax agreement or under the trans-Tasman superannuation portability agreement (which took effect from 1 July 2013). This treatment continues under the new rules. As withdrawals and transfers from Australian superannuation schemes are not taxable, transfers from a foreign (non-Australian) scheme into an Australian scheme are taxable under the new rules. Transfers between two non-Australian foreign schemes (rollover relief) A transfer between two foreign superannuation schemes could give rise to a taxable event under the old rules, being a disposal of rights in the first scheme and an acquisition of rights in the new scheme. New section CF 3(2) lists the types of lump sums that are taxable. Through its omission in CF 3(2), a transfer from one foreign superannuation scheme to another non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme is not a taxable event. It does not matter whether the transfer is to a scheme in the same foreign country or a different foreign country, as long as the scheme to which it is transferred is not New Zealand or Australian. This may occur, for example, when a person disposes of their interest to purchase an annuity with a different provider, or if a person transfers from one foreign scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme in order to obtain better returns. Instead, the person is taxed on the eventual withdrawal or payment (or transfer to an Australian or New Zealand scheme). New section CF 3(21)(b) provides that the amount of tax payable is calculated from when they became New Zealand-resident while holding the interest in the first scheme. Transfers from a foreign scheme to an Australian scheme are taxable under section CF 3(2)(c).The reason for taxing at this point is because transfers from Australian schemes are typically exempt, as noted above. Example 3 Kimberley, a New Zealand tax resident, has an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in Spain that she acquired before migrating to New Zealand. She wants to change providers to get a better investment return, and decides to transfer her funds into another foreign superannuation scheme in France that offers better returns. Under the new rules, Kimberley does not need to pay New Zealand tax on the amount she transfers to the French scheme. Instead, she is taxed when she transfers the interest in the French superannuation scheme to a New Zealand superannuation scheme. Her tax liability on the transfer of the French interest into New Zealand takes into account the period of time she held the interest in the Spanish scheme while she was New Zealand-resident, as well as the period she held the French interest before transferring. 14 Certain transfers following the death of a spouse or a relationship split Under new section CF 3(2)(d), the transfer of an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme to another person is generally a taxable event to the transferor. New section CF 3(3) provides an exception to this rule if all of the following conditions are met:  the transferor’s interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is partly or wholly transferred into a non-Australian foreign superannuation scheme in the name of the transferee;  the transfer occurs upon the death of the transferor or under a relationship agreement that arises as a result of the dissolution of the transferor and transferee’s marriage, civil union partnership, or de facto relationship (“relationship cessation”);  the transferee was the spouse, civil union partner, or de factor partner immediately before the death of the transferor or the relationship cessation; and  the transferee is a New Zealand tax resident at the time of transfer. This means when an interest is cashed out and merely distributed to another person, the conditions for rollover relief are not met. A cash distribution is a taxable event to the transferor under section CF 3(2)(a). The condition that the transferee must be a New Zealand tax resident is a base protection measure as New Zealand does not tax foreign-sourced income derived by non-residents. Where rollover relief is granted under section CF 3(3) to the transferor, section CF 3(1)(b)(ii) ensures that the transferee is ultimately taxable under the rules in section CF 3 rather than under the FIF rules. Section CF 3(21)(d) provides that the transferee is taxed for the period they have held the interest in the superannuation scheme, as well as the period that the transferor held the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while New Zealand tax-resident before the transfer. This is to ensure that all gains that accrued to the scheme while the transferor was a New Zealand tax resident while holding the interest are eventually taxed. Example 4 Mary, her husband Martin, and their son Simon are all New Zealand tax residents. Mary first acquired an interest in a United Kingdom superannuation scheme while she was non-resident. Mary dies unexpectedly. In her will, Mary transfers half of her interest in the UK superannuation scheme to Martin and the other half to Simon, rather than cashing out the interest and distributing the proceeds. As Martin is a New Zealand tax resident and Mary’s surviving spouse, the transfer to him is not a taxable event as it meets the requirements for rollover relief under new section CF 3(3). 15 Ten years later, Martin decides that he wants to transfer the interest to a New Zealand scheme. This is a taxable event for Martin under section CF 3(2)(b). Under section CF 3(21)(d), the amount of the transfer that is deemed to be assessable income will take into account how long Mary was New Zealand-resident while owning the interest before she died and it was transferred to Martin, as well as how long Martin has owned the interest. In contrast, Simon is not provided rollover relief under section CF 3(3) as he is Mary’s son and not a surviving spouse. This means that when the executor of Mary’s estate transfers half of Mary’s interest in the superannuation scheme to Simon, the transfer is a taxable event under section CF 3(2)(d) and the amount of the transfer that is deemed to be assessable income will depend on how long Mary was New Zealand-resident while owning the interest before she died and transferred it to Simon. From the time that Simon acquires the interest, Simon has a FIF superannuation interest as Simon was already New Zealand-resident when it was transferred to him. This means that Simon needs to account for income on an annual basis under the FIF rules. Five years after he acquires the interest, Simon decides to transfer the interest into a New Zealand scheme. Because Simon’s superannuation interest has been taxed under the FIF rules, he does not pay any tax on the transfer to the New Zealand scheme. Four-year exemption period New sections CF 3(4)(a), CF 3(5), CF 3(6) and CW 28B provide that a lump sum that is received during a person’s exemption period is exempt from New Zealand tax. The exemption period is similar to the four-year tax-free window provided by the pre- existing “transitional resident rules” in section HR 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. People who are transitional residents are generally not subject to tax on foreign income during the first four years of New Zealand tax residence. Unlike the transitional resident rules, section CF 3(5) does not require a person to be non-tax resident for a minimum period in order to qualify for an exemption period. The exemption period is thus available to new migrants and returning New Zealanders alike (as long as they satisfy the overall requirement for section CF 3 that the interest in the foreign superannuation was first acquired while non-tax resident). Also, unlike the transitional resident rules, it is not possible to opt out of the exemption period. In addition, a person who receives Working for Families tax credits still receives a full exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interest. To be eligible for an exemption period in relation to a foreign superannuation interest, new section CF 3(5) provides that a person must have first acquired the interest while non-tax resident and has not had an exemption period under section CF 3(5) before they acquired that interest. This means a person may only have one exemption period under section CF 3 during their lifetime, but it may apply to several interests simultaneously, provided that the interests were acquired while non-tax resident. 16 The wording provided in section CF 3(6) to determine the timing and length of the exemption period mirrors the transitional residence period provided in section HR 8(3). This provides consistency for individuals with foreign superannuation interests who are also transitional residents. This is reinforced by an amendment to section HR 8(1), which states that a lump sum derived under section CF 3 during a person’s transitional residence period is not taxable in New Zealand. The exemption period begins on the date a person becomes a New Zealand tax resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (either by acquiring a permanent place of abode or meeting the requirements of the 183-day rule). The exemption period ends at the end of the 48-month period beginning after the month in which the person meets the requirements of section YD 1(2) or YD 1(3), ignoring the rule in section YD 1(4). If a person becomes a tax resident under section YD 1 part-way through a calendar month, their exemption period applies for that partial month as well as the subsequent 48-month period. If a person becomes a New Zealand resident as a result of meeting the 183-day rule in section YD 1(3), the exemption period starts on the first day they are New Zealand-resident (under section YD 1(4)), but does not end until 48 months after they actually triggered the 183-day rule in section YD 1(3) (that is, on their 184 th day in New Zealand). Note that tax residence in this context means tax residence as provided in section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. As discussed in the section on “Taxable lump-sum withdrawals or transfers”, a person could be considered to be a tax resident of New Zealand and another country under the domestic laws of each country. If the person “tie-breaks” to the other country under the DTA and is treated as not being a New Zealand resident for the purposes of the DTA, they are still considered to be a New Zealand tax resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is relevant for the purposes of calculating the exemption period. (It should be noted that when the individual tie-breaks to the other country for the purposes of a DTA, in general New Zealand cannot tax lump sums originating from that other country and paid to the individual during the period that they tie-break to the other country). Example 5 Jordan migrates to New Zealand with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. She is deemed to have acquired a permanent place of abode in New Zealand on 16 June 2015. Jordan is eligible for an exemption period which begins on the date she acquired her permanent place of abode. Her exemption period lasts for the remainder of June 2015, plus the 48 full calendar months following that. This means her exemption period ends on 30 June 2019 and her assessable period begins on 1 July 2019. 17 Methods for taxing lump sums Lump sums are taxable if they are received during the person’s assessable period. A lump sum is taxed under one of two methods:  the “schedule method” (the default method) in new section CF 3(9)(a), (10), (11), and (19); or  the “formula method” in new section CF 3(9)(b), (12)–(19). These two methods determine how much of a lump sum should be included as assessable income in an individual’s income tax return (the assessable withdrawal amount). New sections CF 3(4)(b) and CW 28C provide that the part of the lump sum that is not treated as assessable income under the schedule method or formula method is exempt income. The exempt income is not taken into account for student loan or Working for Families tax credit purposes. The schedule method is the default method for calculating a person’s assessable income in relation to a foreign superannuation withdrawal. A person who satisfies the criteria in section CF 3(9)(b) is eligible to use the formula method in relation to a lump sum received from their foreign superannuation scheme, if they choose to do so. If they choose not to use the formula method, they must use the schedule method. To be eligible to use the formula method the individual must meet several criteria in relation to the interest. First, the foreign superannuation scheme must be a foreign defined contribution scheme for which a person has sufficient information about the value of the scheme and contributions made. A foreign defined contribution scheme is defined in section YA 1 as a foreign superannuation scheme that operates on the principle of allocating contributions to the scheme on a defined basis to individual members. In addition, a person must not have used the schedule method for a past lump sum received from that particular interest, and must not have received a withdrawal (other than a pension or an annuity) before 1 April 2014. If the person received their interest from a spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner, in a transaction referred to in section CF 3(21)(d), another condition is that the person who originally held the interest did not use the schedule method in relation to the interest. Calculating the assessable period As noted above, a person who receives a lump sum during their “assessable period” is required to calculate their assessable income in relation to that lump sum by using either the schedule or the formula method (the assessable withdrawal amount). 18 Generally speaking, the assessable period is the period during which a person is a New Zealand tax resident while holding an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme. The assessable period is calculated on an interest-by-interest basis. This ensures that the rules still work as intended if an individual has interests in multiple schemes acquired at different points in time (because, for example, they worked for different employers). Determining the duration of a person’s assessable period is necessary to calculate the assessable withdrawal amount under both the schedule method and formula method. New section CF 3(7) reinforces this. The tax liability arising under the schedule method essentially depends on how long the person has been a New Zealand tax resident. It is calculated using the number of income years beginning in the person’s assessable period. The interest factor in the formula method is calculated using a person’s years of tax residence. Sections CF 3(11)(c) and CF 3(18)(c) provide that a person’s years of residence is calculated as the greater of 1 and the number of income years which begin in the assessable period before a person receives a lump sum. New section CF 3(8) provides how a person’s assessable period for a foreign superannuation interest is calculated. If the person has a four-year exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interest (as described above), their assessable period for that foreign superannuation interest begins as soon as the exemption period ends. This is provided for in new section CF 3(8)(a)(ii). If the person does not have an exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interest (this will generally occur if the person has already had an exemption period before they acquired the foreign superannuation interest in question), their assessable period for that foreign superannuation interest begins when they become a New Zealand tax resident for the first time while owning that interest. This is given by section CF 3(8)(a)(i). It is possible that a person could migrate to New Zealand with a foreign superannuation interest, lose their New Zealand tax residence, and then become tax resident again. New Zealand does not generally aim to tax foreign-sourced income derived by non-tax residents. To ensure that the schedule and formula methods do not contradict this principle, new section CF 3(8)(c) provides that the assessable period excludes periods of non-tax residence. New section CF 3(8)(b) provides that a person’s assessable period for an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme ends when the person derives a lump sum (the distribution time). This means when a person receives multiple lumps from a given foreign superannuation interest, their assessable period for that interest is extended with each lump sum they receive. 19 Example 6 Brian’s exemption period ends on 30 September 2015. His assessable period begins on 1 October 2015. Brian leaves New Zealand and his last day as a New Zealand tax resident is 27 March 2022. He becomes a New Zealand tax resident again on 1 August 2027. Brian receives a lump sum from his foreign superannuation scheme on 5 February 2029. Brian’s assessable period is from 1 October 2015 until 5 February 2029, but excludes the period 28 March 2022 to 31 July 2027 (which is when he was non-resident). As noted above, section CF 3(2) provides that transfers between two non-Australian foreign superannuation schemes are generally not taxed. Instead, the holder of the interest is taxed when it is finally withdrawn or transferred to a New Zealand or Australian superannuation scheme. New section CF 3(21)(b) provides that in such a case, the assessable period begins when the person first became New Zealand tax-resident while owning the interest in the original foreign superannuation scheme or when their exemption period for that original interest ended. Example 7 Matilda migrated to New Zealand with an interest in an employment-related German superannuation scheme and became tax-resident on 8 August 2012. Her exemption period is 8 August 2012 to 30 August 2016. Her assessable period for that superannuation interest begins on 1 September 2016. On 7 July 2017 she transfers her interest into a different German superannuation scheme. This transfer is not a taxable event. On 21 March 2020, Matilda transfers that German superannuation interest to a New Zealand superannuation scheme, which is a taxable event. Matilda’s assessable period in relation to the transfer starts on 1 September 2016 and ends on 21 March 2020. When an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is transferred to another person, the transfer is generally taxable under new section CF 3(2)(d) to the transferor based on their assessable period, if the transferor is a New Zealand tax resident. If the transferee is a New Zealand tax resident when they receive the interest from the transferor, the transferee generally does not qualify for the tax treatment provided in section CF 3 in relation to their acquired interest for subsequent lump sums received from the interest. In this case, the transferee has a FIF superannuation interest and is required to account for tax on an annual basis under the FIF rules. The exception to this is where the transfer meets the conditions listed in section CF 3(3) for rollover relief following the death of the transferor or a relationship split involving the transferor and transferee. In this case, the transfer is not a taxable event to the transferor, but section CF 3(21)(d) provides that the transferee’s assessable period begins when the transferor’s assessable period for that interest began. 20 This approach ensures that all gains that have accrued to the scheme while the transferor was New Zealand tax-resident while holding the interest are eventually taxed. Further explanation of the conditions for rollover relief arising under section CF 3(3) and an example can be found in the section “Certain transfers following the death of a spouse or a relationship split” of this report. Example 8 Rebecca and Stella are sisters who migrated to New Zealand. Rebecca acquired an interest in an Italian superannuation scheme while she was working in Italy. Rebecca’s exemption period ends on 30 November 2013 and her assessable period begins on 1 December 2013. On 16 October 2019, Rebecca decides to transfer her interest to Stella. The transfer does not met the requirements for rollover relief under section CF 3(3) as Rebecca and Stella are not married, in a civil union, or in a de facto relationship. Rebecca must account for the transfer using the rules in section CF 3. Rebecca’s assessable period for calculating her assessable withdrawal amount arising from the transfer is 1 December 2013 to 16 October 2019. Rebecca must calculate her tax liability under either the schedule or formula method. As Stella is a New Zealand tax resident when she acquires the interest from Rebecca, and does not qualify for rollover relief under section CF 3(3), Stella needs to account for income on the foreign superannuation interest using the FIF rules. Schedule method New sections CF 3(9)(a), CF 3(10), (11), and (19) provide for the schedule method. The schedule method is the default method for taxing foreign superannuation withdrawals received by individuals who first acquired their foreign superannuation interest while they were non-tax resident. The schedule method deems a certain amount of the lump-sum transfer or withdrawal to be investment gains, based on the person’s years of tax residence. The approach uses fractions that represent the proportion of the lump sum to be included in a person’s assessable income – the assessable withdrawal amount. The schedule year fractions increase with years of residence. New sections CF 3(4)(b) and CW 28C provide that the remainder of the lump sum that is not deemed to be the assessable withdrawal amount is exempt from tax. The fractions in new schedule 33 are set at the rate necessary to put a person who leaves their foreign superannuation overseas in the same position as if they had instead transferred their superannuation to New Zealand when they first became tax-resident and paid tax on investment gains as they accrued in a KiwiSaver or bank account, for example. This would also put them in a similar tax position to someone who pays tax on an annual basis under the FIF rules on an overseas-based financial asset. Given certain assumptions (including a 5% post-tax interest rate in the foreign scheme), the schedule method has been designed so that a person should conceptually be indifferent from a tax perspective between keeping their superannuation overseas and transferring it to New Zealand. Further discussion of the policy rationale behind the schedule method can be found in the annex to the issues paper. 2 2 Taxation of foreign superannuation, released on 24 July 2012 available at www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz. 21 A person’s assessable income (or assessable withdrawal amount) under the schedule method is calculated using the following formula provided in new section CF 3(10): (super withdrawal – contributions left) x schedule year fraction The terms in the formula are defined in new section CF 3(11). The term “super withdrawal” is the amount of the foreign superannuation withdrawal (the lump sum). The “contributions left” item in the formula is a deduction for contributions made for or on behalf of a person while the person is a New Zealand tax resident, if the contributions satisfy certain conditions. The schedule method may otherwise treat some of the New Zealand contributions as gains would result in over-taxation. New section CF 3(19) provides that all of the following conditions must be met:  at the time the contribution is made, the person must be a New Zealand resident under section YD 1 and treated as a New Zealand resident under all applicable double tax agreements;  the contribution is made by the person, or the person’s employer, or for the benefit of the person;  the contribution must be required under the rules of the foreign superannuation scheme (that is, voluntary contributions cannot be deducted); and  employer contributions must be subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax. Additional conditions set out in section CF 3(11)(b) provide that a given contribution may only be deducted once under the schedule method, and for a given lump sum, the amount of contributions deducted may not exceed the value of the lump sum in calculating the assessable withdrawal amount. Section CF 3(11)(b) also provides that only recognised contributions made during the assessable period before the distribution time can be deducted. Contributions that can be deducted are restricted in this manner because the schedule rates already include an implicit allowance for contributions. For example, for the year one schedule rate, 4.76% of the withdrawal is treated as taxable New Zealand-sourced gains and the remainder is treated as non-taxable. The non-taxable portion includes contributions as well as gains derived while non-resident. The reason for having restrictions on the types of contributions that are deductible is to ensure that contributions are not effectively deducted more than once − first, by being deducted as “contributions left” in the formula and, secondly, by then being allocated out using the schedule year fractions. 22 The appropriate “schedule year fraction” to use is identified by calculating the number of income years that begin in the person’s assessable period, before the person receives the lump sum. This is the number of income years which begin after the person becomes a New Zealand tax resident and after their four-year exemption period ends. This means that when a person has an exemption period, the number of income years beginning in a person’s assessable period is less than the number of years that they have been New Zealand-resident. The effect of counting a person’s years of residence from the end of the exemption period is to treat them as being non-resident during the exemption period. Gains which accrue during those four years are not clawed back and are therefore not taxed under the schedule method. Example 9 After a period spent working overseas, Dan returned to New Zealand with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme and acquired a permanent place of abode on 28 June 2012. Dan’s exemption period begins on 28 June 2012 and ends on 30 June 2016. Dan’s assessable period starts on 1 July 2016. He withdraws a lump sum of $50,000 on 27 January 2020. There are three income years that begin in Dan’s assessable period: the years beginning 1 April 2017 (2018 income year), 1 April 2018 (2019 income year), and 1 April 2019 (2020 income year). Dan is therefore required to use the schedule year fraction for year three. The corresponding schedule year fraction is 14.06%, so his assessable income is $7,030 (being $50,000 x 14.06%). Dan includes $7,030 as income in his 2020 income tax return. His marginal tax rate is applied to this amount, rather than the full amount of the lump-sum withdrawal. If the number of income years beginning in a person’s assessable period is zero when a person receives a lump sum (that is, they receive the lump sum during the part-year in which their assessable period starts but before the start of the next income year), the person should use the schedule year fraction associated with year one. Example 10 Melanie’s assessable period begins on 1 October 2014. She withdraws a lump sum of $50,000 on 5 February 2015, which means that an income year has not yet started during her assessable period. Melanie is required to use the schedule year fraction for year one because the withdrawal was made between 1 October 2014 and 31 March 2015. The corresponding schedule fraction is 4.76%, so her assessable income is $2,380 (being $50,000 x 4.76%). Assuming Melanie’s tax rate is 33% (which is the top personal marginal tax rate for the 2014–15 income year), she is liable to pay $785.40 of tax on her $50,000 lump-sum withdrawal. 23 Example 11 Ruby migrated to New Zealand with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme and became a New Zealand tax resident on 25 November 2008 when she obtained a permanent place of abode. Her exemption period is 25 November 2008 to 30 November 2012 and her assessable period begins on 1 December 2012. On 6 May 2018, Ruby transfers her foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand scheme and the transfer equates to $100,000. Ruby has been treated as New Zealand-resident under all applicable double tax agreements since early 2009. The rules of Ruby’s foreign superannuation scheme require that she continues to contribute a certain amount to the scheme each year. The amount she is required to contribute during her exemption period amounts to $2,000. The amount she is required to contribute during her assessable period before the transfer is $3,000. Ruby decides to contribute an additional $500 to the scheme during her assessable period, which was not required by the scheme. Ruby uses the schedule method to calculate how much of her transfer she needs to include in her 2019 income tax return. Ruby’s assessable period in relation to the transfer is 1 December 2012 to 6 May 2018. The number of income years beginning in her assessable period is six, so Ruby must use the schedule year fraction of 27.47%. The $2,000 of contributions made during her exemption period are not deductible as one of the requirements for a contribution to be deductible is that they are made during the assessable period before the distribution time. The $3,000 of contributions are deductible as they meet the requirements in sections CF 3(8)(b) and CF 3(19) that they were made during Ruby’s assessable period, they were required by the rules of the scheme, they were made by Ruby, and Ruby was treated as a New Zealand tax resident under all applicable double tax agreements when they were made. The additional $500 she contributed is not deductible as it was a voluntary contribution. Ruby calculates her assessable withdrawal amount as follows: ($100,000 – $3,000) x 27.47% = $26,645.90 Ruby includes $26,645.90 as income in her 2019 income tax return and pays tax at her marginal tax rate on this amount. 24 New schedule 33 to the Income Tax Act 2007 provides the full schedule of rates per income year beginning in the person’s assessable period: Schedule year Schedule year fraction 1 4.76% 2 9.45% 3 14.06% 4 18.60% 5 23.07% 6 27.47% 7 31.80% 8 36.06% 9 40.26% 10 44.39% 11 48.45% 12 52.45% 13 56.39% 14 60.27% 15 64.08% 16 67.84% 17 71.53% 18 75.17% 19 78.75% 20 82.28% 21 85.74% 22 89.16% 23 92.58% 24 95.83% 25 99.08% 26+ 100% Formula method New sections CF 3(9)(b), CF 3(12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18), (19) and a new definition for “foreign defined contribution scheme” inserted into section YA 1 provide for the formula method. The formula method is an alternative to the schedule method for people with foreign defined contribution schemes, if they meet other certain requirements and choose to use the formula method. This method taxes the actual investment gains that have accrued to a person’s foreign superannuation scheme while the person has been a New Zealand tax resident (excluding the gains that accrued during the person’s four-year exemption period). To use this approach, new section CF 3(9)(b) provides that in addition to the requirement that the scheme must be a foreign defined contribution scheme, all of the following conditions must be met:  the person has the information required to use the formula method;  the person must not have received a distribution from the scheme before 1 April 2014, other than a pension or an annuity; 25  the person has not used the schedule method in relation to that scheme; and  if the person has acquired the interest from another person in a transaction referred to in new section CF 3(21)(d), that other person did not use the schedule method. As set out in section CF 3(9)(b), a person is not permitted to use the formula method for an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme if they have already used the schedule method for that interest. However, a person is able to use the schedule method, if they have previously used the formula method for a given interest. To use the formula method, a person is required to obtain the market value of the foreign superannuation interest at the time the exemption period ends, as well as information about contributions made and other necessary information. Requirements relating to the quality of information also apply. Detailed procedure The necessary calculations for the formula method begin with new section CF 3(12): Distributed gain = (super withdrawal x calculated gains fraction) – other gains The definition of each of these terms is provided in section CF 3(13) and (14). “Super withdrawal” is the amount of the foreign superannuation withdrawal for which the person is using the formula method to calculate their assessable income. “Other gains” is the total amount of “distributed gain” calculated under this formula for previous foreign superannuation withdrawals received in the assessable period before this particular lump sum. If this is the first lump sum for the person in relation to that foreign superannuation interest, then “other gains” is equal to zero. This is because no other lump sums have been received during the person’s assessable period before the time the current lump sum (for which the person is using the formula method) was distributed. If, for example, a person is calculating the assessable withdrawal amount in relation to a third lump sum that the person has received from their foreign superannuation scheme, the “other gains” term consists of what they previously calculated for “distributed gain” in respect of the first and second lump sums. The “other gains” term acts as a wash-up calculation to ensure that a person is not over- or under-taxed in relation to their foreign superannuation interest. The “calculated gains fraction” is the greater of zero and the result given by the formula in section CF 3(14) as follows: Calculated gains fraction = predistribution + withdrawals – value – contributions predistribution 26 Where the formula for the “calculated gains fraction” provides a negative result, the person must enter zero for the “calculated gains fraction” term in the formula for the “distributed gain” in section CF 3(12). The result is that losses cannot be offset against other income in the person’s income tax return. The terms in the “calculated gains fraction” formula are defined in new section CF 3(15). “Predistribution” is the value of the person’s interest in the scheme immediately before they made their foreign superannuation withdrawal. “Withdrawals” is the total amount of previous foreign superannuation withdrawals the person has received from their foreign superannuation scheme made during their assessable period before the time the current lump sum (for which the person is currently using the formula method to calculate their assessable withdrawal amount) was distributed. This term is zero if the person has received no other lump sums from the foreign superannuation scheme. If, for example, the person is calculating the “calculated gains fraction” in respect of their third lump sum, “withdrawals” would consist of the value of their first and second lump sums. “Value” is the opening value of the person’s interest in the scheme at the beginning of their assessable period. If the person has an exemption period, “value” is the value of their foreign superannuation interest at the end of their four-year exemption period, not at the time of migration. This is to ensure that gains made by the scheme during the person’s exemption period and the pre-migration value are not taxed. If a person does not have an exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interest, “value” is the value of the person’s scheme at the time they first became a New Zealand tax resident while holding the interest. “Contributions” is the total amount of recognised contributions under section CF 3(19) made to the scheme during the person’s assessable period before the distribution time. This term provides a deduction for contributions made for or on behalf of a person while the person is a New Zealand tax resident, if the contributions satisfy certain conditions. The formula method may otherwise treat some of the New Zealand contributions as gains and would result in over-taxation. Section CF 3(19) provides that all of the following conditions must be met:  at the time the contribution is made, the person must be a New Zealand resident under section YD 1 and is treated as a New Zealand resident under all applicable double tax agreements;  the contribution is made by the person, or the person’s employer, or for the benefit of the person;  the contribution must be required under the rules of the foreign superannuation scheme (that is, voluntary contributions cannot be deducted); and  employer contributions must be subject to employer superannuation contribution tax or fringe benefit tax. 27 Once a person has calculated their “calculated gains fraction” and their “distributed gain” in relation to their lump sum, they are then required to calculate their assessable withdrawal amount by using the formulas in new section CF 3(16) to (18). These formulas are used to calculate the appropriate amount of “interest” to be charged on the amount of taxable New Zealand gains to account for the deferral benefit that the person obtains by not paying tax on accrual. This “interest” is calculated at the same rate as the average growth of the person’s superannuation interest over the number of years of New Zealand tax residence. Assessable withdrawal amount = \[gain x (grow rate – 1) x tax rate x (assessable years – 1)\] + gain The terms in the formulas are defined in new section CF 3(18). “Gain” is the amount of distributed gain that a person has calculated in section CF 3(12) in relation to the current lump sum for which they are using the formula method to calculate their assessable withdrawal amount. “Tax rate” is the tax rate referred to in row 1 of table 1 in schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This is the top prescribed investor rate (PIR) for taxing investments in multi-rate portfolio investment entities (PIEs). The term “assessable years” refers to the number of tax years beginning in the person’s assessable period. Where a tax year has not yet begun during a person’s assessable period before the distribution time, the person must use “1” for this term. The term “grow rate” is given by the formula in new section CF 3(17): The term “accrued total” means:  the sum of: – the value of the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme immediately before the distribution time; and – the total amount of previous foreign superannuation withdrawals made during the assessable period from the scheme before the time that the current lump sum was distributed. This term is zero if the person has received no other lump sums during their assessable period from the scheme. This is the same as what is used for “withdrawals” in section CF 3 (14);  which is then reduced by: – the value of recognised contributions under section CF 3(19) made to the interest in the scheme during the person’s assessable period before the distribution time. The conditions that must be met in order for a contribution to be a recognised contribution are provided in new section CF 3(19) and have been discussed in further detail in reference to the formula for the “calculated gains fraction” in section CF 3(14). 28 “Value” is the value of the person’s interest in the scheme at the beginning of their assessable period. If the person has an exemption period, “value” is the value of their foreign superannuation interest immediately following the end of their four-year exemption period. This is to ensure that the pre-migration value and the gains made by the scheme during the person’s exemption period are not taxed. If a person does not have an exemption period in relation to their foreign superannuation interest, then “value” is the value of the person’s scheme at the time they first became New Zealand tax resident while holding the interest. This is the same as what is used for “value” in section CF 3(14). The term “assessable years” refers to the number of tax years beginning in the person’s assessable period. Where a tax year has not yet begun during a person’s assessable period before the distribution time, the person must use “1” for this term. This is the same as the term “assessable years” in relation to section CF 3(16). The final result given by section CF 3(16) is the person’s assessable withdrawal amount which is to be included as income in the person’s income tax return. The remainder of the lump sum that exceeds this amount is exempt income, as provided by new section CF 3(4)(b). Summary of procedure In addition to the detailed description of the procedure for the formula method, a summary of the procedure to calculate the assessable withdrawal amount under the formula method is shown below: 1. Calculate the “calculated gains fraction” in section CF 3(14) using:  the value of the scheme immediately before the foreign superannuation withdrawal (“predistribution”);  the total value of previous foreign superannuation withdrawals made during the assessable period before the distribution of the current foreign superannuation withdrawal (“withdrawals”);  the value of the scheme at the beginning of the assessable period (“value”);  the total value of recognised contributions made to the scheme in the assessable period before the distribution of the current foreign superannuation withdrawal (“contributions”). 2. Calculate the “distributed gain” in section CF 3(12) using:  the result for “calculated gains fraction” as calculated in step 1;  the amount of the foreign superannuation withdrawal (“super withdrawal”);  the total value of distributed gains calculated in section CF 3(12) for previous foreign superannuation withdrawals from the scheme in the assessable period before the distribution of the current foreign superannuation withdrawal (“other gains”). 29 3. Calculate the “grow rate” in section CF 3(17) using:  the value of the scheme at the beginning of the assessable period (“value”);  the sum of the value of the scheme immediately before the foreign superannuation withdrawal and previous foreign superannuation withdrawals made during the assessable period before the distribution of the current foreign superannuation withdrawal, reduced by the total value of recognised contributions made to the scheme in the assessable period before the distribution of the current foreign superannuation withdrawal (“accrued total”);  the number of tax years beginning in the assessable period and before the distribution time (or 1 if the result is zero) (“assessable years”). 4. Calculate the “assessable withdrawal amount” in section CF 3(16) using:  the result for “distributed gain” as calculated in step 2 (“gain”);  the result for “grow rate” as calculated in step 3;  the number of tax years beginning in the assessable period and before the distribution time (or 1 if the result is zero) (“assessable years”);  the tax rate referred to in schedule 6, table 1, row 1 (Prescribed rates: PIE investments and retirement scheme contributions) (“tax rate”). Example 12 Graham migrates to New Zealand with an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme and becomes a New Zealand tax resident on 17 April 2011. His exemption period is 17 April 2011 to 30 April 2015. During Graham’s exemption period, he withdraws a lump-sum amount of NZ$50,000 from his scheme on 20 November 2014. Graham’s interest in his foreign superannuation scheme is worth NZ$100,000 when his assessable period begins on 1 May 2015. Graham withdraws a lump-sum amount of NZ$60,000 from his scheme on 23 June 2025. His scheme is worth NZ$180,000 immediately before the lump-sum withdrawal. On 9 November 2030, Graham’s foreign superannuation interest is worth NZ$150,000 and he transfers the full amount into a New Zealand superannuation scheme. Graham has made no contributions to the scheme while he has been New Zealand-resident. The withdrawal on 23 June 2025 and transfer on 9 November 2030 fall within the definition of “foreign superannuation withdrawal” and are received during Graham’s assessable period, so Graham must calculate his tax liability under section CF 3. However, the withdrawal on 20 November 2014 is exempt income as it is received during his exemption period. 30 23 June 2025 withdrawal To calculate his “assessable withdrawal amount” in relation to his withdrawal made on 23 June 2025, Graham must first calculate his “distributed gain” and “calculated gains fraction”. For the “calculated gains fraction”, Graham uses $180,000 for the “predistribution” term as this is what his interest in his foreign superannuation scheme was worth immediately before he made the withdrawal. For the “value” term, he uses $100,000 as this was the value of Graham’s interest in the scheme at the beginning of his assessable period. Graham has made no contributions and has not yet received any other foreign superannuation withdrawals during his assessable period, so both “contributions” and “withdrawals” are zero. Graham does not include the withdrawal he received during his exemption period on 20 November 2014 in “withdrawals”, because it was not received during his assessable period. His “calculated gains fraction” under new section CF 3(14) is therefore: Graham then uses this to calculate his “distributed gain” under section CF 3(12) in relation to the $60,000 lump sum: .67 The “other gains” term is zero because Graham has not received any other lump sums that were taxed under the formula method. Now that Graham has his “distributed gain”, he uses this to calculate his “assessable withdrawal amount”. First, Graham calculates his “grow rate” under section CF 3(17). To do this he must first identify his “accrued total”. His “accrued total” is $180,000 because his scheme was worth $180,000 immediately before the lump sum was withdrawn. He has not received any other foreign superannuation withdrawals during his assessable period, nor has he made any contributions to the scheme. Graham uses $100,000 for the “value” term (the value of his interest at the beginning of his assessable period). Ten tax years have begun in his assessable period so far, so the number of “assessable years” is ten. Graham’s “grow rate” is: 31 In calculating his “assessable withdrawal amount”, Graham is required to use the top prescribed investor rate 3 and makes use of the “distributed gain” amount he calculated earlier. As above, his number of “assessable years” is ten. Graham’s “assessable withdrawal amount” is: Graham includes $30,734.99 as assessable income in his IR3 return for the 2025–26 tax year (the year in which he received the lump sum). The remaining $29,265.01 of the $60,000 withdrawal is exempt income. Graham pays tax based on $30,734.99 of included income, rather than on the full amount of his foreign superannuation withdrawal of $60,000. 9 November 2030 transfer Graham’s transfer of the remainder of his interest in his foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand scheme is a taxable event. Graham continues to use the formula method for this second foreign superannuation withdrawal. As before, the “value” term is still $100,000 but “predistribution” is now $150,000. Graham has still not made any contributions to his foreign superannuation scheme, so “contributions” is still zero. Graham includes $60,000 in the “withdrawals” term to account for his lump-sum withdrawal made on 23 June 2025. Graham’s “calculated gains fraction” under section CF 3(14) is therefore: Graham uses this to calculate his “distributed gain” under section CF 3(12) as follows: .33 Graham then calculates his “assessable withdrawal amount” using the formulas in section CF 3(16) and (17). Graham’s “accrued total” is the value of his fund immediately before the transfer plus the value of his first withdrawal ($150,000 + $60,000). Graham uses $100,000 for the term “value”. At the time of the transfer on 9 November 2030, 15 tax years have begun during Graham’s assessable period, so Graham uses 15 for the term “assessable years”. Graham’s “grow rate” is: 3 This is the rate in row 1 of table 1 in schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which is 28% on the date of enactment of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. 32 Using the results for the “grow rate” and “distributed gain”, and assuming that the top prescribed investor rate is 28% 3 , Graham’s “assessable withdrawal amount” is: Graham therefore includes $99,897.35 as assessable income in his IR3 return for the 2030–31 tax year. Graham pays tax on that amount, rather than on the full value of the transfer of $150,000. Optional KiwiSaver withdrawal facility Under section CF 3(2)(b), a transfer from a foreign superannuation scheme into a New Zealand superannuation scheme is a taxable event. In some cases, the transfer may be into a locked-in superannuation scheme, such as KiwiSaver. This could lead to cashflow difficulties for the person if they are unable to access any of the transferred amount to pay the resulting tax liability. To address this issue, new clause 14C has been inserted into schedule 1 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to provide an optional withdrawal mechanism for people who have transferred their foreign superannuation scheme into a KiwiSaver scheme and need to pay their tax liability arising from the transfer. Subclause 14C(1) provides that a person may withdraw an amount to pay their tax liability arising from a transfer under the Income Tax Act 2007, but not interest and penalties. While this withdrawal facility is available from 1 April 2014, it may be used in respect of a transfer that was made before 1 April 2014 as long as there is a tax liability that arises under the Income Tax Act 2007 (and other requirements have been met). The reference to the Income Tax Act 2007 is also read as a reference to the Income Tax Act 2004 and Income Tax Act 1994 under existing section ZA 3(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means the optional withdrawal facility available under new clause 14C of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 is available when the tax liability on the lump-sum transfer arises under the Income Tax Act 2004 or Income Tax Act 1994 due to the date of the transfer. The maximum amount that may be withdrawn is provided in subclause 14C(2) and is the lesser of the person’s tax liability arising on the transfer of the foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver and their terminal tax liability for the tax year in which the transfer is assessed as income. This means when the terminal tax liability for the year is less than the tax liability on the transfer (for example, this could occur when a person has losses in relation to other income), a person is only permitted to withdraw up to the amount of their terminal tax liability. In addition, the amount withdrawn may not exceed the value of the person’s accumulated funds in the KiwiSaver scheme less the value of the Crown contribution. This condition is provided by subclause 14C(3). 33 Subclause 14C(1) also provides that a person may withdraw an amount to pay their student loan repayment obligation arising under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, but only the portion of the repayment obligation that arises as a result of the transfer of the foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver being assessed as taxable income. Example 13 On 26 June 2013, Hamish transfers his foreign superannuation interest into a KiwiSaver scheme. He calculates his tax liability on the transfer and includes $20,000 as assessable income in his 2013–14 income tax return. This is in addition to Hamish’s other income of $60,000 for the 2013–14 year. The student loan repayment threshold for the 2013–14 year is $19,084 and the repayment rate is 12%. Hamish’s student loan repayment obligation for the year is $7,309.92 (($80,000–$19,084) x 12%). He is permitted to use the KiwiSaver withdrawal facility for up to $2,400 of that amount ($20,000 x 12%), which relates to the amount of his increased student loan repayment obligation arising from the transfer. A number of requirements must be met in order to use the withdrawal facility. These conditions are provided for in new subclause 14C(4). Subclause 14C(4) requires that the application to the KiwiSaver provider to withdraw funds under clause 14C must be made within 24 months from the end of the month that the tax liability and/or student loan repayment obligation arising from the transfer of the foreign superannuation interest into the KiwiSaver scheme is assessed. The form of the application is determined by the trustees or manager of the KiwiSaver scheme as provided by subclause 14C(4). Under subclause 14C(4), a person’s application must include any supporting documents and information that are required by the trustees or manager of the KiwiSaver scheme. In addition, new subclause 14C(4) requires that a person’s application must include a completed statutory declaration giving the details of the transfer of the person’s foreign superannuation interest into the KiwiSaver scheme and the resulting liability for tax arising under the Income Tax Act 2007. New subclause 14C(5) provides that the trustees or manager of the KiwiSaver scheme must inform the Commissioner of Inland Revenue of any withdrawals made under clause 14C and must provide details of the withdrawal. In addition, payment of the withdrawal must be made to the Commissioner if the KiwiSaver provider’s systems allow the release of funds to any person other than the KiwiSaver member (for example, a solicitor). Use of the new withdrawal facility is optional, so it is important for individuals to consider whether making a withdrawal under subclause 14C would trigger any obligations or conditions imposed upon the transfer of their foreign superannuation interest into KiwiSaver. This may include, for example, penalties imposed on withdrawals made within a certain period of time following migration under the rules of the scheme, or under the other country’s law. 34 Example 14 Andrea transfers her interest in a foreign superannuation scheme worth $100,000 into a KiwiSaver scheme on 30 January 2015. Andrea calculates that her assessable withdrawal amount in relation to the transfer is $4,760, which she includes in her 2014–15 income tax return. Assuming that Andrea’s marginal tax rate is 33%, her tax liability arising from the transfer is $1,570.80. Andrea has overpaid tax in relation to her other income derived in the 2014–15 year. Andrea’s terminal tax liability for the 2014–15 income year is $1,200. Andrea does not have a student loan. She makes an application under clause 14C of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to the manager of her KiwiSaver scheme on 6 October 2015. Her withdrawal is limited to $1,200 as this is the lesser amount of her terminal tax liability and her liability for tax arising from her transfer. Andrea’s application is for $1,200. She provides a signed statutory declaration and the documents required by the manager. The KiwiSaver manager approves the withdrawal and pays $1,200 to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The manager also provides details of Andrea’s withdrawal to the Commissioner. Use of the foreign investment fund rules From 1 April 2014, the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules generally no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes except in the following two circumstances:  when the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme was first acquired while a person is a New Zealand tax resident under section YD 1; or  when a person treated their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme as an attributing interest in a FIF in an income tax return filed before 20 May 2013 and the person treats the interest as an attributing interest in a FIF in income tax returns in all subsequent income years. This is reflected in the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” which has been inserted into section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Interests in foreign superannuation schemes first acquired while New Zealand tax-resident The FIF rules continue to apply when a person first acquires their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while already New Zealand-resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This is provided for in paragraph (a) of the definition of new term “FIF superannuation interest” in section YA 1 and applies irrespective of whether the interest was acquired before or after 1 April 2014. A person is considered to be a New Zealand tax resident under section YD, 1 if they have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand. If a person does not have a permanent place of abode in New Zealand, they are considered to be a New Zealand tax resident if they are personally present in New Zealand for more than 183 days in a 12-month period. 35 As discussed in section “Taxable lump-sum withdrawals or transfers”, a person could be considered to be a tax resident of New Zealand and another country under the domestic law of each country. If the person “tie-breaks” to the other country under the DTA and is treated as not being a New Zealand resident for the purposes of the DTA, they are still considered to be a New Zealand tax resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. This means an individual who first acquires their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while New Zealand tax-resident must account for income in relation to their interest on an annual basis. Any distributions received from the scheme are considered under the FIF rules and are not treated as income of the individual at the time they are derived. This is a standard feature of the FIF rules. There is an exception to this rule in the situation when a New Zealand resident acquires the interest in a transaction that meets the criteria set out in section CF 3(21)(d). Section CF 3(21)(d) refers to a transfer of an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme from a New Zealand tax resident to:  a New Zealand-resident surviving spouse, civil union partner or de factor partner of the original owner following their death; or,  a New Zealand-resident former spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner of the original owner under a relationship agreement arising from the end of the marriage, civil union or de facto relationship. If the criteria in section CF 3(21)(d) are met, the individual is not required to account for income in relation to the foreign superannuation interest under the FIF rules, but is instead required to account for tax on receipt. Section CF 3(1)(b)(ii) provides that in this situation, the individual is taxed on any lump sums under the new rules in section CF 3. Pensions received from that scheme are taxed in full at the person’s marginal tax rate. The purpose of this carve-out from the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” is to ensure that an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme is correctly taxed at the correct point in time, when a transfer of the interest from one person to another satisfies the criteria for rollover relief provided in section CF 3(3). Where rollover relief is provided to the transferor under section CF 3(3) (and an exception from the FIF rules is given to the transferee in the definition of FIF superannuation interest), section CF 3(21)(d) is integral in correctly calculating the transferee’s assessable period under section CF 3(8). There is another exception to the acquired-while-tax-resident rule, when a person transfers their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme into another foreign superannuation scheme while New Zealand tax-resident and that first interest was not a FIF superannuation interest. Consider a person who acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non- resident before they migrated to New Zealand. Once they are a New Zealand tax resident they transfer their interest to a different foreign superannuation scheme provider (this may occur, for example, when a person disposes of their interest to purchase an annuity with a different provider, or if a person transfers from one foreign scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme to obtain better returns). As noted in section “Transfers between two non-Australian foreign schemes (rollover relief)”, this transfer is not taxed under section CF 3. 36 However, the person is taxed under section CF 3 when a lump sum is received from that second scheme, rather than being subject to the FIF rules in relation to the interest in that second scheme. This is provided for in section CF 3(1)(b)(ii). Section CF 3(21)(b) provides that in such a case, the assessable period begins when the person first became New Zealand tax-resident while owning the interest in the original foreign superannuation scheme or when their exemption period for that original interest ended. Example 3 in section “Transfers between two non-Australian foreign schemes (rollover relief)” is relevant here. Example 15 Glenn is a New Zealand tax resident. Glenn decides to diversify his investment portfolio and on 26 February 2011, he invests $100,000 in a foreign superannuation scheme. His interest is an attributing interest in a FIF and Glenn accounts for FIF income and losses in relation to his interest in subsequent income tax returns. For income years beginning from 1 April 2014, Glenn continues to account for FIF income and losses in relation to his foreign superannuation interest, because he first acquired his interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while a New Zealand tax resident. Example 16 Peter acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while already a New Zealand tax resident in 2010. The interest is an attributing interest in a FIF, but Peter has not been returning FIF income or losses in relation to his interest. From 1 April 2014, Peter’s interest in the foreign superannuation scheme is still an attributing interest in a FIF. Peter learns that he should be returning FIF income and losses in his income tax returns and begins to do so from the 2014–15 income year. Peter remains liable for omitted FIF income in relation to income years ending before 1 April 2014. Example 17 Zoe is a New Zealand tax resident who goes to the United Kingdom to work for one year. While she is in the UK, she retains a permanent place of abode in New Zealand and remains a New Zealand tax resident. She also becomes a UK tax resident during that one-year period. While working in the UK, Zoe acquires an interest in a UK pension scheme. When she returns to New Zealand after her year abroad, she has a FIF superannuation interest and is required to account for income under the FIF rules, because she remained a New Zealand tax resident while she was away. 37 Grandparenting of the foreign investment fund rules in limited circumstances In addition to the provision that interests in foreign superannuation schemes acquired while New Zealand-resident are taxable under the FIF regime, the FIF rules remain available (but not mandatory) for a certain group of people who acquired their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident but have already returned FIF income or losses in an income tax return filed before 20 May 2013. This provision, known as “grandparenting”, is provided in paragraph (b) of the definition of new term “FIF superannuation interest” in section YA 1. Grandparenting applies on an interest-by-interest basis. That is, when a person has interests in multiple foreign superannuation schemes, it is possible that the person may be grandparented in relation to one or several of those interests, or none at all. For a given interest in a foreign superannuation scheme in a given income year (the “current year”), the criteria that must be met for the interest to be a FIF superannuation interest are described below. The reference to “current year” means that from 1 April 2014, a person needs to evaluate whether they satisfy the criteria every income year. First, the person must have acquired (or is treated as having acquired) the interest in the foreign superannuation scheme while non-resident. Where an interest is acquired while the person is already New Zealand tax resident, the interest is already an attributing interest in a FIF under paragraph (a) of the definition of FIF superannuation interest in section YA 1. In addition, the interest must be an attributing interest in a FIF in an income year ending before 1 April 2014 (known as the “qualifying year”). For that “qualifying year”, the person must have treated the interest as an attributing interest in their income tax return and that income tax return must be filed before 20 May 2013. It is possible that because of the $50,000 de minimis thresholds in sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d), a person did not have FIF income or losses to include in their income tax return, even if their interest in a foreign superannuation scheme was an attributing interest in a FIF before 1 April 2014. In this case, the person is not considered to have treated the interest as an attributing interest in their income tax return for the qualifying year. The person must also continue to hold that interest from the end of the “qualifying year” until the beginning of the “current year” (known as the “qualifying period”). For all of the income years in the “qualifying period”, the person must treat the interest as an attributing interest in a FIF in their income tax returns. The effect is that when a person has satisfied the grandparenting criteria for a superannuation interest, the person is not required to account for tax on a distribution from the scheme received during the “current year”. When a person who correctly treated their interest as an attributing interest in an income tax return filed before 20 May 2013 for an income year ending before 1 April 2014 and fails to treat it as an attributing interest in an income tax return for one or more income years in the “qualifying period”, the interest is no longer a FIF superannuation interest. Whether this failure is deliberate is irrelevant. When an interest ceases to be a FIF superannuation interest, 38 the person is taxed on receipt of any distributions from the interest and no credit is given for any tax paid on income arising under the FIF rules in relation to that foreign superannuation interest. In particular, any lump sums received from 1 April 2014 are taxed under the new rules in section CF 3. The term “treated by the person as an attributing interest in a return of income” also covers situations where a loss arises under the FIF rules, but that loss is reduced to nil in accordance with section EX 51 on a portfolio basis and the income arising under the FIF rules is nil. Example 18 Thomas acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme before he migrated to New Zealand in August 2006. Thomas has just entered the workforce, so his interest in the scheme is small and has always remained well below $50,000. Thomas has no other foreign investments. Before 1 April 2014, Thomas’ interest is an attributing interest in a FIF. However, Thomas was a transitional resident under section HR 8 for the period August 2006 to August 2010 and was not required to account for income under the FIF rules during that period. From August 2010, Thomas’ interest was an attributing interest in a FIF, but due to the de minimis threshold in sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d), he had no FIF income or losses. This means that Thomas did not treat his interest as an attributing interest in an income tax return for an income year ending before 1 April 2014. Therefore, from 1 April 2014, Thomas is not able to use the FIF rules in relation to his foreign superannuation interest. Optional treatment of lump sums derived between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 when tax obligations were not previously met New section CZ 21B of the Income Tax Act 2007, section CF 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004, and section CC 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provide an optional method relating to the taxation of lump-sum transfers and withdrawals made from foreign superannuation schemes by 31 March 2014. This optional method is available in addition to the tax rules governing foreign superannuation interests before 1 April 2014. A person who has made a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer from their foreign superannuation scheme between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 (or applies for the withdrawal or transfer of such an amount by 31 March 2014) has the option to pay tax on 15 percent of the lump- sum amount. The phrase “applies for the withdrawal of such an amount” in new section CZ 21B means the person has done all that is necessary of them to apply to withdraw or transfer their funds by 31 March 2014 and generally that any delay in receiving the funds is outside of their control. 39 Section CZ 21B(1) requires that the person has not included the lump sum as income in their income tax return for the income year during which the lump sum is derived, and has not been assessed for income included in that lump sum by 31 March 2014. The 15 percent concession is only available if the person has not complied with their tax obligations in relation to their foreign superannuation interest, either on receipt of a lump sum under the ordinary tax rules or on an annual basis under the FIF rules in the income years leading up to the distribution of the lump sum. If the 15 percent option is not used, a person remains liable for tax under the law that applied to their foreign superannuation interest at the time they made the withdrawal – this may be tax on accrual under the FIF rules, or tax on receipt under the ordinary tax rules. The original due date for payment of tax still applies if there is a positive amount of income under reassessment. This means that any relevant penalties and use-of-money interest apply from the income year in which the transfer or withdrawal occurred if the person is subject to tax on receipt, or from the appropriate years in which the person should have returned income under the FIF rules. People who have complied with the tax law that existed at the time they received their lump sum and paid any associated tax are not able to reassess their position using the 15 percent option. In addition, people who have complied with the tax law in relation to a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer and have correctly calculated that they have zero tax to pay (for example, under the transitional resident rules) are not required to do anything further. Unlike the restriction in section CF 3 to interests in foreign superannuation schemes acquired while non-tax resident, there is no such restriction for the 15 percent option. A person who acquired an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme while resident under section YD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 can use the 15 percent option provided they meet the requirements of section CZ 21B(1). Section CZ 21B(1)(d) provides that to use this option, a person must include 15 percent of the lump-sum amount as income in their 2013–14 or 2014–15 income tax return. Tax is then calculated on this amount at the person’s marginal tax rate. The remainder of the lump sum is not assessable. Section CZ 21B(2) provides that the person is treated as having derived that 15 percent amount in the income year in which it is included in the person’s income tax return, which means the portion that is included in the person’s income tax return for 2013–14 or 2014–15 may affect that person’s obligations and entitlements for that income year, such as child support, student loans, and Working for Families tax credits. The 15 percent option may be used after the 2014–15 income year in respect of a pre-1 April 2014 lump sum, but the person’s 2014–15 income tax return must be reassessed. In this case, any relevant penalties and use-of-money interest apply from the 2014–15 income year. Section CZ 21B(4)(b) and (c) provide that using the 15 percent option satisfies the tax liability of a person in relation to their foreign superannuation interest by overriding the law that applied before 1 April 2014 in relation to the taxation of the person’s lump-sum distribution and of the person’s interest in the foreign superannuation scheme. The effect is to override any non-compliance in relation to the person’s foreign superannuation interest irrespective of whether the person was non-compliant with the ordinary tax rules or the FIF rules. 40 In the situation when a person applies to their foreign superannuation provider to release or transfer their interest by 31 March 2014, but the lump sum is not received until on or after 1 April 2014, the interaction between new sections CF 3 and CZ 21B means that a person may choose between using the 15 percent option to satisfy their tax liability and the rules in new section CF 3. Section CZ 21B(4)(a) provides that if a person in this situation chooses to use the 15 percent option, their tax liability arising under section CF 3 is overridden. If the person should have complied with the FIF rules before 1 April 2014 but did not, section CZ 21B(4)(c) simultaneously overrides their previous FIF obligations in relation to the foreign superannuation interest. Example 19 Judy transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She did not include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003–04 income year, and did not pay tax in relation to her interest under the FIF rules. She decides to use the 15 percent option for her lump-sum transfer. She declares $22,500 (being 15 percent of $150,000) as income in her IR3 return for the 2014–15 income year. Judy will be liable for any penalties or use-of-money interest in relation to her 2014–15 tax return, not her 2004–05 tax return. Example 20 Catherine is a new migrant and became a New Zealand tax resident on 30 January 2002. Catherine transferred $150,000 from her foreign superannuation scheme to a New Zealand scheme in February 2004. She did not include this income in her IR3 return for the 2003–04 income year. She decides to use the law as it applied at the time that she made the withdrawal to calculate the tax on her lump-sum transfer. In her situation, her interest was not an interest in a FIF, and the majority of her $150,000 was a return of capital, and only $2,000 of the amount is income. She has her 2003– 04 IR3 return amended to include the $2,000. Catherine will be liable for penalties and use-of-money interest from the 2003–04 income year. Example 21 Albert migrated to New Zealand in 2008 with an interest in a New Zealand superannuation scheme. He became a New Zealand tax resident on 17 March 2008 and qualified as a transitional resident under section HR 8 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Under section HR 8, Albert is a transitional resident from 17 March 2008 until 31 March 2012. Certain foreign-sourced income derived during this time is exempt from New Zealand tax. Albert withdrew his foreign superannuation interest worth $100,000 on 1 September 2010. The $100,000 is received while Albert is a transitional resident, so he does not include it as income in his 2010–11 income tax return. As Albert correctly calculated that he had no New Zealand tax to pay, he is not required to do anything further.

Purpose The integrity of the New Zealand tax system is based on individuals and businesses meeting their tax obligations on time and in full. While a small minority wilfully abuse this responsibility, most are respectful and compliant. However, changes to tax policy over time have added to the effort and cost of complying and this has been a major political issue for businesses in particular. Consequently, when the present Government came into term, it set the goal of cutting the effort and cost of businesses dealing with government agencies, departments and ministries as one of its major priorities. Known as the Result Area 9 (R9) objective, this specifically aims to reduce the effort and cost that businesses incur in dealing with the public sector by 25% between 2012 and 2017. As Inland Revenue is one of the agencies that account for a significant component of the “cost of compliance”, this objective is of particular concern to the organisation. Against this background, Inland Revenue is conducting or involved in a number of research projects that are either monitoring the cost of compliance for businesses (eg, the 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey) or identifying opportunities to reduce these costs (eg, R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey). The results of the recent SME Cost of Compliance Survey point to the fact that approximately 16% of SMEs find the effort and cost of dealing with Inland Revenue “highly stressful”. With this in mind, the purpose of this qualitative study was to identify, from the perspective of small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), what practical steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce the effort and cost of compliance for these and other businesses. This involved, among other areas of investigation, identifying the particular situations or “pain points” that made dealing with Inland Revenue challenging and difficult. The qualitative study The qualitative study was undertaken in two stages during May and June 2014: 1. Stage 1 was exploratory in nature and aimed to generate practical suggestions that would make meeting SMEs’ taxation obligations and other compliance obligations easier (ie, require “less effort”). 2. Stage 2 focused on identifying which of the practical suggestions outlined in Stage 1 would deliver the most value to SMEs. Twenty-five SME business owners were carefully recruited from the study, based on the results of the 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey and the RA9 Longitudinal Panel Survey, with the emphasis placed on those who were “highly stressed”. These participants were interviewed in both stages of the study. The main findings 1. Confirming the results of earlier research, Inland Revenue was repeatedly listed as an agency requiring “a lot of effort” to deal with. 2. The following issues and situations were identified as those which made dealing with Inland Revenue difficult (ie, “pain points”):  making an incorrect payment  making a late payment  being significantly in arrears  being owed a refund  payments being made, but not registered by Inland Revenue  SMEs wishing to close down their company  Inland Revenue making changes to policy, to calculation rates, to the presentation of information it provides (eg, statements) or to the way SMEs prefer to deal with the agency (eg, the migration from paper to online environment). 2 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit 3. These pain points were exacerbated and made more difficult for SMEs as follows:  when they attempted to contact Inland Revenue and experienced access-related issues  the attitude, helpfulness and proactivity of Inland Revenue staff  difficulties experienced understanding both verbal and written communications  difficulties accessing and then understanding information, particularly on the Inland Revenue website  fairness-related issues and issues to do with the parity of the Inland Revenue-customer relationship. 4. Given these pain points, 44 practical ideas and suggestions were made that would alleviate the effort of dealing with Inland Revenue, with the overarching theme being a desire for Inland Revenue to become more “customer-oriented” and “customer-centric” 1 . These may be categorised under the following headings:  understanding the customer  improving access  improving communications  suggestions in relation to Inland Revenue staff  suggestions in relation to myIR  improving Inland Revenue’s website  authorising tax agents  Inland Revenue’s “value proposition”. 5. Twelve of the suggestions were frequently identified as “must haves” and are displayed in green in the figure overleaf. The yellow represents participants who considered the suggestions were “nice to have, but not essential”, while the gap represents participants who considered them as “not really of interest or use to me”. 1 Please refer to Appendix C for a full list of the suggestions and the issues and problems that gave rise to them. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 3 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 1: The Top 12 most “valued” suggestions 4 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit 6. The 12 main suggestions can be classified into the following themes: simplification, relationship/trust/ discretion and communication with experts. 7. One particular suggestion was identified as delivering the most “value” to SMEs more than any other; namely, “Inland Revenue should give customers a ‘high trust’ status if they have a good record which, in turn, allows Inland Revenue staff some discretion in dealing with these customers”. When participants were asked to explain this selection, the general comment they made was that this epitomised an organisation that was “customer-centric”, ie, it respected and valued its customers. More specifically, when they were asked how Inland Revenue would treat a “high trust” customer:  participants considered that Inland Revenue would basically give them the “benefit of the doubt” and provide them with some flexibility in the event that they had, for example, filed late or made an incorrect payment. Participants envisaged Inland Revenue viewing the customer’s filing and payment history, seeing that the current situation was out of the ordinary, contacting them to advise them of the situation and assisting them to address it  when participants were asked how customers would earn a “high trust” status, they considered that this would be on the basis that they had been compliant (ie, they had filed and made correct payments on time) for anywhere between one to ten years. 8. Other suggestions rated in the Top 12 included the following:  “Inland Revenue should use more simplified, ‘plain customer-speak’ in all written communications with me.” When participants were asked what more simplified, “plain customer-speak” written communications would look like, they referred to the communication getting straight to the point, using simple words, short sentences and fewer acronyms. Importantly, they described it as being less threatening and less arrogant in its tone.  “Inland Revenue needs to redesign its website so it is more intuitive to me.” When participants were asked what an intuitive Inland Revenue website would look like, they referred to a website that had a simple, clean looking home page, obvious “go-to” sections for particular types of customers and super-fast search functionality.  “I am able to directly contact ‘expert’ teams within Inland Revenue based on business size.” When participants were asked what it would be like contacting Inland Revenue with “expert teams” based on business size, they referred to the fact that they could easily access teams of staff who understood what it was like to be the owner of a small business, including the financial cost and time commitment required to be compliant with Inland Revenue and other government agencies.  “I am able to directly contact ‘expert’ teams within Inland Revenue based on tax type (eg, income tax, GST, FBT).” When participants were asked what it would be like contacting Inland Revenue with “expert teams” based on tax type, they imagined dealing with staff who could communicate with them in lay terms and provide them with a clear and unequivocal solution to any issue or problem they had. 9. Additional practical ideas and suggestions rated in the Top 12 were as follows:  “Inland Revenue should allow my tax agent to complete all transactions on my behalf, providing I have given the appropriate authority.” When participants were asked what it would be like if Inland Revenue allowed their tax agent to complete all transactions on their behalf, they imagined any issues or problems they had would be quickly and effectively resolved.  “Inland Revenue needs to offer a full online customer experience, so that I can do everything online if I choose to.” When participants were asked what it would be like if Inland Revenue offered a full online customer experience, they imagined that any business they wished to do involving Inland Revenue could be done online, rather than the current situation in which this is not entirely possible.  “Inland Revenue needs to hide or remove all outdated information on their website so that there is no confusion about what is current.” This was a “no-brainer” for participants who could not understand why Inland Revenue would want to have outdated information on its website, given that this had led them to make mistakes on some occasions or question the currency of information they were viewing, thereby leading to inaction.  “Inland Revenue needs to improve its website's search engine.” This was also a “no-brainer” for participants given the fact that many use Inland Revenue’s 5 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit website as an information website, as well as a transaction website.  “Inland Revenue should give its staff greater authority/delegation/discretionary power (eg, ability to override automatically generated letters).” This suggestion was perceived as enabling Inland Revenue staff to override Inland Revenue systems that were inappropriate given the circumstances, thereby also being more cost-effective for Inland Revenue. In part, this suggestion also relates to the suggestion that was most frequently identified as being valued; the “high trust” suggestion.  “I would like to receive text/email notifications advising me when I have not paid my tax.” This suggestion was seen as reflecting an organisation that is truly customer-centric.  “Inland Revenue needs to provide up-to-date calculators.” This suggestion relates to the earlier suggestion of ensuring all information on the Inland Revenue website is current. Conclusions and recommendations While the original 44 practical ideas and solutions would involve Inland Revenue both simplifying and making changes to policies, systems and processes, the Top 12 suggestions predominantly involve change. While these changes may not currently fit into Inland Revenue’s current business plans and/or require significant investment, it should be remembered that, as far as participants are concerned, the suggestions they made were reasonable rather than unrealistic suggestions. Importantly, they reflect a standard of customer service that they have already experienced with some government agencies, departments and ministries (eg, New Zealand transport Agency), as well as private sector organisations in general (eg, banks). In other words, they are a benchmark that they ideally would like Inland Revenue to meet. Two recommendations for further research result from the current study: 1. Given that this study was conducted on a qualitative basis, with a non-representative sample of SMEs (ie, the emphasis was deliberately placed on those who were “highly stressed”), the practical ideas and suggestions appearing in the Top 12 need to be regarded as indicative rather than conclusive, and that the original 44 suggestions are all important to consider given how they were initially identified. Therefore, quantifying the results of this qualitative study is recommended. Quantification would allow the results to be examined across a representative sample of SMEs, as well as allow the segmentation referred to in this report to be verified. This segmentation recognises that certain practical suggestions may be of more “value” to some SMEs than others. 2. The focus groups were a reminder of the important dependency that some SMEs have on their accountant or tax agent. Therefore, we recommend the equivalent of this qualitative study is completed with accountants and tax agents who primarily provide taxation services to SMEs. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 6 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 1. Purpose, objective and methods In this section of our report we outline the purpose, objectives and the methodology used to complete this study, beginning with a brief overview of the background relevant to the project. Background Result Area 9 (R9) aims to reduce the cost of businesses dealing with government agencies by 25% between 2012 and 2017. As Inland Revenue is one of the agencies that accounts for much of the dealings that businesses have with the public sector, Inland Revenue is conducting or is involved in a number of research projects that are either monitoring the cost of compliance for businesses (eg, 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey) or identifying opportunities to reduce these costs (eg, RA9 Longitudinal Panel Survey). Purpose and objectives The study that is the subject of this report (ie, the SME Tax Compliance Qualitative Project) is a further project relating to the achievement of R9. The purpose of this study was to identify, from the perspective of small and medium sized businesses (SMEs), what practical steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce the effort and cost of compliance for businesses. This included, not only identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take internally, but also identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take with other government agencies given their dealings with businesses. To identify these practical steps, this research had the following information objectives: 1. To provide an understanding of how businesses currently approach the task of meeting their taxation obligations, as well as their other compliance obligations. 2. To identify the specific “pain points” for businesses when dealing with Inland Revenue and other government agencies—the one-offs (eg, registration) as well as the ongoing or recurring (eg, taxation-related) 3. To provide an understanding of why these are pain points for businesses 4. To collect, for consideration, any ideas or suggestions that businesses have that would make meeting their taxation obligations easier (eg, simplifying, changing and/or eliminating processes), as well as their other compliance obligations 5. To establish businesses’ reactions to ideas generated by previous research (eg, the Maven research funded by MBIE). Methodology To meet these information objectives, the research was completed on a qualitative basis and conducted in two stages: 1. Stage 1 was exploratory in nature and aimed to generate practical suggestions that would make meeting SMEs’ taxation obligations and other compliance obligations easier (ie, require “less effort”) (points 1 to 4 on page 5 of this report). 2. Stage 2 focused on identifying which of the practical suggestions outlined in Stage 1 that would deliver the most value to SMEs (points 4 and 5 on page 2 of this report). Stage 1 Four focus groups were completed in Auckland (two) and Wellington (two) between 30 April and 7 May 2014, involving a total of 25 participants. Because of the interest in identifying what SME business owners felt were the practical steps that Inland Revenue could take to reduce owners’ effort in meeting their tax obligations and dealing with Inland Revenue, participants in the focus groups were recruited on the basis of either the time spent on tax-related matters or on the basis of the stress that this created for them. Furthermore, the emphasis was placed on those owners who considered themselves to be highly stressed. Two of the focus groups were recruited on this basis, with one comprising small businesses with either zero or up 7 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit to 19 employees and the other with 20 or more employees. The other two focus groups were recruited on the basis that they considered themselves to have low or moderate levels of stress and would therefore provide a comparative viewpoint, as well as an appreciation of what they had done to make their tax obligations manageable. Therefore, one of these was recruited on the basis that it spent an above average number of hours on meeting their business's tax obligations, while the other was recruited on the basis that it spent a low to moderate number of hours. All participants were the owners or part-owners of SME enterprises who identified themselves as the person mostly responsible for tax matters for that business (although this does not necessarily mean they personally had day-to-day responsibility, ie, they actually calculated the tax, filed or made the payments). The focus groups lasted between 75 and 90 minutes and were facilitated by two members of the research team. Given the work commitments of participants, three of the focus groups were arranged as breakfast sessions and one as a lunchtime session. It is important to note that, at the time participants were recruited, they were told their focus group would last 60 minutes. The fact that all focus groups ran significantly over this time is a reflection of the amount of discussion that characterised each group. Many participants described their focus group as a liberating or therapeutic session. Participants were recruited from the panel established for the R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey. At the time of recruitment, qualifying questions were asked to verify the characteristics of each and every participant against the recruitment criteria. Table 1 shows the number of participants for each of the four focus groups.

A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 8 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Stage 2 Participants who attended the first round of focus groups were also asked to participate in a second round of focus groups. Twenty-one of the 25 participants who were involved in the first stage attended these focus groups. Between the two rounds of research, the practical ideas and suggestions generated as a result of the first stage were reviewed by Inland Revenue, resulting in 44 suggestions being taken into Stage 2. Four focus groups were completed for this second stage, in Auckland (two) and Wellington (two), between 10 June and 18 June 2014. A copy of the interview guide used in this stage can be found in Appendix B. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 9 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Section 2. Detailed results To reiterate, the purpose of Stage 1 was to explore the dealings SMEs have with Inland Revenue and other government agencies, as well as to generate practical ideas and suggestions that would make meeting their taxation obligations and other compliance obligations easier (ie, require “less effort”). To do this, the focus groups were conducted as follows: 1. Participants were first asked for their general views about the effort involved in dealing with government agencies. 2. Once their general views had been collected, participants were asked to describe and rate the level of effort required on their part to deal with Inland Revenue and other government agencies. 3. Participants were then asked to explain the reasons why they felt it took “a lot of effort” to deal with Inland Revenue. 4. To conclude the discussion, participants were asked to provide any practical ideas and suggestions they could think of that would help make dealing with Inland Revenue easier. The following sub-sections outline the research results to Stage 1. A SME-derived definition of “effort” in the context of dealing with government agencies Irrespective of the characteristics of the focus group (ie, irrespective of whether the group was a “highly stressed” group or one that had low to moderate stress), when the discussion about the effort of dealing with government agencies commenced, the discussion typically centred on: 1. the emotional stress and frustration of doing so Interviewer: So when we talk about stress, what is it? Frustration. Absolute frustration. Frustration. 2. (to a lesser extent) the time and process involved in (unnecessarily) dealing with government departments. I think of it as a time issue. To be fair it’s not really me who spends the time, but we have a finance manager who spends a good chunk of her time ensuring that we meet all of our IRD compliance obligations. In comparison, the discussion hardly ever focused on the direct or indirect financial costs of dealing with government departments (ie, the cost of the time spent by staff or the cost of employing accountants or tax agents), or the cost of the lost opportunities of doing so. Government departments requiring “a lot of effort” Again, irrespective of the characteristics of the focus group and without hesitation, participants in all focus groups listed Inland Revenue as one of the government departments they had recently dealt with that required “a lot of effort”. Note the frequency with which Inland Revenue was mentioned in this regard, in comparison to other government departments, in Table 2. At the other extreme, the New Zealand Transport Agency (NZTA) was the government department that participants had recently dealt with that was most frequently listed as requiring “not much effort”. Care must be taken when interpreting these results, given that a small number of carefully selected participants were involved in this qualitative study. At best, the results are indicative rather than conclusive and would need to be verified by benchmarking against other quantitatively based research. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 10 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Table 2: Level of stress dealing with government departments Level of stress Not much effort Moderate effort A lot of effort Inland Revenue 5 8 12 ACC 10 11 4 Customs 3 0 2 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment 6 5 2 Statistics New Zealand 4 6 2 New Zealand Transport Agency 10 2 1 Department of Internal Affairs 2 2 0 Ministry for Primary Industries 3 0 0 New Zealand Trade and Enterprise 0 1 0 Other central government agencies 2 0 2 Local government 2 5 6 Other 0 0 0 Note: This table contains frequencies. Importantly, note that participants listed some agencies, departments and ministries as requiring both “a lot of effort” and “not much effort”. This applied, for example, to Inland Revenue and ACC. When asked to clarify why this was the case, it became clear that: 1. the government department would be listed as requiring “not much effort” to deal with when the reason for the interaction was “business as usual” and there were no related issues or problems My business is at the stage where everything ticks over and runs itself. There aren’t any changes to my employees’ wages as it’s the standard 40 hours per week, so I don’t really run into any problems. 2. on the other hand, the government department would be listed as requiring “a lot of effort” to deal with primarily when the reason for the interaction related to an issue or problem (see “pain points” section below). Only if you change anything. If you change \[the\] wages \[...\], or if they (IR) change what they want, the student loan or child support, or whatever, then you’ve got problems. If you don’t change anything and they don’t change anything, then it’s fine. But as soon as you have a difference there just seems to be a major \[problem\] and that seems to take months. We’re at that level \[a 1 out of 10 effort rating\] because we don’t have problems. I do concur though, that if you \[...\] have a problem and you have to ring them up, then your problems start. Why does dealing with Inland Revenue require “a lot of effort”? (“pain points”) A thorough investigation of participants’ dealings and interactions with Inland Revenue was completed as part of discussion during the focus groups. This enabled the clear identification of their “pain points” or the events and situations which give rise to their dealings and interactions with Inland Revenue being stressful and frustrating. Overall, the process of calculating, filing and paying tax was not difficult or problematic for participants when this occurred correctly and in a timely fashion. This was especially the case for those participants who used proprietary software packages and/or were assisted by an accountant or tax agent. However, major “pain points” arose when this process or stages in the process did not occur correctly or in a timely fashion and participants dealt and interacted with Inland Revenue as a result of: 1. having made an incorrect payment (ie, paid less tax than they should have, perhaps because tax codes had changed and they were not aware of the changes, or simply because they had make an incorrect calculation) It’s either easy or it gets very difficult, very quickly, if you have to deal with an exception, or you get a letter six weeks later for a mistake that happened last cycle. So you have to go back and dig all the stuff out blah blah blah and that’s a hassle. 11 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit 2. having made a late payment (and were therefore being charged interest based on the time that had elapsed between when the tax was due and when they paid) Last year was just a disaster, I was late sending in my return. \[I was charged\] $600 or something for provisional tax that was not paid on time because I had use of their money. Well actually I hadn’t filed the return, so I didn’t have use of their money because I didn’t think I had anything to pay because it was a new company, we’d just opened. It had only been open for two months and I’m suddenly due for provisional in advance, which we didn’t know we were going to earn because we didn’t have the company. I’m thinking, hello! I said to my husband, look I’m just paying it, I’m not going to worry about the $600, because it’s just too stressful. They want it that’s fine, give it to them. But it was so annoying that, as a new company, we didn’t know it was going to be due for it, I was late returning it. 3. being significantly in arrears (as a result of having made incorrect, late or no payments and were therefore being charged interest as well as the tax owed) One of our employees has got tax arrears and he’s on a payment plan. Now we as a company screwed up, we missed one of those payments. We did it out of his pay, but we forgot to pay Inland Revenue. His entire accounts were frozen within a matter of a day, I think. He was in the process of looking at buying a house and everything was completely frozen and that was that. It took us several days to sort this out with Inland Revenue. It was our cock-up, not his. Why is he being punished for starters, secondly, why was there not a simple phone call, you know, “you’ve missed a payment”? Seeing that you’ve made all these other payments, you’ve missed one payment, what’s the story? But, they were flexing their muscles, making an example and wallop. I just recently got involved with consulting on a business that’s in a lot of trouble due to staff incompetence and possibly theft. Trying to deal with IRD, because these people got into arrears with GST, etc. I’ve found the whole thing absolutely quite horrible. There doesn’t seem to be any specific group that actually targets businesses in trouble to in actual fact assist them a lot more. Because you know when a business gets into the crap, as we all know, there’s a lot of areas that add to that stress, like with being in arrears and all of that sort of carry on. I don’t think that the \[staff\], as much as I think that they’re empathetic in some regards, I don’t think that they’re actually qualified or skilled enough to actually offer the proper assistance that’s needed. 4. being owed a refund (ie, filed for a refund with long stand-down periods and no notification as to when it will be received). The Government doesn’t want to part with the money, so the Government sits on it for 10 weeks. Meanwhile you’re stressing because you’re owed a 20 grand refund because you’ve overpaid prov. tax, you thought you were going to have a better year than you did. You need that 20 grand because you’re in overdraft. They won’t release it. The thing is that they will tell you 10 weeks and if you’re not vigilant, they won’t do anything after 10 weeks. A number of other events or situations also caused stress and frustration, including when: 1. payments are made, but not registered by Inland Revenue I sent a cheque the other day for our PAYE and then got a note saying that it hadn’t been allocated. They’d banked the cheque. But it was attached to the allocation form. I mean how can you just detach something, bank it and not action the piece of paper that went with it? 2. SME owners wish to close down their company We’re currently winding up the company and dealing with IRD because we have a GST problem, we didn’t get enough money from the sale, so that’s an interesting circumstance, the penalty tax keeps going up each day and I’m saying, well good who’s going to pay that? When you’re winding up a company, or a partnership, or something like that, they stuff it up every time. Their error rate is 100 percent and has been over the last three years. I mean because I have bands and partnerships of groups of musicians that come and go all the time, so I’m forever winding up companies and winding 12 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit up partnerships. They have never got one right in three years. 3. Inland Revenue makes changes to policy, to calculation rates, to the presentation of information it provides (eg, statements) or to the way SMEs prefer to deal with the agency (eg, the migration from paper to online environment). IR need to reverse their policy of not sending anything out. Their attitude right now is if you want an IR10 or something like that, “oh just download it”. Not everyone has got a printer and why should I use my printer ink to download heaps and heaps and heaps of paperwork that they used to send out. The Government made a very big point about making things simpler for us, so now the IRD has reversed that by not sending out information. In addition, dealing with certain tax types was considered to cause more issues and problems than other tax types. In this regard and with some regularity, participants mentioned child support, KiwiSaver and PAYE as the tax types that were especially problematic for them. Well \[...\] when it comes to ECST, they didn’t explain exactly what we had to do in the first place and we spent a year doing it wrong, and now it’s taken us a year to sort it out. We have child support for some of our staff. I mean like this week is a classic, I’ve had three letters and one phone call with three different amounts. Many participants were incensed by their issues and problems with these tax types, given that they saw themselves collecting these taxes on behalf of Inland Revenue for the government, with no real benefit or recompense to themselves. Yes, because you’ve got so much compliance that we have to do now that you’ve got KiwiSaver, you’ve got student loans and if anyone owes child support, etc. The amount of work that we have to do personally in order to comply is just ridiculous. The onus isn’t on the person that’s actually at fault, or in arrears, or whatever. We essentially work for the Crown basically. If you pay GST you work for the Crown. Yes, I think that’s the nub of it is that we become agents of IRD, unpaid agents of IRD. By way of summary, Table 3 summarises the extent to which certain tax types/matters were considered to create issues and problems for participants, and shows the frequency with which certain events and situations were identified as “pain points”. Once again, care must be taken when interpreting these results. The results are indicative rather than conclusive and would need to be verified by benchmarking against quantitative research.

A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 13 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit What makes SMEs different in terms of their attitudes to dealing with government departments? Both the 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey and the R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey contain results which show that SMEs differ on the basis of the level of stress and/or hours they spend meeting their tax obligations and dealing and interacting with Inland Revenue. As explained earlier, it is on the basis of these differences that participants were recruited for the focus groups. As a result of the discussion during the focus groups we believe we have an enhanced understanding of the reasons for these differences and it is possible to group SMEs into distinct segments. We believe the two key dimensions which account for the differences between SMEs are as follows: 1. the sophistication of SMEs’ accounting and payroll methods and/or systems, which is a reflection of and/or manifests itself in terms of their financial literacy and, therefore, their knowledge and level of confidence with taxation matters, including whether they have and make use of a myIR account and how they use accountants and tax agents 2. the complexity and/or variability of their business and the impact this has in terms of their taxation obligations. In this regard, the size of the business appears to be an important discriminating factor in many, although not all cases (ie, there are exceptions). For example, a small business that has a stable level of business will likely have relatively simple taxation obligations, as well as being able to meet them easily because they change minimally between taxation periods. In contrast, a larger business and particularly one that experiences reasonably significant changes in terms of revenue flows (debtors), expenses (creditors) and resource use (eg, staff) will potentially have complex taxation obligations to meet and have difficulty meeting them. By cross-referencing these two dimensions, four segments are created and these are shown in Figure 2. Based on the focus group discussion, participants who regarded dealing with Inland Revenue as stressful and frustrating are more likely to be found in the bottom left-hand segment; that is, their level of sophistication is low and they have a complex and/or a changeable business situation. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 14 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 2: Segmentation High Low Low High Sophistication of accounting and payroll systems/processes Complexity/variability of their business Participants in this segment experienced the least “pain” Participants in this segment experienced the most ”pain” A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 15 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Figure 3 presents personas to enable the reader of this report to “visualise” the types of SMEs likely to be found in the two extreme segments of this segmentation. It is important to note that these are illustrative only and that there will therefore be exceptions. For example, not all tradespeople will be found in the segment experiencing the “most pain”. Figure 3: Personas of participants who experienced the “most” and “least” pain Participants experiencing the “least” pain -Highly sophisticated accounting and payroll systems/processes -Stable business Characteristics: Small and medium sized businesses that are well-established (ie, have been operating for five or more years). They tend to employ someone in-house to deal with the accounts and payroll administration. They use external accountant services when required. For example: professional firms (eg, lawyers) software developers larger retailers. Participants experiencing the “most” pain Unsophisticated accounting and payroll system/processes Highly variable business Characteristics: Self-employed people or small businesses who typically do their “own books” and have little time to do so. They have limited understanding of their compliance obligations and find it difficult to keep up with policy changes. They like to keep their accounting and payroll methods simple (eg, use a spreadsheet or analysis book). They tend to go through (or be going through) periods of change (eg, start-up businesses, businesses winding down, businesses that experience seasonal fluctuations in turnover and staff). For example: small restaurant/café owners tradespeople smaller retailers. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 16 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit It is also important to note that the segment in which a SME might be placed (and, therefore, their position in the figure) will reflect their current situation, ie, it is possible that a SME may, over time, move between segments. In fact, it is clear from the discussion during the focus groups that, as a result of some of the contact and interaction that some participants have had with Inland Revenue, they have moved into the top right-hand segment. That is, they have taken steps to reduce their stress and frustration by purchasing proprietary software packages and/or made greater use of their accountant or tax agent. Well I think the other thing is that you use accountants, the accountant acts also as a buffer for you at the end of the day if a situation becomes quite complicated, I’ve always found it’s easier to say to them, “right you need to sort that out and get back to me”. They seem to make faster tracks in with the IRD in dealing with things than if I try to do it personally. So hence, why, I would prefer to always go through the accountants. I prefer sometimes just to email my accountant, or ring my accountant and say what’s the answer to this, rather than you know, even if they sent me a bill for quarter of an hour, or whatever, or add it to the yearly bill, I don’t mind, because then I know. Sort of, I trust them, as the book of knowledge for Inland Revenue, rather than me sitting on the phone just to answer a simple question. Some practical suggestions that would relieve the effort required to deal with Inland Revenue Having identified the events and situations that resulted in the most stress and frustration for participants, a considerable part of the discussion was devoted to discussing what practical steps Inland Revenue could take that would ease the effort that participants felt was involved in dealing with the agency. In the first instance, the practical changes that participants suggested have been categorised between:  those that relate to “high-level” issues or problems, and  those that relate to truly practical issues or problems. “High-level” issues The over-arching issue or problem that participants repeatedly mentioned in the focus groups, which in their opinion made it difficult to deal and interact with Inland Revenue, was the fact that Inland Revenue is not “customer-oriented”. There’s nothing personal about it. You’re fighting a machine at all times. You might have a voice on the other end, but you’re fighting a machine. You are guilty until proven innocent at all times. There’s no comment, or anything that’s personal about it. The first thing about customer service is to be one on one with your client. Like it’s interesting at the start where you said that you’re doing \[research\] for the “customers”. When you ring Inland Revenue they don’t treat you like a customer, they treat you like criminals. Therefore, participants suggested that Inland Revenue needed to become customer-centric, and that it needed to “change its culture” to do so. Well there has to be a way that they can be seen to be more user friendly, more advisory as opposed to adversary. Inland Revenue’s lack of customer-orientation under- pinned all the practical issues or problems that participants identified in the focus groups. Therefore, the following practical ideas and suggestions for change reflect an organisation that has experienced a culture change and is truly customer-centric. Practical issues In this subsection of the report, we list each issue or problem identified by participants when dealing with Inland Revenue and the practical ideas and suggestions for change they provided that would, in their opinion, alleviate the issue or problem. These need to be considered in relation to the events and situations (“pain points”) listed earlier in this report as occurring, which resulted in participants’ dealings and interactions with Inland Revenue being stressful and frustrating. The table in Appendix C provides a quick reference guide to the practical ideas that were suggested by participants in the focus groups. Note that the table identifies the issue or problem (first column), lists the related practical suggestion as identified by participants (second column) and then classifies the suggestion as 17 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit involving simplification (S), change (C) or elimination (E). The fourth column indicates if the same suggestion was also made in the Maven research. 1. Access-related issues or problems Specific issue: Difficulty accessing Inland Revenue by telephone due, for example, to call centre operating hours; difficulty accessing Inland Revenue by telephone during heavy traffic periods; and being shifted from “pillar to post”. Access issues are complicated by a “frustrating call-back system”.  Suggested practical change: Extend operating hours for call centre; employ more call centre operators during heavy traffic periods; allow customers to call-back using cell phones; and have a Customer Management System (CMS) that contains real-time information on recent contact history and other significant issues (eg, taxed owed). Specific issue: Customers not being able to access their complete history with Inland Revenue, centrally from one source and, in turn, their forward tax obligations.  Suggested practical change: Expand myIR to show historical interactions and transactions; link myIR to CMS; and provide customers with a calendar showing their tax obligations for the year; and provide customers with the status of all their relevant tax types. 2. Staff-related issues or problems Specific issue: Inland Revenue staffs’ apparent lack of knowledge/expertise and, therefore, their inability to provide effective solutions in a timely manner, and their tendency to provide different or mixed messages/information. Complicating this is the fact that staff do not have the complete customer picture.  Suggested practical change: Inland Revenue staff training that focuses on understanding and meeting the needs and expectations of customers (ie, an “outside-in” approach); creating “expert teams” or account managers dedicated to businesses of different sizes, including being able to email a named person); and providing a CMS to Inland Revenue staff so they have a complete picture of the customer’s situation. Specific issue: Inland Revenue staffs’ apparent lack of proactivity.  Suggested practical change: Inland Revenue staff training that encourages them to focus on encouraging and enabling compliance rather than being reactive and punitive; staff training that encourages staff to identify potential issues and problems for customers and contacting them accordingly to assist in their resolution; an improved notification system that alerts staff to potential issues and problems for customers; and an improved notification system that enables staff to manage customers’ expectations (eg, in relation to when refunds can be expected). Specific issue: Inland Revenue staffs’ apparent lack of empathy.  Suggested practical change: Change Inland Revenue staff recruitment policies to employ persons with excellent customer service skills; set expectations of high customer service at Inland Revenue staff training; and adopt a policy of rewarding Inland Revenue staff who demonstrate excellent customer service. Specific issue: Inland Revenue staff appear to “hide” behind legislation/policy, and presume that customers are guilty rather than innocent.  Suggested practical change: Inland Revenue staff are empowered to make decisions rather than use legislation/policy as an excuse not to do so; Inland Revenue staff become more accountable for their actions; Inland Revenue staff are given training on the legislation/policy so they understand in which situations they can provide a degree of flexibility to the customer; and Inland Revenue provides customers with a “high trust” status if they have a clean history and record. 3. Communications-related issues and problems Specific issue: Inland Revenue staff use Inland Revenue- speak in their verbal discussions with customers, making it difficult for them to understand.  Suggested practical change: Inland Revenue staff are trained to use “customer-speak” and lay terms in all their verbal communications with customers. Specific issue: Paper statements are difficult to understand.  Suggested practical change: Simplify the language and structure of statements so they can be understood from a customer perspective; and use devices such as a “key” to aid comprehension. Specific issue: Too many (automated) letters are sent; letters are contradictory; information in letters is inconsistent with the advice provided by staff; letters are generally difficult to understand, impersonal and in the extreme, meaningless.  Suggested practical change: Simplify the language used in letters so they can be understood from a customer perspective; provide customers with the ability to select channels by which they receive notifications; make better/greater use of myIR as an information provision tool; use CMS to provide staff with a complete picture of the customer’s situation; and allow staff to have greater manual control over the automation of letters (so they can override them as necessary). Specific issue: Complications arising between Inland Revenue, the customer and the customer’s tax agent, 18 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit despite the customer giving their tax agent authority to act on their behalf.  Suggested practical change: Establish protocols for tax agents to communicate with Inland Revenue on behalf of customers; and allow tax agents with greater authority to act on behalf of their customer, providing the customer has given their consent. Specific issue: Difficulties using Inland Revenue’s website, arising from an overload of information on the website; poor, fragmented structure and search functionality resulting in navigation issues. A number of specific issues relate to tax forms; namely, customers being able to easily find them, know they are current, being able to work on multiple forms and correctly save the information they record on forms.  Suggested practical change: The website needs to have a more intuitive, customer-oriented structure; provide only current information, but if this is not possible, date stamp, dated information; provide all information on one page rather than across a number of different locations; have a smarter search engine, possibly facilitated through the use of indexes; and have forms designed for use from the customer perspective. Specific issue: Individual customers having to use multiple myIR logins for multiple entities.  Suggested practical change: Allow multiple entities to be managed through one myIR account. Specific issue: Lack of complete online experience (eg, FBT filing is still completed on paper with a reference number; questions cannot always be answered online and as a result, customers revert to the telephone).  Suggested practical change: Move to a complete online customer experience with Inland Revenue (ie, enable all returns to be completed and filed online with no need for paper; and all related communications online); and implement a Q&A online service that can help customers resolve issues and problems they might have (eg, a live chat service). Specific issue: Customers’ lack of knowledge of Inland Revenue services (eg, myIR).  Suggested practical change: Promote Inland Revenue’s services for customers (eg, myIR, notifications, secure email service, statement stopper); and provide more online tutorials and/or make those available more visible. Specific issue: Customers’ lack of awareness/knowledge of policy and legislation changes leads to errors/mistakes.  Suggested practical change: Provide easily found templates and up-to-date calculators on Inland Revenue’s website; for smaller SMEs (eg, turnover under $500,000), provide a free, downloadable accounting/payroll software package that automatically updates as changes are made (eg, to enable correct new ESCT calculations); provide more visible links to established payroll providers; and employ targeted communications to those affected by change, while also providing them with additional support. 4. Parity and fairness-related issues Specific issue: In general, there is a power imbalance, with the “rules” for businesses appearing much harsher and less flexible than those for Inland Revenue (eg, in terms of timeframes; and interest on refunds versus interest on penalties).  Suggested practical change: Overall a culture change is required, but in the interim, a change in policies and practices is suggested (so that customers are alerted if there appears to be a problem and they are given the benefit of the doubt before being penalised; they are notified as to when their refunds will be paid and when they have been paid; and interest is paid on delayed refunds); and a change in the tone of communications is suggested (ie, less authoritative and draconian). Specific issue: Employers are doing the government’s/ Inland Revenue’s work (eg, managing student loans, child support and KiwiSaver and are generally expected to take all the responsibility, with no benefit or gain).  Suggested practical change: Eliminate employer responsibilities or pay/reward them for managing non-business-related tasks. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 19 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Detailed findings: Stage 2 The purpose of Stage 2 was to identify which of the practical ideas and suggestions provided by participants in Stage 1 would deliver the most value to SMEs. To do this, a refined list of 44 practical suggestions was developed in consultation with Inland Revenue. At a high level, these covered the following areas:  understanding the customer  improving access  improving communications  suggestions in relation to Inland Revenue staff  suggestions in relation to myIR  improving Inland Revenue’s website  authorising tax agents  Inland Revenue’s “value proposition”. The 44 practical ideas and suggestions may be viewed in Appendix D. To identify the suggestions that would deliver the most value, the focus groups progressed as follows: 1. By way of introduction and to provide context, participants were told that a key theme resulting from the first stage of research was a desire for Inland Revenue to be more “customer-oriented”. They were then asked to imagine a changed Inland Revenue and invited to describe what the “customer-centric” agency would look and feel like to interact with. 2. Participants were then presented with the 44 ideas and suggestions and invited to “prioritise” or “rate” them as a “must have”, “nice to have, but not essential” or “not really of interest or use to me”. When this task was completed, participants were invited to explain the suggestions they had prioritised as “must haves”, as well as the underlying themes that these represented. A “customer-centric” Inland Revenue Not surprisingly, the responses to the general discussion about a changed, “customer-centric” Inland Revenue echoed the sentiments uncovered during the first stage. Participants referred to an Inland Revenue that:  understood and had a complete and current view of the customer  reflected this with a website that was customer- oriented in terms of information provision and particularly its search functionality  enabled customers or their nominated tax agent to have full access to Inland Revenue, at times and through channels that suited them  provided customers with a full, online experience for those who wished to interact electronically  had staff who communicated both verbally and in written terms in “customer-speak”, on a proactive and empathetic basis. Overall, participants viewed a changed, “customer- centric” Inland Revenue as delivering true “value” to SMEs and drew comparisons with some other government agencies, departments and ministries (eg, ACC) or private sector organisations such as banks and suppliers (eg, trades suppliers). ACC, they are pleasant for a start off. Pleasant and polite. I’m not pushed around. They come across as actually caring about what you are saying. They understand what you are ringing about. IRD have no idea what we are talking about. I must admit I’ve found ACC really good. Every year when I ring up and say, look can we spread the payments out over three months? And they say “yes, interest-free over three months, not a problem, I will send you a schedule”. They never say the payments start from this month; it always starts the next month. They never expect 20 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit it in like two days’ time. And they are pretty quick, within a week your payment schedule is there. Closest example of a government department that is easy to work with is the Companies Office. If you have a problem with renewing your company or you have a question, all you have to do now is ring them up and a) you get through to someone straight away, b) you speak to someone who is educated, who speaks English, who speaks to you without being patronising and, c) gets the question resolved within usually 2 to 3 minutes. I have found them extremely helpful. Of course it’s a lot simpler than what you are doing with the IRD but there is an attitude that “we are here to help you”. If the customer needs educating they will educate them. They are the total opposite of IRD. The Auckland Council. Front line person has all the information in front of them. You can go to the website if you wish but they don’t push you in that direction. They also give a reference number and people come back to you. Then they have people ring up a week later asking about the service you received. There should be more data. Information on what you have been talking about. When you ring an IT company, you get a case number. The number brings up all of the data \[history\]. Our suppliers are great, they are to the point and concise. The bigger the organisation then the harder it is to get that point across simply. My best dealings have been with insurance companies and I think Vodafone, as long as you get a local call centre. In our game, if we are getting information about price increases and that sort of thing, the likes of Mega or whoever it be, a lot of those guys come through our industry so it is written without the flowery words. Prices are going up and here is the date. If there is a reason, they put the reason. Simple. If it was written by the lawyer of that company we would probably have three pages explaining all the overseas ramifications of why the price of steel went up, instead of just telling us here it is, simple words, we don’t need the other rubbish that goes with it. Top 12 practical suggestions Participants varied significantly in terms of the practical ideas and suggestions they identified as “must haves”, with some participants identifying no more than about 12 suggestions at one extreme, while other participants identified as many as 25 suggestions at the other extreme. The full results for the 44 suggestions can be found in descending order in Appendix E and by theme in Appendix F. Following the completion of the focus groups, the Top 12 suggestions that were most frequently selected as “must haves” were identified and categorised into the overarching themes that emerged in Stage 1, namely: 1. simplification 2. relationships/trusts/discretion 3. communication with experts. Simplification Staff communicate both verbally and in written terms in “customer-speak”, on a proactive and empathetic basis. Inland Revenue should use more simplified, 'plain customer-speak' in all written communications with me. When participants were asked what more simplified, “plain customer-speak” written communications would look like, they referred to the communication getting straight to the point, using simple words, short sentences and fewer acronyms. Importantly, they described it as being less threatening and less arrogant in its tone. It means they trust you, so when you ring IR don’t treat you like you have just robbed the Bank in England. They are actually nice to you over the phone and they have more flexibility to say “yes” to things. Cut out the rubbish stuff and write it as people talk. Write it is as we would talk it, not with all the bloody crap words that come into it. A lot of IR’s stuff of course is written for them by lawyers so you start to get a bit of lawyer speak come into it. Then you send it out to some bloke who has just started out in business and he has finished his apprenticeship, he may be a brilliant builder or chippie or whatever, but he needs stuff to come in the same language as he talks. Not in legal speak. Because when you start to do that, he gets the fear that he’s meant to somehow go and get a lawyer or someone else to actually understand it and reply back. Whereas, in fact he 21 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit doesn’t. If it was written in normal plain English he could understand it and work with it. When IR send you a letter or talk to you they will use all of these in-house words. Often I have to pull them up and ask them what something means in English, everyday language, so that I know what they are talking about. And that’s the problem. A lot of communications come and by the time you are down to the third paragraph, I don’t know about you fellas, but you are sick of reading it so you don’t worry about it. First thing is you discover, I don’t actually owe them any money, I’ve actually just put it in the wrong column, bugger that I can’t understand it. Chuck it on the desk and leave it. Everything is in abbreviations these days. You can sometimes get things totally wrong from reading abbreviations or IR will say, for example, what TAA means on the first page and then you might see it again three pages later and you have to go right back to see what it means. It means heaps to them but means sweet “eff a” to me. My wife was upset by the tone of the letter and the aggressiveness of the letter. Which just said “you must pay up” but it was really, really aggressive. Reflect this with a website that is customer-oriented in terms of information provision and particularly its search functionality. Graphically speaking the website is confused, there’s so much information on it, you’ve got to sit down and read the bloody thing just to find what you are looking for. Your eyes first look at the picture. And then you have to spend quite some time to find the little PAYE text down the bottom. The website has become very “top heavy”, for example when you look up an IR10A, profit loss form, 5 pages of stuff comes up. It’s become \[unwieldy\]. They should build another website alongside the current one and then one day get rid of it. “Inland Revenue needs to improve its website’s search engine.” This was also a “no-brainer” for participants given the fact that many use Inland Revenue’s website as an information website, as well as a transaction website. I would like information on the IRD website, in canonical form, like gospel according to IRD, with the rules and things like what accountancy rules apply. You don’t know what information is up-to- date. I would like the information in a structure so you can exactly see what the rules are without having to go through month-to-month finding out all of that. “Inland Revenue needs to redesign its website so it is more intuitive to me.” When participants were asked what an intuitive Inland Revenue website would look like, they referred to a website that had a simple, clean- looking home page, obvious “go-to” sections for particular types of customers and super-fast search functionality. My experience with the IR website is that you seem to go here, there and everywhere. And it’s not that clear that you’ve got the latest information. There’s so much information on there. If you are not an expert in tax, it needs to guide you where to go. “Inland Revenue needs to hide or remove all outdated information on their website so that there is no confusion about what is current.” This was a “no- brainer” for participants who could not understand why Inland Revenue would want to have outdated information on its website, given that this had led them to make mistakes on some occasions or question the currency of information they were viewing, thereby leading to inaction. It’s just a bizarre thing to have dated information on a website. It’s just crazy. I don’t think my clients would like me to have outdated information on my website so why would IR be different? Before I even go onto the website I’ve got this sort of mental picture of what it looks like and I think, oh god here we go. It’s like I’ve got to go to Google first and search for a question about tax, and let Google search IR’s website, rather than me go to their website and search. So the search engine through Google is more powerful than theirs.” The key is to be able to find what you want, which for me, is search engine driven. The actual 22 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit intuitiveness of the website doesn’t really matter if you have a good search engine. “I would like to receive text/email notifications advising me of when I have not paid my tax.” This suggestion was seen as reflecting an organisation that is truly customer- centric. Text/email notifications are all basics that should be doable and would make life easy. I want confirmation that I have done something and if I’ve done it right. “Inland Revenue needs to offer a full online customer experience, so that I can do everything online if I choose to.” When participants were asked what it would be like if Inland Revenue offered a full online customer experience, they imagined that any business they wished to do involving Inland Revenue could be done online, rather than the current situation in which this is not entirely possible. I don’t like paper, I don’t like the statements and things coming through. If I could just know it is all there online and it’s easy, then I’d definitely do it like that. Inland Revenue needs to provide up-to-date calculators.” This suggestion relates to the earlier suggestion of ensuring all information on Inland Revenue’s website is current. Sometimes with income tax there is a time in- between years where the new calculator hasn’t been put online. It’s about March and April I think it is where you are finishing one year and starting the next and they may not have loaded the calculator for the new year you are coming into. They need to be more proactive about getting it loaded earlier. My son was trying to calculate his tax return refund and he was getting different amounts, and so he was like, ‘this is confusing’. Why have calculators that don’t provide you with the right answers? Relationship/trust/discretion One particular suggestion was identified as delivering the most “value” to SMEs more than any other; namely, “Inland Revenue should give customers a “high trust” status if they have a good record which, in turn, allows Inland Revenue staff some discretion in dealing with these customers”. When participants were asked to explain this selection, the general comment they made was that this epitomised an organisation that was “customer-centric”, ie, it respected and valued its customers. More specifically, they were asked how Inland Revenue would treat a “high trust” customer: It means that if you have got a “high trust” status, when you are a day or two late, instead of you having to ring and plead your case, IR just automatically remit the penalties and the interest. “Oh it’s just a couple of days late for goodness sake, you know, clearly something has happened.” His cats died, his wife is in hospital...so that to me is what the “high trust” status is, particularly around the penalties and interest. If you have been in business for a few years and you’ve had dealings with the IRD which have always been upfront and transparent I think you should be on a “high trust” status. If you are dicey, then okay I can understand there’s a problem. Participants considered that Inland Revenue would basically give them the “benefit of the doubt” and provide them with some flexibility in the event that they had, for example, filed late or made an incorrect payment. Participants envisaged Inland Revenue viewing the customer’s filing and payment history, seeing that the current situation was out of the ordinary, contacting them to advise them of the situation and assisting them to address it. Why can’t an allowance be made if you are a couple days late? If you are a 5-star company, you should be allowed a week’s leeway because they know that you’ve been trying really hard to get it right. If you are 2 days late or something like that. You should be able to ring up and say, look guys, for the last 25 years I have done my GST’s on time and you have just hit me with a $250 late fee and interest, that’s a bit tough isn’t it? And they then have a look at your record, see you are a good client and say they will write it off. When participants were asked how customers would earn a “high trust” status, they considered this would be on the basis that they had been compliant (ie, they had filed and made correct payments on time) for anywhere between one to 10 years. I would say one year of PAYE and payments and returns being done on time. One time you miss it 23 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit by a couple of days then they should have some leniency there. Full compliance. It’s a bit like getting the no claims discount for life insurance or 5 years without claims for your car insurance. I think something similar with tax types, if you have been compliant with all of your tax types for 2 or 3 years then I think you should get “high trust” status. Being compliant would be defined as filing all of your returns on time and making all of your payments on time. If you are a genuine customer and you’ve paid your taxes on time for a period, for I don’t know...3 years? Then there should be a leniency given if something hasn’t been complied with. Trust has several aspects to it. Time is one of them. If you have only been there 5 minutes then you can’t be trusted. But if you have been operating a company for 10 years plus and you are still there, still doing what you should be doing, you make a mistake, you should be trusted that you are trying to do the right thing. “Inland Revenue should give its staff greater authority/delegation/discretionary power (eg, ability to override automatically generated letters).” This suggestion was perceived as enabling Inland Revenue staff to override Inland Revenue systems that were inappropriate given the circumstances, thereby also being more cost-effective. In part, this suggestion also relates to the suggestion that was most frequently identified as being valued; the “high trust” suggestion. I had an experience last year with a data entry error that caused us quite some grief. There was no written communication except for the penalties and standard threatening letters. I certainly spoke to someone on the phone that helped me \[...\] but I am not an accountant and I didn’t really understand what was going on. It wasn’t as simple as, “You haven’t paid your employer deductions”, it was “Error with provisional tax” and that was that. There had been a typo at IRD, but the IRD person on the phone was not important enough or high up enough to fix the error or stop the letters. We never got anything in writing saying that it was IRD’s fault, all I got was verbal communication over the phone. When you keep getting demands for $40,000, it was really quite stressful because we didn’t have $40,000. It took us some months to resolve the issue. If you get an automatically generated letter that is incorrect and you tell them this is incorrect and you’ve stated why and show it is incorrect, well the staff should have authority to accept that and override the letter. Otherwise there is no point calling them if is impossible for them to override an automatically generated letter. It depends on the nature of the issue. There are some things you would think they could deal with relatively easily, that are fairly low level provided you could provide the evidence to support the position. There are things you can accept that the person may not be able to resolve but can take the action to get it sorted. “Inland Revenue should allow my tax agent to complete all transactions on my behalf, providing I have given the appropriate authority.” When participants were asked what it would be like if Inland Revenue allowed their tax agent to complete all transactions on their behalf, they imagined any issues or problems they had would be quickly and effectively resolved. You are paying quite good money for a tax agent so they should be able to do everything. They act as a buffer so people like me don’t have to engage with the IRD if they don’t want to. If it is a minor matter then sure I’ll engage. But generally I don’t. I know for a fact that my accountant can get through to someone a hell of a lot quicker and get the problem expedited a hell of a lot faster than I can. So there’s no point of me even trying. One of the problems we run into is, Jo deals predominately with all the processing of the taxes, her name is down to be contacted and deal with everything, but yet IR still insist to come to me. Jo’s the one processing it but they can’t talk to her. I say, but the authorisation is there, and they say, no we can’t. What’s the point in authorising someone if IR refuse to deal with that person that’s authorised? 24 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Communication with experts “I am able to directly contact ‘expert’ teams within Inland Revenue based on business size.” When participants were asked what it would be like contacting Inland Revenue with “expert teams” based on business size, they referred to the fact that they could easily access teams of staff who understood what it was like to be the owner of a small business, including the financial cost and time commitment required to be compliant with Inland Revenue and other government agencies. I think the biggest difference is people who hire a lot of people who don’t. Large businesses have a much more complicated tax regime to deal with. “I am able to directly contact ‘expert’ teams within Inland Revenue based on tax type (eg, income tax, GST, FBT).” When participants were asked what it would be like contacting Inland Revenue with “expert teams” based on tax type, they imagined dealing with staff who could communicate with them in lay terms and provide them with a clear and unequivocal solution to any issue or problem they had. Finding an expert where you’ve got a list of numbers, that person for GST, that’s family support, or that’s whatever, that would be fantastic Differences between groups As noted earlier, participants differed in terms of the number of practical ideas and suggestions they identified as “must haves”. As a general observation, smaller SMEs were more likely to identify more of the suggestions than larger SMEs who were more selective. Not surprisingly, participants who could be classified in the segment that experienced the “most pain” also tended to identify more suggestions as “must haves” than did those that could be categorised as experiencing the “least pain”. As noted earlier, given the qualitative nature of this study, these differences must be treated as indicative rather than conclusive. Less valued practical suggestions By way of comparison, the following six practical ideas and suggestions were less frequently identified as being of value (ie, received the least “must have” ratings). Statements relating to extending the call centre operating hours:  Number 42 of 44: “I would like to be able to contact the call centre in the weekend outside of Sat 9am to 1pm.”  Number 41 of 44: “I would like to be able to contact the call centre on weekdays outside of Mon-Fri 8am to 8pm.” Participants most commonly rated these statements as “nice to have, but not essential”. When participants were given the opportunity to explain their rating, most mentioned that the problem wasn’t so much to do with extending the call centre’s operating hours, it was more to do with being able to access a call centre operator with minimal delay during normal business hours. I think by 8pm everything is done and dusted, so to me it’s a nice to have but not essential. Well 8am to 8pm I think is actually quite good trading. There have been a few times when I’ve rung them towards the later end of those operating hours and been on hold to then just being hung up on when 8pm comes around. Access is appalling. The service should be able to take my call within those hours. You can ring in the weekends but you can never get through. One participant suggested that Inland Revenue provide “live traffic” information on their website so that people could decide whether or not to call or wait. What would be really clever is if on their website they kept in real-time the number of people trying to call. We have “x” number of people calling us at the moment. Then you could actually see that, oh, now is not a good time to call. The exception to this view were participants who could see the benefits in extending the call centre hours, particularly those who do “hands-on” work during the day and only have time to manage their tax-related matters before or after working hours. It depends on your role, my role is mainly admin so when I am at work I’m doing this stuff and I’m not like, oh I have been painting cars all day so I’ll ring IRD at night, when I’m in there I’m doing that so it is about what your role is. I like to knock all of that stuff out in the morning so 6am \[on weekdays\] would be more beneficial. 25 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit “I should not be penalised for non-compliance.” Most participants stated they would be pleased not to be penalised for non-compliance. However, they understand that Inland Revenue is a collection agent and needed to enforce some form of order, otherwise “no one would pay their taxes”. No one would ever comply. If you don’t pay on time, you should be penalised. You’ve got to pay your taxes, it’s as simple as that. If you pay your taxes you’ve got roads etc. There needs to be some check there to ensure that, well if I don’t pay it, this is the result. Penalising for non-compliance should be lined up with your track record. Related to trust. Other suggestions that were rated less frequently as being of value and received little discussion included:  “I would use online tutorials and ‘how-to-guides’”  “Inland Revenue should provide links to useful tax services”  “I would like to receive text/email notifications advising me that a new statement can be viewed in my myIR account”. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 26 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Appendix A: Stage 1 – Interview guide Inland Revenue – SME Tax Compliance Qualitative – Stage 1 (#4627) Purpose This discussion guide acts as an aide memoire to ensure that the focus groups with SMEs are conducted effectively and they have the opportunity to provide constructive feedback. Research objectives Inland Revenue is conducting or involved in a number of research projects that are either monitoring the cost of compliance for businesses (eg, 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey, R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey) or identifying opportunities to reduce these costs (eg, e-uptake research). The purpose of this research is to complement previous research by identifying what practical steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce the cost of compliance for businesses. This includes not only identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take itself but also identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take with other government agencies, given their dealings with businesses. To identify these practical steps, this research will need to: 1. provide an understanding of how businesses currently approach the task of meeting their taxation obligations, as well as their other compliance obligations 2. identify the specific “pain points” for businesses when dealing with Inland Revenue and other government agencies—the one-offs (eg, registration) as well as the ongoing or recurring (eg, taxation-related) 3. provide an understanding of why these are pain points for businesses 4. collect, for consideration, any ideas that businesses have that would make meeting their taxation obligations easier (through simplification, transformation and/or elimination of processes), as well as their other compliance obligations 5. provide an understanding of why these are pain points for businesses. The research is being completed in two stages, with this first stage focused on points 1–4 above. This interview guide relates to this first stage. 27 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Introduction (5 minutes) Objective: To ensure respondents are fully informed and understand how the interviews will be conducted. Welcome. Researcher introductions, timing and purpose of the focus group—to build on the information they have already provided about the effort involved in dealing with government agencies in the R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey:  with a particular focus on dealing with and meeting their tax obligations with Inland Revenue  that is, the cost and time, and other energy that goes into preparing for, filing and then paying (if a payment is due) income tax, GST, FBT and other types of tax  What things make it difficult or easy to do this?  At what point in the process is it challenging?  Are there changes to the processes, which are obvious to businesses, that would make it less challenging? Obtain their consent to record the discussion and explain that it is for the purposes of helping us analyse and report the results. Reassure confidentiality (through the Code of Practice of the Research Association of New Zealand), and explain that responses will be reported collectively and will only be used for the purposes of the research (individuals’ responses will not be identifiable in any reporting, unless consent is explicitly provided to do so). Background (5 minutes) Objective: Respondents briefly introduce themselves. Ask each respondent to briefly introduce themselves, including:  the nature of their business (ie, business activity, self-employed or what number of employees)  how long they’ve been in business (this business and others)  their role in the business (eg, are they the owner or a manager, are they responsible for taxation matters and if they are, what specifically does this involve—oversight, preparation). 28 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit General attitudes to dealing with government departments (15 minutes) Objective: To provide a context for the discussion about the challenges of meeting their tax obligations. Ask respondents for their views about the effort involved in dealing with government departments in general—in comparison, for example, to private sector organisations.  Prompt on the following: - Which departments are, in their experience, easy to deal with (require little effort) and which are difficult to deal with (require a lot of effort)? (Get respondents to physically sort departments into three piles— the difficult, the easy, and the in-between.) - What makes a department difficult to deal with, ie, how do they define “effort”? Have they got any specific examples? (List the features raised on a whiteboard for all to see.) - What makes a department easy to deal with? Have they got any specific examples? (List the features raised on the whiteboard for all to see.) Focusing specifically on Inland Revenue, where would they rank Inland Revenue on the “easy to difficult” scale?  Prompt on the following: - For what particular reasons have they rated Inland Revenue in this way? - For those rating Inland Revenue as difficult to deal with: o is it because tax is a difficult subject topic in general; hard to get your head around (knowledge, mental energy)? o ... or is it because of the amount of time they have to spend on getting everything prepared and checked (including the paper work and the forms that one has to complete)? o ... or is it the emotional stress that comes with wondering whether what they have done is the right thing (confidence), resulting in a lot of anxiety and stress? o ... or is it because the tax system keeps changing on them? o ... or is it because of the level of service and support they get from Inland Revenue, and the way Inland Revenue treats them when they ask them a question or do something wrong? o ... or is it because it involves money and there’s never enough of it because they have to maintain their cash flow? o ... or is it because they don’t have any or few appropriate systems or processes in place to help them prepare their tax/meet their taxation obligations? o ... or is it that tax is a “last-minute” activity? o ...or is it that tax things aren’t a priority? o ... or is it because of some combination of these things? (List the reasons raised on the board for all to see.) 29 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Meeting tax obligations (approx. 20 minutes) Objective: To ascertain how, in a practical sense, SMEs deal or manage their tax obligations (or don’t). Ask respondents where they would place themselves on the “meeting their tax obligations” scale in general (ie, the tax compliance scale). Check their rating by asking them to confirm they have never missed a filing date, or misfiled and have had to make subsequent adjustments, etc.  Irrespective of where they place themselves on the scale, ask them to: - ... explain what they do to manage their tax obligations in general (assuming they are managing): o For example, do they have special (real or mental) “tax accounts”? o ... or have they studied up on the subject (to improve their knowledge and confidence)? o ... or have they got professional help? o ... or have they employed staff who are experienced in dealing with tax matters? o ... or do friends and family help them? o ... or do they have special systems and processes in place (eg, informal as well as formal such as software packages)? o ... or some combination of these things? - What other strategies do they employ and are any of these on the margin of the law or outside the law (eg, income suppression)? - If the way they manage their tax obligations involves third parties, what in each case does this specifically involve? - List the tax coping/enabling factors raised on the whiteboard for all to see. How much responsibility do respondents think that government agencies have to provide systems and processes for managing compliance compared to what businesses should be doing themselves to meet their compliance obligations?  Do Inland Revenue’s systems and processes contribute negatively or positively to the amount of effort they make to meet tax obligations? 30 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Practical changes (approx. 20 minutes) Objective: To generate ideas for changes that would make it easier for SMEs to meet their tax obligations (eg, simplification, elimination, transformation). Ask respondents to identify, in their own words, how they group or compartmentalise the different types of tax they deal with:  Do they do this in specific terms, eg, income tax, GST, FBT, student loans, RWT, PAYE?  Or do they do this in general terms, eg, personal tax, business tax, tax relating to employees? Then ask them to rate the tax types using the “easy to difficult” scale (get respondents to physically sort the tax types into three piles—the difficult, the easy, and the in-between). Focusing on the tax types that are rated at the “difficult” end of the scale, ask respondents to explain what it is about these tax types that make them challenging. For example:  is the difficulty preparation-related (including the sourcing and collation of all the necessary information and its reconciliation, the lead times involved)?  ... or is it related to filing (including remembering that filing is due, getting around to it, the calculations involved, the completion of forms, the amount of (supporting) information that needs to be provided, the frequency of filing, the method of filing, issues with electronic filing as well as paper filing, filing confirmations)?  ... or is post-filing (including making payments/receiving refunds, the methods involved in these, confirmations)?  ... or the lack of or the shortcomings in their level of organisation?  ... or the lack of or the shortcomings in their systems and processes?  ... or is it generally getting service and support from Inland Revenue when there are issues (including matters to do with the availability of information that is easy to understand, channels of communication per se, hours of operation, accessibility, the experience and knowledge of staff, their attitude, multiple contact points versus a single contact point, lack of consistency versus a single voice, reactivity versus proactivity, levels of authority)?  List the difficulties/problems raised on the whiteboard for all to see. Then ask them to imagine what practical changes they would make to reduce the effort involved in meeting their tax obligations in relation to these “difficult” tax types.  Are there changes they would make, or would most of the changes be required from Inland Revenue’s end?  What specific things would they suggest Inland Revenue do to make meeting their tax obligations easier (seeking practical examples of changes to processes, systems, information, delivery of information, tools, etc)? List the suggestions on the whiteboard for all to see. Ask respondents to rank the simple process changes in order of potential positive impact and explain why they have ranked particular changes first or second, etc. 31 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Wrap-up (5 minutes) Objective: To bring the focus group to a conclusion. Inform respondents about the second stage and invite them to participate. Re-confirm the confidentiality aspects of the research. Thank respondents and close. A qualitative investigation to identify steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce effort and compliance cost of SMEs 32 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Appendix B: Stage 2 – Interview guide Inland Revenue – SME Tax Compliance Qualitative – Stage 2 (#4627) Purpose This discussion guide acts as an aide memoire to ensure that the focus groups with SMEs are conducted effectively and they have the opportunity to provide constructive feedback. Research objectives Inland Revenue is conducting or involved in a number of research projects that are either monitoring the cost of compliance for businesses (eg, the 2013 SME Cost of Compliance Survey, R9 Longitudinal Panel Survey) or identifying opportunities to reduce these costs (eg, e-uptake research). The purpose of this research is to complement previous research by identifying what practical steps Inland Revenue could take to reduce the cost of compliance for businesses. This includes not only identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take itself, but also identifying those steps that Inland Revenue could take with other government agencies, given their dealings with businesses. To identify these practical steps, this research will need to: 1. provide an understanding of how businesses currently approach the task of meeting their taxation obligations, as well as their other compliance obligations 2. identify the specific “pain points” for businesses when dealing with Inland Revenue and other government agencies—the one-offs (eg, registration) as well as the ongoing or recurring (eg, taxation- related) 3. provide an understanding of why these are pain points for businesses 4. collect, for consideration, any ideas that businesses have that would make meeting their taxation obligations easier (through simplification, transformation and/or elimination of processes), as well as their other compliance obligations 5. establish businesses’ reactions to ideas generated by previous research (MBIE). The research is being completed in two stages, with this first stage focused on points 1–4 above. This interview guide relates to the second stage, focused on point 5 above. 33 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit Introduction (5 minutes) Objective: To ensure respondents are fully informed and understand how the interviewing will be conducted. Welcome, and thank respondents for returning to participate in the second stage of the research. Introduce any Inland Revenue representatives who are in attendance. Explain to respondents that the feedback they and others gave as a result of the first stage, and particularly their ideas for practical suggestionsto make dealing with Inland Revenue less stressful and take less effort, were considered by Inland Revenue. This second stage returns these practical suggestions to the table to:  effectively rank them in order of their usefulness/value to small and medium sized businesses  provide more detailed feedback in relation to some of them (in relation to which we are a little unclear at this stage). Obtain their consent to record the discussion and explain that it is for the purposes of helping us analyse and report the results. Reassure confidentiality (through the Code of Practice of the Research Association of New Zealand), and explain that responses will be reported collectively and will only be used for the purposes of the research (individuals’ responses will not be identifiable in any reporting, unless consent is explicitly provided to do so). Background (5 minutes) Objective: Respondents briefly introduce themselves (again) (for the purposes of any attending Inland Revenue representatives). Ask each respondent, and Inland Revenue representatives, to briefly introduce themselves, including:  the nature of their business (ie, business activity, self-employed or what number of employees)  whether they deal with tax-related matters for their business on a day-to-day basis (as opposed to an accountant or tax agent), and what exactly this involves. 34 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit General discussion about high-level suggestions raised by respondents participating in Stage 1 (15 minutes) Objective: To provide greater detail in relation to a number of high-level suggestions. Present the following high-level suggestions as the three that were consistently identified by respondents who participated in Stage 1:  “Inland Revenue needs to change its culture”  “Inland Revenue needs to become more customer-centric”  “Inland Revenue needs to change its policies, processes and systems to better reflect the needs of businesses”. In relation to these statements, ask respondents to describe:  what a cultured changed Inland Revenue looks and feels like  what it would be like to interact with from a customer point of view  especially when there are issues needing to be resolved. Ranking of specific suggestions (approx. 30 minutes) Objective: To identify those suggestions that would have the most resonance with small and medium sized businesses. Give each respondent a copy of the scoring sheet that lists the 44 practical suggestions:  Explain that these suggestions were the specific suggestions provided by respondents who participated in the first stage.  We have simply grouped them under high-level headings.  On an individual basis, ask respondents to rate each suggestion by putting a 1, 2 or 3 in the box by the suggestion: - 1 = “must have” - 2 = “nice to have, but not essential” - 3 = “not really of interest or use to me”.  Explain that respondents can rate as many or as few suggestions with a 1, 2 or 3. Following individual respondents rating the suggestions, encourage the group to discuss those suggestions that have been identified as “must have”.  Begin by white boarding the “must have” suggestions to identify those that have been commonly identified for all to see.  Depending on the “must have” suggestions that are listed on the board, explore the following: - 1. “Inland Revenue staff use a system that allows them to have a real-time, total picture of me and my business”. Probe: What do customers imagine the real-time picture covering? 35 Prepared by: Penny Salmon and Research NZ National Research and Evaluation Unit - 2–4. Customers are able to directly contact ‘expert’ teams within Inland Revenue based on business size/industry/tax type. Probe: What do customers expect the ‘expert’ teams will be like and do for them exactly? - 5–6. Extend weekday call centre operating hours beyond Mon–Fri 8 am to 8 pm and weekend call centre operating hours beyond Sat 9 am to 1 pm. Probe: Do customers have views on what realistically the hours would be extended to? - 11–18. Text/email notifications sent to customers reminding them/advising them ... Probe: What do customers envisage as the timeframes within which these notifications would be received? - 21. Inland Revenue gives its staff greater authority/delegation/discretionary power (eg, ability to override automatically generated letters). Probe: Are customers able to provide other examples in which staff would be able to exercise their greater discretionary power? - 22. Customers are given a ‘high trust’ status by Inland Revenue if they have a good record which, in turn, allows Inland Revenue staff more flexibility to work with these customers. Probe: On what basis do customers think Inland Revenue should give a customer a ‘high status’? - 26. Inland Revenue enables customers to view historical transactions on their myIR account. Probe: How far back do customers think these historical transactions should go? What level of detail do they expect to see? - 30. Centralise topic-specific information rather than have it spread across various parts of the website. Probe: Do customers have particular content in mind? - 42. Customers are incentivised to meet their tax obligations and/or are not penalised for non- compliance/Customers are incentivised to assist with the collection of non-business related tax ( eg, child support, KiwiSaver and student loans). Probe: What do customers think is a reasonable incentive? Wrap-up (5 minutes) Objective: To bring the focus group to a conclusion. Re-confirm the confidentiality aspects of the research.

S Y  Statements can be difficult to understand.  Simplify the language and structure of statements where possible—provide a “key”. S  Issues with letters/statements sent by IR: - Too many letters being sent. - Many letters are automated, impersonal, meaningless and difficult to understand. - Problems with conflicting information in multiple letters sent by IR on the same issue (ie, contradictory). - Letters are often inconsistent with advice provided by staff (eg, staff members tell customers to “ignore” letters).  Have a CMS where customer information is centralised and in one place.  Provide customers with the ability to select channels to receive notifications about, for example, changes to tax types, GST due dates (thereby potentially reducing written correspondence).  Increase awareness amongst customers that they can “opt-out” of paper statements.  Written communications should be simplified, have a clear purpose and use plain “customer speak”.  Instead of sending letters, all messages and transactions/payments should be clearly visible on myIR (eg, date received, processing time).  Allow greater (manual) control over automated letters: - IR staff should be able to override unnecessary mail (ie, put a “stopper” on them). - Ensure letters reflect what staff have advised customers.

Y: Yes  Complications arising between IR, the customer and the customer’s tax agent (eg, tax agents not being able to resolve problems for the customer because of privacy issues, despite having been given the authority by their customers).  Establish protocols for tax agents around communications, and provide guidelines on how they can help customers meet their compliance requirements.  Allow tax agents greater authority, with customer approval (eg, allow tax agents to make enquiries about their customer with their permission). Improved tracking of communications with each party using, for example, myIR and a CMS. C C  Difficulty using the website. - Overload of information. - Can’t find anything easily (eg, forms). - Poor search functionality (Google is better). - Difficulty dealing with the fragmented nature of the website. - Poor structure of online forms (eg, “save” button too far away from body of form). - Unsure what rules/information/forms are current (ie, dated information).  Only publish current information and either remove or archive old information: - Use date stamps for quick identification of dated and current information.  Website design should be less cluttered and have a more customer-oriented structure (ie, an “intuitive” layout).  Have a smarter search engine so that customers are taken to the correct page immediately: - Use indexes (eg, forms index).  Have topic-specific information all on one page rather than in multiple places.  Have the “save” function more clearly displayed and an alert that prompts the customer if they have not saved (eg, “Are you sure you want to leave this page, you have not yet saved”): - Ensure all online forms have a saving function even if the form has not been completed.

Y: Yes 5. Parity/fairness issues  Power imbalance. The “rules” for businesses appear much harsher/less flexible than those for IR (eg, timeframes generally, interest on arrears/tax appear to be unduly punitive, interest paid on refunds perceived to be unfair).  Employers are doing the government’s/IR’s work (eg, managing student loans, child support, KiwiSaver) – expected to take all of the responsibility but seeing no benefits/gain.  Culture change.  Promote the value proposition of IR/government to businesses.  Change policies and practices (incentivise/reward compliance rather than penalising for late compliance): - Pay interest on delayed refunds. - Notify customers about when their refunds will be paid and when they have been paid.  Alert customers about problems before penalising them (eg, “Have you forgotten to pay your GST?”). - Notify customers promptly when mistakes have been made (see section on communications).  Change tone of communications (ie, less authoritative, draconian).  Eliminate employer responsibilities or pay/reward the employer for managing non-business related tasks (eg, KiwiSaver, child support).

### Opening Address to ATAINZ Tax Conference, Quality Inn Parnell

Thank you for inviting me here today. It is always a pleasure to address tax professionals.

I’m especially pleased to be here given the theme of your conference, The Future ¬ Moving Forward.

That’s a very topical issue and something that I am deeply interested in.

Taxation is a necessary part of society as long as government is required to provide services such as health and education, police and defence, conservation and civil defence.

Yet today, it seems to me that our tax system and in fact tax systems around the world, are at a cross roads.

The design of tax systems is crucial if adequate revenues are to be raised over the medium term in the face of challenges.

A good tax system, as you know, comprises good tax policy supported by a strong tax administration.

Tax policy in New Zealand is in a very strong position.

Our broad-based, low rates framework, backed by a good system of public consultation means that policies are efficient, effective and practical and aim to be fair and minimise compliance costs.

Following the Global Financial Crisis, many tax jurisdictions around the world who do not share our broad-based, low rate tax framework face the pressing issue of sustainable revenue raising.

For New Zealand, this is not our top concern. We are on track to restoring the Government’s books to surplus, but that doesn’t mean we stop being fiscally responsible.

Our tax policy gives businesses the certainty and predictability they require.

So I do not envision any great changes to the direction of tax policy.

I want to talk to you today about a tax administration for the future.

I understand that Inland Revenue’s Deputy Commissioner, Mike Cunnington will provide you with more detail about the programme to modernise our tax administration, but I’d like to give you an overview.

Our top priority for the tax system is modernising the way the tax system is run so that it keeps pace with taxpayers’ expectations and Government’s needs.

#### A new tax administration

The last time I was here, I spoke briefly about the high level design of IRD’s change programme.

I told you there were to be four stages to the work.

The first is to enable secure digital services and includes work to improve the collection of PAYE and GST information from business. Having established that, we’d move on to streamlining income tax and business tax processes.

The third stage would look at streamlining the delivery of social policies that IRD administers such as Child Support and Working for Families tax credits.

And stage 4 rounds off the transformation ensuring that all remaining aspects of the tax system are brought into the new administration.

I also told you last year that I wanted Inland Revenue to think of some options. I’m pleased to be able to give you today a clearer idea of how the future could look.

You may wonder why it has taken this long to get to this point.

The answer is because there’s a lot riding on it so we’ve got to get it right. We can’t afford to rush into this with ill-conceived ideas.

More than most, you know the importance of taxes to the Government and to the people of New Zealand.

While they are valuable in funding necessary services, taxes also impose costs: administration, compliance costs and distortionary costs. An efficient tax system keeps these to a minimum.

Our tax system rests on voluntary compliance, and for this to continue working, we need the tax system to be fair and seen to be fair.

It should be as easy as possible for those who want to do the right thing to comply. Equally it should be difficult for taxpayers _not_ to comply.

This will become more and more important as we look to the future. An ageing New Zealand population creates extra fiscal pressures. That should not automatically mean higher tax rates or new taxes.

The responsible thing to do is to take every step we can to ensure that the way we administer the tax rules works as well as possible. That’s what the transformation of Inland Revenue is all about.

It has to be a sound investment for New Zealand.

If we’re going to make this work, it can’t be by shifting costs from the government to taxpayers.

The reforms will not be successful if administration costs are cut but we see compliance costs rise and total costs for New Zealand as a whole increase.

And of course the Government is keen to ensure we do not stifle enterprise. We want to ensure we provide an environment where businesses can get on with growing their businesses and spend less time on meeting tax obligations.

So in considering the direction and objectives of the programme of work to modernise tax administration, we need to balance minimising the costs of raising taxes with fairness concerns and ensuring the tax system promotes compliance.

#### SMEs

The issue of compliance costs, especially for SMEs, will be a priority but always with regard to ensuring the integrity of the system and fairness to all taxpayers. And of course we need to maintain the Government’s revenue.

The focus will be on providing simpler, not concessionary solutions.

For instance, imagine a business starting up. At present, they would need to register separately as a business with Inland Revenue, as an employer and for GST. This is a small example of the sort of irksome thing which ties people up in red tape, when they would be better off spending that time on getting their business profitable.

It should be possible for that business to purchase an accounting software package which takes care of all those separate transactions with IRD in one go.

For employers more generally, we will also be exploring wider simplifications such as replacing the employer monthly schedule with information which is more directly linked to payroll systems.

And of course, calculating provisional tax presents problems for some taxpayers.

As much as possible we want firms to be paying tax during the year as income is earned. This is consistent with the way in which other taxpayers are taxed. But at the same time we want to make this as painless and easy to comply with as possible.

We will be exploring whether there are ways of making improvements in this area.

#### Increasing compliance

We also need to improve tax payment efficiency.

How taxes are paid imposes compliance costs and Inland Revenue’s efforts to collect taxes comes at a cost to the taxpayer. It is our responsibility to make sure that we are minimising compliance costs and using those tax dollars prudently.

It should come as no surprise that international studies have found that certain forms of tax such as PAYE are much more efficient at collecting tax than others such as self-declared income.

An important question will be whether there are good ways of making it easier for those who want to comply with the tax rules and harder for those who don’t.

A practical difficulty is in getting rates of withholding as good as possible and minimising the costs of square ups when it is later discovered that insufficient tax has been withheld.

Modern technology may help by making square ups less costly.

The Government will be exploring whether we can provide more extensive prepopulated information on tax returns available to individual taxpayers. For a person with simple affairs and without business, rental, or foreign income, filing a tax return might be no more complex than simply saying whether the sources of income that Inland Revenue has identified are their only sources of income.

We will also be exploring whether we can simplify square ups with automatic bank transfers to those who have paid too much and adjusting withholding rates for those who have paid too little.

There is scope for simplification for those with more complex tax affairs.

Suppose you have a staff member for instance who has child support obligations while repaying a student loan and who receives a Working for Families entitlement.

It should be possible for your payroll software to automatically send that employee’s information to and from Inland Revenue as part of each weekly pay cycle, with his student loan repayments and Working for Families entitlement being automatically calculated and updated.

If that happens, it means that payroll staff do the job once and do it right. No need for the current situation where IRD contacts employers to correct information.

Improvements may also be possible in the rates at which secondary tax is withheld. More timely employment information may allow Inland Revenue to interact with employers to get better rates of withholding.

This sort of approach should considerably ease the compliance burden on the employer and the staff member’s working for families and various obligations would be accurately calculated so there would be no need for an end of year square-up.

The objective is to simplify, and to modernise and to make it easy to comply and hard to get it wrong.

#### Conclusion

This is just a taster of what it could all look like. Over the coming year I intend to release public consultation into all these matters. The first discussion document will focus on the big picture and subsequent ones will provide finer detail and concrete proposals.

It will be hugely important that all New Zealanders consider these proposals and their implications for themselves.

In the past, ATAINZ has made submissions on policy proposals, I hope and trust that you will engage with this very important matter.

Thank you.

Speech

13 March 2015

### Address to IFA Annual Conference, Queenstown

Thank you for inviting me to open your conference once again.

Following last year’s General Election I am pleased to have retained the Revenue portfolio. Actually rightly or wrongly, I asked to be able to retain it - and I look forward to working with you once again as Minister of Revenue.

The relationship that exists between IRD and the tax advisory profession is mature and one we need to continue to cultivate.

Today I want to talk about the tax policy work programme which I have agreed upon with the Minister of Finance, and ensuring the soundness of our tax system is very much the basis of that work programme.

Tax is a necessary part of a well-functioning economy.

In New Zealand, where we have a high rate of voluntary compliance, I would suggest that whilst many people are not thrilled to be paying tax, they see that it is necessary to fund public services.

But even the most efficient tax system imposes costs to society over and above the tax revenue raised. Economists refer to these as “deadweight costs”.

A good tax system seeks to minimise those costs and this is where it becomes interesting.

First, and most obviously, there are the costs to taxpayers in complying with the tax system.

While there is evidence to suggest that compliance costs in New Zealand are relatively low, compliance costs for SMEs alone have been estimated at around $2.5 billion in 2009 which was more than 1% of GDP.

Compliance costs in the United States have been estimated at about 10% of total tax collections.

If the same were true in New Zealand, this would convert to 3-4% of GDP.

There are also costs to the Government in administering the tax system. The Government is obliged to be accountable and to use taxpayer funds prudently.

The public service must be efficient and it must be careful in its use of taxpayer dollars.

Probably at least as important as administration and compliance put together are distortionary costs arising because of ways that taxes can bias individuals and firms to do things that would not be sensible in the absence of taxes.

For example, they can bias firms to invest or individuals to save in less productive ways. They can discourage individuals from working harder, undertaking training or accepting risk.

It’s important to keep all of these costs to a minimum while ensuring that taxes are fair and seen to be fair.

Fairness is not a matter of cutting those who are successful down to size. We want the best and most innovative ideas and businesses to thrive in New Zealand and provide productive jobs for its citizens.

But at the same time we want everyone to do their fair share to fund the public services that New Zealanders expect and to look after the genuinely disadvantaged.

The Government does not have a blank cheque to fund tax reform.

Tax changes which are intended to increase economic efficiency reduce compliance costs or increase fairness but have a revenue cost must be seen in the same light as expenditure proposals.

And any tax changes that reduce revenue have to be prioritised along with increases in other areas such as health and roads.

Taking this all into consideration, therefore, tax policy presents challenges and designing and formulating a tax policy work programme is a careful art.

The cornerstone of New Zealand’s tax policy settings is the extraordinary degree of cooperation in creating them.

That our tax system is a good one is testament to professionals such as yourselves who devote much time and energy to questions of tax policy.

Your work is appreciated and recognised.

A 2014 study by the Tax Foundation in Washington DC found NZ to have the second most competitive tax system in the OECD. This is an extremely positive finding, which demonstrates that our tax system remains taxpayer and business friendly.

And the Deloitte 2014 Tax Complexity Survey found that most respondents rated NZ’s policies as straightforward, consistent and predictable compared with other countries in the region.

These are important measures for a tax system.

New Zealand enjoys a very high level of public engagement with our tax policy consultation and this results in tax legislation which is generally workable and fit for purpose.

Coherent settings assist in consultation between Inland Revenue and taxpayers and also help the courts to decide on what is and is not tax avoidance.

The fundamentals of the system therefore are good and I don’t see any need for large scale changes.

The main focus, as always, is on ensuring we have a tax system which runs efficiently in order to pay for the things that our citizens demand and should reasonably expect the Government to deliver.

There are ultimately trade-offs that a Government must make in deciding on what can and what _should_ be done.

The big picture is about more than tax, and the objective is for the best policy outcome.

That could be the modernisation of Inland Revenue’s administration of the tax system or rolling out ultra-fast broadband.

In a post-recession world where the threat of offshore economic turmoil remains ever-present, there is an increased need for prudence and for paying our own way.

Tax policy can have substantial and wide-ranging effects on the economy, and when done well, has an important role to play especially by encouraging productivity and growth and making sure that taxes don’t get in the way of investment flowing to where it’s most valuable.

So it’s important that the tax programme meshes with the major economic challenges that New Zealand faces.

New Zealand has performed well throughout the Global Financial Crisis and has had strong growth compared with other OECD countries. Naturally the Government would like to see this relatively strong growth continue.

The Government also sees a strong value in returning to surplus and over time reducing net debt.

We continue to live in a fiscally constrained environment so tax reform will need to be carefully weighed up on its merits.

Meanwhile, the modern economy, especially the digital economy, creates opportunities and challenges and we need to rise to embrace these and drive improvements in the tax system.

Our tax system will need to be able to take all this in its stride and help future governments in meeting the fiscal demands of these challenges.

All of that is by way of introduction to my topic for today: the tax policy work programme.

#### The tax policy work programme

The Government's tax policy work programme is usually developed at the beginning of the electoral cycle and then reviewed and updated half-way through.

New and updated work programmes are made public, for purposes of transparency and to ensure there are as few "surprises" as possible.

That is all part of our generic tax policy process.

The work programme that I am announcing today continues the focus on three important themes.

They are:

*   to further improve and enhance tax and social policy within our broad-base, low rate (BBLR) framework,
*   BEPS and international tax reform, and
*   Inland Revenue’s transformation programme.

Let’s start with BBLR.

#### Applying BBLR

New Zealand is well served by its broad-base, low rate approach to tax policy. This minimises the costs of raising taxes and makes things as fair as possible.

It also provides a robust revenue base which has helped New Zealand weather the storm of the GFC because through it all, we managed to maintain Government revenue to fund services without excessive borrowing.

BBLR will also help us to return to surplus.

Our three main tax bases: personal income, corporate income and consumption are a stable basis for revenue. By consistently ensuring that these tax bases are applied fairly and as evenly as possible, we have managed to avoid hiking tax rates — in fact we’ve cut rates and in the case of gift duty and cheque duty, even _repealed_ taxes.

However, our focus on BBLR means that there is always work to do to ensure that the bases are applied fairly and that the rules are working as intended.

A good example is a review of the tax rules for closely held companies. This follows from the creation of "look-through companies" and the abolition of "loss-attributing qualifying companies".

For a tax system founded on voluntary compliance, simplification is always an important focus but for this review, we want to make sure that the rules for look through companies are working effectively without undue compliance costs.

This work is consistent with the objective of simplifying requirements and reducing compliance costs for small and medium businesses and a consultation document is scheduled for release in the first half of the year.

Work is also progressing on the interaction of loss grouping and imputation credits and a review of abusive tax positions to protect BBLR.

The Government must continue to protect our tax base and apply our broad-base, low rate framework. We are exploring whether there are sensible policy measures which would raise additional revenue.

I was very pleased to see the officials’ issues paper on related parties debt remission released recently. While significant further work is necessary, this is an important step forward.

#### International and BEPS

The second major area of work is international tax and BEPS.

There has been substantial international concern over large multinationals exploiting the differences between tax jurisdictions in order to pay the least amount of tax or no tax at all.

In New Zealand, work in this area has been ongoing with the result that we have some of the best anti-BEPS rules in the OECD.

At the same time, the Government is conscious of the fine balancing act required to ensure that overseas investors continue to see New Zealand as a good place to do business.

It is critical that the tax system does not stand in the way of businesses growing and thriving in New Zealand. But part of being a good place to do business means ensuring that our tax rules are fair — for everyone.

Countering BEPS will help to level the playing field and will also help maintain confidence and belief in the tax system.

We will therefore continue to work with the OECD and the G20, and there are plans to consult on both hybrids and entities and interest limitation rules after the OECD has released its BEPS action plan this year.

Whilst there is much to be gained by working closely with the OECD, multinationals must be clear that the New Zealand government expects them to pay their fair share of tax if they want to benefit from BBLR. Other aspects of our domestic law not covered by BEPS can also be improved. This includes strengthening our NRWT rules for related party debt.

The vexed issue of purchasing of offshore services and intangibles, as well as low value goods and digital downloads, is an important one.

We are heavily involved with the OECD process to develop rules to tax consumption fairly. This is an issue that hits at the very heart of our own BBLR system. GST on these goods and services must be fair to consumers, retailers, and all taxpayers. After all, under BBLR where tax is not paid by one group it must be made up for by another.

The OECD is making progress in this area, however a number of tax jurisdictions have implemented policy to address offshore purchasing and digital downloads. Early indications are that these measures are having their desired effect. I have therefore instructed officials to report to me in the short term on these developments and their suitability for implementing as part of the New Zealand tax system.

It’s a matter of importance to many countries and we are thinking through what this means for New Zealand.

I’d like to turn now to the third area of the policy work programme.

#### Modernising tax admin

Thus far I’ve spoken about tax policy changes. I think it’s fair to say that New Zealand’s tax policy settings are as good as if not better than most of our international counterparts.

Now we need to turn our attention to the tax administration.

The world we live in today is much more connected. Everything is done online, and it’s much faster.

The advent of the internet has seen people doing a lot of their business for themselves.

For instance, where once you went to a travel agent to arrange your travel, it’s quite common now for people to go online and find a deal.

The internet has given people the desire to self-manage their affairs. It is up to service providers to give people the ability to do so.

And this should apply to interaction with the tax system. It’s a reasonable enough expectation for taxpayers to be able to conduct their tax affairs online too.

It’s not about replacing an old computer system. It is about bringing our tax administration into the 21st century to reflect changes in technology and to meet customer expectations.

With future fiscal pressures, there will inevitably be pressures for new taxes or higher tax rates to help bridge fiscal gap.

Rather than rushing to do so, it’s critical to ensure that we are doing everything feasible to ensure the highest possible levels of compliance with existing tax rules.

A big part is making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply and to reduce the costs of tax across the economy.

We want a system which helps those who want to comply. But equally it is essential that the system is effective in making it difficult not to comply.

If the public wants to self-manage their affairs, that’s a good thing, because it frees up Inland Revenue staff to be used in ways which create most value for money, which is in line with the Government’s objectives for the public service as a whole.

A key issue is ensuring that Inland Revenue collects relevant and useful information in a form it can use cheaply and effectively.

I’ve already mentioned the policy objective of reducing the overall costs of taxation as much as possible, and it’s no different for this modernisation programme.

A number of policy changes will first need to happen, and policy work supporting the modernisation of tax administration forms a significant part of the next 18 month tax policy work programme.

The work will cover questions about simplifying and rationalising PAYE and a wider use of digital services.

One of the first ideas intended to be released for full consultation addresses the monthly chore of providing PAYE information to the IRD.

That’s currently done using an Employer Monthly Schedule, but it could be hugely simplified by making this part of the normal day-to-day processes rather than a stand-alone tax process through a two-way transfer of information between the business’s own accounting systems and Inland Revenue.

The pay-off would be reduced compliance costs for most businesses and a generally simplified tax system.

We know that withholding taxes, if designed correctly and taking into account compliance costs, are an efficient mechanism for collecting taxes and we will look at whether the use of withholding taxes should be expanded.

Also under the spotlight will be provisional tax, a perennial bug bear for many businesses, small and medium ones in particular.

But it’s not all about business — there will be proposals for simplifying the tax rules for individuals and the rules around social policies administered through the tax system such as Working for Families and Child Support.

It’s the biggest change we’ve contemplated to tax administration in New Zealand and it’s important that the public is consulted. Beginning in the next few weeks, you’ll be seeing a series of policy consultation documents.

The very first consultation document I intend to release on the topic, sets out the initial thinking about the future of our tax administration system and seeks feedback from the public on whether this policy vision is heading in the right direction.

The private sector has identified speed and certainty as important features for the tax system.

It will be crucial in consultation to work through how these private sector priorities will best be delivered.

It is important to find meaningful ways to reduce the time businesses spend on tax, particularly for SME’s many of whom have limited resources and capability when it comes to tax.

We need your ideas and suggestions because the objectives of this modernisation programme are in line with your own and we do not hold a monopoly on good ideas for transforming the tax administration.

We need to step back and reconsider areas where businesses have specific concerns, such as provisional tax.

Looking at these areas will challenge many of our pre-conceived notions of how tax should operate but we have to be up for those challenges.

If we don’t then we are only going to achieve minor improvements rather than the kind of gains that really pay off.

#### Conclusion

The work programme I have announced today is comprehensive and ambitious and will deliver big gains for New Zealand.

It includes putting in place the foundations of fundamental changes to how the tax system is administered. That by itself would be a heavy workload, but the important work of ensuring that the tax system works as intended must continue.

In addition to this, we must always remember our place in the world and the global context and tackling the BEPS problem is a priority.

In addition to the work I have sketched out today, we also need to monitor developments in the rest of the world and be mindful of the implications for the New Zealand economy.

In particular we have to follow the Australian White paper on taxation and consider whether any suggestions for reform in Australia should cause us to re-examine our tax settings.

The huge advantage that New Zealand has over most other countries is cooperation and consultation and the willingness of different groups in society to work together to achieve the best outcomes.

In working through changes I once more look to you for your help and cooperation.

I wish you all the best for a successful conference.

### KiwiSaver HomeStart Bill passes

Building and Housing Minister Dr Nick Smith and Revenue Minister Todd McClay today welcomed Parliament’s passage of the Taxation (KiwiSaver HomeStart and Remedial Matters) Bill, which will allow eligible KiwiSaver members to access more of their KiwiSaver funds to purchase their first home.

“These changes to KiwiSaver and the new HomeStart grant will open the door for 90,000 young New Zealanders over the next five years to own their own home,” Dr Smith says.

“The passage of this Bill will extend the current KiwiSaver withdrawal rules for first home buyers, so that eligible KiwiSaver members will be able to withdraw the annual member tax credit paid by the Government as well as their own contributions and those made by their employers,” Mr McClay says.

This means that eligible KiwiSaver members will now have access to up to an extra $521 for each year they have contributed to the scheme to put towards the deposit on their first home.

“Often, the biggest challenge faced by prospective first home buyers is pulling together the deposit. The measures contained in this Bill will provide a welcome boost,” Mr McClay says.

The Government’s $1,000 kick-start is not included in the changes in order to keep the KiwiSaver member’s account open and active after the withdrawal of eligible funds.

The Bill implements one part of the Government’s new support package for first home buyers which was announced in August 2014. The KiwiSaver HomeStart package, which comes into effect 1 April, also includes:

*   A doubling of the support for first home buyers where they are purchasing a newly built home;
*   Increasing the house price caps to the more realistic levels of $550,000 in Auckland, $450,000 in Wellington, Christchurch and other areas facing housing affordability issues and $350,000 in the rest of New Zealand; and
*   Expanding eligibility for Welcome Home Loans by aligning the house price caps with the new KiwiSaver HomeStart grant.

Other refinements made to the KiwiSaver scheme in this Bill include:

*   The law has been amended in response to concern from the Māori Party, to enable a KiwiSaver first home withdrawal to apply to the building or purchase of a home on Māori land;
*   The law has been clarified so that a KiwiSaver first home withdrawal can be used for the purchase or building of a home in New Zealand only;
*   The law has been amended so that from 1 June 2015, the KiwiSaver first home withdrawal can be used for making an initial deposit on a home, provided the funds are protected until settlement. The current law does not enable withdrawals to be used for a deposit, which creates a barrier particularly for new homes purchased off the plans; and
*   The KiwiSaver HomeStart grant policy has been revised to allow greater flexibility for new builds in the time to completion because the timeframes announced in August were unrealistic for some apartment and townhouse developments.

“HomeStart is the most significant Government support for first home buyers in more than a generation and comes into effect on 1 April 2015. These changes double the Government’s support for first home buyers from $217 million to $435 million over the next five years. It complements the Government’s other housing initiatives, including opening up new residential land, reducing tariffs on building materials, investing more in building skills and reducing compliance costs,” Dr Smith says.

The Bill also makes changes to clarify and correct the tax rules for payments made under the Veterans’ Support Act 2014.

Speech

### Address to Wellington Employers’ Chamber of Commerce on the launch of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation

Good morning

Thank you for joining me here today.

My thanks to the Wellington Employers’ Chamber of Commerce for providing this opportunity to talk to you.

As Minister of Revenue, there are certain things I have noticed about tax.

1.  Some people believe that their tax obligations belong in the “too hard” basket
2.  Meeting tax obligations can impose costs, and
3.  People rarely say to me “tell us more about paying tax, Minister”

We need to be reasonable and accept that we can’t wave a magic wand and change these things instantly, but today I want to talk to you about how the Government aims to address and mitigate these issues.

The Government knows that for business to flourish, it has to be easier to do business in New Zealand. That is why we have a determined agenda to support all businesses, large or small.

And we recognise that Government's role is to provide stability and certainty and predictability.

These are the things that encourage businesses to invest in and help grow our economy.

The Government remains focused on returning to surplus and its long-term fiscal objective remains to reduce net core Crown debt to 20 per cent of GDP by 2020.

The key way the tax system can help achieve that is by providing revenue to spend on priority areas without having to borrow excessively, minimising costs to the taxpayer and promoting business certainty.

Tax is an important part of a well-functioning modern democracy, and it’s important that the costs imposed by taxation are kept to a minimum.

Tax policy can have substantial and wide-ranging effects on the economy, and when done well, has an important role to play especially by encouraging productivity and growth and making sure that taxes don’t get in the way of investment flowing to where it’s most valuable.

New Zealand’s relatively consistent broad-based, low rate tax policy framework is well regarded — and it’s not just me saying so.

The Tax Foundation in Washington DC found New Zealand to have the second most competitive tax system in the OECD.

And most survey respondents in Deloitte’s 2014 Asia Pacific Tax Complexity Survey Report rated New Zealand’s tax policies as straightforward, consistent and predictable compared with other countries in the region.

Consistency and predictability of the tax system are rated by the private sector as being particularly important. These factors combined with the relative simplicity and coherence of our policy settings mean that New Zealand enjoys high levels of tax compliance.

So I don’t see any need for an urgent or radical shift in tax policy settings.

But a good tax system comprises good tax policy, supported by a strong tax administration.

And looking ahead, there is an urgent need to improve the way that taxes are administered.

#### The need for change

The Government collects tax revenue to fund health and education, welfare, law and order and justice. It’s used to fund civil defence and emergency response, and so many other vital services. It supports NGOs up and down the country, that work hard to make people’s lives better with programmes like Breakfasts in Schools.

It’s important to keep providing these services, but there are challenges ahead.

The Secretary-General of the United Nations has noted that the fastest growing population segment worldwide is older people.

According to the UN Population Fund, by 2050 the population globally aged over 60 years will be larger than the global population aged under 15 years.

That’s relevant for fiscal policy because it means that we need to start thinking ahead.

An ageing population coupled with the increasing demand for world class healthcare and other services, will contribute to fiscal pressures.

The time to act is now, and today I am very happy to announce the Government’s response to begin preparing for our future.

I’m not talking about imposing new taxes or raising tax rates.

Instead we’re going to focus on making tax easier. Easier understand, easier to comply with, and easier for everyone to pay their fair share.

I’ve already said that our tax policies are amongst the best in the world. We need to ensure that they are applied and work as intended.

Today we take the first step towards modernising our tax administration.

In New Zealand we have a very high rate of compliance with the tax laws.

Compliance with tax obligations is actually a crucial consideration for any economy.

The overwhelming majority, who do the right thing and pay their taxes on time, are doing their bit for society and for the economy, and we don’t take that for granted.

So when people get into difficulties and seek help, the tax department will help work out a solution. But we can and must do a lot more than that.

#### Modernising tax administration

An important factor in encouraging compliance is to meet taxpayers’ expectations of customer service in the 21st century.

It is not just about replacing an ageing computer system. It’s about simplifying and modernising tax administration to reflect changes in technology, to meet customer expectations and to get us into good shape to face future opportunities.

The advent of the internet has meant a sea change for so many aspects of our lives. We now grocery shop online, pay bills and book hotels and flights online – and we can even watch the Black Caps from our phones.

The world is changing, and now it’s time the benefits of those changes were available to the New Zealand taxpayer.

Inland Revenue must be able to deliver in a world that’s moving fast.

It’s our opportunity to build a tax system that will best serve the needs and requirements of the public and of the Government now and in the future.

It’s in everyone’s interests to make it easy for those who want to do the right thing to comply.

Equally it needs to make it difficult _not_ to comply.

And for a system that depends on voluntary compliance, we need tax to be fair and _seen_ to be fair.

#### Consultation documents

In the last 2 years we have done the ground work. We have spoken to groups, businesses, and individuals to understand what New Zealanders want to see fixed – the pain points for businesses and individuals – and how we can change tax administration rules to solve these.

We formed the Transformation Reference Group, the Simplification Panel and ICT Reference Group, to bring a range of external views on what’s needed, to challenge our thinking, and to identify benefits that can be delivered soon. These three groups represent large corporates, small and medium businesses, the ICT industry and individuals.

We ran a pilot in Hawkes Bay targeting small business owners. The “Save Time” campaign asked customers what Inland Revenue could do to make life easier for them. More than 1500 people contributed ideas and the simplification panel is working through these.

We have met, and continue to meet regularly, with accountants and the tax industry on policy and operational issues. We have spoken at ICT industry breakfasts and continue to meet regularly with key people in New Zealand’s ICT Industry.

Last year Treasury, Inland Revenue, and Victoria University hosted the Tax Administration for the 21st Century Conference, with a wide range of international and New Zealand speakers, to gain a good understanding of stakeholder views. The work of that conference has directly contributed to the ideas I am launching today.

So today I formally launch the transformation of tax administration in this country with the release of the first two consultation papers – in which we ask New Zealanders for their opinions on the future shape of tax service delivery.

The first document provides an overview of the general direction of the transformation programme as a whole, while the second document explores questions relating to providing better digital services.

The transformation programme is designed in a series of bite-sized pieces, each delivering benefits to New Zealand and providing a platform for the next step.

For example, it could be that we design a more customer-friendly, future-focused system to collect PAYE information, reducing compliance costs for employers.

This improved information collection in turn would benefit their workers because Inland Revenue would have more accurate information, making their tax return process much simpler.

PAYE information and deductions are massively important to the Government so we should be able to offer New Zealand a better option than the current process for receiving that information; the employer monthly schedule, or EMS.

The purpose of the EMS is good, but sadly it is a time-consuming, labour-intensive way for IRD to collect the vital payroll information it needs.

One way to reduce tax compliance costs for businesses is to create systems that provide for the transfer of two-way information between say the business’s payroll system and Inland Revenue’s.

This means that PAYE obligations would not be a separate process which adds time and costs but be met as part of the employer’s normal payroll process.

That is why we established a working group with 20 representatives from small, medium and large software developers to co-design how GST and PAYE information can be transferred to Inland Revenue in the future. In tandem, we are working closely with MYOB and XERO on how we can simplify tax processes for small businesses.

Integrating tax information into normal business practices is an attractive idea, but it creates some challenges in potentially requiring every employer to move to digital. We need to be careful we’re not simply shifting costs from government to business.

The Government believes that if businesses are spending less time on complying with tax obligations, they could be spending that time in more productive activities, such as growing their business.

I won’t go into all the details, but some of the other highlights in the consultation document include:

*   Investigating options for simplifying the calculation of provisional tax
*   integrating employers’ tax obligations into business processes, and
*   providing individuals with an online return which lists PAYE income information received from their employer.

#### Policy considerations

In rolling out its programme Inland Revenue will have to bear in mind the impact on business and the compliance costs associated with having to make changes to systems.

This will require ongoing stakeholder engagement to ensure that the Government is fully aware of the impacts on business so that they can be taken into account in planning for the implementation of the changes. For those businesses that do use an online system, I think this approach will reduce compliance costs over time.

While it is clearly desirable to avoid unnecessary compliance costs imposed on business in moving to digital channels, there may be one-off costs associated with software being able to interface with Inland Revenue’s.

But all of this will be explored in the public consultation and I will welcome your input on the proposals.

To comment on the proposals there is an online forum as well as the usual suite of consultation documents. Make sure you grab an information pack before you leave today. It has copies of these documents.

#### Conclusion

I said before that our rate of voluntary compliance is high.

It’s high because people believe that the laws are generally fair. And what makes them fair is that the public has had an opportunity to comment and shape those laws.

An internationally recognised strength of New Zealand’s tax system is its reliance on public consultation in order to ensure that tax policy proposals are effective and fair.

Because of your interest in the well-being of the economy, it is crucial that you express your views on the future of our tax administration.

A well-functioning tax system is one that works for the taxpayers it serves. The Government wants to hear your views on what that might look like.

Thank you for joining me for breakfast today. I hope you have enjoyed it. I also hope you have found my description of a future, more customer-focused, business-friendly tax administration equally palatable.

Thank you.

### Tax modernisation programme launched

Revenue Minister Todd McClay today released the first two in a series of public consultations designed to modernise and simplify the tax system.

“Taxes are an important part of a well-functioning modern economy, but it’s important that the costs imposed by taxation are kept to a minimum. The way we run the tax system must keep pace with the needs of taxpayers,” says Mr McClay.

“We need to make tax simpler. That’s why today I am launching public consultation to consider ideas for a tax administration for the future.”

Mr McClay launched the programme at a breakfast hosted by the Wellington Employers’ Chamber of Commerce.

“We need tax administration to be simple to use and new technology can help achieve that” Mr McClay says.

The first document, _Making Tax Simpler – a Government green paper on tax administration_ aims to introduce New Zealand to the overall direction of the tax administration modernisation programme and seeks feedback on that direction. Consultation on that topic closes on 29 May 2015.

“This is an opportunity to stand back, look at our tax system as a whole and make changes that will simplify the system for the benefit of all New Zealanders. At the same time, we will modernise the technology that runs the tax system.” Says Mr McClay.

The second consultation document, _Better Digital Services_ outlines proposals for greater use of electronic and online processes allowing faster, more accurate, more convenient interactions with Inland Revenue. Consultation closes on 15 May 2015.

“We are already working with New Zealand software development companies on solutions to simplify and significantly reduce the amount of time businesses spend on tax compliance. A working group with 20 representatives from small, medium and large software developers has been meeting since October last year to co-design how GST and PAYE information can be transferred to IRD in the future. In tandem, IRD is working with MYOB and Xero on how we can simplify tax processes for small businesses.

“The scale of the change proposed for the tax administration is unlike anything we’ve contemplated before and the proposals contained in the consultations launched today will affect us all at some level.

“This is your chance to help us build a simpler tax system because a simpler system is a better system” Mr McClay says.

Budget 2015 – property compliance proposals announced
=====================================================

The Prime Minister John Key announced proposals today to improve tax compliance in the property investment sector. The proposals, which are not aimed at the main family home, include:

\- A New Zealand IRD number will be required as part of the land transfer process.

\- As part of the land transfer process, non-resident buyers and sellers must also provide their tax identification number from their home country.

\- Non-residents will also need a New Zealand bank account before they can get an IRD number in order to buy a property.

\- Gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.

\- An extra Budget allocation for Inland Revenue work investigating property compliance, aggressive tax planning and hidden economy initiatives.

Media statement

### Budget 2015: Taxing property gains fairly

The Budget will include extra measures to ensure that people buying and selling residential property for profit – including overseas buyers – pay their fair share of tax, Prime Minister John Key says.

“People calling for a new capital gains tax often overlook the fact that under existing rules, anyone buying property with the intention of selling for a gain is liable for tax on that gain,” Mr Key told the National Party’s Lower North Island regional conference in Lower Hutt today.

“Everyone – whether from New Zealand or overseas – should pay their fair share of tax according to the law. So we need to ensure the existing law is enforced.”

Mr Key confirmed the Budget this week will contain several measures to bolster tax rules on property transactions and to help Inland Revenue enforce them.

They include:

*   Providing Inland Revenue with extra funding for compliance and enforcement.
*   Requiring non-residents and New Zealanders buying and selling any property other than their main home to provide a New Zealand IRD number.
*   Requiring non-residents to have a New Zealand bank account to get a New Zealand IRD number.
*   Introducing a new “bright line” test to tax gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase, unless it’s the seller’s main home, inherited or transferred in a relationship property settlement.

The changes will be subject to consultation and take effect on 1 October this year. The “bright line” test will apply to properties bought on or after that date.

“These measures will not affect New Zealanders’ main home, although existing tax rules will still apply in addition to these new steps,” Mr Key says.

“They are aimed squarely at ensuring that property buyers – including overseas speculators - who buy residential property with the intention of selling for a gain pay their fair share of tax as required by the law.

“It’s not unreasonable to expect that if you buy an investment property and sell it for a gain within two years, then you should be taxed on that gain.

“This is quite different to an investor buying with a long-term view of renting their property to tenants. And it’s completely different to New Zealand owner-occupiers who have worked hard to buy their family home.”

Mr Key says that while the current law is clear about taxing property gains, decisions often rely on the intent of the buyers or an assessment of their intentions by Inland Revenue.

“One of the reasons this has become an issue, particularly with overseas investors, is that we don’t always have good information about them. And some overseas investors can be difficult to track down – even if Inland Revenue knows they owe tax.”

Mr Key says New Zealanders would expect Inland Revenue to apply the same tax rules on overseas property investors that are applied to New Zealand property buyers.

“That’s what these changes are about. As New Zealanders, we expect each other to pay our fair share of tax.

“That same requirement must also apply to overseas residents. The Government welcomes overseas investment, but in return those investors must follow our rules when it comes to tax,” Mr Key says.

### Budget 2015: Extra property tax measures

The Government is taking extra steps to bolster the tax rules on property transactions – including those by overseas buyers - and to help Inland Revenue enforce them, Finance Minister Bill English and Revenue Minister Todd McClay say.

The tax measures are also expected to take some of the heat out of Auckland’s housing market and sit alongside the Reserve Bank’s latest moves to address associated financial stability issues, Mr English says.

“Taken together, they will help Inland Revenue enforce existing tax rules, provide it with extra resources and ensure that property investors pay their fair share of tax – whether they’re from New Zealand or overseas.”

The Budget this week will confirm that, from 1 October this year, the following will be required when any property is bought or sold:

*   All non-residents and New Zealanders buying and selling any property other than their main home must provide a New Zealand IRD number as part of the usual land transfer process with Land Information New Zealand.
*   In addition, all non-resident buyers and sellers must provide their tax identification number from their home country, along with current identification requirements such as a passport.
*   And to ensure that our full anti-money laundering rules apply to non-residents before they buy a property, non-residents must have a New Zealand bank account before they can get a New Zealand IRD number.
*   In addition, a new “bright line” test will be introduced for non-residents and New Zealanders buying residential property, to supplement Inland Revenue’s current “intentions” test. Under this new test, gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.

“Tax rules are complex and affect people in different ways, so we will consult on these measures before they take effect on 1 October,” Mr English says.

The “bright line” test will then apply to properties bought on or after 1 October.

To further ensure overseas property buyers meet both existing tax requirements and those of the new test, the Government will investigate introducing a withholding tax for non-residents selling residential property.

Officials will consult on these details with a view to this withholding tax being introduced around the middle of 2016.

Mr English reiterated owner-occupiers of residential property will not be affected by the new measures when they sell their main home, or if property is inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.

“It’s important to reiterate that these changes will not apply to New Zealanders’ main home, although existing tax rules will still apply in addition to these new measures,” Mr English says.

“It’s equally important that people buying residential property for gains meet their tax obligations, whether they are from New Zealand or overseas.

“The combination of collecting IRD numbers and introducing this new bright-line test will help ensure that non-residents pay their fair share of tax in New Zealand.”

Since Budget 2010, the Government has provided Inland Revenue with $33 million more for property tax compliance and enforcement. In return, up to March this year, this has resulted in an extra $258 million of assessed tax revenue – a return of over $7.80 for every $1 invested.

The Budget will provide Inland Revenue with a further $29 million for property tax compliance, taking its total budget for work in this area over the next five years to $62 million. This is expected to generate around $420 million of additional assessed tax in the coming five years.

Mr McClay says the extra information disclosure requirements for property buyers, particularly for non-residents, will help Inland Revenue track and identify transactions that are likely to be taxable.

“In particular, they will allow Inland Revenue to share information about non-residents with overseas tax authorities,” he says.

“Under the current law, anyone buying property with the intention of selling it for a gain is liable for tax on that gain. As the extra tax assessed confirms, Inland Revenue has had good success in enforcing the existing rules in recent years.

“So we’re providing Inland Revenue with more resources, information and tools to ensure that both New Zealand and non-resident property investors pay their fair share of tax.

“The new bright line test will create a clearer rule that ensures buyers who sell properties within two years are taxed on their gains, subject to the few exemptions we’ve set out.

“They will still be subject to tax under existing rules if they buy a property with the intention of selling the property for gain – even if they do so outside the two-year “bright line” period,” Mr McClay says.

### PROPERTY TAX MEASURES – FACT SHEET

#### Summary

*   The Budget will include steps to bolster the tax rules on property transactions and to help Inland Revenue enforce them.
*   These measures will ensure that property investors pay their fair share of tax – whether they are from New Zealand or overseas.

#### What is changing?

The Budget will provide $29 million of extra funding specifically for Inland Revenue to increase its property tax compliance activities, taking its total budget in this area over the next five years to $62 million. This follows an extra $33 million for property compliance and enforcement since Budget 2010.

After consultation, the following will be required when any property is bought and sold from 1 October this year:

*   All non-residents and New Zealanders buying and selling any property other than their main home must provide a New Zealand IRD number as part of the usual land transfer process with Land Information New Zealand.
*   All non-resident buyers and sellers must provide their tax identification number from their home country, along with current identification, such as a passport.
*   To ensure that our full anti-money laundering rules apply to non-residents before they buy a property, all non-residents must have a New Zealand bank account before they can get a New Zealand IRD number.
*   In addition, a new “bright line” test will be introduced for non-residents and New Zealanders buying residential property, to supplement Inland Revenue’s current “intentions” test. Under this new test, gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or sold as part of a relationship property settlement. The new test will apply to properties bought on or after 1 October.

#### What’s the purpose of these measures?

Under New Zealand’s existing tax laws, anyone who buys a property with the intention of selling it for a gain is liable for tax on any gain. This applies equally to New Zealanders and to overseas buyers. The Government wants to make sure this existing law in enforced across the board.

The measures announced today will bolster the tax rules on property transactions and help Inland Revenue enforce them. In turn, this is expected to take some heat out of Auckland’s housing market

#### Extra funding for Inland Revenue

The $29 million of extra funding in Budget 2015 will be used to increase property tax compliance activities. This will focus on targeting property speculation, particularly in Auckland and Christchurch.

This will take Inland Revenue’s total budget for work in this area over the next five years to $62 million. In return, this is expected to generate around $420 million of additional assessed tax over the next five years. Since 2010, the Government has provided Inland Revenue with an extra $33 million for property tax compliance, and this has led to an extra $258 million of assessed tax – a return of over $7.80 for every $1 invested.

#### More information from property transactions

From 1 October, all non-residents and New Zealanders buying or selling property other than their main home must provide a New Zealand IRD number as part of the usual land registration process.

If a person is resident for tax purposes in another jurisdiction, they will also have to provide any tax identification number (which is the equivalent of an IRD number) that has been issued to them by that country.

This information will help Inland Revenue identify people who may be trading property for the purpose of making gains in the New Zealand market. Inland Revenue will also be able to provide information to overseas tax authorities in line with existing New Zealand legislation.

#### Anti-money laundering rules

As a prerequisite to applying for an IRD number, a non-resident will need to open a New Zealand bank account. This will ensure that non-residents investing in residential property are subject to our full anti-money laundering rules.

#### “Bright line” test

The new “bright line” test will require income tax to be paid if a residential property is bought and sold within two years, unless it is the seller’s main home. Following consultation on details, the test will apply to residential property bought on or after 1 October 2015.

If a property is sold within two years, any gains on sale will be taxed at the seller’s normal income tax rate. Sellers will need to include the gain in their income tax return for the year.

There are a small number of exemptions from the “bright line” test - if the property being sold is the seller’s main home, if it is inherited, or if it is transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.

The “bright line” test supplements Inland Revenue’s current “intentions” test for taxing property sales. It will help ensure that people who buy and sell property for gains actually pay tax on those gains. And it means that if property is bought and sold within the two years, there will be a presumption that the gain is taxable unless it falls within the exemptions.

#### Withholding tax for non-residents

To further ensure overseas property buyers meet both existing tax requirements and those of the new test, the Government will investigate introducing a withholding tax for non-residents selling residential property.

Some overseas property buyers and sellers can be difficult to track down - even if Inland Revenue knows they owe tax. Requiring non-resident property buyers to provide a New Zealand IRD number will help Inland Revenue to identify which of them should pay the new withholding tax under the new “bright line” test.

Officials will consult on the details with a view to the withholding tax being introduced around the middle of 2016.

#### What is the process from here?

The Government will consult on the details of the measures announced today. An issues paper will be released in July on the “bright line” test before legislation is introduced by late August. The new test will then apply to properties bought on or after 1 October.

### **Budget 2015 tax announcements**

The Government’s 2015 Budget contains a range of tax-related measures, including a change to KiwiSaver, proposals to address child poverty, social housing and improving property compliance.

#### KiwiSaver

The Government has announced its intention to repeal the $1,000 kick start payment for new enrollees. The change is expected to come into effect from 2pm on 21 May 2015.

Media statement – [KiwiSaver $1,000 kick-start payment to cease](#statement-kiwisaver)

#### Child support

Two measures were proposed today to address child support debt. These aim to encourage liable parents to re-engage with their child support obligations and strengthen Inland Revenue’s ability to work with parents to help control and manage their child support debts:

*   extending the write-off of monthly incremental penalties to more parents. This will apply from 1 April 2016; and
*   an amendment to the penalty write-off tests to adopt a more pragmatic “fair and reasonable” test. The “fair and reasonable” test is proposed to apply on a discretionary, case-by-case basis from 1 April 2016.

Media statement - [Forgiving debt to encourage child support payments](#statement-child-support)

#### Children in hardship

A proposed amendment was announced to increase the rate of the in-work tax credit and increase the Working for Families tax credits abatement rate from 1 April 2016. This is part of wider changes proposed by the Government and more information on this can be found on the [Budget 2015 website](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2015)
.

#### Social housing

A proposed amendment was announced to clarify that payments made by the Ministry of Social Development to social housing providers to the extent the payments relate to the provision of social housing are GST-exempt. This is consistent with payments for residential accommodation more generally. This is part of a wider package on social housing initiatives and more information on this can be found on the [Budget 2015 website](http://www.treasury.govt.nz/budget/2015)
.

#### Property

To help ensure that a fair amount of tax is paid by all, the Government has announced three tax-related proposals aimed at improving compliance in the property investment sector.

*   A New Zealand IRD number will be required as part of the land transfer process.
*   As part of the land transfer process, non-resident buyers and sellers must also provide their tax identification number from their home country.
*   Non-residents will also need a New Zealand bank account before they can get an IRD number in order to buy a property.
*   Gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.
*   An extra Budget allocation to Inland Revenue for investigating aggressive tax planning, property compliance and hidden economy initiatives.

### KiwiSaver $1,000 kick-start payment to cease

People enrolling in KiwiSaver from 2pm today will no longer receive a $1,000 kick-start payment, Finance Minister Bill English says. The change does not affect existing KiwiSaver members.

“KiwiSaver has been successful in attracting members, with 2.5 million New Zealanders having a KiwiSaver account and together receiving $2.5 billion in kick-start payments since the scheme started in 2007,” Mr English says.

“However, it also has considerable costs for taxpayers. The Government will spend more than $850 million this year on two subsidies – the ongoing government subsidy of up to $521 a year per member and the $1,000 kick-start.

“Because of these costs, the Government has decided to remove the $1,000 kick-start payment from today.”

Contributing KiwiSaver members aged 18 or over or under 65 will continue to receive an annual Member Tax Credit from the Government of up to $521.

Employers in general are still required to contribute at least 3 per cent of an employee’s gross wage or salary and employees will continue to make their own contributions.

“Removing the kick-start payment for future enrolments will save over $500 million over the next four years,” Mr English says. “This money is being reinvested in this Budget into priority public services.”

In 2015/16, the Government is forecast to spend $705 million on the KiwiSaver Member Tax Credit plus $12.3 billion on New Zealand Superannuation.

“Auto-enrolment when starting a new job, the 3 per cent employer contribution and the member tax credit of up to $521 each year means people still have an incentive to sign-up to KiwiSaver and to keep saving for their retirement.

### Forgiving debt to encourage child support payments

Budget 2015 includes changes to tackle child support debt and to encourage parents to pay what they owe for children for whom they are responsible, Revenue Minister Todd McClay says.

Over the next four years, the Government will forgive around $1.7 billion of penalties owed by parents to encourage more support to reach children.

“Child Support debt is currently $3.2 billion and rising, and only around $700 million is actual child support,” Mr McClay says.

“The rest is debt from penalties. This is the legacy of a penalty system that was overly punitive and which is now being changed.

“We need to get parents to start paying so that children, many of whom are in hardship, are better off. Liable parents are facing paralysing levels of debt from penalties, and as a result are not attempting to pay their outstanding amount, nor are they meeting their current obligations.

“Many have chosen to leave New Zealand. Some $827 million of the total debt, of which most is penalties, is owed by people living in Australia.

”A further $778 million, of which 84 per cent is penalty debt, is owed by those living outside New Zealand and Australia.

“This is in no one’s interests. We want child support paid so it goes directly to the children who need it, or back to the taxpayers who are paying it by default in the form of a benefit to that child’s family.”

Many people receiving or paying child support are on low incomes. Almost 54,000 of the 120,000 people with child support debt earn less than $30,000 annually.

And those low earners owe more than $700 million of the total $3.2 billion in debt.

“We want liable parents to pay what they owe,” Mr McClay says. “To make that happen, Inland Revenue will adopt a ‘fair and reasonable’ test to consider applying penalty relief where it makes sense to do so.

“In addition, mandatory write-offs of monthly incremental penalties will apply to those liable parents who are paying by compulsory deduction and meeting their payment requirements.”

If maximum discretion is applied, this will result in $1.7 billion of penalties being forgiven over four years.

More than $1.6 billion of this is already reflected as an impairment in the Government’s books. The measures will result in a net estimated decrease in Crown operating revenue of $47.1 million over the next four years. This is the value of the penalties currently in the Government’s books, less the expected increase in child support payments to the Crown.

In future, the growth of child support debt will be slowed by changes made in the recent child support reforms, including;

*   Replacing the penalty rates from 10 per cent for late payment with a two-stage penalty, (2 per cent if a payment is not made by the due date, and a further 8 per cent if the amount remains unpaid after seven days).
*   Reducing monthly incremental penalties from 2 per cent to 1 per cent.

“These measures should not be seen as a soft option,” Mr McClay says. “We remain focused on liable parents meeting the obligations to their children and will have no tolerance for parents who deliberately avoid responsibility.

“We intend to use every measure available to us to collect debt from those who do not make arrangements for payment even though they are able, including arrest at the border for people who have consistently refused to pay.

“Improving the rate of child support collected means more money going to low-income New Zealand families who rely on it to help cover the cost of raising children,” Mr McClay says.

All changes are expected to take effect from 1 April 2016.

### Paving the way for a simpler tax system

A tax bill to be introduced today will help prepare the ground for simplification of the tax administration system, says Revenue Minister Todd McClay.

Mr McClay says changes proposed in the Taxation (Transformation: First Phase Simplification and Other Measures) Bill will remove some of the legislative obstacles to making the tax administration system simpler and more certain for New Zealand.

“For example, the bill proposes an amendment to allow earlier tax refunds based on personal tax summaries that meet the automatic refund threshold, reducing the wait time from 30 days to 15 days, and increasing the threshold for automatic refunds from $200 to $600. This means approximately another 400,000 people will benefit from these changes.

“Other measures focus on reforming the way Inland Revenue is able to communicate with its customers. Much of our current tax law was written before the explosion of digital devices and it doesn’t reflect the way information between Inland Revenue and its customers can be sent,” Mr McClay says.

“Under the current tax rules, certain communications must be “in writing” or delivered “by post”, even though providing information electronically would be better and more efficient for customers and for Inland Revenue.

“This bill begins our simplification of tax legislation by proposing to remove references to outdated modes of communication and provide modern and relevant rules that will support electronic communication to be used in the same way as paper communications,” Mr McClay says.

Measures in the bill, such as simplifying the current tax rules for employee share schemes would also be welcomed, following feedback received earlier this year on proposals to make the rules less onerous for employees participating in these schemes by allowing employers to withhold tax on an employee’s behalf.

“Other proposals in the bill will allow Inland Revenue to share certain information where it makes customers’ lives easier,” he says.

“They include allowing Inland Revenue to supply a KiwiSaver scheme provider with the names and details of members who have transferred out of their schemes and the name of the members’ new providers, providing special tax codes directly to the Ministry of Social Development to help those receiving New Zealand Superannuation or a veteran’s pension to meet their income tax obligations, and sharing information collected and held for tax purposes with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and with WorkSafe, to help identify those responsible for breaches of workplace safety.

“These, and other measures proposed in this bill represent a small but important step in Inland Revenue’s longer term Business Transformation to modernise the way the tax system is administered, and make it easier for people to get their tax right,” says Mr McClay.

“While the bill is focussed on tax simplification, the Government is committed to reducing compliance costs for taxpayers more generally throughout the Business Transformation programme.

For example, from 1 July this year, taxpayers using the pooling method of depreciation will be able to include assets valued up to $5,000. The pooling method allows taxpayers to group low-value assets together and depreciate them as a single item; thereby reducing the number of calculations needed each tax year. The previous asset threshold was $2,000, and the new threshold applies for the 2015 –16 tax year.

### Online GST discussion document released

Revenue Minister, Todd McClay, today released a discussion document on the collection of GST for online purchases.

_GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods_ contains proposals to require overseas suppliers to register and return GST when they sell services (including online products such as e-books, music and videos) to New Zealand consumers. It also outlines the way forward for improving the collection of GST on all goods, including low-value imported goods.

”This document is an important first step in dealing with the increasing volume of purchases that should, under New Zealand’s tax rules, be subject to GST,” Mr McClay says.

“It is about creating a level playing field for collecting GST and putting New Zealand businesses and jobs ahead of the interests of overseas retailers, but it must be done with the least possible inconvenience to New Zealand consumers.”

He says the volume of services, online downloads and goods purchased by New Zealanders from overseas suppliers on which no GST is paid is an increasing concern for the Government.

“Current estimates put the amount of GST foregone on these purchases at approximately $180 million a year, and growing at around 10 per cent each year.

“That is revenue that would otherwise be available to the Government to help fund essential services like healthcare, education and safer communities in New Zealand,” Mr McClay says.

“It is not just about the loss of revenue on these purchases, it is also about fairness. We recognise that New Zealand suppliers, including retailers, must charge GST on goods and services they supply to their customers, whereas offshore suppliers currently do not.”

Proposals released for public feedback would cover a wide range of services purchased by New Zealand residents from overseas suppliers They include both digital services such as internet downloads and online services, as well as more traditional services such as legal and accounting services supplied remotely.

“The proposals are a pragmatic response to a growing worldwide phenomenon, and broadly aligned with similar rules announced by Australia earlier this year, and with the current rules in the European Union.

“They are also consistent with draft OECD guidelines due to be finalised and released later this year as part of the OECD’s wider recommendations around the problem of base erosion and profit shifting,” says Mr McClay.

Mr McClay says that while the discussion document primarily focuses on services, the fact that GST is not charged on low-value imported goods, below the Customs _de minimis_, is also of concern for the Government. The growing volume of imported goods means the amount of forgone GST is continuing to increase and raises concerns for domestic suppliers.

“For that reason, the consultation document raises the matter for discussion. Customs is currently reviewing how the collection of GST on imported goods can be improved and is due to report to Ministers on the findings by October.

“This is expected to be followed by a consultation process on the issue of _de minimis_,” Mr McClay says.

The document discusses some of the options and asks for feedback. This separate consultation paper on the de minimis threshold will be released in the near future and submissions will be able to be made as part of that process.

### Q&As – GST: Cross-border services, intangibles and goods

### What is the discussion document about?

The document is about the current problem of GST not being collected on cross-border services (including internet downloads and other online services) and imported goods that are below the “de minimis” threshold (typically goods below the value of NZ$400).

The discussion document seeks submissions on proposed rules that would require offshore suppliers of services to return GST on services purchased by New Zealand-resident consumers. This approach is advocated by the OECD and has been adopted in countries of the European Union. It has also recently been proposed in Australia.

The document also discusses the collection of GST on low-value imported goods and seeks submissions on this issue.

Customs is undertaking some work in this area and is assessing ways to lower the cost of collecting GST on imported goods. Customs will report back to the Government on this work by October this year. Following this report, it is also anticipated that a consultation paper, specifically focusing on the GST treatment of low-value imported goods, will be released and further submissions will be encouraged as part of that process.

Submissions on this discussion document close on 25 September 2015.

### Why doesn’t the Government currently tax imported goods and services?

When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased services from offshore, and online digital products were not yet available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs involved in taxing cross-border services potentially outweighed the benefits of taxation.

In terms of imported goods, New Zealand and other countries apply “de minimis” thresholds below which no duty, including GST, is collected on the imported goods. De minimis thresholds are applied to facilitate the flow of goods and to ensure that the cost of collecting GST on low-value goods does not outweigh the benefits of doing so.

New Zealand’s de minimis is set at a level under which it is estimated that the costs of collecting the duty begin to exceed the revenue the duty generates. It is a higher threshold than that set by many countries but lower than the Australian threshold of AU$1,000.

### Why is the Government seeking to tax goods and services purchased from offshore suppliers?

The principal issue is about fairness. Domestic suppliers return GST on goods and services they sell to New Zealand customers whereas offshore suppliers are not required to return GST. This puts domestic retailers at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers.

The growing e-commerce market also means the amount of GST not being collected on imported goods and services is increasing. Current estimates put the amount of GST foregone on these purchases at approximately $180 million a year (of which about $40 million relates to services and intangibles), and growing at around 10 percent each year. Government revenues pay for important public services such as education, healthcare, roads and superannuation.

### What are the main features of the proposals?

*   Offshore suppliers of services would be required to register and return GST on services purchased by New Zealand-resident consumers.
*   Offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST if their supplies of services to New Zealand residents exceed a given threshold in a 12-month period. Submissions are sought on what the level of that threshold should be.
*   A wide definition of “services” is proposed, which includes both digital services (such as video, music and software downloads) and more traditional services (such as legal and accounting services received remotely).
*   In some situations, an electronic marketplace or intermediary may be required to register instead of the principal offshore supplier.
*   Submissions are sought on whether offshore suppliers should be required to return GST when they supply services remotely to New Zealand GST-registered businesses and whether these services should count towards the registration threshold.

### Why would offshore suppliers comply with the proposed rules?

When similar rules have been applied in other countries, offshore suppliers – particularly large international suppliers that account for the majority of cross-border services and intangibles – have demonstrated a willingness to comply.

To generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand, the proposed rules would be consistent with the rules that apply in other countries. For offshore suppliers that do not comply, the normal enforcement rules and penalties that apply to New Zealand suppliers are expected to apply.

The OECD, which is producing internationally agreed guidelines on GST and cross-border services and intangibles, also envisages countries cooperating and sharing information to ensure that suppliers comply with registration requirements in different jurisdictions.

### How do the proposals compare with what other countries are doing?

The proposals are similar to the rule that have been operating in Europe since 2003, as well as rules recently announced in Australia that are due to be enacted on 1 July 2017. The proposed rules also closely follow the draft OECD guidelines that are due to be finalised later this year.

### What is the Government doing about the non-collection of GST on imported goods?

The Government is considering a range of options that may allow better collection of GST on low-value imported goods. People are invited to include any concerns about this issue in their submission on the current discussion document.

Officials will report to Ministers by October this year. It is anticipated that a consultation paper on the GST treatment of low-value imported goods will follow that report and further submissions will be able to be made as part of that process.

### Why isn’t the Government proposing to require offshore suppliers of goods to return the GST?

It is currently the Government’s intention to align, where possible, the collection of GST on imported goods with the proposals in the paper relating to the collection of cross-border services and intangibles.

However, no other country has adopted such a system and, therefore, the success of its application to goods is currently uncertain.

Further work is required to determine the viability of options and whether they would in fact lower costs of collection.

It is likely that a combination of approaches would be required.

### Bright-line test targets gains on property sales

Revenue Minister Todd McClay says measures proposed in a tax bill introduced today will improve compliance with the current residential land sale rules and help to ensure that people pay their fair share of tax on gains from property sales.

The main feature of the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill is a proposed new “bright-line” test, which will require income tax to be paid on any gains from residential property purchased and sold within two years, with some exceptions. The exceptions include the sale of an owner’s main home, inherited property, or the transfer of property in a relationship settlement.

“The proposed new test will only apply to the sale of “residential land” – it does not apply to land predominantly used as business premises or farmland.

“The bright-line test makes it clear that all property buyers, including overseas buyers, who buy and sell a residential property within two years, will be taxed on their gains,” he says.

The bill defines certain terms in the Income Tax Act 2007 to make it easier for taxpayers to understand their income tax responsibilities when selling a property or residential land that is subject to the bright-line test. For example, the bill defines what “residential land” is and what a person’s “main home” is.

It also defines the start and end of the two-year bright-line period. The period generally starts when a person obtains registered title for the property, and ends when the person enters into an agreement to sell the property. An additional rule applies for sales “off the plan”.

The bill limits the use of losses arising under the bright-line test. The bill also includes an anti-avoidance rule to prevent companies or trusts being used to circumvent the test.

“The proposed bright-line test follows the Government’s consideration of feedback received during public consultation undertaken in June this year.

“It will supplement the current “intention” test in the Income Tax Act 2007, which can be difficult to enforce.

“The changes proposed in this bill, together with those included in the recently introduced Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill, will help Inland Revenue to more accurately identify investors in residential property – here and overseas – and ensure they pay their fair share of tax”, says Mr McClay.

A summary of the Bright-line Test and Q&As are attached.

* * *

### Q&As – Bright-line Bill

#### Application date – all existing property is grandparented

Andrew buys a rental property in February 2015 and sells the property on 1 April 2016. This sale is not subject to the bright-line test because the property was purchased before 1 October 2015.

#### Rental property – 2-year period

Helen buys a rental property and gets registered title to the property on 15 November 2015. She rents the property out. She decides to accept a very good offer for the property and enters into an agreement to sell the property on 1 August 2016. Is Helen subject to the bright-line test?

Yes, the property has been bought and sold within the two-year period measured from 15 November 2015 to 1 August 2016, being the relevant dates. Helen must include the gain on the sale of the property in her income tax return for the 2016–17 tax year.

#### Additional rule for sales “off the plan”

Deepak enters into an agreement to buy a bare section in a planned subdivision on 1 December 2015. The purchase of the section is due to settle (with title passing) in December 2018. Deepak enters into an agreement to sell his interest in the property to a third party on 10 December 2016. Is Deepak subject to the bright-line test on the sale of his interest in the property?

Yes, Deepak has sold an interest in bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it. As Deepak has not had legal title to the land transferred to him at the time of sale, the additional rule for “off the plan” sales applies. The relevant 2-year period for “off the plan” sales is from the entering into of the contract to buy (1 December 2015) until the entering into of the contract to sell (10 December 2016). The bright-line test applies in this example because the period is less than 2 years.

#### Original acquisition date of land applies for subdivisions

Iosefa owns a large property in Wellington, which he bought in 2010. In December 2015, he decides to subdivide the property and sell off the back section. Is Iosefa liable for tax on the sale of the back section under the bright-line test?

No, the acquisition date for the subdivided section is the original acquisition date for the property (being 2010).

#### Farmland versus life-style block – capable of being farmed

James lives in a city apartment and decides to buy a small lifestyle block for his retirement in 10 years’ time. He gets registered title to the property on 5 January 2016. The lifestyle block has a house and a paddock. He rents it out to a local family to live in and grazes a few sheep on the paddock to keep the grass down. James decides to sell the lifestyle block in late 2016. Is James taxable on the sale under the bright-line test?

Yes, the land is residential land because it has a dwelling on it and it is not farmland (because it is not capable of being farmed as an economic unit due to its small size).

#### Sale following change of job – main home exception

Manu buys a property on 1 November 2015 as his main home. Three months later, he is made redundant and needs to leave town to get a new job. He sells his property and moves to a new town for his new job. Is Manu taxable under the bright-line test on any gain on the sale of the property?

No, the main home exemption applies to the property because Manu has occupied the property mainly as his residence during his ownership.

#### Secondment – must actually live in the property for majority of time

Andrea buys a Christchurch property on 30 December 2015 intending to use the property as her main home. Six months later, she takes a secondment position in Sydney for two years. She rents out the property after she leaves. She decides to sell her Christchurch property 12 months into the secondment. Is Andrea taxable under the bright-line test on any gain from the sale of the property?

Yes, the main home exception does not apply because she has not occupied her Christchurch property as her main home for the majority of the time she has owned the property.

#### Apartment bought for family member – owners must live in the property

Jane is a student from England studying in New Zealand. Her English resident parents have purchased an apartment on 1 December 2015 in Auckland for her to live in while she is studying in New Zealand. After one year studying, Jane decides to return home and her parents sell the apartment on 30 January 2017. Are the parents subject to the bright-line test on the sale proceeds?

Yes, the apartment has been bought and sold within two years and the main home exception does not apply because the owners have not used the property as their main home during their period of ownership.

#### Mixed use property

Andrew and Bill buy a two-storey property with a dwelling on the top floor and a larger shop on the ground floor on 1 November 2015. They rent out the dwelling and operate a business from the ground floor. Their circumstances change and they sell the property on 1 July 2016. Are they taxable under the bright-line test?

No, the property has predominantly been used as business premises and is therefore not subject to the bright-line test.

#### Habitual buyer and seller – Only 2 main homes in 2 years

Josh has a practice of regularly buying residential properties, living in them while renovating them, and then selling them within six months of purchase. During a two year period, he buys and sells three properties. Is he liable for tax on any gains on the sale of the properties under the bright-line test?

Josh is not liable for tax under the bright-line test on the sale of the first two properties in the two-year period because of the main home exception. However, he may be liable for tax under the other land sale rules on the first two properties. Josh will be liable for tax under the bright-line test for the sale of the third property, because the habitual seller exception applies.

#### Inheritance – transfers and subsequent sales excluded

Jean buys an investment property on 1 November 2015. She dies on 1 March 2016. The property passes to the executor of Jean’s will and subsequently to her daughter, Mary. Mary sells the property on 30 April 2016. Is Mary liable under the bright-line test for tax on any gains on the sale?

No, the exception for inherited property applies.

#### Relationship separation – transfer exempt but subsequent sale may be taxable

Jack and Jill get married in June 2015 and purchase a house and a rental property together on 15 December 2015. Six months into the marriage they decide to separate. Jill gets the house and the investment property under the relationship property agreement. Jill continues to live in the house as her main home. She decides to sell the house and the investment property in July 2016 (ie within two years of purchasing the properties). Is Jill taxable under the bright-line test?

Jill will not be taxable on the sale of the house because it has been her main home for the period she has owned the property (either jointly or subsequently on her own). The sale of the rental property will be subject to the bright-line test because it has been bought and sold within two years.

#### Ring-fenced losses for bright-line sales

Pierre bought an Auckland rental property in 2011 with the intention of selling it, so any gains from the sale of the property are subject to the current land sale rules. In January 2016, he buys a rental investment property in Dunedin that he intends to retain for the long-term. His plans change and he has to sell both properties at once in October 2016. The Dunedin rental property is subject to the bright-line test because it was bought and sold within two years. The Auckland apartment makes a $50,000 gain and the Dunedin rental property makes a $120,000 loss. What amount of income does Pierre have to return in his income tax return?

In the 2016–17 tax year, Pierre has made a $50,000 gain and a $120,000 bright-line loss. However, the amount of bright-line loss he can claim in the 2016–17 year is limited to the amount of the $50,000 gain. This has the effect of reducing his property income for the tax year to nil. He has to carry forward the remainder of the bright-line loss of $70,000 to a subsequent year to offset against other property income.

### Residential property withholding tax proposed for offshore sellers

Public consultation begins today on the Government’s proposed residential land withholding tax with the release of a paper seeking public feedback.

Revenue Minister Todd McClay welcomed the release and says the proposed tax would apply only to offshore sellers. He says it is an important part of the Government’s residential property tax compliance work and will ensure tax is paid under the Bright-line test legislation.

“Under the proposed Bright-line test, which I introduced last week, gains from residential property sold within two years of purchase will be taxed, unless the property is the seller’s main home, inherited from a deceased estate or transferred as part of a relationship property settlement.

“The objective is to target those people who are seeking to make a quick gain from property, whether they are based in New Zealand or overseas.

“However, it can be more difficult to collect tax from people speculating on property in New Zealand if that seller lives overseas. For this reason we are proposing that a portion of the sales proceeds are withheld at the time of sale and paid to Inland Revenue as a pre-payment or bond against any tax that may be due,” says Mr McClay.

“We want all people buying and selling property for profit to know that we expect due taxes to be paid.

“Together with the other measures announced in Budget 2015, the proposed withholding tax should go a long way towards bolstering our property tax rules and improving tax compliance amongst property speculators,” Mr McClay says.

The consultation document, a summary of the proposals, and Q&As are attached.

### Question and Answers - Residential land withholding tax

#### What is RLWT and why is it being proposed?

RLWT stands for “residential land withholding tax” and it is a withholding tax on certain sales of residential property in New Zealand.

The Government has introduced draft legislation for taxing gains from the sale of residential land made within two years of acquisition under a proposed new bright-line test. The RLWT is being proposed as a collection mechanism for the bright-line test and would apply where the seller is an “offshore person”.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue has a number of powers available to enforce tax obligations and to ensure that the correct amount of tax revenue is collected. However, these are not always administratively practical or effective, particularly when the taxpayer has no or limited presence in New Zealand. Withholding taxes ensure that the relevant amount of tax is paid before the recipient obtains control of the funds. Withholding taxes are commonly used to tax New Zealand-sourced income derived by non-residents.

#### If I sell a property after 1 July 2016, will RLWT be withheld from the payment for the property?

It is proposed that RLWT would apply only to “offshore persons”. In addition, the following must also apply:

*   the property you are selling is “residential land”;
*   you acquired the property you are selling on or after 1 October 2015; and
*   you owned the property for less than two years before selling it.

#### Who is an “offshore person”?

The definition of “offshore person” includes individuals as well as entities and is defined in the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill.

_I’m an individual. Am I an offshore person?_

*   Are you a New Zealand citizen and are you (or have been) physically present in New Zealand within the last three years? If so, you’re not an offshore person.
*   Do you have a residence-class visa and are you (or have been) physically present in New Zealand within the last year? If so, you’re not an offshore person.

An entity will generally be classified as an offshore person if it is incorporated outside New Zealand or is owned 25% or more by an offshore person or offshore persons.

Further information about the Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill can be found at [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL63260_1/taxation-land-information-and-offshore-persons-information)
 and [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/bills/51-34)
.

#### What is “residential land”?

“Residential land” is defined in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill and means:

*   land that has a dwelling on it;
*   land for which the seller is party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling; or
*   bare land that because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it;
*   but does not include land that is used predominantly as business premises or as farmland.

Further information about the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill can be found at [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL64744_1/taxation-bright-line-test-for-residential-land-bill)
 and [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/bills/51-59)
.

#### How is the “two year” test measured?

The two-year holding period for RLWT would be the same as that in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill. The bright-line test looks at when a person acquires a property and when they subsequently dispose of it.

In most cases, the seller’s date of acquisition would be the date on which their title to the property was registered and the date of disposal would be the date on which the seller enters into an agreement for the sale of the property.

Further information about the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill can be found at [www.parliament.nz](http://www.parliament.nz/en-nz/pb/legislation/bills/00DBHOH_BILL64744_1/taxation-bright-line-test-for-residential-land-bill)
 and [www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz](/bills/51-59)
.

#### What would the rate of RLWT be?

The officials’ issues paper [_Residential land withholding tax_](/publications/2015/2015-ip-rlwt)
 released for public feedback on 31 August 2015, proposes that RLWT should be withheld at a rate that is the lower of:

*   the standard rate: 33% x seller’s gain (total purchase price - seller’s acquisition price); and
*   the default rate: 10% x the total purchase price for the property.

_Example_

Hannah is an offshore person and purchases a property for $610,000 in February. In August of the same year, Hannah sells the property to Michael for $820,000. Hannah’s gain is $210,000 ($820,000 - $610,000).

The amount to be withheld under each calculation option is:

*   10% x $820,000 = $82,000; and
*   33% x $210,000 = $69,300.

Under the “lower of” approach, $69,300 would need to be withheld.

#### Who withholds the RLWT?

The officials’ issues paper proposes that the person involved in the land transaction in the best position to withhold the tax and pay it to Inland Revenue is the conveyancer or solicitor.

For the purposes of the RLWT, this person is referred to in the officials’ issues paper as the conveyancing agent. The issues paper asks for feedback on whether it should be the buyer’s or the seller’s conveyancing agent that is responsible for withholding RLWT.

#### If I am buying a house, will I need to withhold RLWT?

In most cases, no. As noted above, it is proposed that RLWT would apply in only limited situations and that the obligation to withhold RLWT should be placed on a conveyancer, solicitor, or other professional involved in the conveyancing of the property sale (we use the term “conveyancing agent” in the issues paper).

In many other countries that have withholding taxes on sales of residential property, the obligation to withhold is placed on the buyer, but they expect the buyer to use a solicitor to fulfil their withholding obligations.

Sometimes, the services of a conveyancer or solicitor might not be used. If this is the case, it is proposed that you may be required to withhold RLWT.

#### Would RLWT be withheld if I make a loss on the sale of my property?

No. The issues paper proposes a “lower of” approach where the amount to be withheld would be the lower of 33% of the seller’s gain (which is the total purchase price minus the seller’s acquisition price) and 10% of the total purchase price. This means that where a loss is made (where the total purchase price is less than your acquisition price), no withholding would be required.

There may be instances where you make a gain on the property, but improvements you’ve made to the property may result in an overall loss. In this case, the issues paper proposes you should be entitled to either a refund from Inland Revenue for the RLWT paid or a credit to offset another tax liability.

_Example_

Dan is an offshore person and purchases a residential property for $1,000,000. Dan sells the property to Sam for $850,000 18 months later. Dan has made a loss on the sale of the property ($850,000 - $1,000,000 = -$150,000).

The amount to be withheld under each calculation option is:

*   10% x $850,000 = $85,000; and
*   $0, because Dan has made a loss on the sale of the property.

Under the “lower of” approach, no withholding would be required due to the fact that Dan has made a loss on the sale of the property.

#### What if I have deductible expenses?

There may be instances where you haven’t made a loss on the sale of your property, but you have a number of expenses that will be deductible in determining your overall income tax liability. This may be because you undertook renovations or made improvements to the property before selling it, for example.

These expenses aren’t reflected in the amount that would be withheld under RLWT. You would need to file an income tax return to obtain a deduction for your relevant expenses.

#### Would I still need to file an income tax return if RLWT has been withheld?

Yes. The proposed RLWT is not intended as a final tax and has been designed as a collection mechanism for income tax payable under the two-year bright-line test announced at Budget 2015. This means that while we have designed the RLWT to approximate your income tax liability as closely as possible, you are still required to file an income tax return including your taxable income (or loss) arising from the sale of your property under the bright-line test. The issues paper proposes that you would be entitled to a tax credit for any RLWT withheld and paid to Inland Revenue against your income tax liability.

After your income tax return has been filed and your income tax liability has been confirmed, you may be entitled to a refund if too much RLWT was withheld, or you may have additional tax to pay if not enough RLWT was withheld.

#### Would I need to wait until the end of the tax year to file an income tax return?

No. It is proposed that you may be able to file an interim income tax return before the end of the tax year. However, this wouldn’t be your final tax liability if you earn other taxable income during the year.

#### I am a conveyancing agent – how do I get information about the seller and the property to determine whether to withhold RLWT and at what rate?

The proposed RLWT has been designed so that most information can be independently obtained by any party to the property transaction.

In the interests of certainty, the officials’ issues paper proposes that RLWT could apply unless an exception is available. This means that the seller or their solicitor may need to supply relevant information for an exception to apply.

The seller would need to provide evidence of whether or not they are an offshore person. This could include a New Zealand passport or a copy of their residence class visa (and if they are not physically present in New Zealand at the time of the sale, a statement as to their recent physical presence in New Zealand).

To determine whether the land being sold is residential land, the seller’s conveyancer or solicitor may be required to certify whether or not the land is residential land. In most cases this should be relatively straightforward.

To determine whether the two-year holding requirement has been exceeded, the withholding agent would need to obtain information about the seller’s dates of acquisition and disposal.

Generally, the seller’s date of acquisition would be the date their title to the property was registered. This date is available from Quotable Value Limited and Landonline. If the seller’s title to the property was registered after 1 October 2015, but the seller entered into an agreement to acquire the property before 1 October 2015, withholding would not be required. In this case, the seller would need to provide a certified copy of that agreement to the withholding agent.

The date of disposal would in most cases be the date on which the buyer and seller enter into an agreement for sale and purchase for the property being sold. Both parties and their agents would have access to the agreement and should be able to obtain this date.

To calculate the amount of RLWT to be withheld, the withholding agent would need to obtain the total purchase price agreed between the buyer and the seller, as well as the seller’s acquisition price. The total purchase price would be available in the agreement for sale and purchase between the buyer and seller. Both parties and their agents would have access to the agreement and should be able to obtain this figure. The seller’s acquisition price is the total price paid by the seller to acquire the property being sold. This should be available from Quotable Value Limited.

#### What happens if there isn’t enough information to calculate RLWT under the standard rate?

In most cases, we think that the standard “33% x seller’s gain” rate would apply. However, there may be instances where there isn’t enough information available to calculate the seller’s gain. This could be because accurate information about the seller’s acquisition price isn’t available from Quotable Value and the seller does not disclose this information. In such a case, the default 10% rate would apply.

_Example_

Melanie agrees to buy a property from David for $1,000,000. David has owned the property for two months. The withholding agent is required to withhold RLWT, but is unable to obtain accurate information about David’s acquisition price from Quotable Value. David does not wish to provide this information to the withholding agent or the buyer.

The withholding agent is only able to calculate RLWT using the 10% rate (10% x $1,000,000 = $100,000). The withholding agent can’t calculate RLWT using the gain approach because they are unable to get information about David’s acquisition price.

#### What happens if I fail to withhold RLWT?

If a withholding agent fails to withhold the correct amount of RLWT and pay this amount to Inland Revenue, the sale (and in particular, the title transfer process) would not be held up.

Instead, the issues paper proposes that monetary penalties should apply. The Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out when and at what rates such penalties may be charged. This ensures that penalties for breaches of tax obligations are imposed consistently, at a level that is proportionate to the seriousness of the breach. RLWT penalties could be set in accordance with other penalties in the Tax Administration Act 1994.

#### How do I provide feedback on the RLWT proposal?

We invite you to make a submission on the officials’ issues paper – the closing date for submissions is Friday 2 October 2015.

We are particularly interested in submitters’ views on:

*   whether the obligation to withhold should be on the buyer’s or seller’s conveyancing agent;
*   the key compliance costs associated with the proposed withholding tax;
*   circumstances in which a conveyancing agent would not be able to obtain the seller’s acquisition price;
*   other instances where the standard RLWT rate would not be able to be calculated;
*   situations where the conveyancing agent would not handle the funds; and
*   other practical considerations.

Submissions should be addressed to:

> Residential land withholding tax  
> C/- Deputy Commissioner, Policy and Strategy  
> Inland Revenue Department  
> PO Box 2198  
> Wellington 6140

Or email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
 with “Residential land withholding tax” in the subject line. Electronic submissions are encouraged. Your submission should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for Inland Revenue and Treasury officials to contact you to discuss the points raised, if required.

Submissions may be the subject of a request under the Official Information Act 1982, which may result in their release. The withholding of particular submissions, or parts thereof, on the grounds of privacy, or commercial sensitivity, or for any other reason, will be determined in accordance with that Act. If you are making a submission and consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act, please clearly indicate this in your submission.

### OECD releases full BEPS action plan

The OECD last night released its final package of actions to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The Minister of Finance Bill English, and Minister of Revenue, Todd McClay say that the plan, representing two years of intensive work by the OECD and G20 nations will be a significant step forward in the fight against BEPS.

“BEPS behaviours can result in multinationals paying little or no tax anywhere in the world, so this announcement is a big step forward and the culmination of over two years’ work by the international community” Mr English says.

The package released last night by the OECD finalises the BEPS Action Plan, the first half of which had been delivered late last year.

The plan aims to address root causes rather than dealing with symptoms. Important causes of BEPS are the lack of transparency in tax systems, the misalignment between countries’ tax rules and the effectiveness of rules in general. As such, the plan includes measures ranging from new minimum standards to revision of existing standards, and developing common approaches amongst nations. Member countries have also agreed to peer review and monitoring.

“Issues facing tax jurisdictions today were undreamt of when tax rules and tax systems were first designed” says Mr McClay.

“The central issue has always been that international tax standards have not kept pace with developments in the global economy. Tax rules were developed in an age of steam and iron. In the meantime, business practices have progressed light years from that point. So this OECD co-ordinated approach will mean we will now have international consensus on tax law standards bringing global tax rules firmly up to date.

“The plan gives us all a good basis to take stock of our international tax rules and domestic rules too,” says Mr McClay.

However Mr McClay says that no decisions have been made by New Zealand on implementation or timing and that any changes would be subject to the usual public consultation process.

Mr English agrees; “We need to always consider the effect that tax policy has on the productive sector of the economy. Decisions have to be made as to what extent the OECD recommendations are applicable to New Zealand and the best way to implement them, giving thought to matters such as compliance costs. This will be high on the agenda for the Government in the coming months.

“It matters because New Zealand is becoming more and more attractive as a place to do business and invest in, so it’s critical that we continue to strengthen our tax rules to ensure overseas companies pay their fair share” he says.

“This is not about hammering large multinationals. The OECD makes the point that the current situation often results in double non taxation, that is, corporates not paying tax either in their home jurisdiction or in the country they’re doing business in.

“The OECD’s BEPS plan is careful to avoid over taxation. The Government wants to ensure that New Zealand remains a good place to do business, but also wants to make sure that everyone pays their fair share of tax” says Mr English.

Speech

### Making tax simpler  
Speech to Trans-Tasman Business Circle

It is my pleasure to be with you here today to unveil the next important stage of how the Government is making tax simpler for business.

Over the last few years we have taken the first steps in what is a very significant journey towards a simpler tax system for New Zealand.

While our tax system is among the best in the world, and is internationally recognised for that, I know that we can do better. The reality is that as the world becomes more and more connected, and more digital, we need to keep looking at what we can do to improve.

Our aim is to make the tax system simpler, more certain and more open for individuals and businesses, and for Government.

We want a transformed tax system that delivers significant benefits for our country and supports Government’s goal to building a more competitive and productive economy.

As in all areas of government, we need to take advantage of the shift to digital, look at how we provide customer-focused services, and how we make things easy for people.

Let me be clear – I know Inland Revenue is doing a great job with the systems it has. Businesses and individuals tell me that. I’ve seen very positive feedback, and more and more people are using the new, digital services that Inland Revenue provides.

But businesses are also telling me that there’s still too much effort required to comply with the requirements of the tax system that it’s too difficult to know if they are doing the right thing, and that it can be hard to find the information they need.

In part that’s because Inland Revenue is limited by some of its systems, and that’s why these are being replaced. But it’s also because we need policy to catch up with a digital world, and because Inland Revenue, like all Government agencies, needs to think differently about the services it provides.

I am pleased to say that we are making great progress in all these areas.

Inland Revenue has introduced a number of digital channels in recent years and customers are using these in large numbers.

94 per cent of customers get their refunds digitally and 84 per cent make payments digitally.

Nearly 60 per cent file their tax returns digitally, via the MyIR website, e-filing through tax agents, and from last year Inland Revenue’s first mobile app.

More than 1.8 million people have voice verification with Inland Revenue.

Inland Revenue has cut down on paper by sending information electronically directly to people’s secure myIR accounts. Since April this year more than two million letters, statements and notices have gone out this way.

Shared initiatives with other departments are getting us closer to telling government only once: like registering for PAYE through the Companies Office; getting your baby’s IRD number when you register the birth - 93 per cent are now registered - and sharing information between IR and MSD so people get, or pay, the right amount.

We have also embarked on the policy changes we need, with the introduction of the first Business Transformation Bill earlier this year, and consultation with the public on the overall future of the tax system.

This will bring changes as simple as allowing electronic signatures to be accepted rather than requiring paper-based signatures, which are now woefully out of date.

We said the Transformation of tax administration would use a mixture of New Zealand and international expertise – and where a New Zealand company could do the work I would expect they would be given the opportunity to.

We have been true to this.

To date, Business Transformation is under budget and ahead of schedule.

Some 67 per cent of the Business Transformation spend to date has gone to New Zealand companies, supporting businesses and creating jobs.

We also said that where the private sector can provide capacity we would use them rather than Inland Revenue – we would borrow their expertise rather than building systems from scratch ourselves.

I have encouraged Inland Revenue to work closely with industry, including accounting and payroll providers.

Today I am happy to announce that the first fruits of this work comes next month when a sample of Xero and MYOB customers will be able to file their GST returns straight from their accounting software to Inland Revenue, rather than having to file a separate return.

This may sound simple, but it has very practical benefits for businesses, cutting the amount of time it takes to meet tax obligations, and is an early step in integrating businesses and tax processes.

From March next year this will be rolled out to all Xero and MYOB customers, and in time it will be extended to all other software providers to offer their customers.

This will be followed by building PAYE processes into payroll software, however this is subject to policy change and public feedback.

All this is just the tip of the iceberg however.

Inland Revenue has put considerable effort into making sure they get this change right – because New Zealand can’t afford to get this wrong. There has been careful planning to maximise the chances of success and I’m pleased to say that all the indications are positive.

I’m delighted to say that since the original projections, it looks like this work will take less time, cost us less, and deliver more benefits.

The programme is now planned to be completed within seven years instead of the ten years originally indicated.

Further, I fully expect the project to come in well below the highest projection of $1.9 billion – and it is now likely that the new Crown funding required will be under $1 billion.

You might well ask how this is possible.

In part this is because of the selection of a core tax system that’s built for tax and is already operating at other tax authorities and it will need less customisation.

It’s also because of the commercial expertise that Inland Revenue has brought on board to help build the new system – people and companies who have done this work before, both in New Zealand and internationally.

These changes are about much more than changing technology and systems. This is about unlocking real business benefits, while exploiting the advantages of new technology to improve service.

Policy plays a major role in simplifying the future revenue system and that’s what you’re here to hear more about today.

In March, we issued the first two proposals on the overall direction of the tax modernisation programme we are heading in, and the intention to introduce more digital services.

Then in June I introduced the first of a series of bills which will contain proposed legislative changes to enable the transition to a simpler, more convenient tax system.

Feedback received from the first round of consultation has been encouraging and gives me confidence that we’re on the right track. Today I am releasing that feedback so that you can see how earlier responses have informed the proposals we are releasing today.

A large proportion of that feedback focused on business tax ideas.

The comments align very much with the Government’s thinking on this matter.

We are very conscious of the significant impact tax can have for business, so we need to make sure we get our proposals for change right the first time.

There are lots of issues to consider but it is an opportunity to make a profound difference.

Today, it gives me great pleasure to launch the next two discussion documents in the Making Tax Simpler series:

*   [_Better administration of PAYE and GST_](/publications/2015/2015-dd-mts-4-paye-gst)
    
*   [_Towards a new Tax Administration Act_](/publications/2015/2015-dd-mts-3-tax-administration)
    

I would like to summarise the policy changes we are consulting on:

Almost all businesses need to account for GST. And if you’re also an employer, then PAYE is part of your tax obligations.

The focus of the first public consultation we are launching today is on making it easier for businesses to manage their PAYE and GST obligations and improving the timeliness and quality of PAYE information by using business software.

The PAYE proposals are intended to minimise compliance costs by streamlining some processes and eliminating others.

Other than paying tax, taxpayers’ other interaction with the tax system is providing information to Inland Revenue. This imposes compliance costs.

We’re considering a philosophical change by getting rid of the notion of forcing taxpayers to conform to a process.

We asked ourselves, why not allow employers to carry out their PAYE obligations to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurs, for example, when they pay their employees rather than at a separate time required by IRD?

That would have the advantage of fitting tax obligations in with normal business processes in the same way as with the trial I mentioned earlier allowing GST filers to file their GST returns online from their accounting software straight to Inland Revenue.

If Inland Revenue was advised of new employees when they are first added to the payroll system employers could receive notification from Inland Revenue of the deductions to make before the employer started to pay them, preventing subsequent re-work.

If employers provide PAYE information to Inland Revenue at the time the business process occurred, Inland Revenue could use that more timely information to improve the accuracy of deductions which would improve individuals’ access to their social policy entitlements.

We are seeking feedback on three different implementation options for the proposed switch from monthly filing of PAYE information to filing at the time the business process occurs.

All the options recognise that some employers are unable to access the digital services that would facilitate this switch and an exemption process would exist for them.

I said before that digital technology was the key to unlocking greater convenience and simplification in our tax system. It also reduces the cost of administering the system.

Employers now make much more use of digital technology than they did in 1999 when the threshold for filing PAYE information electronically was introduced.

We are therefore also seeking feedback on a proposal that would lower this threshold from $100,000 a year of PAYE and employers’ superannuation contribution tax to $50,000.

Continuing with the theme of digital filing, we’re proposing that GST-registered persons would be able to submit their GST returns to Inland Revenue directly from accounting software, rather than filing a GST return as a separate process.

The result should be businesses across New Zealand who will have more time to focus on growing their business, employing New Zealanders, and supporting our economy.

We will assess feedback on this proposal along with the results of the pilot I talked about earlier and decide how to proceed.

Economic growth is a fragile thing which must be nurtured carefully and the Government is very much aware of the issue of compliance costs. We’re careful about imposing requirements on any business.

So adopting the new GST services will be optional for GST-registered persons, however submitters are asked for feedback on whether there should be a threshold above which GST-registered persons should be required to submit their GST returns electronically (through existing electronic channels or new digital services).

The second consultation I am releasing today looks at our current tax administration system set out in the Tax Administration Act, and how we might make it simpler for everyone and more flexible for the future.

Much of how Inland Revenue administers the tax rules is governed by this Act which was enacted in 1994.

It hasn’t been comprehensively reviewed since then. In the meantime, there have been some big changes in the social and economic environments including the shift to digital and online communication. There is also an increasing demand for improved public services.

This consultation covers three key areas of tax administration where changes would support simplification.

First, it looks at the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, to ensure that her resources and those of taxpayers are used most efficiently.

It does this by considering the Commissioner’s dual functions as a state sector chief executive and as the chief administrator of the tax system.

While our tax administration has a solid foundation, the document also considers the Commissioner’s care and management role and the extent to which it could be made a little more flexible.

The document also considers what the right balance should be between keeping taxpayer information secret and using that information more efficiently to provide better services for New Zealanders.

It recognises the need for taxpayer secrecy while considering how this should apply in aiming for an improved public service.

And it looks at other questions we need to consider as part of our wider vision to improve our tax administration system.

This includes how pre-population of tax returns may work in our self-assessment tax system, self-assessment being a cornerstone to good tax administration that we expect to maintain.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance. It’s a good, efficient way to ensure that government continues to have the revenue it needs to provide essential services for New Zealanders.

The proposals contained in the consultation I’m launching today will, together with future consultation rounds, help to modernise and simplify our tax administration to make it work better for taxpayers, and better for businesses.

I encourage you to digest the proposals and what they will mean for your businesses and for your clients, for your families.

Thank you.

### Business Transformation: Less time, lower cost, more benefits

Revenue Minister Todd McClay says Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme is likely to take less time, cost less, and deliver more benefits than the original projections.

Mr McClay was speaking at the Trans-Tasman Business Circle, where he released two consultation papers. The first, making it simpler for businesses to manage PAYE and GST and the second looking at the Tax Administration Act.

“There are good reasons for the shortened time frame and lower costs. We selected a core tax system that’s built for tax and is already operating in other tax jurisdictions. Because this needs less customisation, it means Inland Revenue’s timeframe is likely to be reduced two or three years – so the programme is now planned to be completed within seven years instead of the ten years originally indicated.

“Also of great help is the commercial expertise that Inland Revenue has brought on board to help build the new system – people and companies who have done this work before, both in New Zealand and internationally.

“I fully expect this project to come in well below the high end of the projections – $1.9 billion – and it is now likely that the new Crown funding required will be under $1 billion,” says Mr McClay.

Today’s release is the second round of the Government’s “Making Tax Simpler” consultation series that commenced in March this year.

“Essentially what’s being proposed is to make PAYE and GST systems fit with business processes rather than the other way round,” says Mr McClay.

“So for example, why not allow employers to carry out their PAYE obligations when they pay their employees, rather than at a separate time required by Inland Revenue.”

Mr McClay says the focus for proposed changes to GST is on digital filing to reduce time and cost to businesses.

“For GST, we’re proposing that businesses be able to do their GST returns directly through the accounting software packages that many of them use, rather than making them file separate GST returns.

The Minister says the second discussion paper released today looks at the Tax Administration Act and how the current system might be made simpler for everyone and more flexible for the future.

“It looks at the role of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, how taxpayer information can be used more efficiently to provide better services for New Zealanders, and the role of taxpayers and third parties,” says Mr McClay.

The Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill was introduced today.

The bill proposes a new withholding tax on sales of residential property by offshore persons who sell the property within two years of acquisition, proposed changes that will apply GST to remote services and intangibles supplied by offshore suppliers, and proposals to allow certain information on New Zealand student loan borrowers living in Australia to be shared between Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office. The bill also proposes a small number of technical measures designed to keep the student loan scheme rules clear and current.

### Student loan info to be shared with Australia

A tax bill introduced to Parliament today will allow information on student loan borrowers living in Australia to be shared between Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office, ensuring defaulters pay their outstanding loan balances.

Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Revenue Minister Todd McClay say measures included in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill will bring into New Zealand law an Arrangement for the Exchange of Information signed between the countries in March this year.

At the end of September this year, there were approximately 725,000 student loan borrowers. Fifteen per cent of borrowers live overseas, with the majority in Australia. An estimated $3.2 billion is owed by borrowers living overseas.

"We are making steady progress in tracking down student loan defaulters and getting them to pay up," said Mr Joyce. "However there is still too many who have spent a long time in Australia refusing to meet their obligations. This new initiative will give IRD up to date contact details to track down those deliberately avoiding their payments and being unfair to other taxpayers."

The information-sharing arrangement will form part of a successful Inland Revenue initiative to increase overseas-based borrowers’ compliance with their student loan obligations.

Approximately $227 million in additional repayments have been received since the compliance initiative began in 2010. The initiative has helped to achieve the following results:

*   Inland Revenue receiving 27 per cent more calls from overseas-based borrowers in September 2015 than in the same period last year
*   A 24 per cent increase in repayments received this financial year to 30 September, compared with the same period last year
*   An increase of 12.7 per cent of overseas-based borrowers making repayments towards their 2016 repayment obligation compared with the same time last year.

Inland Revenue also offers facilities to make it easier for borrowers to comply with their obligations with options such as fee-free payments for borrowers living anywhere in the world through online money transfer companies.

Once the information-sharing arrangement passes into law in both countries, it will be another valuable tool for Inland Revenue to obtain up-to-date contact details for student loan borrowers believed to be living in Australia.

“This will help Inland Revenue to maintain borrowers’ contact with the scheme and, when appropriate, help with the collection of any outstanding payment obligations,” says Mr McClay.

The bill also proposes a small number of technical measures designed to keep the student loan scheme rules clear and current.

They include streamlining the rules applying to borrowers who work overseas but are entitled to interest-free loans because they work for approved charitable organisations, and standardising the treatment of over-deductions from a borrower’s salary or wages.

### GST on online services - levelling the playing field

Revenue Minister Todd McClay says measures proposed in a tax bill introduced today are about fairness and equity.

“It is about creating a level playing field for collecting GST and putting New Zealand businesses and jobs ahead of the interests of overseas suppliers”, says Mr McClay.

These measures are an important first step in the Government’s efforts to deal with increasing volumes of online services and other intangibles purchased from overseas suppliers that should, under New Zealand’s tax rules, be subject to GST.

“GST should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand. This is what makes our GST system fair, efficient and simple,” says Mr McClay.

“The growth of online digital and overseas services means the volume of services on which GST is not collected is an increasing challenge – for the Government in terms of the GST revenue foregone, and as a matter of fairness for New Zealand suppliers of services and intangibles who must account for GST in their pricing structures.”

Mr McClay says the proposed measures will apply GST to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles supplied by offshore suppliers (including e-books, music, videos, and software purchased from offshore websites) to New Zealand-resident consumers, by requiring the offshore supplier to register and return GST on these supplies.

“To reduce compliance costs, offshore suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices.”

Non-resident suppliers will be required to register and return GST when their supplies of remote services to New Zealand residents exceed NZD$60,000 in a 12 month period.

Mr McClay says the proposed measures are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and to create a level playing field between domestic and overseas suppliers of online services and intangibles.

“The proposed changes would broadly follow the OECD’s recommended guidelines, as well as the rules that apply in other jurisdictions, such as Member States of the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and South Africa,” says Mr McClay.

Australia has announced plans to introduce similar rules that will apply from 1 July 2017.

Mr McClay says that while the measures in the bill relate to online services, the fact that GST is not charged on low-value imported goods that are below the Customs’ de minimus threshold is also of concern to the Government.

“The growing volume of imported goods means the amount of foregone GST is continuing to increase and raises concerns for domestic suppliers,” he says.

This should be seen as a two-step process to also focus on low value goods.

The Government realises this is an important issue for New Zealand retailers, however we are not willing to move unreasonable cost or inconvenience on to consumers. For this reason Customs has been asked to work through a number of logistical issues with stakeholders.

“The New Zealand Customs Service is expected to release a consultation document in April 2016 that will seek public feedback on the practical implications of options to streamline the collection of duty, including GST, on low-value imported goods.

“In the meantime, the measures proposed in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill are about providing a robust, simple and easily administered set of rules for overseas suppliers of services to New Zealanders.”

The proposed new rules would come into force on 1 October 2016, following enactment of the bill.

### Questions and Answers – GST on cross-border services and intangibles

**What are the GST changes in the bill?**

The amendments proposed in the bill apply GST to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles supplied by offshore suppliers (including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from offshore websites) to New Zealand-resident consumers, by requiring the offshore supplier to register and return GST on these supplies.

Currently, GST is not collected on cross-border services and intangibles that are purchased from offshore suppliers. Many are concerned that the current tax settings distort consumer and business decisions, placing New Zealand suppliers of services and intangibles at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated at around $40 million per year).

The amendments are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of services and intangibles

GST is also not collected on low-value imported goods that are below the “de minimis” threshold (typically goods below the value of NZ$400). The bill does not impact the collection of GST on these goods. Instead the measures in the bill are intended to be the first step in the process of collecting GST on overseas purchases.

The Government realises this is an important issue for New Zealand retailers. However we are not willing to move unreasonable cost or inconvenience on to consumers. For this reason, Customs has been asked to work through a number of logistical issues with stakeholders and is expected to release a consultation document in April 2016 that will seek public feedback on the practical implications of options to streamline the collection of duty, including GST, on low-value imported goods.

**Why doesn’t the Government currently tax imported goods and services?**

When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased services from offshore, and online digital products were not yet available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing cross-border services outweighed the benefits of taxation.

In terms of imported goods, New Zealand and other countries apply “de minimis” thresholds below which no duty, including GST, is collected on the imported goods. De minimis thresholds are applied to facilitate the flow of goods and to ensure that the cost of collecting GST on low-value goods does not outweigh the benefits of doing so.

New Zealand’s de minimis is set at a level under which it is estimated that the costs of collecting the duty begin to exceed the revenue the duty generates. It is a higher threshold than that set by many countries but lower than the Australian threshold of AU$1,000.

**Why is the Government seeking to tax goods and services purchased from offshore suppliers?**

The principal issue is about fairness. Domestic suppliers return GST on goods and services they sell to New Zealand customers whereas offshore suppliers are not required to return GST. This puts domestic retailers at a competitive disadvantage compared with offshore suppliers.

The growing e-commerce market also means the amount of GST not being collected on imported goods and services is increasing. Current estimates put the amount of GST foregone on these purchases at approximately $180 million a year (of which about $40 million relates to services and intangibles), and growing at around 10 percent each year. Government revenues pay for important public services such as education, healthcare, roads and superannuation.

**What are the main features of the proposals?**

*   Offshore suppliers of services would be required to register and return GST on remote services purchased by New Zealand-resident consumers.
*   To ensure compliance costs are minimised, offshore suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices.
*   Offshore suppliers would be required to register and return GST if their supplies of services to New Zealand residents exceed NZ $60,000 in a 12-month period.
*   A broad definition of “remote” services is proposed, which includes both digital services (such as video, music and software downloads) and more traditional services (such as legal and accounting services received remotely).
*   In some situations, an electronic marketplace may be required to register instead of the principal offshore supplier.

**Why would offshore suppliers comply with the proposed rules?**

When similar rules have been applied in other countries, offshore suppliers – particularly large international suppliers that account for the majority of cross-border services and intangibles – have demonstrated a willingness to comply. For many of these companies, failure to comply with their obligations would pose a significant risk to their reputation.

To generate a similar level of compliance for New Zealand, the proposed rules would be consistent with the rules that apply in other countries. For offshore suppliers that do not comply, the normal enforcement rules and penalties that apply to New Zealand suppliers are expected to apply.

New Zealand is able to obtain tax-related information from other jurisdictions under both bilateral agreements (such as double tax agreements or tax information exchange agreements) and the Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, as amended by the 2010 Protocol ("the Convention"), which expands its information exchange network to a wider, and continually growing, network of jurisdictions. These agreements establish a network of jurisdictions from which New Zealand can request, collect and provide information, assist in service of documents, and collect unpaid GST.

The OECD is also working on further detailed guidance for the effective exchange of information and other forms of mutual assistance between tax authorities in the field of indirect taxes.

**When will the proposed rules come into force?**

The rules will come into force on 1 October 2016.

**How do the proposals compare with what other countries are doing?**

The proposed amendments are consistent with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) International VAT/GST Guidelines, and broadly follow the rules that apply in other jurisdictions, such as Member States of the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and South Africa. Australia has announced plans to introduce similar rules that will apply from 1 July 2017.

**How will an offshore supplier determine if a customer is a New Zealand resident?**

Offshore suppliers will be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of commercially available evidence (for example, a billing address and the country code of their mobile phone SIM card). As many suppliers to the global market have put systems solutions in place to comply with similar rules in the European Union, it is likely that implementing similar rules in New Zealand will result in lower compliance costs for offshore suppliers.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to prescribe an alternative method of determining whether a customer is resident, which will assist offshore suppliers by providing flexibility in circumstances where sufficient information was not commercially available.

**How will an offshore supplier determine if a customer is a GST-registered business?**

Offshore suppliers will be required to treat a customer as not being a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number, New Zealand Business Number or notified them of their status as a registered business. To provide additional flexibility, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person.

**What if a customer provides incorrect information to avoid paying GST?**

The new rules provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST in cases such as when a person provides false or misleading information about themselves in order to avoid GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. The existing “knowledge offences” are also expected to apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information to avoid GST.

### Tax bill completes property investment rule changes

A tax bill introduced today proposes a new withholding tax on sales of residential property by people who live overseas and go on to sell the property within two years of purchase.

The proposed measure is the third part of the Government’s investment property tax reforms announced as part of Budget 2015.

Revenue Minister Todd McClay says the proposed residential land withholding tax (RLWT), which is included in the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill will act as a collection mechanism for the \[proposed\] new bright-line test, which applies to gains from the sale of residential property purchased on or after 1 October 2015 and sold within two years.

“The proposed RLWT will ensure the integrity of the tax system and will bring the collection of bright-line tax into line with other withholding taxes, which generally apply when there is likely to be a tax liability and collection may be difficult,” says Mr McClay.

RLWT will apply when:

*   the property being sold is located in New Zealand and defined as “residential land” under the bright-line test provisions;
*   the seller acquired the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has owned the property for less than two years before selling it; and
*   the seller is an “offshore person”.

Under the proposed measures in the bill, an “offshore person” would include:

*   people who are not New Zealand citizens;
*   people who do not hold residence class visas; and
*   New Zealand citizens and residence class visa holders who have been away from New Zealand for a significant period of time (three years in the case of New Zealand citizens).

New Zealand trusts and companies may also be considered “offshore persons” if they have significant offshore interests in them.

“Unlike the bright-line test there is no exception for the seller’s main home under the proposed new RLWT rules.

“As the withholding tax would only apply to a person living overseas, it is unlikely that the New Zealand property being sold would be the person’s main home.

“The bill does, however, propose an exemption from RLWT for transfers upon death, and for transfers made in relation to a property relationship agreement, in keeping with the bright-line test,” says Mr McClay.

The bill proposes that the obligation to pay the RLWT will primarily be the responsibility of seller’s conveyancing agent or in their absence, the purchaser’s conveyancing agent and in the absence of both, directly by the purchaser.

Mr McClay says the proposed changes were announced by the Government in Budget 2015 as part of a package of proposals to improve compliance with the current land sale rules, and were consulted on earlier this year.

“The RLWT proposal in the bill, together with the new bright-line test and changes to collect better tax information about buyers and sellers of residential property will help to ensure that everyone pays their fair share of tax on gains from property sales,” says Mr McClay.

The RLWT will come into force on 1 July 2016, following enactment of the Taxation (Residential Land Withholding Tax, GST on Online Services, and Student Loans) Bill.

### Speech to Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CAANZ) Annual Conference

It’s great to be here with you again.

First I want to say thank you. We have had an extremely busy year in the tax community. It has been a year of heavy lifting.

In just this year we’ve put out 14 consultation papers on policy, seen the introduction or passing of seven bills, and have been involved in the development of other legislation.

There has also been significant progress on the Business Transformation (BT) front from a tax administration point of view.

That is huge.

IRD used to have one tax bill each year. Over the next few years, we can expect the volume of bills through the house to increase. This is now the new norm.

The Government recognises that the considered thoughts and goodwill of the private sector have a critical role in the successful implementation of the tax policy work programme.

While we can congratulate ourselves on our cohesive, relatively straightforward tax system, a lot of that depends on you providing feedback on proposals and ensuring that they are workable.

It’s important that this is recognised and I want you to know that it is appreciated.

Your efforts have not gone unnoticed at the highest levels of government.

Last month we received the very welcome news that the Government’s books had returned to surplus.

This was achieved by prudent fiscal management of government spending and by maintaining a stable and robust revenue stream to the government.

Getting the government’s books back into surplus is a major achievement for the economy.

It happened well ahead of almost all of the rest of the world, and years ahead of forecasts for the Australian economy.

Whilst modest, a surplus is a surplus and it shows we’re moving in the right direction.

An efficient tax system is half the story in reaching this achievement.

The lack of a robust tax system can lead to loss of confidence and can cause real misery as some other countries have recently experienced.

Greece springs to mind - where for years they increased spending but nobody paid additional income tax. In fact it’s not actually clear if anybody was paying tax.

But achieving surplus doesn’t mean “mission accomplished”.

The need for continued fiscal prudence remains.

Looking into the future, New Zealand faces the need to fund the rising expenditures associated with an ageing population, and continue to deliver the services Kiwis demand and deserve.

The best way of achieving this is by having a healthy and growing economy.

The Government does not want to get the revenue it needs by taking larger and larger slices of a diminishing pie. Instead it wants to grow the pie.

At the same time we need a continuing focus on maintaining a robust tax base which raises the revenue needed to pay for public services.

And the Government also wants the tax system to continue to be fair and continue to be seen to be fair.

This means that we want to ensure that clever tricks cannot be used to stream profits away from New Zealand, lowering its tax base and national income, but at the same time making sure that New Zealand continues to be a good place to do business.

Our broad tax base, means that there is not much in the way of “low-hanging fruit” for further revenue-raising by broadening tax bases without significant negative effects on economic efficiency and growth.

So this is all a difficult balancing act.

It is critical to maintain the revenue raising capacity of our existing tax system, but we will do so within the principles of a broad base, low rate tax system.

Clear and coherent frameworks are important for good tax policy.

International tax reviews have cited the importance of deciding what it is a nation wants to tax and doing so consistently.

New Zealand is very fortunate to have a clear and coherent BBLR framework for taxation.

Broad bases help ensure that taxes are fair and efficient and do as little as possible to impede productivity and growth.

Broad bases also allow the government to collect the revenue it needs at the lowest rates possible. This, in turn, provides a second-round benefit in promoting fairness, efficiency and growth.

Our broad base, low rate framework for tax policy acts to promote revenue integrity. It helps keep administrative and compliance costs as low as possible.

And by avoiding complex rules and frequent changes in the system, it promotes business certainty and leaves businesses free to focus on seizing opportunities, being innovative and creating profits, jobs and growth.

BBLR was introduced in the 1980s and has a lot of buy-in from the wider New Zealand public. Reviews of taxation including the McLeod Review in 2001 and the Tax Working Group have argued that there should be a high burden of proof before moving away from BBLR principles.

Leading tax practitioners with experience of tax systems in other countries have noted that there can be a sharp difference in the tone of tax debates between New Zealand and other countries where there are much less clear policy frameworks.

The lack of buy-in to a clear framework can act like rust and gradually undermine integrity and compliance.

A clear framework is an important part of the success of the Generic Tax Policy Process. Tax reform debates can be principled and about whether or not tax changes are consistent with the framework.

But over and above this, successful tax reform requires goodwill and co-operation from all involved in the tax reform process.

We want a tax system where as much as possible businesses can plan their affairs without agonising over future tax consequences and where businesses can make sound investment decisions without having tax advantages or disadvantages driving their judgement.

An area that has in recent times had a high news profile is the issue of base erosion and profit shifting or “BEPS”.

With hugely increased levels of international trade and the advent of digital communication for commercial purposes, BEPS is now a concern, not just for New Zealand, but around the world.

BEPS is a problem where companies can arrange their affairs so that taxable profits are booked outside of where the economic activity takes place, or are subject to arrangements that result in no taxable profits being declared anywhere.

We want to have an economy where smart and innovative businesses want to operate and where these businesses thrive.

From the Government’s point of view, BEPS should not be seen as loading more and more onerous burdens on firms.

At the same time we want to ensure that all firms pay a fair amount and fair share of tax.

In our domestic rules applying to such income, we have already made considerable progress.

The international tax review, which exempted active income of companies that was earned abroad from New Zealand tax, contained a number of provisions that were designed to protect New Zealand from the base erosion strategies that have been identified as part of the BEPS project.

I think it’s fair to say that New Zealand’s rules in this area are as good as any, and better than most.

But it must be recognised that the eventual success of the OECD’s BEPS Project will depend on a critical mass of jurisdictions updating their domestic tax laws to international best practice.

Its goal is to make company taxes more transparent and even in their application across companies and countries.

Companies should pay tax somewhere and they should not be free to shift profits to the countries with very low or zero tax rates.

They should pay tax where economic activity takes place.

It is not in the interest of New Zealand businesses and individual taxpayers, if multinational companies can avoid paying their fair share of taxes either in New Zealand or elsewhere.

Our tax system relies on voluntary compliance, which works as long as most people see that the tax system is fair, so our focus has been on ensuring that the system remains coherent and readily understood.

It also aims to distribute the tax burden fairly, that is, that everyone pays the tax that they should.

Last month the OECD released its promised full set of recommendations for countering BEPS.

There are 15 points on the action plan, which I won’t go through today.

As I said before, our approach is to be mindful of the tax system as a whole and to take a considered approach.

The release of the OECD action plan therefore gives us an opportunity to scrutinise our tax rules when held up against the OECD recommendations.

As joint owners of the tax policy work programme, the Minister of Finance and I will agree on appropriate BEPS items to add to the work programme.

We consider that there may be room for improvement in some areas of our tax rules.

In particular we will be looking at interest limitation rules and whether or not they are cast appropriately.

We will also be considering strengthening our anti-hybrid rules.

In the past there has been concern that double taxation of international capital flows could penalise cross border investment and reduce worldwide income.

An opposite problem can arise today if hybrid arrangements can subsidise cross border investment and lead to lower taxes than would arise with domestic investments.

This too can lead to worldwide inefficiency and lower worldwide income.

The OECD has suggested new rules to stem this form of BEPS.

Our approach in the lead-up to the release of the action plan has been to work with the OECD and to be a strong supporter of the global response to BEPS.

That doesn’t mean that we simply adopt all BEPS recommendations into the tax policy work programme. Each country must make its own evaluation of what areas of its domestic laws need strengthening.

At the same time it is critical to ensure that any tax policy changes to address BEPS concerns are not unduly complex and nothing is yet set in stone.

Any changes would be subject to our normal consultation process and consultation documents on these two topics will be released next year. We will be looking for your input again.

An important component in our consultation on BEPS work will be outlining the Government’s thinking on how best to tax inbound investment.

I have agreed with the Minister of Economic Development, Steven Joyce, that a piece of work to consider cost of capital more broadly across government might be undertaken.

The effects of taxes on the cost of capital are important considerations, but so too is the issue of taxing capital as consistently and as neutrally as possible.

I mentioned before that the private sector has input into the work programme.

Naturally, the sector has an interest in seeing an environment that supports growth.

The tax policy work load is heavy at the moment; with work falling into three main themes

*   sensible reforms within a broad base, low rate framework
*   tax administration reform to support Inland Revenue’s business transformation and
*   a sensible, measured response to BEPS.

The work programme includes a number of items which the Government considers important to progress, such as the property tax changes announced as part of Budget 2015.

But there are also a number of items included there raised by the private sector (or which the sector has a keen interest in) which have been adopted onto the work programme as officials considered they would add to the fairness and efficiency of the tax system.

I mentioned earlier that there have been 14 consultation documents sent out for your feedback since I was last here at your conference.

These include loss grouping, closely held companies, residential land withholding tax, GST and online purchases, the bright-line test, NRWT proposals, proposals for allowing PAYE deductions on employee share schemes, the launch of the BT Green paper and proposals for greater use of digital technology, amendments to the rules for related parties debt remission and clarifying the GST rules for bodies corporates.

These various proposals are at different stages in the policy process. For instance, the public feedback on amendments to the closely held company rules is currently being analysed and I expect to introduce amendments to these rules in a tax bill early next year.

Meanwhile the proposals to apply GST to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles (including e-books, music, videos, and software purchased from offshore websites) provided by offshore suppliers to New Zealand-resident consumers have just been introduced into the House.

The amendments address the non-taxation of cross-border remote services and intangibles in order to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and create a level playing field for domestic and offshore suppliers.

It does not consider rights issues, as it is a tax bill. It does however consider the avoidance of GST.

These proposals are also consistent with OECD guidelines and with international practice, including the proposals announced in Australia that are expected to come into effect on 1 July 2017.

In New Zealand, the amendments will apply from 1 October 2016.

But whether they originated with the private sector or from the Government, these policy proposals are all aimed at ironing out inconsistencies and improving integrity and making New Zealand a better place to live.

One of the huge advantages of our system of tax policy consultation is that it is extremely responsive.

It makes it easy for you to tell us when the tax law is not producing the answer that was intended.

I encourage you to keep doing this as fixing these issues keeps the system running smoothly.

The trick here for you is to prioritise what’s most important. We simply haven’t the resources to fix everything now.

I want to make a further comment.

As I’ve already said, I’m aware of the important role you have in the success of tax reform.

I am also aware that the better and more complete policy proposals are, the less work that means for you.

The quality of tax policy advice must be maintained to ensure that the focus on BBLR work continues at a high standard.

Three years ago I made a commitment to you that as we worked through BT, we would work hard to ensure that Business As Usual activities did not suffer.

While not all, the majority of our tax work this year has been in the Business As Usual area.

Over the next few years, while there will be a natural convergence of policy work in both BT and Business As Usual, there will be additional policy pressures as we become busier.

To meet my commitment to you with regard to Business As Usual, I have had a number of discussions with the Commissioner of Inland Revenue about our workload. The Commissioner has confirmed that she will increase investment into the policy advice area as appropriate.

An important spin-off will be ensuring that many of the items including remedial matters that are important to professionals such as yourselves have scope to be progressed.

Before I conclude, it would be remiss of me not to mention Business Transformation.

After all, a bulk of our policy resources has been invested into ensuring the successful delivery of the programme – and rightly so.

As I’ve mentioned on several occasions, BT is a once in a lifetime opportunity to modernise and simplify tax administration, and we must get it right.

On the policy front, we are certainly delivering.

Last week I launched policy consultation on two topics covering proposed changes to the GST and PAYE processes and to the Tax Administration Act.

Wider than this, we are working hard to deliver some early wins.

From next month, for example, Inland Revenue together with Xero and MYOB are launching a pilot programme allowing customers to file GST returns straight from their accounting software to Inland Revenue.

It’s been pleasing to see Inland Revenue working collaboratively with the private sector, both locally and internationally, to deliver on the programme.

The Government has been clear that where New Zealand companies can do this work, we expect them to be given the opportunity to do so.

To date, some 67 per cent of the spend on BT has gone to New Zealand companies, supporting businesses and creating jobs.

This has all contributed to us meeting our major milestones – in fact we are running ahead of time and continue to run under budget.

As some of you in the room heard last week, the programme is now planned to be completed within seven years instead of the ten years originally indicated. Further, it is now likely that the new Crown funding required will be under $1 billion over this period. This is well below the highest projections of $1.9 billion.

It’s really great seeing it all come together, but we still have more to do.

I look forward to working with you and hearing your contributions on the BT policy proposals that are coming down the track.

I’ll wind up my speech now by saying that New Zealand’ tax system is up there with the best, but it will need to evolve and adapt to meet the needs of the 21st century and an increasingly globalised and digital world.

Tax policies will need to adapt to fit these challenges.

BEPS is a matter of global concern for tax jurisdictions and no less so for New Zealand.

The OECD is leading the charge at an international level, but New Zealand’s response will, as always, be to take the considered view and consider the OECD recommendations and how they fit in with our tax system as a whole.

It’s the responsible thing to do. Thank you

Speech

### Speech to New Zealand Payroll Practitioners Association (NZPPA) Conference

Good morning.

Thank you for inviting me to join you once again. Over the last few years it has always been my great pleasure to come and speak to you.

Your role as payroll professionals and mine as Revenue Minister have a common interest in the smooth running of the tax system.  If it works well for you, then it’s working for me.

We all use the tax system at one time or another, whether it is paying income tax, child support, paying off a student loan or receiving tax credits, it all goes through the tax system.

And a major component of it depends on how you do your job.

190,000 employers have PAYE obligations and as at February 2015 PAYE including employers’ superannuation contribution tax was 35 per cent of total tax collected by the IRD.

One of the first questions asked of me when I became Minister of Revenue was from this group.

It was something along the lines of the “EMS is a problem for us, what was I going to do about it.”

On that occasion, Lynn of Tawa helped me muddle through an answer.

I said that Business Transformation was the future.

Well, today I can say that it is.

My speech today will address that very thing and focus on better processes for providing payroll information to the IRD with some concrete proposals for simplifying the system.

Things have definitely progressed since the last time we spoke.

We now have some runs on the board that I can report to you from this year.

Earlier this year, we launched the first round of public consultation on the general direction of the programme to simplify and modernize our tax administration.

We also asked for your views on making greater use of digital technology as the vehicle for that simplification.

This year we completed the high-level design of the whole programme, and we are now preparing to move to implementation.

Other ongoing and important pieces of work have been with other Government agencies, on Better Public Services goals and common capabilities.

A bill was introduced into the House containing changes required to make the transformation of our tax administration a reality - bringing in changes as simple as allowing electronic signatures to be accepted rather than requiring paper-based signatures, which are now woefully out of date.

And the department is now working with FAST enterprises on a system to replace its FIRST mainframe computer. This will form the technological core of our new revenue system.

Meanwhile the IRD, working with Xero and MYOB, is about to launch a pilot programme allowing people to file their GST returns direct from their accounting software.

We have used, and will continue to use a mixture of New Zealand and international expertise to deliver on business transformation.

To date, 67 per cent of the spend on Business Transformation has gone to New Zealand companies, supporting businesses and creating jobs.

This equates to $54 million into the New Zealand economy - with another $26 million going to international companies.

And we’re also and stepping up engagement across the public and private sector, and stakeholder groups – hence my presence here today.

I’m pleased to be able to tell you that all major milestones were met on time and the programme has continued to run under budget.

In fact the programme’s performance in the last year has reinforced its track record of successful delivery and I am confident that we are going to successfully complete this project ahead of time and under budget from our original estimates.

As I mentioned last week, the programme is now planned to be completed within seven years instead of the ten years originally indicated.

Further, I fully expect the project to come in well below the highest projection of $1.9 billion – and it is now likely that the new Crown funding required will be under $1 billion.

It’s really great seeing it all come together, but there’s lots more to do.

So you may have heard that last week I launched the next phase of consultation on two topics: _Towards a New Tax Administration Act_ and _Better Administration of PAYE and GST_.

I encourage you to comment on both, but I suspect (and hope) the second one will be of more interest to you, because that’s the one I’m going to talk to focus on today.

As I mentioned before, PAYE accounts for a big wedge of the revenue collected, so it’s important to the Government that we get it right.

The proposals focus not on what you do for PAYE, but _how_ you do it – process improvements.

The objective is to make providing PAYE information less time consuming and therefore less costly for employers.

The key to unlocking that is greater use of digital technology.

I think there would be valuable benefits for all of us and for our economy.

As I mentioned earlier, along with tax; child support, KiwiSaver, Student Loans and others also go through the tax system and the PAYE system is critical for their function.

So in thinking about the operation of PAYE the Government needs to think about the system as a whole and the costs and benefits for employers, government and individual employees.

A major proposal being consulted on marks a big shift in thinking in moving from expecting employers to file PAYE information at a time required by Inland Revenue to integrating these obligations into the things employers would be doing anyway.

What if, rather than a fixed monthly basis, we shifted to providing payroll information on income paid and deductions made at the same time as you are paying staff.

And employers could send the information from within their payroll system by approving a feed of data to Inland Revenue. No need to save, attach (or in some cases print) and then send files to IRD.

I just want to emphasise a point there. The employer will have to _approve the feed of data_.

The proposal that employer’s software could connect to Inland Revenue’s system does not mean that Inland Revenue can go into an employer’s system and collect data.

Every transfer of information would be approved by an authorised representative of the employer, but it would be a much more seamless process than at present.

The Government understands that for this to represent a significant saving for employers with large complex payrolls there would need to be a simple process for correcting “errors” and adjusting the data that is sent when the payroll is finalised. The discussion document also contains proposals in that area.

These are process improvements that we believe will benefit employers.

There are also a number of proposals around the rules for calculating PAYE.  The discussion in this area focuses on things employers have told Inland Revenue are confusing or complex.

Another process that the Government believes could improve significantly which would reduce re-work for payroll professionals and save the employee problems is getting deductions correct and more timely for new employees from the start.

We think we can be smarter about how this is done.

It should be possible that when you add a new employee to the payroll and have the relevant fields complete, your payroll system will prompt you to “provide details to Inland Revenue”.

And, as long as the IRD number is correct, the Inland Revenue system will automatically message you back with:

*   any necessary change to the proposed tax code, for example for student loans
*   the new employee’s KiwiSaver status and relevant deduction rate; and
*   any child support or overdue tax deductions to be made.

There are a range of other similar proposals such as for Inland Revenue to send notice of changes to deductions – such as the annual child support updates – in a form that, once the employer has accepted them, can be automatically uploaded.

These sorts of proposals will, we hope lead to less time spent on PAYE obligations.

I’m sure you are interested in how these PAYE changes could be rolled out.

Because timely accurate PAYE information is important to the correct delivery of social policy and a prerequisite for future changes, Government is considering whether it should require employers to change the way they supply PAYE information.

Three options are set out for your consideration: the voluntary-first approach, the review approach and a legislated approach.

All would have possible exemptions for those employers who cannot access digital services and the Government understands that large organisations and those with complex payrolls could require a significant lead-in time to implement software changes.

Under the **voluntary-first approach**, employers could choose to adopt the new way of doing things and meet their existing obligation by providing PAYE information when the business process occurs.

Following a significant voluntary uptake a review would be held.

If it was found that the benefits of the new way of working justified the costs of change employers would be provided with a date by which they would be required to provide PAYE information at the time the business process occurs.

A **review approach** would work like the above except the date for the review would be identified from the beginning. The initial voluntary period would operate like a trial.

A **legislated implementation approach** is where the legislation enabling the changed process would specify a future date, or dates, by which time employers have to provide PAYE information on the new basis.

I would encourage you all to make a submission on which approach would make sense from a practical point of view.

Before I finish I want to address another area where the two discussion documents intersect and that is around secrecy and confidentiality.

A key assumption, across all the new services to simplify tax, is that they have to keep confidential information secure and the PAYE document outlines at a high level how this will be achieved.

But we also have to respond to changing customer expectations - when contact details change people don’t want to have to tell five different government agencies they want to tell government once.

Cross-government service and our evolving, digital world brings a new challenge and the other discussion document ‘_Towards a new Tax Administration Act_’ explores ideas like “could taxpayers consent to the release of their own information in some circumstances”?

Again, if you are interested in those questions I’d encourage you to also look at and comment on that document.

You can make a submission online by visiting, [makingtaxsimpler.ird.govt.nz](/archived-websites#mts)
 or pick up a flyer from the IRD stand.

Transforming the tax system is a big job, and given the importance of the PAYE system, we need to get it right.

The public needs to have confidence in a smoothly running tax system. So as always, such proposals are subject to public consultation.

I understand there is a presentation later in the programme from Inland Revenue officials and that they have a stand here – I suggest you take those opportunities to learn more about what is proposed.

We want to hear your thoughts.

If you think that a proposal is not going to work then I value your insights – tell us why it won’t work or what improvements could be made to what is being proposed in this current consultation.

As payroll professionals, this is your opportunity to make a difference.

We are not yet at the stage of final decision or detailed design for these changes so now is the time to share your professional voice.

Thank you.

Innovation creates new sources of economic growth by delivering new products and generating improvements in the quality and cost of existing products. Encouraging business innovation is one of the seven key initiatives of the Government’s Building Innovation workstream, which recognises that research and development is a key element in the innovation process. High up-front costs associated with undertaking research and development mean that relative to other investment projects, the profit cycle for research and development projects tends to be much more heavily skewed towards early losses. This can pose a particularly significant barrier to undertaking research and development for innovative start-up companies. Larger firms generally have the ability to use those losses earlier, setting them off against existing streams of income. Current tax provisions delay the ability of loss-making businesses to use their deductions as they are required to carry the losses forward. This provides an important integrity measure in the tax system to mitigate the creation of artificial losses. However, these current tax settings create a cashflow problem for certain companies in an on-going tax loss position. This cashflow bias is particularly significant for companies undertaking research and development, and this can increase the cost of investing in research and development rather than in other assets. Problems can be compounded for start-up companies undertaking research and development who are already likely to suffer from broader capital constraints. Current tax settings can also penalise businesses that engage in research and development that ultimately turns out to be unsuccessful. This is because current tax provisions state that losses, in this case from unsuccessful research and development, can only be used going forward if there is a subsequent profitable business. The current rules therefore make the use of previous tax losses contingent upon successful innovation or future income earning by the same group of investors. The risk of incurring this potential additional sunk cost is likely to discourage investment in marginal research and development projects further. The proposed changes focus on start-up companies engaging in intensive research and development, and are intended to reduce their exposure to market failures and tax distortions arising from the current tax treatment of losses. The timing that those companies can access their losses will be brought forward, provided they meet certain criteria. This will help to reduce the bias against investment in these firms from current tax settings. 4 PROPOSALS FOR THE “CASH OUT” OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX LOSSES Summary of proposed amendments The bill proposes to allow loss-making research and development start-up companies to “cash out” their tax losses arising from research and development expenditure. The measures are intended to be as simple as possible. That intention and the focus on start-ups means that the proposed changes are not aimed at taxpayers with complex or unusual tax arrangements. Under the proposals, research and development start-up companies will be able to claim up to 28 percent (the current company tax rate) of their tax losses from research and development expenditure in any given year. The main eligibility requirements are that the company must be a loss-making company resident in New Zealand, with a sufficient proportion of expenditure on research and development. The amount of losses that can be cashed out will be capped at $500,000 for the 2015–16 year, increasing by $300,000 over the next five years to $2 million. The amount that can be cashed out in any year is the smallest of that cap, the company’s net loss for the year, the company’s total research and development expenditure for the year, and 1.5 times the company’s labour costs for research and development for the year. Because the cash-out is administered through the tax system, it is delivered in the form of a tax credit. Research and development expenditure as defined for the initiative will be more restricted than expenditure that is subject to the income tax deductibility provisions for research and development. Expenditure on certain activities and some types of expenditure are excluded. A cashed-out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future taxable income; it is intended to provide a temporary cash flow timing benefit. When businesses make a return on their research and development, they will be required to repay some or all of the amounts cashed out. New deductions will reinstate corresponding losses that will be available to offset future income. Triggers for the repayment of amounts cashed out include the sale of research and development assets, liquidation or migration of the company, or the sale of the company. Application date The amendments will apply to income years beginning on or after 1 April 2015. 5 Key features Eligibility (Clauses 192 and 213) The proposed eligibility requirements, as set out in new sections MX 1 and MX 2 of the Income Tax Act 2007, are intended to target the initiative to start-up firms engaging in intensive research and development. The initiative is not intended to apply to highly structured research and development companies or those who are not meeting their tax obligations. The applicant must be a company that is resident in New Zealand for the whole year and not be one treated, under a double tax agreement, as a resident of a foreign country or territory. A company incorporated part-way through the year will be eligible as long as it meets all the requirements for the part of the year that it is in existence. A company that is owned by the Crown, or a special corporate entity as defined, or one that is publicly listed will not be eligible. The company must have a net loss for the relevant tax year, and meet the wage intensity criteria. It must have research and development expenditure, and intellectual property that results from the research and development must vest, at least partially, in the company. It must also have complied with all tax law obligations. A company that is part of a group of companies that includes a foreign company or a company that is treated, under a double tax agreement, as a resident of a foreign country will not be eligible. Similarly, if a company is part of a group of companies, the group must meet the requirement to have a net loss (in aggregate), meet the wage intensity requirement, and have complied with all tax law obligations. These features are important for the integrity of the initiative. Look-through companies and qualifying companies are excluded. Wage intensity criteria In order to target the initiative to research and development start-ups, expenditure on labour is used as a proxy to gauge the intensity of research and development. Evidence indicates that loss-making research and development-intensive businesses, particularly smaller and younger businesses, tend to spend a greater proportion of their wage and salary costs on research and development than other businesses. The wage intensity criteria are set out in new section MX 3 and, to be eligible, the company must have a wage intensity calculation of 0.2 or more. The intensity calculation is: total research and development labour expenditure total labour expenditure 6 Total research and development labour expenditure is defined as the total of:  salary or wages paid to employees for carrying out research and development;  amounts paid to shareholder-employees as income for carrying out research and development; and  the costs of research and development carried out by a contractor multiplied by 0.66 (the multiplier is intended to reduce profit and non-wage cost components of the contract price). Research and development labour expenditure does not include labour employed on activities that are excluded from eligibility. Total labour expenditure is the total of:  salary or wages paid to employees;  amounts paid to shareholder-employees as income; and  the costs of research and development carried out by a contractor multiplied by 0.66 (as in the numerator). Amount of the cash-out (Clauses 192 and 213) Because the cash-out is administered through the tax system, it is delivered in the form of a tax credit. Similarly to other tax credits, the amount will be cashed out only for the relevant year. That means that it will not be possible to cash out a loss in a year subsequent to when the loss arose. New section MX 4 sets out the amount of tax credit for a year. It is the smallest of:  $500,000 multiplied by the corporate tax rate;  the company’s net loss for the year multiplied by the corporate tax rate;  the company’s research and development expenditure for the tax year multiplied by the corporate tax rate; or  the company’s total research and development labour expenditure for the year, multiplied by 1.5 and also multiplied by the corporate tax rate. It is proposed that the $500,000 cap on eligible losses will be increased to $2 million over five years (by increments of $300,000 per year). New section MX 5 proposes to extinguish tax losses that are cashed out. Research and development expenditure (Clauses 213, 217 and schedule 1) The definition of “research and development” is similar to that which applies to provisions that govern deductibility of research and development expenditure in the income tax rules. Using the existing definition is simpler for taxpayers already familiar with it for accounting purposes. However, to ensure that the initiative stays targeted, qualifying expenditure is limited. 7 Expenditure on certain activities will be excluded because they generally take place in a post-development phase, are related to routine work or there is an indeterminate relationship between the activity and economic growth. Many of the activities are likely to take place when the company is less likely to be capital and cashflow-constrained. Excluded activities An activity performed outside of New Zealand. Acquiring or disposing of land, and related activities, except if the land is used exclusively for housing research or development facilities. Acquiring, disposing of, or transferring intangible property, core technology, intellectual property, or know-how, and related activities (for example: drafting sale and purchase agreements for patents). Prospecting for, exploring for, or drilling for, minerals, petroleum, natural gas, or geothermal energy. Research in social sciences, arts, or humanities. Market research, market testing, market development, or sales promotion, including consumer surveys. Quality control or routine testing of materials, products, devices, processes, or services. Making cosmetic or stylistic changes to materials, products, devices, processes, or services. Routine collection of information. Commercial, legal, and administrative aspects of patenting, licensing, or other activities. Activities involved in complying with statutory requirements or standards. Management studies or efficiency surveys. Reproduction of a commercial product or process by a physical examination of an existing system or from plans, blueprints, detailed specifications, or publicly available information. Pre-production activities, such as a demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up, and trial runs. Similarly, some items of expenditure are excluded on the basis that their inclusion could create an economic distortion, inequity between taxpayers in a similar position or risk compromising the integrity of the initiative. A notable exclusion is for expenditure that is not deductible. Excluded expenditure Expenditure for goods and services to the extent to which they relate to an activity that is an excluded activity (see the table above). Expenditure on goods and services used to provide a service of research or development to an external contractee, or used to further another person’s research or development activities. Expenditure that corresponds to a payment for which the person has made an election under section CX 47(4) (Government grants to business). Expenditure for which no deduction is available for the income year. Expenditure for or under a financial arrangement. Expenditure for the acquisition or transfer of intangible property, core technology, intellectual property, or know-how. 8 Reinstatement of losses (Clauses 99, 117, 192, 194, 195 and 213) A cashed-out loss can be thought of as an interest-free loan from the Government to be repaid from the taxpayer’s future taxable income; it is intended to provide a temporary cashflow timing benefit when the company is in tax loss. If the company or the shareholders make an untaxed return on their investment before they have repaid the value of the cashed-out loss, this will lead to an outcome that is concessionary to the taxpayer. In addition to the untaxed receipt, they also retain the benefit of the remaining cashed-out losses that have not yet been repaid. This also creates a fiscal risk. If the company is able to sell intellectual property or if the company is sold, it is highly likely the research and development company will no longer be constrained to the same degree by the market failures and cashflow constraints affecting small research and development-intensive start-up companies. In this situation, the original policy rationale will no longer apply, as the company will have funds available to pay back the value of the cashed-out loss. New section MX 6 sets out the rules required to recover the value of any remaining cashed-out loss to ensure the correct policy outcome. It is proposed that the cashed out payments should be repaid (and corresponding losses reinstated) when:  the company makes a return on their investment by disposing of or transferring research and development assets;  the company migrates;  if the company is liquidated;  the company amalgamates with another company; or  if more than 90 percent of the company has been sold since the company first cashed- out research and development tax losses. It is proposed that the company will have deductions corresponding to the repayments in order to reinstate the losses. New section DV 26 and new subsection EJ 23(1)(ab) reinstate the loss and should allow the deduction to be carried forward in line with other deductions for expenditure on research and development. In the case of the sale of research and development assets, the repayment amount (research and development repayment tax) will be capped at the market value of the consideration for the disposal or transfer multiplied by the tax rate. However, if both the sale of research and development assets and one of the other triggers occurs in the same year, all of the cashed out amounts will need to be repaid that year. In all five cases the repayment amount will be reduced by income tax paid by the company from the time that losses were cashed out. The payment of income tax is a repayment of the cashed-out amount (because the company does not have the use of losses that have been extinguished to set off against that income). No further repayments will be required if the company has already derived sufficient taxable income to repay the balance of the cashed out amounts before one of these events occurs. 9 Example R&D Bio is incorporated in May 2015. It cashes out losses of $150,000 and $300,000 for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years respectively. It receives tax credits of $42,000 and $84,000. It carries forward other losses of $50,000. In the 2017–18 year the company enters a manufacturing phase selling trading stock to earn net income of $150,000. It has taxable income of $100,000 and pays income tax of $28,000. In the 2018–19 income year it sells know-how for $250,000 and also has taxable income of $80,000. That year R&D Bio has to pay research and development repayment tax of $70,000 ($250,000 \* 0.28) as well as income tax of $22,400. In the 2019–20 income year R&D Bio has taxable income of $150,000 and pays income tax of $42,000. Unless R&D Bio cashes out further losses, no further repayments will be required from that time. Repa ym ents and income tax pa yments made since the 2017–18 income year ($28,000+$70,000+$22,400+$42,000=$162,400) exceed the tax credits paid for the 2015–16 and 2016–17 income years ($42,000+$84,000=$126,000). Imputation No credit balance will arise in an imputation credit account of a company that has cashed out a loss until that company has repaid the cashed-out amounts. This is to maintain neutrality with taxpayers who are not able to cash out losses. The rules are set out in new section OB 47B Example In the example above, R&D Bio will not have a credit balance in its imputation credit account for either the 2017–18 year, nor for the 2018–19 income year. It will have a credit balance of $36,400 for income tax paid for the 2019–20 income year (income tax of $42,000 - loss cash-out balance of $5,600). Effect on deductions It is proposed that a deduction mechanism is used to reinstate the losses. Those deductions will be available to be allocated to a future income year. Administration (Clauses 180, 181, 187, 230 and 238) Companies will need to apply to cash out their tax losses. Applications will need to be made at the same time companies file the corresponding income tax return. The income tax return and the application will need to be in electronic form. Electronic filing will also be required when a company pays research and development repayment tax. Like other tax credits, cashed out amounts may be offset against tax payable by the company. The rules governing the administration of the initiative are set out in sections LA 7, LB 4B and MA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and new sections 70C and 97C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 10 Consequential amendments (Clauses 88 and 267) Consequential amendments are being made in section DF (1BA) of the Income Tax Act 2007 and to the GST Order in Council 1992. 11 Black hole expenditure 12 13 OVERVIEW These proposed amendments will give effect to changes to the income tax treatment of certain items of “black hole” expenditure that were announced as part of Budget 2014. “Black hole” expenditure is business expenditure that is not immediately deductible for income tax purposes, and also does not form part of the cost of a depreciable asset for income tax purposes which means it cannot be deducted over time as depreciation. The amendments are primarily targeted at black hole research and development (R&D) expenditure. Under current tax law, taxpayers are allowed immediate income tax deductions for R&D expenditure incurred up until the point that an intangible asset is recognised under the accounting rules. Any further development expenditure incurred generally must be capitalised. The problem is that development expenditure incurred subsequent to the recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes is potentially never able to be deducted for income tax purposes. This may discourage businesses from undertaking R&D that they would have undertaken in the absence of taxation. The amendments aim to reduce the cases where tax rules may be discouraging investments that would be undertaken in the absence of taxation, by allowing capitalised expenditure to be deducted or depreciated, as appropriate. On 7 November 2013, a Government discussion document, Black hole R&D expenditure, was released, which outlined initial proposals to allow tax deductions for black hole R&D expenditure. The proposals were part of the Government’s “encouraging business innovation” initiative under its Business Growth Agenda “Building Innovation” workstream. Submissions were generally supportive of the intent of the proposals to relieve black hole R&D expenditure. However, many of the submitters wanted the scope of the proposals widened to provide tax deductibility for both successful and unsuccessful capitalised development expenditure towards intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes. In response to these submissions, the scope of the proposals was widened to also provide tax deductibility for these expenditures. Additionally, a number of submitters identified other categories of expenditure that fit within the policy framework in the discussion document (namely, expenditure relating to registered designs and the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially) and the proposals were extended to cover them. 14 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE ON DERECOGNISED NON-DEPRECIABLE ASSETS (Clause 85) Summary of proposed amendment For taxpayers that have developed intangible assets that are not depreciable for tax purposes, an amendment to section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will allow a one-off income tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure (incurred on or after 7 November 2013) upon the intangible asset to which it relates being derecognised for accounting purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. Key features Section DB 34 will allow a taxpayer who has developed an intangible asset (recognised for accounting purposes) that is not depreciable for tax purposes an income tax deduction for capitalised development expenditure they have incurred on the asset. The proposed amendment only applies for expenditure incurred on or after 7 November 2013, the date the discussion document was released. The deduction will be allowed upon the intangible asset being derecognised (that is, written off) for accounting purposes (other than due to its disposal). The deduction will be allowed irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or the R&D was unsuccessful. The deduction will be allowed in the income year in which the relevant intangible asset is derecognised for accounting purposes. Background Taxpayers are currently allowed immediate tax deductions under section DB 34 of the Income Tax Act 2007 for R&D expenditure incurred up until the point that an intangible asset is recognised under the accounting rules. Any further development expenditure incurred must be capitalised. In the event that the R&D project does not create an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, any development expenditure incurred post-recognition of an intangible asset for accounting purposes is generally non-deductible for tax purposes. This may discourage businesses from undertaking R&D investments that would have been undertaken in the absence of taxation. 15 It would be inappropriate, from an economic perspective, to allow tax deductibility for expenditure towards creating an asset that would not have been likely to have a finite life if successful. Not allowing a deduction for losses in this situation is the counterpart of not taxing capital gains. It is recognised, however, that technology tends to move at a relatively fast pace and it is likely that R&D-generated assets will have finite useful lives, even if those lives are not able to be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty at the time of the asset’s creation. While capitalised expenditure on successful R&D can lead to an asset that is worth more for a period than the amount of capitalised expenditure, resulting in an untaxed gain, not allowing any deduction for capitalised expenditure on an asset that can only have a finite useful life appears harsh. Allowing a one-off tax deduction for capitalised R&D expenditure that relates to an intangible asset that is non-depreciable for tax purposes upon the intangible asset being derecognised for accounting purposes (other than due to its disposal) appears the most appropriate solution. This would mean that a deduction would be available irrespective of whether the asset was useful for a period or the R&D investment was completely unsuccessful. Restricting deductions to when an asset has been derecognised for accounting purposes restricts deductions to cases when it is clear that the expenditure is of no on-going value. Expenditure incurred on or after the date of the 7 November 2013 release of the Government discussion document, Black hole R&D expenditure, should be eligible for deductibility under the proposed new provision. This was signalled as the Government’s preferred option in the discussion document. This was done to ensure that the discussion document’s release did not prompt businesses to defer their R&D expenditure in anticipation of new tax rules coming into effect. Allowing additional historical R&D expenditure to be eligible for deductibility would significantly increase the fiscal cost, but provide only limited additional benefit in reducing the bias that those who have incurred sunk costs have towards selling the resulting asset over continuing to hold it. The proposed change will reduce distortions against investment in R&D caused by the current tax rules. 16 CLAW-BACK FOR DERECOGNISED NON-DEPRECIABLE ASSETS (Clause 73) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new section CG 7C of the Income Tax Act 2007 will claw back, as income, deductions that have been taken for capitalised development expenditure on derecognised non-depreciable intangible assets, in the event that the intangible asset is sold or becomes useful again. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. Key features New section CG 7C is a claw-back provision, which will apply to a taxpayer if:  they have been allowed a deduction under section DB 34 because proposed new section DB 34(3) applies (that is, a deduction for capitalised development expenditure on a non-depreciable intangible asset that has been derecognised for accounting purposes); and  the previously derecognised intangible asset: – is disposed of for consideration that is not income under another provision of the Income Tax Act 2007; or – is used or available for use. In the case of a disposal for consideration, the amount that will be clawed back as income will be the lesser of the consideration derived for the disposal and the amount of the deduction previously taken. In the case of the asset being used or becoming available for use, the entire amount of the deduction previously taken will be clawed back as income. For the purposes of the depreciation rules, the taxpayer will be treated as never having had the deduction. Therefore, if the taxpayer eventually acquires an item of depreciable intangible property to which the expenditure relates, they will be able to depreciate the expenditure. Any income arising under proposed new section CG 7C will arise in the income year in which the previously derecognised intangible asset is disposed of for consideration, or is used or available for use, as the case may be. 17 Background There is risk that, after a taxpayer has taken a deduction for capitalised development expenditure on a derecognised non-depreciable intangible asset, the intangible asset may be sold or become useful. In the case of a sale, the taxpayer has conceptually derived income. Therefore, a claw-back provision is necessary to preserve a neutral tax treatment by ensuring that a taxpayer does not receive a deduction that is larger than the loss they have suffered. If a taxpayer was able to receive an early deduction for expenditure that has created what turns out to be a useful asset, they would receive a significant advantage. Therefore, a claw-back provision is appropriate, as it would reduce this advantage and ensure greater economic neutrality and consistency with the treatment of expenditure that has created an asset that has always been regarded as successful. Without a claw-back provision, there would be a risk of taxpayers manipulating the system. A claw-back provision is therefore an important integrity measure. 18 DEPRECIABLE COSTS OF CERTAIN DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Clauses 105, 106, 109 and 110) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed new section EE 18B of the Income Tax Act 2007 will enable taxpayers who have created an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes to include capitalised expenditure that relates to the asset as part of the depreciable costs of the asset. Application dates The amendment allowing capitalised expenditure relating to an existing item of depreciable intangible property (other than a patent, patent application, or plant variety rights) to be included as part of the item’s depreciable costs will apply from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. The amendment allowing capitalised expenditure relating to a patent, patent application, plant variety rights or the new additions to schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 proposed in this bill to be included as part of the item’s depreciable costs will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. Key features New section EE 18B specifies that the “cost” to a person of an item of depreciable intangible property for depreciation purposes includes expenditure they have incurred on an underlying item of intangible property, if that item gives rise to the item of depreciable intangible property. In the case of patents, patent applications, plant variety rights, and the new additions to schedule 14 proposed, the person must have incurred the expenditure on or after 7 November 2013, for the expenditure to be included in the depreciable cost of the item of depreciable intangible property. Consequential amendments are proposed to sections EE 33 and EE 34, which set out how to calculate the annual rate of depreciation for fixed-life intangible property and patents, respectively. Background Capitalised expenditure may be rendered non-depreciable, even if a taxpayer is successful in creating an intangible asset that is depreciable for tax purposes (that is, an asset listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007). As explained below, this may occur because, although the expenditure has given rise to an asset that is depreciable for tax purposes, the depreciable costs of the asset have been interpreted to exclude some types of expenditure. 19 An interpretation statement issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue takes the view that the depreciable patent costs (for a taxpayer who has lodged a patent application with a complete specification or had a patent for an invention granted) are limited to the administrative and legal fees incurred in the patent process. 1 According to the Commissioner’s view of the law, capitalised development expenditure relating to the invention that is the subject of the patent (or patent application) is potentially neither deductible nor depreciable for tax purposes. In reaching this view, the Commissioner considered the policy intent as to the meaning of “patent” in the depreciation provisions, and concluded that: 2 \[T\]here is no evidence that the meaning of “patent” was intended to be changed to mean “the patent and the invention” under the current depreciation legislation. Had this been the intention, it would be expected that such change would have been explicitly made. As this is not the case, it is the Commissioner’s view that, in the depreciation rules, the patent costs means the costs of acquiring the patent and not expenditure incurred in devising an invention. Although the Commissioner’s interpretation statement is confined to patents, it is likely that the depreciable costs of plant variety rights would be interpreted in the same way, given that they are both types of intellectual property rights obtained by registration following an R&D process. A similar interpretative issue exists in the case of “the copyright in software”, with some doubt having been expressed about whether taxpayers who have developed software for use in their own business are able, under current law, to depreciate all of the capitalised development costs. However, unlike in the case of patents and plant variety rights, there is a clear statement in a 1993 policy statement indicating that the policy intent was that capitalised expenditure incurred in the development of software by a business for its own use should be depreciable. In outlining the tax treatment of expenditure incurred on in-house software development, the statement says that “when the development is completed capitalised costs will be deductible under the depreciation regime”. 3 It is understood that taxpayers who have developed software for use in their own business, based on the 1993 policy statement, have been depreciating all of the capitalised development costs. Where expenditure is in economic substance related to the creation of an asset with a finite useful life that can be estimated in advance with a reasonable degree of certainty, the appropriate tax treatment is to allow the expenditure to be depreciated over that life. The policy framework adopted for resolving issues with the depreciability of capitalised expenditure relating to intangible assets that are depreciable for tax purposes is to:  make the changes apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year, with capitalised expenditure incurred on or after the date of the release of the Government discussion document, Black hole R&D expenditure, (that is, 7 November 2013) to be eligible for depreciation in the case of patents, patent applications, plant variety rights and the proposed new additions to schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007; and  make the changes retrospective to the statutory time-bar, for intangible assets, when the policy intent was that the expenditure should be depreciable. 1 Interpretation statement “Income tax treatment of New Zealand patents”, Tax Information Bulletin Vol 18, No 7 (August 2006), p 51. 2 Ibid, p 44. 3 Appendix to Tax Information Bulletin Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993). 20 NEW DEPRECIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (Clauses 72, 87, 104, 107, 111 to 116, 213(2), (9), (10) and (12), and 216) Summary of proposed amendment Proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 will make depreciable registered designs, applications for the registration of a design, and copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially. Several associated amendments are proposed as a consequence. Application date These amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year. Key features The proposed amendment to schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007 will make the following intangible assets depreciable:  a design registration;  a design registration application; and  copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially (as defined in section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994). Including definitions of “design registration” and “design registration application” in section YA 1 make it clear that a registration of a design in New Zealand under the Designs Act 1953 and a registration of a design in other jurisdictions, under similar laws and associated applications, are eligible for depreciation. Section EE 16 defines the cost of these new depreciable intangible assets for the purpose of calculating the annual amount of depreciation allowed. Expenditure incurred before 7 November 2013 is ineligible for depreciation. Section EE 19 reiterates this, making it clear that costs incurred before 7 November 2013 for these new depreciable intangible assets cannot be added to the asset’s adjusted tax value and depreciated. New section EE 34B sets out how to calculate the annual rate of depreciation for a design registration. Section EE 67 provides that the legal life of a design registration or application for depreciation purposes commences from when the application was first lodged. Section EE 67 also provides that the legal life of the copyright in an artistic work to which section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 applies is the length of time, from when the artistic work was applied industrially, that protection against infringement of that copyright is available under that Act. 21 Section DB 37 will allow a taxpayer a deduction for capital expenditure they have incurred for the purpose of applying for the grant of a design registration if they did not obtain the design registration because the application was not lodged or was withdrawn, or because the grant was refused. The deduction will be allocated to the income year in which the taxpayer decides not to lodge the application, withdraws the application or is refused the grant of design registration. Section CG 7B ensures that this existing claw-back provision will claw back, as income, deductions that have been taken for aborted or unsuccessful applications for the grant of design registration, if the taxpayer subsequently sells or uses the abandoned application property. Other minor consequential amendments proposed to sections EE 44, EE 57, EE 60 and EE 61 ensure that the depreciation rules operate appropriately in relation to the new depreciable intangible assets. Background An intangible asset can only be depreciated for income tax purposes if it is listed in schedule 14 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For an item of property to be listed in schedule 14, it must be intangible and have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on the date of its creation or acquisition. A design registered in New Zealand under the Designs Act 1953 has a legal life of 15 years (assuming all rights of renewal are exercised). Designs registered in other jurisdictions are also likely to have finite legal lives. It is therefore appropriate to make registered designs depreciable by adding them to schedule 14. The 15-year legal life of a registered design generally begins on the date on which the first application is made, rather than the date the registration is granted. Therefore, it is also appropriate to make applications for the registration of a design depreciable, by adding them to schedule 14. This will ensure that depreciation is available during the time that registration is pending. Section 75 of the Copyright Act 1994 contains a special exception from copyright protection for an artistic work that has been applied industrially. The effect of this exception is that, once an owner of copyright in an artistic work (or a licensee) has applied the artistic work industrially (as defined in the section), within New Zealand or overseas, their copyright protection will only last for a further 16 years (for product designs and casting moulds) or 25 years (for works of craftsmanship). This time limit makes the copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially appropriate for inclusion in schedule 14. These proposed additions to schedule 14 follow feedback from submissions received on the Government discussion document, Black hole R&D expenditure, released on 7 November 2013. To ensure consistency with the proposed amendments on the deductibility of capitalised R&D expenditure, only capitalised expenditure on registered designs (and applications) and copyright in an artistic work that has been applied industrially incurred on or after 7 November 2013 will be eligible for depreciation. 22 As it is proposed to make registered designs depreciable, it is also appropriate to allow an immediate tax deduction for expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for registration of a design if registration is not obtained. This will parallel the tax treatment of expenditure incurred for the purpose of applying for a patent when a patent is not obtained. An existing claw-back provision applies to deductions taken for aborted or unsuccessful applications for the grant of a resource consent, a patent or plant variety rights, if the taxpayer subsequently sells or uses the abandoned application property. Applying this provision to deductions taken for aborted or unsuccessful design registration applications is appropriate to ensure consistency with existing policy settings. 23 Other policy matters 24 25 GST AND BODIES CORPORATE (Clauses 249, 250, 251, 253 and 254) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments clarify that services provided by bodies corporate are supplies for consideration for goods and services tax (GST) purposes and give bodies corporate the option to register for GST. Rules to protect the tax base from any adverse consequences of allowing this choice are included in the proposed amendments. Application dates The proposed amendments apply from the date of the bill’s introduction, with the exception of the definition of body corporate, as well as proposed sections 5(8A) and 51(1B), which have an application date of 1 October 1986 (the date the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 came into effect). Key features Under the proposed rules, section 2 defines a “body corporate” as having the same meaning as under the Unit Titles Act 2010 but excludes a body corporate of a retirement village registered under the Retirement Villages Act 2003. “Common property” is also defined in section 2 and has the same meaning as in the Unit Titles Act 2010. Proposed section 5(8A) clarifies that levies and other amounts paid by a body corporate’s members to the body corporate are treated as being consideration received for services supplied by the body corporate to its members. Despite this, proposed section 51(1B) excludes the value of the body corporate supplies to members, from the body corporate’s total value of supplies, when determining whether the body corporate is required to register under section 51(1). This means that if a body corporate only makes supplies to its members, it will not be required to register, even if the value of the levies or other amounts exceeds the $60,000 registration threshold. However, if a body corporate is required to register because supplies to third parties exceed the registration threshold, or the body corporate decides to voluntarily register, it will be required to return output tax on the full value of both its body corporate and third-party supplies. Proposed section 51(5B) provides that a body corporate that makes an application to voluntarily register after the introduction of the bill, must be registered with effect from a date after the registration application date. If a body corporate decides to register, or is required to do so, proposed section 5(8AB) treats any funds held by the corporate at the date of registration as a supply of services for consideration in the course or furtherance of its taxable activity. The supply of services is treated as performed on the day of registration. 26 Bodies corporate that were registered before the date of introduction, but decided to cancel their registration post-introduction, are only able to deregister from the date they applied to cancel their registration (proposed section 52(8)). A proposed addition to section 10(7A) ensures that any common property held by the body corporate at the time of deregistration is valued at zero. This will mean the body corporate is not required to return output tax on those assets held at the time its registration ceases. Proposed section 52(9) provides that a body corporate that registers for GST after the date of introduction cannot deregister for a period of four years. Background A body corporate is a legal entity created under the Unit Titles Act 2010 when multiple owners have unit title properties in an apartment building or similar complex. The body corporate comprises all of the property owners and provides a way for the owners to act together in relation to their common and shared interests. Bodies corporate are responsible for managing, maintaining, repairing and organising insurance for the building and common property areas, and for making and enforcing the body corporate operational rules. Bodies corporate are a product of unit owners undertaking joint actions for their mutual benefit. Funds of the body corporate are held in expectation that they will all be spent. This means that from a GST perspective, bodies corporate should be largely GST-neutral. Currently, most of New Zealand’s approximately 13,800 bodies corporate are not registered for GST, and Inland Revenue’s historic position was not to allow bodies corporate to register. A High Court decision in Taupo Ika Nui Body Corporate v CIR (1997) 18 NZTC 13,147, appeared to support this position by suggesting that many bodies corporate would not be required to register for GST because they did not make supplies to unit owners for consideration. More recently, Inland Revenue was asked to revisit the question of whether bodies corporate should be able to register for GST. To answer this question, Inland Revenue undertook a legal analysis and came to a different view which was that a body corporate could be considered to make supplies to its owners and therefore carry on a taxable activity. A consequence of this view is that, if a body corporate makes supplies that exceed the $60,000 threshold, it would be required to register for GST. Given the historic position, the new interpretation could adversely affect thousands of property owners, as it would require a large number of bodies corporate to register for GST. The proposed amendments clarify that services provided by bodies corporate are supplies for consideration for GST purposes and give bodies corporate the option to be registered. This ensures that bodies corporate that are not currently registered will not have to do so unless they would be required to do so because of the level of their supplies to non- members or third parties. It also gives certainty to bodies corporate already registered for GST as these bodies corporate will be able to remain registered. The approach proposed in this bill replaces that set out in the Government discussion document, GST treatment of bodies corporate, released on 6 June 2014. 27 Detailed analysis Proposed section 5(8A) clarifies that body corporate levies are consideration for a supply by the body corporate to its members. This rule has an application date of 1 October 1986 (the date that GST took effect). This is to ensure that bodies corporate that registered before the date of the bill’s introduction have that position confirmed by legislation. Proposed section 51(1B) excludes the value of supplies to members, from the body corporate’s total value of supplies, when determining whether the body corporate is required to register under section 51(1). This should give the majority of bodies corporate the option of registering for GST, unless their supplies to third parties exceed $60,000, in which case they will be required to be registered. The effect of the proposed rules is summarised in the following diagram: Retirement villages registered under the Retirement Villages Act 2003 are excluded from the new rules (see new definition of “body corporate”). This is because the nature of supplies that retirement villages provide can be distinguished from supplies made by a typical body corporate. This is recognised by the Unit Titles Act 2010, as significant parts of the Act do not apply to retirement villages. The bill also proposes rules to protect the tax base from any adverse consequences that could arise as a result of allowing bodies corporate the option to register. This is achieved by imposing an output tax liability on any funds held by the body corporate at the time of registration if a body corporate decides to register after the bill’s introduction date (new section 5(8AB)). This prevents a body corporate from obtaining a tax advantage by accumulating untaxed funds while it is not registered and then registering to claim input tax deductions when it spends the funds. The amendment, which will apply on the date of the bill’s introduction, ensures bodies corporate remain GST-neutral. 28 A body corporate’s “funds” include all cash and non-cash investments held by the body corporate. The new rule is intended to ensure a body corporate cannot restructure its cash reserves to avoid the application of output tax upon registration. “Funds” will include a body corporate’s operating account, long-term maintenance fund, contingency fund and any capital improvement fund (see definition of “fund” under the Unit Titles Act 2010). Any financial investments held by the body corporate are also included (see section 130 of the Unit Titles Act 2010). Proposed section 51(5B) requires that a body corporate that makes an application to voluntarily register after the introduction of the bill must be registered with effect from a date after the registration application date. This prevents bodies corporate from backdating their registration. Registration backdated prior to the introduction of the bill would have the effect of avoiding the output tax liability imposed under proposed section 5(8AB), discussed above. Conversely, bodies corporate that were registered prior to the date of introduction, but decide to deregister post-introduction, are only able to deregister from the date they applied to cancel their registration (see section 52(8)). This prevents bodies corporate from backdating their registration cancellation to a time that is most advantageous to them. A body corporate seeking to deregister will not be refunded any GST paid on its funds held at the time of deregistration. This is consistent with the treatment of other registered taxpayers leaving the GST system. There is also likely to be a point on the “save and spend” cycle of a body corporate’s activities when its accumulated funds are very low and it can exit the GST base with limited financial impact. A four-year lock-in rule is proposed to prevent bodies corporate from continually changing their registration status (new section 52(9)). It applies when a body corporate registers after the date of introduction and then later applies to cancel its registration. The cancellation can only take effect on, or after the later of:  the date on which the body corporate applies to cancel its registration, or  the day that is four years after the day of registration. Under the proposed rules, body corporate supplies to third parties still count towards the $60,000 registration threshold. These supplies are treated like any other supply for GST purposes and consequently, if a body corporate’s supplies to third parties exceed the $60,000 registration threshold, it will be required to register. This will mean the body corporate will be required to return output tax on any funds on hand at the time of registration. This is considered preferable to treating supplies to third parties as separate from body corporate supplies, with only third-party supplies making up the body corporate’s taxable activity. A segregated approach would require the body corporate to apportion its input tax deductions depending upon which supplies they relate to. This could impose significant compliance costs on bodies corporate. As the exclusion in proposed section 51(1B) only applies for the purposes of section 51(1), once registered a body corporate must return output tax on the value of all the supplies it makes (both body corporate supplies and third-party supplies) in the usual way. 29 ANNUAL SETTING OF INCOME TAX RATES (Clause 65) Summary of proposed amendment The bill sets the annual income tax rates that will apply for the 2015–16 tax year. The annual rates to be set are the same that applied for the 2014–15 tax year. Application date The provision will apply for the 2015–16 tax year. Key features The annual income tax rates for the 2015–16 tax year will be set at the rates specified in schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 30 31 CHILD SUPPORT (Clauses 3 to 64) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments seek to simplify the administration of the Child Support Scheme established by the Child Support Act 1991. There are also changes which seek to ensure that the policy objectives in the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 are achieved by correcting minor errors, clarifying wording and making additional consequential amendments to simplify the Child Support Scheme. Application date With some exceptions, the amendments come into force on the day after the date the bill receives Royal assent. However, the following clauses come into force on 1 April 2015:  clauses 4, 49(1) and (2), and 50(2) to (7) (Interpretation, Application, Transitional and Savings Provisions);  clause 15 (Living Allowance);  clauses 23 and 28(2) (Penalties for underestimation of taxable income). Clauses 31(2), 40(3) and (4), and 41(2) come into force on 1 April 2016. Clauses 52, 56 and 57 come into force on the date on which the bill receives Royal assent. Key features The bill proposes that some of the child support reforms per the Child Support Amendment Act 2013 be repealed or amended. The changes to the reforms focus principally on the options for making payments or the method of recognising special circumstances for assessment purposes, and also focus on reducing debt. The bill also proposes remedial changes to the Child Support Act 1991 and the Child Support Amendment Act 2013. The following remedial changes are intended to provide a simpler and improved Child Support Scheme, with positive or no impact on families:  The definition of “social security benefit” (and “beneficiary”) will be changed to exclude sole parents who are full-time students and who claim a Jobseeker Support payment on the grounds of student hardship between academic years. For child support purposes, they will be treated in the same manner as full-time students receiving a student allowance (clause 4(3) and (4)).  Removing the ability in some situations for only one parent to end an assessment, particularly when it is based on estimated income. Removing the ability to unilaterally “opt out” will provide greater certainty about assessments and a reduced number of situations when retrospective assessments and debts occur (clauses 10, 11, 24(3), 28(1) and (47)). 32  Changing the requirements regarding notices of assessment and entitlement to cope with unusual situations when the required amount differs from the usual assessment – for example, departures to a formula assessment (clauses 25 and 26);  Allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to make determinations that differ from what is applied for under the original departure application if the result of the determination is correct and fair, without the need for a cross-application or re- application to be made (clause 31(3));  Allowing a parent to object to an amended assessment even when their final liability or entitlement has not changed, but a component within it has changed (clause 29(1) and (2));  Currently, if a receiving carer receives an Unsupported Child Benefit for one child they are unable to end a child support assessment for any other children they care for, even when they are not receiving a benefit in respect of those other children. The ability to end an assessment would be widened to apply with respect to the children for whom the carer is not receiving a benefit, allowing them to set up voluntary arrangements (clause 11). The proposed remedial changes to clarify the legislation, correct errors or make the Scheme easier to understand include:  updating references to “welfare benefits” to reflect the new names and eligibility criteria following the welfare reform and ensure the child support living allowance is connected to the correct new benefit (clause 15);  clarifying who can appeal a decision by the Commissioner to disallow an objection to an assessment (that is, the original objector can appeal rather than any person) (clause 29(3));  having consistent use of the defined term “annual rate of child support” in the Act (clauses 12 and 36);  clarifying how the split of the minimum amount of child support works when the liable parent has a formula assessment and voluntary agreement in place (clause 12);  ensuring the estimation of taxable income sections still work when an overseas parent lives in a country where tax is not payable on income (clause 16);  clarifying who the parties are in an application to be declared a step-parent (clause 37);  making clear the time periods and income limits being referred to in the new administrative review ground on income earned to cover re-establishment costs (clauses 40 and 41);  clarifying who can elect to end a Commissioner-initiated administrative review (clauses 32 to 35);  clarifying the parties in various appeals such as an appeal to a decision establishing the proportions of shared care (clauses 38 and 39);  restoring an earlier provision that allows information to be communicated to other agencies by the Commissioner in relation to threats made by the liable parent against the receiving carer. This used to apply to a spousal maintenance relationship but was inadvertently narrowed to just child support assessment relationships (clause 48). 33 Background The Child Support Act 1991 sets out the requirements for individuals to apply for, be assessed on, and make and receive child support payments. It contains procedures for changes to assessments, determinations of liabilities, objections and appeal procedures via the Family Court regarding child support assessments. There are also provisions dealing with debt collection, penalties and debt write-offs of child support. The Child Support Amendment Act 2013 implemented major reform of the Child Support Act to bring in a new, more detailed formula assessment which takes into consideration the costs of raising children and also the incomes of both parents. It also:  changes the way a liable parent and a receiving carer is determined;  recognises a greater number of people involved in the care of a child;  provides greater options for the payment of child support;  encourages payment of child support obligations; and  provides greater flexibility for the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to manage child support debt. The intention of the changes is to improve fairness of the Child Support Scheme by taking into account a wider range of individual circumstances and to reflect changes in family structure and involvement in bringing up children since the Child Support Scheme was first introduced. The amendments in Part 1 of the Child Support Amendment Act were to come into force on 1 April 2014 and Part 2 of that Act was to come into force on 1 April 2015. Those dates were delayed by one year under provisions contained in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Amendment Act 2014. This was to allow Inland Revenue additional time to implement the changes to the quality standard required. Remedial changes were also made under the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. The bill proposes that some of the child support reforms per the Child Support Amendment Act, the Child Support Act and the Taxation Amendment Acts be repealed or amended. The changes to the reforms do not affect the new framework of how child support is determined and who is responsible for paying child support – they concern the administration of the scheme – principally the options for making payments or the method of recognising special circumstances for assessment purposes. Under proposals in the bill, the following aspects of the reforms will no longer proceed and be repealed in the Child Support Amendment Act:  compulsory deductions of child support from employment income, and the associated grounds for an exception such as privacy or cultural reasons (a new provision for voluntary deductions will achieve similar outcomes) (clause 54);  the new definition of “adjusted taxable income”, which includes income adjustments to taxable income, such as income in trusts and companies (an existing administrative ground can be used instead) (clauses 13, 14 and 17 to 22); 34  a penalty for receiving carers who are parents and who underestimate their income for the year (existing provisions can achieve some similar outcomes) (clause 23);  the ability to offset current payments against past debts where the liable parent and receiving carer swap roles (a new administrative review ground will be used instead) (clause 58);  the discretion to recognise other payments, such as payment of school fees qualifying as child support payments when they directly benefit the child (as existing provisions can achieve similar outcomes) (clause 54). 35 CHARITIES WITH OVERSEAS PURPOSES (Clause 218) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes adding 10 new charitable organisations to schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Donors to the following charities will then be eligible for tax benefits on their donations:  Adullam Humanitarian Aid Trust  Bicycles for Humanity, Auckland  Face Nepal Charitable Trust Board New Zealand  Hagar Humanitarian Aid Trust  Himalayan Trust  International Needs Humanitarian Aid Trust  Mercy Ships New Zealand  Orphans Aid International Charitable Trust  ShelterBox New Zealand Charitable Trust  So They Can In addition, Aotearoa Development Cooperative is to be renamed as ADC Incorporated following an organisation restructure by the charity. Application date The amendments will apply on 1 April 2015. The renaming of Aotearoa Development Cooperative to ADC Incorporated will have effect from 20 June 2014. Reference to Aotearoa Development Cooperative will be removed from schedule 32 on and after 1 April 2015. Background Donors to organisations listed in schedule 32 are entitled as individual taxpayers, to a tax credit of 33⅓% of the monetary amount donated, up to the value of their taxable income. Companies and Māori authorities may claim a deduction for donations up to the level of their net income. Charities that apply funds towards purposes that are mostly outside New Zealand must fulfil a number of requirements and be listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 before donors become eligible for these tax benefits. 36 The 10 charitable organisations proposed to be added to schedule 32 in this bill are engaged in the following activities:  Adullam Humanitarian Aid Trust: Formerly known as Barnabas Aid for Syria, the Trust was established in 2012 to provide aid and relieve the suffering, poverty and distress for communities caught up in natural disasters, civil strife, human rights abuses, war, oppression and violence. The Trust is currently active in Syria and is using a network of Christian churches to deliver aid to dislocated communities affected by the Syrian civil war. Aid is not restricted to church members. All individuals in need are equally eligible to receive aid when they are part of the same community that is suffering the distress which the Trust is seeking to relieve.  Bicycles for Humanity, Auckland: This Trust is the Auckland chapter of the global Bicycles for Humanity network which provides second-hand bicycles, spare parts, and tools and accessories to impoverished communities in developing countries. Established in 2013, the Trust is working towards making its first shipment of second-hand bicycles to Namibia with the assistance of the Bicycle Empowerment Network. Following this, the trustees will consider a similar shipment to a South Pacific nation.  Face Nepal Charitable Trust Board New Zealand: Since 2010, Face Nepal’s objective is to provide economic and educational resources directed at the alleviation of poverty in Nepal. Its activities largely focus on arranging and co-ordinating volunteer work to support projects identified by the Nepali community.  Hagar Humanitarian Aid Trust: The Hagar Humanitarian Aid Trust, formerly operating as Hagar New Zealand Charitable Trust was set up in 2009 to assist with the recovery and empowerment of women and children who are victims of human rights abuses, particularly human trafficking, sexual exploitation and gender-based violence. The Trust is active in supporting missions in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Viet Nam and Myanmar.  Himalayan Trust: Established in 2008, the objective of the Trust is to provide medical and public health facilities and supplies, assistance in or towards quality education and improved facilities for Himalayan people. The Trust’s work focuses on education, health and environmental protection. In various guises, the Trust has been operating since 1966 and was previously known as The Himalayan Trust Board (1974) and before that The Sherpa Trust Board (1966).  International Needs Humanitarian Aid Trust: The Trust works in support of poor communities in over 33 countries in the developing world, including Pacific Island nations. It specifically funds projects directed at community development, vocational education, micro-credit, child-focused programmes and disaster relief. The Trust was formed in 2008 as an associated Trust to International Needs New Zealand (INNZ), which has been operating since 1972, specifically to be the operating arm of INNZ to carry out humanitarian work as described.  Mercy Ships New Zealand: Through the use of hospital ships, Mercy Ships is involved in the provision of medical services and surgery in West Africa. It also provides medical training to build technical medical capacity in the host country. Mercy Ships New Zealand was set up in 2003 to support the work of Mercy Ships International which was founded in 1978. 37  Orphans Aid International Charitable Trust: Established in 2004, the Trust was set up to provide social, medical and housing assistance to Romania’s orphans. It also now actively supports projects in India directed at relieving child poverty, including education, and providing opportunities for women to develop work skills and run microbusinesses. They have recently become active in Uganda in projects aimed at preventing child abandonment and poverty.  ShelterBox New Zealand Charitable Trust: The Trust was set up in New Zealand in 2013 and is part of a global network of 18 affiliates directed at providing those stricken by disaster with a relief package for basic shelter and on-going self- sufficiency. Most recently, the New Zealand Trust was involved in funding shelter boxes and delivery of relief in the Philippines following the devastating typhoon of October 2013.  So They Can: The organisation is predominantly active in Kenya, and supports a number of projects directed at relieving child poverty and providing opportunities for women to develop work skills and run their own businesses. Funds are raised through a child sponsorship programme, grants from corporate and private foundations, and fundraising events. The Trust formerly operated under the name Breathe Foundation (2010). Aotearoa Development Cooperative was added to the list of donee organisations in schedule 32 on 1 April 2013. It works with poor communities in Burma. In 2014 the charity restructured and became an incorporated society from 20 June 2014. The proposed change preserves the charity’s donee status for the 2014 and later income years. 38 CALCULATION OF FRINGE BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYMENT- RELATED LOANS (Clause 203) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will allow employers who are part of the same group of companies as a person in the business of lending money to the public, the option of using the market interest rate method to calculate the fringe benefit arising from an employment-related loan. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Currently only persons who are in the business of lending money to the public can use the market interest rate method to determine the fringe benefit arising from an employment- related loan. That method requires the employer to assess what the market interest rate would be on a comparable loan to an unrelated third-party borrower. The proposed amendment will allow an employer who is a member of the same group of companies as a person who is in the business of lending money to the public, to use this method of valuing an employment-related loan. The proposed amendment includes transitional rules to waive the normal change of method notification period so that an affected employer can apply the market interest rate method soon after enactment. If the election notice is provided before 1 April 2016, the market interest rate method can be applied from the quarter following notification. For a part-year period, the employer may treat this period as a whole income year for the purposes of satisfying the requirement that the method is applied for at least two income years. To qualify the employer must be paying fringe benefit tax (FBT) on a quarterly basis. Background When a person receives a loan from their employer at less than market interest, a fringe benefit arises, as the employee benefits from the reduced interest expense. This fringe benefit is subject to FBT. To limit compliance costs, most employers must calculate the fringe benefit arising from the loan by comparing the interest accruing under the loan with the interest that would accrue if the loan was at the prescribed interest rate, which is set by regulation. The prescribed rate is set with reference to the Reserve Bank’s survey of published floating first mortgage interest rates. 39 Since 2006, an employer in the business of lending money to the public has had the additional option of valuing the fringe benefit by comparing the rate of interest under the loan with the rate of interest that they charge on a comparable loan made to an unrelated borrower. This additional option was provided because persons who lend money to the public were expected to have systems in place to easily monitor movements in market rates of interest, and could therefore apply the market interest rate method without difficulty. The option for valuing the fringe benefit was not extended to other employers, as the compliance costs associated with the option would not make it worthwhile. An issue has since emerged where employers whose employees receive discounted loans under an arrangement with a lender within the same group of companies cannot apply the market interest rate method to value the benefit when the employer itself is not lending to the public. These employers are required to value the benefit using the prescribed interest rate, which may lead to their having a slightly higher FBT liability because it does not factor in market discounts that may be available. As it is anticipated that the employer will be able to obtain information on market interest rates from the lender, these employers too should be able to apply the market interest rate method without difficulty. Accordingly, the proposed amendment to give these employers the option of applying the market interest rate method should not have any compliance cost implications. 40 CFC remedials 41 42 FAIR DIVIDEND RATE METHODS (Clauses 137, 138 and 139) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes changes so that taxpayers can change between fair dividend rate (FDR) methods in calculating income from offshore investments no more than once every four years for each foreign investment fund (FIF) interest. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1 April 2016 tax year. Key features Proposed section EX 51B of the Income Tax Act 2007 sets out when a person, other than a unit valuing trust, can use the FDR periodic method, and when they must use the FDR annual method. The proposed section allows a change in method no more than once every four years on a per fund basis. Proposed section EX 53 sets out when a unit valuing trust or other persons who choose to do so can use the FDR periodic method. The proposed section allows a change in method no more than once every four years on a per fund basis. Background Under the FDR method of calculating their taxable income from offshore investments, taxpayers are considered to have income from their FIF interests equal to 5 percent of the opening value of each investment. This is referred to as the “usual method” of calculation. Most taxpayers use this method but they also have the option to use a more complex FDR method known as the “unit-valuing funds” method. Taxpayers must use the same FDR method for all of their FIF interests. This second method was introduced for certain investment funds, for whom the calculation method is mandatory. It was also extended to all taxpayers who were willing to incur the additional compliance costs of basing the FDR calculation on the value of the investment on each day of the year – that is, they must make 365 calculations rather than just one. The unit-valuing method provides a more accurate result as it takes into account changes in value throughout the year. If a FIF loses value over the course of a year, the unit-valuing method will calculate a lower amount of income than the usual method because the latter method will base the entire year’s income on the (higher) opening value. Conversely, if the FIF gains value over the year, the unit-valuing method will result in more taxable income than the usual method. As the choice of method is made retrospectively – that is, after the taxpayer has observed if the FIF has gained or lost value, they are able to pick the method which produces the least income. This was not an intended feature of the rules as it was expected that taxpayers would choose one or the other method and use that consistently. The change proposed in this bill is intended to restore the original policy intention. 43 PREPAID EXPENDITURE (Clause 126) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes amending the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules so that they mirror the effect of the prepayment rules in section EA 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and prevent taxpayers from claiming an immediate deduction for an amount that should be spread over several years. Application date The amendment will apply from the 1 April 2016 tax year. Key features Section EX 20C(13)(a)(iii) corrects an anomaly in the rules which allowed immediate deductions for amounts that should be spread over several years. This is achieved through direct reference to the adjustments provided in sections CH 2 and DB 50. Background The tax rules allow taxpayers to claim deductions for expenses incurred in generating taxable income. If a taxpayer incurs an expense in one year for something that will last more than one year, adjustments are made so that the deductions are spread over the relevant years. These rules, known as the prepayment rules, are separate from the depreciation rules but serve similar purposes. Currently, the CFC rules do not include such adjustments and taxpayers can make a full claim in the year payment was made for expenses that may relate to goods or services that will be used over many years. This is an omission. 44 PART-YEAR EXEMPTIONS FOR AUSTRALIAN FIFS (Clause 134) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to limit the test for the Australian FIF exemption so that it only applies to the period of the year that the taxpayer holds an interest in the FIF. Application date The amendment will apply to income years starting on or after 1 July 2011. Background Taxpayers with a 10 percent or more interest in a FIF that is resident in Australia generally qualify for the Australian FIF exemption and do not have to declare income from that investment. One of the criteria for the exemption is that the taxpayer must have a 10 percent or more income interest in the FIF at all times in the income year. Income interests are calculated by averaging out the taxpayer’s interests in the FIF across the income year. This means that a taxpayer who has a 40 percent income interest in a FIF for six months of the year and a 20 percent income interest in the FIF for the remaining six months will be considered to have a 30 percent income interest in the FIF for the whole year. This averaging out is done across the whole income year irrespective of whether the taxpayer had an interest in the FIF at all times or not. Therefore, if a taxpayer acquires a 15 percent holding halfway through a year, their income interest is calculated as a 7.5 percent income interest for the year. In that scenario the taxpayer would not qualify for the Australia exemption in the year they acquired the interest in the FIF. In the next year they would qualify, if they continued to hold the interest and, if they dispose of the interest halfway through the following year, they would again fail to qualify for the Australian exemption as their FIF income interest would be less than 10 percent. This is not the correct outcome as the taxpayer has held the same interest in the FIF across the three years, but is not taxed consistently. The proposed amendment is intended to correct this anomaly. 45 ANTI-AVOIDANCE RULE FOR THE TEST GROUPING CONCESSION (Clause 165) Summary of proposed amendment The bill introduces an anti-avoidance rule to prevent taxpayers from using the test grouping rules, which were introduced as a compliance concession, to gain an unintended tax advantage. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 April 2016. Key features Proposed section GB 15BA will provide that the Commissioner may treat an election to include or not to include a particular CFC in a test group as reversed if the person has entered into an arrangement to reduce the amount of net attributable CFC income or increased the amount of net attributable CFC losses. Background The CFC rules allow taxpayers to consolidate same-jurisdiction CFCs into a test group when applying the active income exemption test. This means that operational CFCs, who earn active income, can shelter the passive income of holding CFCs. While some criteria have to be met (for example, each CFC must have a taxed CFC connection with the same jurisdiction) the taxpayer otherwise has complete discretion over whether they include a CFC in a test group. The rules were introduced to allow taxpayers to take full advantage of the active income exemption, irrespective of their business structures. Because taxpayers have discretion in applying the test group rules it is possible for them to arrange matters so that they pay no tax when they have income but still accumulate losses when they do not. This means that when there is an operating (active) CFC and a holding (passive) CFC the taxpayer can choose to group the CFCs when the holding CFC has passive income but not when it makes a loss. When grouped, the active income of the operating CFC will grant the group the active income exemption. When not grouped, the loss of the passive CFC will be carried forward to be used against any future attributable income within that jurisdiction. In this way taxpayers may be able to accumulate losses without having to pay tax on their income. 46 TEST GROUPS FOR GROUPS OF COMPANIES ACQUIRED OR DISPOSED OF DURING THE YEAR (Clauses 128 and 129) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to allow taxpayers who acquire or dispose of groups of foreign companies during the year to access the test grouping concession in that year, for those companies. Application date The amendment will apply for income years starting on or after 1 July 2009. Key features Proposed sections EX 21D and EX 21E are being amended so that taxpayers using either the default or accounting standard tests can form test groups comprising newly acquired or disposed CFCs. Background Taxpayers have the option of grouping multiple CFCs together into a test group and working out the ratio of active to passive income based on the consolidated accounts when applying the active business test. The CFCs must be resident in the same country and the taxpayer must hold an income interest of more than 50 percent in each CFC. The latter rule prevents a single CFC from being used by more than one taxpayer. This rule produces counter-intuitive results when a taxpayer acquired or disposed of a group of foreign companies part-way through a year. For example, NZ Co A sells a group of two Australian companies to NZ Co B on 1 October. As neither NZ Co A or NZ Co B will have more than a 50 percent interest in the Australian companies, as the interests are calculated by taking an average holding over the whole income year, they will be unable to access the test group concessions. This may mean that the passive income earned by one of the Australian companies will now have to be attributed back to both New Zealand taxpayers as it will no longer be sheltered by the active income of the other company. In this scenario the intent of the more than 50 percent interest income requirement is to prevent NZ Co B from grouping the newly acquired companies with the existing CFCs that it already owns. There is no need for the rules to also prevent the two Australian companies from being grouped together by the New Zealand taxpayers for the periods that they hold the interests. 47 ATTRIBUTION OF INCOME FOR PERSONAL SERVICES (Clause 166) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to allow taxpayers to choose between the standard attribution of personal services rules or the CFC rules if they provide personal services through a foreign company. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Proposed section GB 27 is being amended to exclude from the exemption from attribution, income from personal services derived through a CFC, if the amount is less than $5,000. This means that a person who derives income from personal services through a CFC has to attribute that income irrespective of the amount. Proposed section GB 27 is also amended so that the exemption from attribution under section GB 27 only applies in relation to income derived from a CFC if the person has filed a tax return attributing income to the person under the CFC rules. Background The attribution rule for income from personal services applies when a taxpayer has interposed an entity (commonly a company) between themselves and the person they are providing services to. For example, Dr Paul could provide medical services to his patients but incorporate a company to be the contractual provider of those services. The company would then employ Dr Paul, who would see the patients and carry out the services. The attribution rule looks through the interposed entity and in certain circumstances attributes the income earned by the company for services provided by the taxpayer, back to the taxpayer. These rules are duplicated and have the same effect under the CFC rules. Income earned by a taxpayer providing services through a foreign company is considered passive income and is attributed back to the taxpayer. While the tax effect of the two sets of rules is the same, taxpayers who fall under the CFC personal services attribution rules face a more complex undertaking as they must comply with both the personal services attribution rules and the CFC rules. This additional compliance burden is not felt by taxpayers who derive both personal services income and other forms of passive income from their CFC interests. These taxpayers would have to comply with the CFC rules regardless of how their personal services income was calculated due to the other passive income. However, taxpayers who only derive personal services income from their CFC interests face additional costs compared with taxpayers who fall under the standard rules. The proposed new rule corrects this. 48 ATTRIBUTABLE FIF INCOME METHOD FOR INDIRECTLY HELD INVESTMENTS (Clause 136) Summary of proposed amendment This bill proposes to align the tax rules for taxpayers who hold FIF interests indirectly with those applying to taxpayers who directly hold FIF interests. The amendments are intended to ensure that income does not arise from a FIF interest if the taxpayer does not hold an interest in the FIF during that FIF’s relevant accounting period. Application date The amendment applies to income years starting on or after 1 July 2011. Background Taxpayers who hold a 10 percent or more interest in a FIF have the option of using the attributable FIF income method to calculate their FIF income. This method provides a more accurate result but at a higher compliance cost and largely mirrors the CFC rules. Under the attributable FIF income method a taxpayer who acquires an interest in a FIF after the end of that FIF’s income year will not have attributable income. For example, a taxpayer with a 31 March balance date acquires an interest in FIF Co on 1 March 2013. FIF Co’s balance date is 31 December. The taxpayer will not have to include any income from FIF Co’s 2013 tax year (1 January 2012 to 31 December 2012) as they did not acquire the FIF interest until after the end of that year. Taxpayer’s 2013 tax year (March balance date) FIF’s 2013 tax year (December balance date) Taxpayer acquires FIF interest 49 If, instead of directly acquiring the FIF, the taxpayer acquires a CFC that holds the same FIF investment, the treatment is different even if the taxpayer is using the attributable FIF income method for that interest. CFC’s 2013 tax year (March balance date) FIF’s 2013 tax year (December balance date) Taxpayer acquires CFC interest Taxpayer’s 2013 tax year (March balance date) In this scenario, the taxpayer is attributed income from the FIF for the 2013 tax year even though they did not hold an interest in the FIF during the FIF’s 2013 income year. 50 MINOR TECHNICAL REMEDIALS The following changes are proposed to correct or update terminology used in the CFC rules to make them easier for readers to understand. Section Change proposed Section CD 18(3)(a) Refers to income tax paid “in the country”. Expands to “in the country or territory” in line with changes made to section LJ 3 in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Section CQ 2(2) Renames section title “Special rule: Taxable distributions under the attributable FIF income method”. Current title uses out-of-date terminology. Section CQ 5(3) Clarifies that income from a FIF held by a non-attributing active CFC can be attributed by inserting “or a non-attributing acting CFC under section EX 21B (Non-attributing active CFCs)” at the end of the subsection. Section CQ 5(1)(c)(xiv) Deletes the word “non-resident’s” to match section DN 6(1)(c)((xiv). Section DN 6(1)(c)(iv) Replaces the word “regime” with “rules” to match section CQ 5(1)(c)(iv). Section DN 6(3) Clarifies that losses from a FIF held by a non-attributing active CFC can be attributed by inserting “or a non-attributing acting CFC under section EX 21B (Non-attributing active CFCs)” at the end of the subsection. Section EX 58(6) Clarifies that the section, which applies to CFCs that hold interests in FIFs, applies to both non-attributing active CFCs and non-attributing Australian CFCs by inserting “or a non-attributing active CFC under section EX 21B (Non-attributing active CFCs)” at the end of the subsection. Section EX 24(3) + (4) Replaces references to “branch equivalent income or loss” with “CFC attributable income or loss” to reflect current terminology. Section EX 31(2)(c)(ii) Clarifies how the rules apply when a taxpayer acquires separate share packages on different days by amending the subsection to read along the lines of “At the earliest date in the income year when the person acquires shares in the company, if the person does not own shares in the company at the beginning of the income year”. Section EX 44(1) Clarifies that this provision applies on an interest-by-interest basis rather than to all interests. Section EX 62(2)(a) Repeals section containing transitional rules relating to the 2011 FIF rule changes. These rules are no longer needed. Section EX 62(6) Removes references to “branch equivalent method” as this method is no longer available. Section YA 1 Introduces a definition of an “indirect attributing interest” to clarify the changes made to section EX 58 in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. 51 52 Working for Families 53 54 OVERVIEW Four remedial amendments to the Working for Families (WFF) scheme are proposed. Two amendments correct drafting oversights that occurred when the definition of “family scheme income”, used to calculate WFF recipients’ entitlements was broadened on 1 April 2011, while the remaining two amendments aim to reduce compliance costs for recipients of the scheme. 55 MAIN INCOME EQUALISATION SCHEME (Clause 188) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section MB 1(5D) will ensure that when a WFF recipient draws on funds deposited by associated entities into their main income equalisation account it does not reduce their WFF tax credit entitlement. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2011–12 tax year. Key features The proposed amendment will extend section MB 1(5D) so that it includes “the person” and all their associated entities listed in section MB 9(b) to (d). Background The definition of “family scheme income” was broadened on 1 April 2011 in order to improve the fairness and integrity of the WFF system. As a result section MB 9 was created to ensure deposits made by persons and their associated companies and trusts into the main income equalisation scheme are included as family scheme income. Its inclusion prevents people from making deposits to the scheme to artificially reduce their income and therefore increase their WFF entitlements. However, section MB 1(5D), which prevents these main income equalisation scheme deposits from being included in a person’s family scheme income again when they draw on their funds, only refers to “a person”. It does not list the person’s associated entities. Therefore, arguably when people draw on income equalisation funds deposited into their account by an associated entity, the funds could be included in their family scheme income a second time. This does not align with the policy intention as it overstates the income available to a person over a set period. 56 SCHOLARSHIPS AND BURSARIES (Clause 189) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section MB 13(2) clarifies that educational bursaries are not included as income for WFF purposes. Application date The amendment will apply from the beginning of the 2011–12 tax year. Key features The proposed amendment to section MB 13(2)(f) in the Income Tax Act 2007 will extend the list of payments excluded from the definition of “family scheme income” from “an educational scholarship” to “ an educational scholarship or educational bursary”. This will ensure that bursaries are treated the same as scholarships for WFF purposes so receiving a bursary will not reduce WFF recipient entitlements. Background A number of payments that are treated as exempt from income tax are also not intended to affect Inland Revenue social policy entitlements. Two of these payments are scholarships and bursaries for attendance at educational institutions. Although these payments are similar, the current wording of the exemption of scholarships and bursaries from income tax in section CW 36 suggests they are different. On 1 April 2011, “scholarship” but not “bursary” was added to the list of payments in section MB 13 that are excluded from “family scheme income” which is used to calculate WFF recipient entitlements. It was intended that scholarships and bursaries would be treated as being excluded from family scheme income. 57 FAMILY ASSISTANCE CREDIT DETAILS NOT NEEDED (Clause 227) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section 41(4)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will remove the requirement for taxpayers to provide Inland Revenue with details of every family assistance credit paid to them as this is unnecessary. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment repeals section 41(4)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background Section 41(4)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 requires WFF recipients to furnish details to Inland Revenue of each family assistance credit paid to them in the tax year. However, Inland Revenue does not request or require this information from recipients. 58 FAMILY SCHEME INCOME STATEMENTS (Clause 232) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to section 80KV of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will enable WFF recipients and their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner to submit separate family scheme income declaration forms. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment will change subsections (1) and (2) and add subsections (3) and (4) of section 80KV in the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure people who have been given a notice of entitlement (NOE) from the Commissioner are not always required to provide in their statement of family scheme income for the tax year, the income of their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. Instead, it will also enable the person’s spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner to submit a separate family scheme income form to confirm or correct the information contained in the NOE. Background Inland Revenue sends out NOEs in order to confirm a person’s social policy entitlements and obligations. Section 80KV(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 then requires the person to give the Commissioner a statement that confirms or adds to the information in the NOE, including the family scheme income of their spouse, civil union partner or de facto partner. This requirement generally works for most households. However, for some (especially those with child support arrangements), it can be difficult to identify each spouse’s portion of family scheme income. In these situations it would be better for each person to submit their income separately. 59 Other remedial matters 60 61 REPEAL OF SIMPLIFYING FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR INDIVIDUALS LEGISLATION (Clauses 225(4) and (8), 240 and 243) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to repeal legislation aimed at simplifying filing requirements for individuals. The legislation was enacted in November 2012 but is not due to take effect until the 2016–17 income year. Implementing the filing simplification legislation is no longer a sound investment given Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation (BT) programme as the expected benefits from the earlier simplification legislation will be better delivered as part of the BT programme. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2016–17 tax year. Key features Several amendments are being made to section 33AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to ensure that after 1 April 2016:  Individuals who are not required to file a tax return but choose to do so anyway can continue to file tax returns for each of the four tax years immediately preceding the tax year in which the individual decides to file a tax return. The result will be that individuals will continue to have the ability to choose the years in which they file a tax return.  Recipients of Working for Families (WFF) tax credits (and their partners) must continue to file a tax return or receive a personal tax summary but only if they receive their WFF entitlements from Inland Revenue. Consequential amendments are also being made to section 120B, which relates to use-of- money interest, and to section 139B, which relates to late payment penalty of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Background Filing simplification for individual taxpayers legislation was enacted in November 2012 as part of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Returns Filing, and Remedial Matters) Bill introduced in September 2011 and is due to take effect from the 2016–17 income year. This legislation contained the following two initiatives:  4 + 1 square-up: Individuals who are not required to file a tax return, but who choose to do so anyway, will be required to file tax returns for the previous four years in addition to the year in which they have chosen to file; and 62  WFF delinking: The link between the receipt of WFF tax credits and the requirement to file an annual income tax return was removed. The policy underlying that legislation was set three years ago. At that time, the Government was concerned about the inherent tension between individuals who are not required to file a tax return and those who are. Individuals who are required to file a tax return may have a tax debt in one year and receive a refund in another year. For individuals who are not required to file, however, there is no incentive to file a tax return in order to square-up in years of tax debt, but they can easily claim any available refunds. The practice of filing tax returns in those years in which an individual is due a refund is referred to as “cherry picking”. This practice has also resulted in a situation where large amounts of revenue are being paid out in refunds, without a reciprocal obligation to pay any tax debt. The simplified filing legislation addressed concerns of fairness by removing the ability for people to “cherry pick” and removing the requirement for others to file tax returns. These initiatives were seen as a “back-end” solution (that is, stopping people from cherry picking the years in which they file a tax return) to a “front-end” problem of inaccurate PAYE deductions during the year, leading to the need to square-up and file a tax return at the end of the year. At the time the filing simplification legislation was enacted in 2012, Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme was in its very early stages. Inland Revenue’s current BT thinking is for more streamlined processes with salary and wage earners’ information being provided by third parties such as employers and banks to Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue undertaking the necessary calculations. This should lead to a more accurate PAYE structure, which means fewer people in a refund or tax-debt position at the end of the year. The problem of “cherry picking” would become redundant. Inland Revenue’s review of the implementation of the filing simplification legislation has concluded that the legislation is no longer a sound investment, given Inland Revenue’s BT programme. Inland Revenue considers that on current plan the BT programme will deliver the benefits (that is, more accurate PAYE) that are expected from the simplification initiatives from the 2019–20 year, and in a more coherent way that aligns with the vision of a proactive and efficient tax system. In response to the findings of the Inland Revenue review, the Government agreed to repeal the filing simplification legislation. 63 EXTENDING THE GRACE-PERIOD OF THE TAX ON NET ASSETS FOR DEREGISTERED CHARITIES (Clause 264) Summary of proposed amendment Section 129(2) of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 is being amended to defer the application of the new tax on net assets for deregistered charities who provide housing as their main or primary purpose. This deferral is needed to provide more time for officials to finalise the eligibility requirements for the new tax exemption for community housing entities and for Charities Services to complete its review of the charitable status of community housing providers. Application date The amendment will apply beginning on 14 April 2014. Key features The amendment ensures that new section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007, which imposes a tax on the net assets of deregistered charities, does not apply to entities that provide housing as their main or primary purpose and who have been deregistered by Charities Services before 1 April 2017. Background The Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 introduced a new set of tax rules for entities removed from the Charities Register (or deregistered). These rules are now in effect. One of these rules (new section HR 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007), imposes obligations in relation to accumulated income and assets of a deregistered charity. In the year after the entity is deregistered, it can choose to either:  distribute or apply the income and assets: – for charitable purposes; or – in accordance with the entity’s rules (as contained in the Charities Register).  become liable to pay tax on the value of its net assets. This rule has split application dates. It applied from 14 April 2014 to any entity which requested to be removed from the Charities Register. It is due to apply beginning on 1 April 2015 to any other entity which is removed from the Charities Register. 64 The split application dates were introduced to deal with the possibility that some community housing providers might be deregistered. Charities Services undertook to review all registered charities which provided housing as their main or primary purpose following the Queenstown Lakes Community Housing Trust High Court decision. The grace-period for the net assets tax was set at 1 April 2015 to allow time for entities to be deregistered without being affected by the new obligations in relation to accumulated income and assets. It was also expected that by 1 April 2015 it would be clear how these deregistered charities were to be treated for tax purposes under the new tax exemption for community housing entities. However, delays in finalising the tax exemption for community housing entities have meant it has not been possible for Charities Services to advance its review. Consequently, the Government has agreed to extend the grace-period for the tax on net assets for deregistered charities who provide housing as their main or primary purpose from 1 April 2015 to 1 April 2017. 65 MEANING OF “CHARITABLE OR OTHER PUBLIC BENEFIT GIFT” (Clauses 183(1), (2), (3) and (6)) Summary of proposed amendment Section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007 is being amended to clarify that for a subscription to be treated as a “charitable or other public benefit gift”, it must, in addition to not conferring any rights arising from its membership:  be an amount of $5 or more; and  be paid to an entity that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are wholly or mainly applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purpose within New Zealand; or  be an organisation listed in schedule 32. Application date The amendment will apply from 1 April 2008, when the Income Tax Act 2007 came into force. Background Currently, income tax relief is provided to individuals, companies and Māori authorities for gifts of money to a charitable or other public benefit entity (“a charitable or other public benefit gift”). Under section LD 3 of the Income Tax Act 2007, there are two categories of “charitable or other public benefit gift”:  a gift of $5 or more paid to a society, institution, association, organisation, trust or fund (an entity) that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual, and whose funds are wholly or mainly applied to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purpose within New Zealand, or an organisation listed in schedule 32 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (generally an overseas donee organisation); and  a subscription paid to an entity, only if the subscription does not confer any rights arising from its membership. Based on current wording, the legislation does not require a subscription paid to an entity to be:  an amount of $5 or more; and  the entity to be one that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of an individual wholly or mainly to charitable, benevolent, philanthropic or cultural purpose within New Zealand, or listed in schedule 32. 66 This is contrary to the original policy intent. The corresponding provision in the Income Tax Act 2004 clearly set out these requirements for subscription paid to be treated as a “charitable or other public benefit gift”. It would appear that this is a drafting oversight which arose as part of the rewrite of the Income Tax Act 2004. The implication is that in the absence of the proposed amendment, individuals would be able to claim tax relief for subscriptions paid to a non-charitable or public benefit entity, provided the subscription did not confer any rights arising from membership. 67 TAX STATUS OF TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTE SUBSIDIARIES (Clauses 76, 183(4), (5) and (6), and 213(67) and (75)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that the income tax exemption for a Tertiary Education Institute (TEI) be widened to include income earned by a business, such as a subsidiary, for the benefit of the TEI. Application date The proposed amendment applies beginning on 1 July 2008. Key features The amendment extends the scope of section CW 55BA, relating to income derived by a TEI, to include TEI subsidiaries. This would mean that income from a business carried on for the benefit of a TEI is also exempt. This restores the position that existed for TEI subsidiaries before enactment of section CW 55BA in the Income Tax Act 2007 which explicitly provided TEIs with an income tax exemption. Background TEIs and subsidiaries that applied their income for the purposes of the TEI were generally income tax-exempt as charities until 1 July 2008, when a requirement was introduced for charities to be registered with the Charities Commission 4 in order to be tax-exempt. Because the TEIs would have been subject to multiple reporting and monitoring requirements, a specific exemption was enacted for them, but this did not cover their subsidiaries. The amendment will restore the position that existed for TEI subsidiaries before the Charities Commission registration requirement. This means subsidiaries that were tax- exempt before 1 July 2008 will retain this position. 4 Now Charities Services – Department of Internal Affairs. 68 DEFINITION OF “REMUNERATION” IN VALUATION RULE FOR ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED TO MINISTERS BY RELIGIOUS ORGANISATIONS (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the valuation rule for accommodation to ministers provided by religious organisations under section CE 1E of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendment will apply beginning on 1 April 2015. Background Section CE 1E of the Income Tax Act 2007 (inserted by section 15 of the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014) contains a specific valuation rule for accommodation provided to ministers of religion. The rule provides that the taxable value of the accommodation is 10 percent of the minister’s “remuneration”. This rule is a codification of a longstanding administrative practice. Historically, the administrative practice involved valuing the accommodation for taxation purposes at 10 percent of the stipend provided to the minister. In codifying this rule it was agreed that the legislation should cover not only stipends but also equivalent remuneration to reflect changes to the way religious bodies have remunerated their ministers over the years. Some churches, for example, now pay their ministers market-related salaries. Accordingly, the valuation formula in the Income Tax Act uses the term “remuneration”. A technical question has arisen over whether the term “remuneration” could be interpreted to include the value of the accommodation being provided to the minister. This outcome is not within the policy intent as it is inconsistent with previous administrative practice. To avoid doubt, the proposed amendment makes it clear that the value of accommodation is not included in the minister’s “remuneration” for the purpose of calculating the taxable value of the accommodation in accordance with section CE 1E. 69 COMMENCEMENT DATE FOR ACCOMMODATION PROVISIONS APPLYING TO MINISTERS OF RELIGION (Clause 81) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment ensures that the new accommodation provisions introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 that relate to accommodation provided by religious organisations to their ministers of religion will apply from 1 July 2013, as originally intended. Application date The amendment will apply on 1 July 2013 to 31 March 2015. Background The accommodation provisions relating to ministers of religion were reorganised in response to submissions made to the Finance and Expenditure Committee. During that reorganisation, the commencement date of the relevant provisions was inadvertently changed from 1 July 2013 to 1 April 2015. To rectify this error, a transitional provision is now proposed, that will cover the intervening period. The transitional provision essentially replicates the requirements of section CE 1E which applies on 1 April 2015. Section CE 1E sets out the 10 percent of “remuneration” formula for determining the taxable value of accommodation provided to ministers of religion. The only difference in the transitional provision is that its formula does not include the “excess rental” as that adjustment was only intended to come into force on 1 April 2015. The “excess rental” is the difference between the market value of the accommodation provided and the market value of accommodation that is reasonably commensurate with the duties of the minister and the location in which he or she performs those duties. 70 FOREIGN SUPERANNUATION (Clauses 71, 75, 96, 133, 145, 213, 256 and 260) Summary of proposed amendments A number of remedial changes are proposed to the tax treatment of foreign superannuation interests held by New Zealand residents in the Income Tax Act 2007. They clarify various aspects of the rules applying to foreign superannuation interests and ensure that the new rules operate as intended. Application date All but one of the proposed remedial amendments will apply on and from 1 April 2014, which aligns with the start date of the new rules. The other proposed change relating to the $50,000 foreign investment fund (FIF) minimum threshold when a person has a FIF superannuation interest will apply beginning on 1 April 2015. Key features The proposed changes:  ensure that the foreign superannuation rules (rather than the FIF rules) apply to interests acquired while a person was a New Zealand tax resident under domestic law, but not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement (DTA);  reintroduce the exclusion from the FIF rules for interests in registered Australian superannuation schemes acquired while a person was a New Zealand resident;  ensure that the schedule method in the foreign superannuation rules applies to lump- sum withdrawals and transfers from a foreign superannuation interest if a taxpayer has less than $50,000 of FIF interests;  ensure that a person who transfers their interest from one foreign superannuation scheme to another foreign superannuation scheme continues to be subject to the foreign superannuation rules rather than the FIF rules; and  resolve historic non-compliance with the FIF rules for persons who return pension income in their income tax return. Background The tax rules applying to foreign superannuation interests held by New Zealand residents were substantially reformed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. 71 The previous rules for interests in foreign superannuation schemes were complex and it was not always clear that they produced an appropriate result. In some cases, the interest was subject to the FIF rules and tax was required to be paid on accrual. When the FIF rules did not apply, tax generally needed to be paid under other tax rules when a distribution was received (such as the rules for pensions, or other tax rules such as the rules for distributions from trusts or companies). From 1 April 2014, under the new rules, interests in most foreign superannuation schemes are taxed only on receipt. Pensions received from a foreign superannuation scheme continue to be taxed in full. For lump-sum withdrawals (and transfers to New Zealand and Australian superannuation schemes), generally a proportion of the amount is taxed depending on how long the person has been resident in New Zealand. The FIF rules no longer apply to interests in foreign superannuation schemes unless the interest is grandparented or the interest is acquired while the person is a New Zealand tax resident. A concessionary rule to help individuals meet their historic tax obligations was also introduced as part of the reforms. If a person made a lump-sum withdrawal or transfer between 1 January 2000 and 31 March 2014 and did not comply with their tax obligations at the time, they have the option to pay tax on 15 percent of the withdrawn or transferred amount. Otherwise, they remain liable under the rules that applied to their scheme at the time of withdrawal or transfer (either the FIF rules or other tax rules that may apply to their interest). The changes proposed in the current bill ensure that the new rules for taxing foreign superannuation interests work as intended. The changes therefore largely confirm or clarify existing policy settings. Detailed analysis Interests in foreign superannuation schemes acquired while not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement Under the new rules for taxing interests in foreign superannuation schemes, the FIF rules continue to apply if a person acquires their interest while they are New Zealand-resident. This is to ensure that the FIF rules that apply to foreign portfolio investments held by New Zealand residents are not undermined. In certain circumstances, a New Zealander who goes overseas to work for several years (for example, on their OE) could still remain a New Zealand tax resident. Currently, a person in this situation with a foreign superannuation interest which was first acquired during this period is deemed to have a FIF superannuation interest and is required to account for tax under the FIF rules. This result is not appropriate if the person is also tax resident in another country and “tiebreaks” to that other country under a double tax agreement (generally, if the person’s affairs are more closely linked to the other country) at the time that they first acquired the foreign superannuation interest. Amendments are being proposed to the definition of FIF superannuation interest to exclude from the FIF rules interests in foreign superannuation schemes acquired while the person is not resident in New Zealand under a double tax agreement (treaty non-resident). When a foreign superannuation interest is acquired in such 72 circumstances, it is proposed that the interest is taxable on receipt – in particular, using the rules in section CF 3 for foreign superannuation withdrawals and the ordinary rules for pensions. This is provided for in proposed new section CF 3(1)(a). Under the proposed change, an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme acquired while the scheme holder is treaty non-resident would not have an exemption period set out in section CF 3(5) and (6). Instead, the assessable period as set out in section CF 3(8) would begin when the person is treated as New Zealand-resident under all double tax agreements for the first time while owning the interest in the scheme. This is achieved by new section CF 3(8)(ab). A consequential amendment is also being made to the rules providing for rollover relief in the case of a transfer following death or a relationship split. Where an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme passes to a person’s spouse under a relationship agreement following death or relationship split, both the transferor and transferee would need to be resident under all double tax agreements for rollover relief to be provided. This is a consequential amendment to maintain revenue integrity. The proposed change would apply beginning on 1 April 2014, which is when section CF 3 came into force. Example Mary is a New Zealand tax resident but has been working in Germany for the past few years. For the purposes of the Germany-New Zealand double tax agreement, Mary is considered to be a resident of Germany. While working in Germany, she contributes to a German pension scheme. Mary moves back to New Zealand and from 14 October 2014 is considered to be resident in New Zealand for the purposes of the Germany-New Zealand double tax agreement. Mary does not have a FIF superannuation interest as she was non-resident under the Germany-New Zealand double tax agreement when she acquired the rights in her pension scheme. Under section CF 3, Mary’s assessable period for her interest in the German pension scheme begins on 14 October 2014. Application of the $50,000 FIF threshold to FIF superannuation interests Under the new rules for taxing interests in foreign superannuation schemes, the FIF rules continue to apply if a person acquires their interest while they are New Zealand-resident. This is to ensure that the FIF rules that apply to foreign portfolio investments held by New Zealand residents are not undermined. However, there is a minimum threshold under the FIF rules for certain taxpayers who have only relatively small foreign portfolio investments. The minimum threshold is intended to reduce compliance costs for these taxpayers. Under the FIF rules, a person has no FIF income or loss if the total cost of their interests in FIFs is less than $50,000. This is provided for in sections CQ 5(1)(d)(i) and DN 6(1)(d)(i). When a person falls within the scope of this FIF threshold and they have not opted to pay tax under the FIF rules, tax is paid on receipt of any distributions from their FIFs under other tax rules that may apply to their interest (such as the rules for distributions from trusts or companies). 73 A problem can therefore arise for an individual who is below this $50,000 FIF threshold and owns a foreign superannuation interest they acquired while they were a New Zealand tax resident, as neither the new rules for foreign superannuation interests nor the FIF rules will apply to them. In this situation, they would need to consider other tax rules that may apply to distributions from their interest, such as the rules for distributions from companies or trusts. That is to say, some of the complication of the previous rules remains. This is not consistent with the intent of the new rules for taxing foreign superannuation interests, which was to provide a relatively simple set of rules for taxpayers to follow. The proposed change addresses this concern by ensuring that the schedule method in the foreign superannuation rules (rather than other tax rules such as the rules for distributions from companies) applies to lump-sum withdrawals (and transfers to New Zealand or Australian superannuation schemes) made from a foreign superannuation interest that was acquired while a taxpayer was a New Zealand resident, where the taxpayer has less than $50,000 of FIF interests. It will require those with no FIF income or loss due to the operation of sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d) to account for tax on any lump-sum withdrawals and transfers received from their foreign superannuation interest using the schedule method, as set out in section CF 3(10), (11) and (19). This proposed change introduces the concept of a “low-value FIF superannuation interest” in section CF 3(1)(b) which determines when section CF 3 applies. Note that proposed new section CF 3(1)(b) refers to sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d) in their entirety, which means that the proposed change would only apply if the person has not opted out of the FIF minimum threshold and into the FIF rules through sections CQ 5(1)(d)(ii), (iii), and DN 6(1)(d)(ii) and (iii). A person with a low-value FIF superannuation interest would not be eligible for an exemption period set out in section CF 3(5) and (6). An amendment to section CF 3(5) provides clarity that this is the case. The assessable period for a low-value FIF superannuation interest begins when the person first acquired the rights in the scheme. This is achieved by the proposed new wording of section CF 3(8) and new section CF 3(8)(ac). In addition, they would not be permitted to use the formula method set out in section CF 3(12) – (19) to calculate their taxable income arising from a foreign superannuation withdrawal. New section CF 3(9)(b)(ib) reflects this. The proposed change applies from 1 April 2015 to ensure that taxpayers who have taken action on the basis of the current legislation are not disadvantaged. Example George is a New Zealand tax resident. He travels to the United Kingdom for one year for his OE. While working in the United Kingdom he contributes to a pension scheme. During that time he remains a New Zealand tax resident and does not “tiebreak” to the United Kingdom under the New Zealand-United Kingdom double tax agreement. At face value, George has a FIF superannuation interest. However, George has no other foreign investments and the interest in his pension scheme is worth $5,000. Under sections CQ 5(1)(d) and DN 6(1)(d), George has no FIF income or loss and so is not required to account for tax on his foreign superannuation interest under the FIF rules. George transfers his pension scheme to a New Zealand superannuation scheme and calculates his tax liability on the transfer using the schedule method as set out in section CF 3. 74 Previous FIF exemption for Australian regulated superannuation savings: section EX 33 Previously, section EX 33 provided an exemption from the FIF rules for Australian regulated superannuation savings. This was repealed in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. Consequential references to section EX 33 in sections CQ 5(1)(c)(iii) and DN 6(1)(c)(iii) were also repealed by that Act. This was not intended. It is therefore proposed that sections EX 33, CQ 5(1)(c)(iii), and DN 6(1)(c)(iii) be reinstated, effective from the date the of the repeal, 1 April 2014. There is also a proposed amendment to the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” to ensure that a FIF superannuation interest does not include an Australian superannuation interest referred to in section EX 33. Example Natalie is a New Zealand tax resident but works in Australia. She contributes to a regulated superannuation fund while working in Australia. Under section EX 33, Natalie’s interest in an Australian regulated superannuation fund is not an attributing interest in a FIF. Transfers between foreign superannuation schemes Under the rules in section CF 3, a transfer from one foreign superannuation scheme to another (non-Australian) foreign superannuation scheme is not taxable income. This is achieved through omission in section CF 3(2) which lists the types of foreign superannuation withdrawals that are considered to be income. Rollover relief is provided until a person receives a foreign superannuation withdrawal that is income, but the assessable period takes into account the number of years the person held the original interest while they were New Zealand-resident. When a transfer from one foreign superannuation scheme to another occurs, a problem arises because the interest in the new scheme is not adequately carved out of the FIF rules. This is due to a missing reference to section CF 3(21)(b) in the definition of “FIF superannuation interest”. The bill proposes that the definition of “FIF superannuation interest” be amended to include a reference to section CF 3(21)(b). The proposed change would apply from 1 April 2014. Periodic pensions and historic FIF non-compliance When the FIF rules ceased to apply from 1 April 2014, any historic non-compliance under the FIF rules is overridden if the person uses the formula or schedule method for lump-sum withdrawals and transfers made on or after 1 April 2014, if the person’s assessable period began before 1 April 2014. The rule is provided for in section CF 3(22) to ensure that the person is not double taxed. 75 However, section CF 3(22) only applies when a person receives foreign superannuation withdrawals. If there is historic FIF non-compliance, but the person does not receive any foreign superannuation withdrawals and only receives a pension, there is no corresponding provision to override the FIF non-compliance. This problem applies to people who mistakenly included their pension income in their tax return before 1 April 2014 when they should have complied with the FIF rules, as well as those who will start to receive a pension after 1 April 2014. To resolve this problem, the bill proposes to introduce new section EZ 32G to override non- compliance under the FIF rules in two situations. The first is where the person derived no payments from their foreign superannuation interest before 1 April 2014 and receives only pension payments from 1 April 2014. The second situation is when the person received only pension payments from the foreign superannuation scheme before 1 April 2014 and included all of these pension payments in their income tax returns for the appropriate income years by the due date for each of those returns. Corresponding sections are also being introduced in the Income Tax Act 1994 (proposed new section CC 5) and Income Tax Act 2004 (proposed new section CF 4). This change is proposed to apply from 1 April 2014 and would apply to pension payments made from 1 January 2000. This would be in line with the override in section CZ 21B available for certain lump-sum withdrawals and transfers. Example Eva has an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme, which, before 1 April 2014, was an attributing interest in a FIF. Eva did not realise that she had to return her FIF income or loss in her income tax return every year. In 2009, Eva started to receive pension payments from her foreign superannuation interest and assumed she should be paying New Zealand tax on her foreign pension, so she included all of these pension payments in her income tax return each year. From 1 April 2014, Eva’s interest in her foreign superannuation scheme does not meet the definition of “a FIF superannuation interest”, so her interest is no longer an attributing interest in a FIF. This means that from 1 April 2014, Eva should be including her pension payments in her income tax return. New sections EZ 32G and CF 4 in the Income Tax Act 2004, and section CC 5 in the Income Tax Act 1994 provide that because Eva included all of pre-1 April 2014 pension payments in her income tax returns (albeit mistakenly), the FIF income and losses that she should have actually returned before 1 April 2014 have been overridden. Example Leo has an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which, before 1 April 2014, was an attributing interest in a FIF. Leo did not realise that he had to return his FIF income or loss in his income tax return every year. Leo received no distributions from his scheme before 1 April 2014. From 1 April 2014, Leo’s interest is not a FIF superannuation interest and so it is no longer an attributing interest in a FIF. In January 2015, Leo starts to receive a periodic pension from his foreign superannuation scheme. He is required to include these as income in his income tax returns. New sections EZ 32G and CF 4 in the Income Tax Act 2004), and section CC 5 in the Income Tax Act 1994 provide that Leo has no FIF income or loss arising from his foreign superannuation interest before 1 April 2014. 76 TAX POOLING AND INTEREST LIABILITIES (Clauses 207 to 212) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to enable purchased tax pooling funds to be used to meet outstanding interest liabilities on increased amounts of tax resulting from an amended assessment or the resolution of a tax dispute that is subject to challenge proceedings. The current rules allow taxpayers to transfer purchased funds from a tax pool to cover the increased tax owed as a result of an amended assessment, or the resolution of a dispute which is subject to challenge proceedings but not any interest that might be due on these amounts. This change addresses this. Application date The amendment will apply on and from 3 July 2014, being the date of the Government’s announcement of its intent to change the legislation. Taxpayers who had an amended assessment issued or challenge proceedings resolved before 3 July 2014 will be able to access tax pooling funds to pay the interest outstanding if the 60-day period to access tax pooling funds was current on 3 July 2014. Key features Section RP 17(1) currently enables tax pooling funds to be used to meet an obligation to pay provisional tax, terminal tax or an increased amount of tax. The proposed change will enable purchased tax pooling funds to be used to pay interest outstanding on increased amounts of tax resulting from an amended assessment or the resolution of a dispute that is subject to challenge proceedings. Changes are also proposed to sections RP 17B(2), (5), (6) and (7), RP 17B(10) and RP 19B(5) to insert after the term “increased amount of tax”, a reference to “interest payable under Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 on the increased amount of tax”. Amendments are also proposed in these sections to insert after the term “deferrable tax” a reference to “interest payable under Part 7 of the Tax Administration Act on the deferrable tax”. Section RP 19(1B) is being amended to clarify that this section only applies to the payment of provisional tax or terminal tax. This section determines the order in which the provisional tax payment is applied and ensures this is consistent with the specific provisions relating to provisional tax set out (as applicable) in sections 120J to 120V of the Tax Administration Act 1994. For non-income tax revenues, the normal ordering rule in section 120F of the Tax Administration Act 1994 applies. 77 A transitional provision is proposed to be inserted in section RZ 12. This will enable minor errors to be corrected in the calculation of the amount of interest required to be accessed from a tax pooling intermediary during the period from the date of the Ministerial announcement (3 July 2014) until the legislation is enacted. Taxpayers will have 60 days from the date of the enactment of the legislation to amend the previously requested interest amount. Background The tax pooling rules were introduced in 2003 to deal with concerns with the difference between the interest rates charged on underpayments of tax and paid on overpayments of tax. In essence, the tax pooling rules enable tax pooling intermediaries to provide a market for businesses to pool their tax with that of other businesses, so that underpayments can be offset by overpayments within the pool, and the taxpayers receive a more attractive interest rate than would be available through Inland Revenue. The current rules enable taxpayers to transfer funds from a tax pool to pay increased amounts of tax resulting from either an amended assessment of their tax liability or the resolution of a tax dispute that is subject to challenge proceedings. The intent of this change was to stop further interest from accruing on these payments once funds were accessed from a tax pool. However, the interaction of two legislative provisions in the Taxation Acts has resulted in interest continuing to be charged, namely:  in the case of purchased funds that can be accessed from a tax pooling intermediary, these are limited to the amount of tax outstanding, and do not include any interest outstanding; and  payments of tax are first applied to interest and then any remainder is applied to the tax outstanding. This results in a shortfall in tax that then attracts interest until further payments are made. The following example illustrates this situation. Example A provisional taxpayer's tax liability for the 2010–11 tax year has been reassessed, resulting in an increased liability of $9,000. For use-of-money interest purposes this amount was due in three equal instalments of $3,000 on 28 August 2010, 15 January 2011 and 7 May 2011. The taxpayer applies to a tax pooling intermediary to purchase backdated funds, but funds are only available on 7 April 2013. The taxpayer is therefore subject to use-of-money interest (of say $1,000) for the period 29 August 2010 to 7 April 2013. The legislation restricts the amount of purchased funds that can be accessed by a taxpayer from a tax pooling intermediary to the tax of $9,000. However, once this amount is transferred to Inland Revenue to pay the taxpayer's outstanding tax as at 7 April 2013, the legislation requires the amount to be first applied to the payment of interest ($1,000), and the remaining $8,000 is applied to tax. This leaves a shortfall of $1,000 in tax, which would continue to attract interest from 8 April 2013 until the $1,000 tax and all further accrued interest is paid in full. The proposed amendment will enable the taxpayer in the above example to purchase both the tax of $9,000 and use-of-money interest of $1,000 on 7 April 2013 and thereby fully pay the tax and interest owing as at that date. 78 MIXED-USE ASSETS (Clauses 89 to 95) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes several remedial changes to the mixed-use asset rules in subpart DG of the Income Tax Act 2007. Application date The amendments apply for the 2013–14 and later income years for land and improvements, and the 2014–15 and later income years for aircraft and boats. Key features The amendments:  clarify the basis for interest apportionment for close companies that have excessive debt;  ensure that the share of interest expenditure of a close company related to the capital use of an asset is allowed as a deduction; and  clarify that the use of a mixed-use asset by an associated-person employee in the course of their employment is not private use. Background The mixed-use asset rules were introduced as new subpart DG and related provisions by the Taxation (Livestock Valuation, Assets Expenditure, and Remedial Matters) Act 2013. The rules generally apply from the 2013–14 income year to prevent excessive deductions for assets that have a significant element of private use, as well as income-earning use, and periods of non-use. An example of such mixed-use is a bach that is used privately and rented out to third parties, but remains empty for most of the year. Detailed analysis Interest expenditure of a close company Under section DG 11(3), if a company’s debt is equal to or less than the value of its mixed- use asset, it is assumed that the debt relates solely to the mixed-use asset and all interest is apportioned under the formula in section DG 9(2). 79 Conversely, under section DG 11(4), if the company’s debt is more than the value of the mixed-use asset, the debt is first allocated to the mixed-use asset and then the balance is assumed to relate to other assets held by the company. Only interest expenditure arising from the debt allocated to the mixed-use asset is subject to the apportionment formula in section DG 9(2) (see section DG 11(6)). The interest expenditure related to the balance of the debt should be deductible under normal principles, which for a company, usually means it is fully deductible under section DB 7. This policy intention is not clearly achieved by the current rules as there is some ambiguity regarding the treatment of the balance of the debt and associated interest expense. Accordingly, the remedial amendment clarifies that this balance is dealt with under the general interest deductibility rules for companies. Interest expenditure of a close company related to capital use of an asset The primary expenditure apportionment formula is contained in section DG 9(2). This formula was amended by the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 to deal with situations when there is capital use of an asset (such as use of an airplane to travel to assess potential capital acquisitions), as well as income-earning use and private use. The amendment ensured that an appropriate proportion of mixed-use expenditure was denied when it related to capital and private use of an asset, but allowed when it related to income-earning use. A related amendment is needed in the apportionment rule for interest expenditure incurred by a close company – contained in section DG 11(3). In contrast to the recent amendments, the rules relating to deductibility of interest will be amended to ensure that a proportionate share of interest expenditure of a close company related to capital use of an asset is allowed as a deduction. This is necessary to ensure that, except in relation to private use of the asset, the mixed-use asset interest deduction rule for companies aligns with the general interest deductibility rule for companies. This means all interest for a company is automatically deductible and, unlike other expenditure, there is no denial of deductions when the expenditure relates to a matter of capital. This will ensure a company that owns a mixed-use asset is no worse-off than a company that does not own a mixed-use asset in relation to deductions for interest that relate to capital matters. The mixed-use asset-owning company will still be denied interest deductions for private use of that asset, which was the purpose of the mixed-use asset reforms. For example, assume an airplane owned by a close company is:  used 30 days for income-earning purposes;  used 30 days for private purposes;  used 30 days for capital purposes; and  not in use for 275 days. 80 There is $1,000 of insurance, $1,000 of hangar fees and $1,000 interest expense that should be apportioned under the mixed-use asset rules. The hangar fees and insurance should be apportioned allowing deductions for income- earning days only. The formula in section DG 9(2) achieves this as follows: $2,000 expenditure × 30 income-earning days (30 income-earning days + 60 counted days) = $667 In contrast, for a close company the interest expense should be apportioned allowing deductions for income earning days and capital days. The formula in section DG 9(2) currently does not achieve this outcome – under the current rules the outcome would be as follows: $1,000 expenditure × 30 income-earning days (30 income-earning days + 60 counted days) = $333 To address this issue, the proposed new formula in section DG 11 will apportion the interest expense of a close company as follows: $1,000 expenditure × 30 income-earning days + 30 capital-use days (30 income-earning days + 60 counted days) = $667 We note that if the airplane was held by an individual or trust (or any entity other than a company), the standard apportionment formula would apply and there would be no deductions for capital-use days. Use of an asset by an associated person employee Currently, if an associate of the asset owner (for example, a 25 percent shareholder in the asset-owning company) uses the asset in the course of their employment, this will be deemed to be private use even though it relates to an income-earning use of the asset. Treating this use as private use results in more deductions being denied than was intended. It could also mean that certain assets are subject to the mixed-use asset rules when they should not be (for example, because there is minimal or no true private use). 81 An example of this is a company (“Asset Co”) owning an aircraft that is used in Asset Co’s business. Asset Co’s two individual shareholders are also employees of Asset Co. When the aircraft is used in the business, this use requires the shareholder-employees to travel on the aircraft to various work destinations. Even though this use is entirely for business purposes (and for the shareholder-employees, for the purpose of deriving their employment income), the mixed-use asset rules currently treat this as private use. This may lead to the asset being subject to the mixed-use asset rules when it would not have been otherwise. It may also lead to an inappropriately high proportion of expenditure of Asset Co being denied as a deduction. There is currently an exclusion from the definition of “private use” for assets used solely in the ordinary course of a taxpayer’s business (section DG 4(3)); this does not, however, extend to employees. Accordingly, the bill proposes that the current exclusion be extended to cover all situations when the asset is being used to derive assessable income of the natural person using the asset, including fees earned as a contractor, and employment income. The bill also makes an associated minor clarifying amendment to the description of the “person” who has private use of an asset in section DG 4(2)(b). Section DG 4(2) currently states that “the person referred to in subsection 1(a) is a natural person who is: (a) the person who owns, leases, licences, or otherwise has the asset; or (b) a person associated with them.” \[emphasis added\] The use of the term “them” in paragraph (b), seems to refer to the person referred to in paragraph (a) that is, a natural person who owns, leases, licences or otherwise has the asset. If the asset is owned, leased, licensed, or otherwise held by a non-natural person (for example, a company) it is arguable that use of that asset by a natural person associated with the non-natural person owner, lessee, licensee or holder of the asset will not be caught by paragraph (b), when it is intended it should be. The amendment clarifies that use of an asset by a natural person associated with the non- natural person (for example, company or trust) owner of the asset is considered to be private use. 82 PROPERTY TRANSFER RULES (Clauses 149 to 152, 213(53), (54) and (62)) Summary of proposed amendments Subparts FB and FC of the Income Tax Act 2007 specify the tax treatment of property transfers in certain circumstances, including: transfer under a settlement of relationship property, transfer upon death, transfer by a trustee of a trust to a beneficiary, and the making of a gift. A number of areas have been identified where the rules in subparts FB and FC do not clearly achieve the intended policy and may have unintended consequences. The proposed remedial amendments address these areas; all of these proposed amendments are consistent with the policy intent of the property transfer rules. Application date The amendments apply from 1 April 2008, the date that the Income Tax Act 2007 came into force. Key features The amendments propose the following changes:  In the case of distributions of property from a trustee of a trust to a beneficiary of the trust, section FC 2(1) will only apply to deem the transfer to occur at market value if another provision in the Income Tax Act 2007 does not already provide a value for the property.  Subpart FB will contain a default rule for the treatment of property transfers under a settlement of relationship property when none of the specific provisions in sections FB 2 to FB 21 apply. Currently, there is no clear provision in subpart FB that applies to certain types of property – for example, attributing foreign investment fund (FIF) interests – and accordingly, there is scope for uncertainty about the outcome of certain transfers.  Other clarifying amendments to remove uncertainty – the headings of sections FB 1 and FC 1 will be changed to reflect their operative nature (the headings are currently those of purpose provisions), the definition of “settlement of relationship property” has been clarified; an incomplete section cross-reference in section FC 4(1)(b) will be corrected and cross-references to relevant sections in subpart FB will be included in applicable sections in subpart FC to assist readers. 83 Background The Income Tax Act 2007 intends to accord concessionary treatment to certain types of property transfers, such as a transfer under a settlement of relationship property or a transfer upon death to a close relative or spouse in certain circumstances (see subpart FB and section FC 3). Broadly speaking, this concessionary treatment involves deferring any tax consequences of transfer until the transferee ultimately disposes of the property. This is often referred to as “rollover relief”. It generally involves two steps:  deeming the transferor to have no tax consequences on disposal; and  deeming the transferee to acquire not only the property, but all the characteristics of the transferor with respect to that property – for example, the date of acquisition, cost at acquisition and intention of acquisition. This treatment contrasts with the general treatment under subpart FC which crystallises tax consequences on transfer between parties not accorded the concessionary treatment. Section FC 2 achieves this by deeming the transfer to be a disposal by the transferor and acquisition by the transferee at market value. Subpart FC was introduced as a generic set of rules to clarify the income tax treatment of “in kind” or “in specie” distributions and gifts – in particular, but not limited to, upon death. A number of areas have been identified where the rules in subparts FB and FC do not clearly achieve the policy intent and may have unintended consequences. The proposed remedial amendments described below deal with these problems. Detailed analysis Transfer by a trustee of a trust where another provision provides an appropriate transfer value Under sections FC 1(1)(c) and FC 2(1), a distribution of property from a trustee to a beneficiary of the trust will be deemed to be a disposal and acquisition at market value. In some circumstances this is an inappropriate outcome. For example, an investor purchases shares for $2,000 and settles those shares on a fixed trust. The shares are distributed to the investor two years later, at which time they are worth $3,000. The cost base of the shares under sections FC 1(1)(c) and FC 2(1) would be $3,000, rather than the $2,000 the investor actually paid for the shares. This means that if the shares are held on revenue account, upon sale of those shares, the investor will be taxable on the difference between the sale price and the higher cost base. So for example, if the shares further increased in value to $4,000 and the investor sold them, they would, under current law, be subject to tax on $1,000 ($4,000 sale proceeds – $3,000 new cost base) but should be subject to tax on $2,000 ($4,000 sale proceeds – $2,000 original cost base). The reverse is also possible. If the value of the shares falls to $1,000, the shares are distributed (thus setting a $1,000 cost base) and are subsequently sold for $1,250, the investor will derive $250 of assessable income even though they have made a $750 economic loss. 84 The cost base in these circumstances should be the amount the investor paid for the shares, not the market value of the shares on the date of distribution, as this more correctly reflects the economic cost of acquiring the shares. Further, if the current law was correct, there would be a difference in tax treatment between acquiring shares under a structure that involves the shares being held in trust for a period of time – for example, as part of a security arrangement – and acquiring them directly, but with restrictive covenants attached which restrict dealing in the shares for the same period as under the trust arrangement. These arrangements are economically substitutable, yet currently have different tax treatments, which is undesirable. Accordingly, the proposed amendment will ensure section FC 1(1)(c) will apply unless the tax treatment is determined under another provision. In the example above, the cost of revenue account property provision (section DB 23) would provide an appropriate cost base for the shares. This is consistent with the intent of subpart FC, which was to provide a cost base for certain transfers when there was no clear cost base provided by the Act. Clarifying the treatment of certain types of property not covered specifically by sections FB 2 – FB 21 There is currently uncertainty over the tax treatment of transfers of certain types of property (for example, attributing FIF interests) on a person’s death in circumstances when the transfer qualifies for concessionary rollover relief. This is because the relevant provisions in subpart FC (for example, section FC 3(2)) refer to subpart FB to determine the treatment of the transfer – that is, subpart FC feeds into the existing provisions in subpart FB in certain cases. Because subpart FB deals with specific types of property in each section, 5 without a clear catch-all provision, some types of property covered by subpart FC (such as an attributing interests in a FIF) do not have a clear corresponding provision in subpart FB. While the policy intent of the legislation is clear, the provisions do not currently achieve that intent. While it is arguable that section FB 1(2) could be seen as a default provision for property not otherwise covered by a specific provision, there are a number of issues with this provision. First, it is currently structured as a purpose, rather than an operative, provision (see the discussion of other changes below). Secondly, it currently only specifies the tax consequences of the transfer for the transferee and is silent on the position of the transferor (even though the section FB 1(2) heading purports to cover both positions). Thirdly, it states that the tax consequences for the transferee on a settlement of relationship property are the same as if the transferor had continued to hold the property. Read literally, this would mean that when the transferee disposes of the property, there are no tax consequences for them because the transferor is deemed to still hold the property. This is contrary to the policy intent of the rollover relief intended to be provided by subpart FB. These issues make it undesirable to rely on section FB 1(2), as currently drafted, as a default provision. Accordingly, the amendments re-write section FB 1(2) as an operative default rollover relief provision (now contained in section FB 1C) to deal with property that does not have a corresponding specific provision in sections FB 2 to FB 21. The default provision ensures:  the transferor has no tax consequences on disposal; and 5 Sections FB 2 to FB 21 of the Income Tax Act 2007. 85  the transferee acquires not only the property, but all the characteristics of the transferor with respect to that property – for example, date of acquisition, cost at acquisition, and intention of acquisition. Other clarifying changes The current headings of sections FB 1 and FC 1 (“What this subpart does”) are headings more appropriate for general purpose provisions, rather than operative provisions. Accordingly, they will be changed to reflect the operative nature of the provisions. The definition of “settlement of relationship property” (currently in section FB 1(3) and to be included in new section FB 1B) has been amended to remove a potentially circular reference to a relationship agreement that creates a disposal and acquisition of property “under this subpart”. The reference to a transaction “between parties” to a relationship agreement has also been removed in case the transfer of property occurs between one of the parties to the agreement and a third party (say, a family trust). An incomplete section cross-reference in section FC 4(1)(b) will be corrected. The policy underlying section FC 4 is to accord rollover relief to property transferred on a person’s death to a beneficiary who is a close relative or a charity. However, the wording refers to “a person exempt under section CW 43”. The problem is that charities are not generally exempt under section CW 43. Instead, the section exempts the income of a deceased person’s executor or administrator when it relates to a charitable bequest. It is sections CW 41 and CW 42 that exempt income derived by tax charities. Accordingly, the reference in section FC 4(1) to section CW 43 will be extended to persons “exempt under sections CW 41, CW 42 or CW 43”. To help readers find the correct corresponding provision in subpart FB, cross-references to the relevant sections will be included in applicable sections in subpart FC (for example, a cross-reference in section FC 6 “Forestry assets transferred to close relatives” will cross- refer to sections FB 6 and FB 7). 86 FOREIGN INVESTMENT PIES: ACCESS TO LOWER TREATY RATE (Clause 215) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the treatment of unimputed dividends derived from New Zealand-resident companies that are attributed to non-resident investors in a foreign investment variable-rate portfolio investment entity (PIE). This will ensure they are subject to the same rate of tax as if the shares were held directly by the non-resident. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2012–13 and later income years to align with the application date of the foreign investment PIE rules. A “savings” provision will apply for taxpayers who filed returns based on the current wording of table 1B in schedule 6 up until the date of introduction of the bill. Key features The amendment restricts access to the lower 15% rate to investors in foreign investment PIEs who reside in a country that has a DTA with New Zealand that reduces the dividend NRWT rate. This is achieved by amending the relevant rows in table 1B in schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 2007. The amendment is consistent with the policy intent of the foreign investment PIE rules. Background A non-resident investor in a foreign investment variable-rate PIE is subject to a 30% tax rate on all unimputed New Zealand dividends if they do not reside in a country that has a double tax agreement (DTA) with New Zealand. This rate is reduced to 15% if the investor resides in a country that has a DTA with New Zealand. These rates were chosen so that a non-resident investor owning New Zealand shares through a foreign investment variable-rate PIE would be subject to the same amount of tax as if they owned the shares directly and were subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on the dividends. The non-DTA rate of NRWT on unimputed dividends is 30%; this rate is normally reduced to 15% under a double tax agreement (for portfolio dividends). New Zealand has DTAs with certain countries which do not reduce the rate of tax on dividends – for example, those that only facilitate the exchange of information. When an investor from one of these countries holds New Zealand-resident company shares directly any unimputed dividends received will be subject to a NRWT rate of 30%. 87 INCOME STATEMENTS AND INCOME TAX FILING EXEMPTIONS (Clauses 231 and 225 to 226) Summary of proposed amendments The bill introduces a number of amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 relating to when the Commissioner is required to issue an income statement and when an individual is required to file an income tax return. Application dates The amendment to income statements for IR 56 taxpayers and the amendment to the schedular payment filing exemption will apply on 1 April 2014. The amendments for an employee’s obligations and other section 33AA amendments will have the same application date as the current section 33AA, which is scheduled to come into force on 1 April 2016. Key features Income statements for IR 56 taxpayers The Taxation (Annual Rates, GST, Trans-Tasman Imputation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2003 removed the requirement for most IR 56 taxpayers to file end-of-year income tax returns. 6 Instead the Commissioner was required to issue an income statement to IR 56 taxpayers. The drafting of this provision did not, however, make it clear that it was only intended to apply to IR 56 taxpayers, leaving open the possibility that income statements could be required to be issued to many other taxpayers, including those who would not otherwise have to file an income tax return. An amendment in this bill clarifies the application of the relevant provision. Schedular payment filing exemption The bill aligns the legislation with the current practice that an individual, who is not otherwise required to file an income tax return, will only have to do so when they derive more than $200 of schedular payments, irrespective of their total income. This replaces the current requirement that an individual, who is not otherwise required to file an income tax return, will have to do so if their total income is more than $200 and they derive any amount of schedular payments. 6 These taxpayers include private domestic workers, staff of foreign consulates and embassies, New Zealand- based representatives of foreign companies and Operation Deep Freeze personnel. 88 Employee’s obligations Section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 – which sets out when an individual is not required to file an income tax return – is scheduled to be replaced by section 33AA with effect from 1 April 2016. One provision within section 33A requires an individual to file a return if the employee’s obligations are not met. The equivalent provision in section 33AA requires an individual to file a return if the employer’s or PAYE intermediary’s obligations are not met. An employer has additional obligations to those of an employee, such as having to pay to Inland Revenue tax that has been withheld. To maintain current policy settings this bill includes an amendment so that section 33AA will refer to the employee’s (rather than employer’s) obligations not being met. Exceptions to requirement for return of income An individual is required to consider whether their income falls within the criteria in section 33AA(1) to (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to determine whether they are required to file an income tax return. The bill includes amendments to these three subsections which will simplify their interpretation without changing their application. 89 GST RATIO METHOD FOR CALCULATING PROVISIONAL TAX (Clauses 200 and 201) Summary of proposed amendments An amendment clarifies that a person must stop using the GST ratio method to determine the amount of provisional tax payable for a tax year, if:  the person files a return of income during that tax year; and  the residual income tax (RIT) calculated in that return of income means the taxpayer no longer meets the requirements of section RC 16(2) and (5) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The person must cease using the GST ratio method from the date on which the return of income is filed. The taxpayer must then apply either the estimation method or a standard method for calculating their provisional tax. The method used depends on whether the return of income was filed before or after the due date for Instalment A of provisional tax. Application date The amendments apply from the beginning of the 2016–17 income year. Background A taxpayer may choose to use the GST ratio method to calculate provisional tax payable for a tax year if all of the following requirements in section RC 16 are satisfied:  RIT for the preceding year from which the GST ratio is calculated must be within the range of $2,501 to $150,000 for the year;  they must be GST-registered for the entire prior year; and  their ratio of RIT to total taxable supplies for the prior year (GST ratio) must not exceed 100 percent or be less than 0 percent. The GST ratio is applied to taxable supplies (turnover) in each GST period to determine the provisional tax payable. Once a year has started, if a taxpayer does not satisfy the above requirements, the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax is not intended to continue to be available to the taxpayer. At present, the legislation does not clearly address this issue if RIT calculated in a return of income for an earlier tax year and filed during the current tax year means that the above requirements are not satisfied. Detailed analysis The residual income tax calculated in an income tax return filed for an earlier tax year may result in either the RIT or GST ratio falling outside the required thresholds to use the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax. This is illustrated in the following example. 90 Example For provisional tax payments for the 2014–15 tax year, a taxpayer having an extension-of-time arrangement for filing the income tax return for the 2013–14 year, might not file the return until 31 March 2015. For due dates for payment of provisional tax falling before this return is filed, the taxpayer would not know the RIT and annual turnover figures from the 2013–14 tax year. The taxpayer is then permitted to use the RIT and annual turnover data from the 2012–13 year to calculate provisional tax due for the 2014–15 tax year. After filing the 2013–14 annual return of income, if the RIT for the 2013–14 tax year exceeds the $150,000 threshold, the taxpayer becomes ineligible to use the GST ratio method for the 2014–15 year. In this case, the proposed amendment clarifies that the taxpayer must cease to use the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax. Instead, they must use either:  the standard or estimation method of determining provisional tax, if the return is filed before the due date for Instalment A of provisional tax for the tax year. In this case, the taxpayer is also treated as never having elected to apply the GST ratio method for the tax year; or  the estimation method, if the return is filed after Instalment A of provisional tax for the tax year. Some minor consequential amendments are also proposed to clarify that:  the date the taxpayer is treated as ceasing to use the GST ratio method is the date on which the relevant return of income is filed; and  if the taxpayer is a borrower under the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, the requirement to cease using the GST ratio method for calculating provisional tax does not change the due dates for student loan repayments. 91 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS OF EMPLOYERS IN THE AGRICULTURE, HORTICULTURE AND VITICULTURE INDUSTRIES (Clause 224) Summary of proposed amendment The bill repeals section 24O of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that obligates employers in the agricultural, horticultural or viticultural industries to provide Inland Revenue with information about employees covered by an exemption certificate or special tax rate certificate. These requirements would have imposed unreasonable costs on employers and Inland Revenue while not being effective at identifying non-compliant employees. Accordingly, the provision has not been enforced and instead employers can check the validity of an employee’s certificate directly with Inland Revenue. Application date The amendment applies for the 2008–09 and later income years to align with the original introduction of this provision. 92 REPEAL OF REDUNDANT COST OF TIMBER PROVISION (Clause 237) Summary of proposed amendment The bill repeals section 92AAA of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which requires the Commissioner to issue a determination on the cost of timber incurred. This provision was introduced when the cost of timber was recorded in a separate account and carried forward to be offset against future forestry income. The cost of timber is now deductible in the year incurred without the need for the Commissioner to issue a determination, rendering section 92AAA redundant. Application date The amendment will apply for the 2015–16 and later income years. 93 NON-MONETARY CONSIDERATION IN THE CONTEXT OF SALES (Clauses 102 and 219) Summary of proposed amendments The bill amends a number of references to “sale” and similar terms in the Income Tax Act 2007 to ensure that transfers or supplies in exchange for non-monetary consideration are covered by the relevant provisions. These amendments address concerns that references to “sale” and similar terms may require an exchange of money and may therefore exclude transactions involving an exchange for non-monetary consideration such as a disposal of shares in exchange for a financial arrangement. The terms that have been amended include “sale”, “buy”, “purchase” and variations of these terms. Application date The amendments will apply for the 2015–16 and later income years. 94 FINANCIAL MARKETS (REPEALS AND AMENDMENTS) ACT 2013 – RELATED CHANGES (Clauses 213(55) and 266) Summary of proposed amendments The bill makes several amendments relating to the Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Approved unit trusts The Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013 amended the definition of an “approved unit trust” in the Finance Act (No 2) 1990 to refer to the definition of a unit trust in the Income Tax Act 2007 rather than the Unit Trusts Act 1960, which is to be repealed. A further amendment is proposed so that the definition in the Finance Act (No 2) 1990 excludes paragraph b(x) of the unit trust definition in the Income Tax Act 2007. Paragraph b(x) excludes an approved unit trust from being a unit trust so this amendment is necessary to allow an approved unit trust to meet the Finance Act (No 2) 1990 definition. Public unit trusts The Financial Markets (Repeals and Amendments) Act 2013 amended the definition of a “public unit trust” in the Income Tax Act 2007 to refer to regulated offers made under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 rather than securities offered to the public under the Securities Act 1978, which is to be repealed. A regulated offer under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 is not a direct equivalent to an offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978; as a result, this amendment altered the scope of what could qualify as a public unit trust. A further amendment to the definition of a public unit trust in the Income Tax Act 2007 is proposed, to remove the requirement that regulated offers are made under the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 (there being no equivalent concept of offers to the public in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013). Paragraph (a) of the public unit trust definition will now require 100 or more unit holders, treating all associated persons as one person, who meet the current requirements in subparagraphs (i) to (iii). Paragraph (b)(vi) and (vii) will have their thresholds reduced from 25 percent to 5 percent to ensure public unit trusts qualifying under these provisions are sufficiently widely held. 95 THIN CAPITALISATION (Clauses 153 to 156 and 158) Summary of proposed amendment The changes to the thin capitalisation rules in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 included a provision to deem the worldwide group of a New Zealand company to be the same as its New Zealand group in certain situations. These are when the company is subject to the thin capitalisation rules only because it:  is controlled by a non-resident owning body; or  is controlled by a trustee that is subject to the thin capitalisation rules. This section does not operate as intended in every situation. Accordingly the bill proposes a re-drafting of the provision to ensure it operates as described above. The bill also corrects minor errors such as cross-references in their clauses. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2015–16 income year, the application date of the thin capitalisation changes introduced in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Employee Allowances, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014. 96 RESPONSE PERIOD FOLLOWING DISPUTES RESOLUTION PROCESS DOCUMENT (Clauses 234 and 235) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments will clarify that the Commissioner’s response period when a taxpayer is late in issuing a disputes document starts from the time when it is decided that “exceptional circumstances” exist and the taxpayer’s late dispute document is to be allowed. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Amendments to section 89AB of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will clarify that the Commissioner’s response period when a taxpayer is late in issuing a disputes document starts from the time when it is decided that “exceptional circumstances” exist and the taxpayer’s late document is to be allowed. If the response period applied while a decision was being reached, the Commissioner would be required to issue a substantive response to a dispute that may not have a procedural basis. Background Certain documents that form part of tax disputes procedures are subject to mandatory response periods. A breach of a response period can see a disputant forfeit their right to begin or continue with a dispute. If exceptional circumstances are found to exist, however, a notice issued by the taxpayer that is late will be treated as if it had been given within the required response period. The decision about whether there are “exceptional circumstances” is at the discretion of the Commissioner. A taxpayer may challenge the Commissioner’s refusal notice by filing proceedings with the Taxation Review Authority within two months of the notice being issued. The proposed change clarifies uncertainty in the current law, where it could be argued that if a taxpayer issues an initiating document late, the Commissioner may be required to file a response document prior to the establishment of any exceptional circumstances that would allow the dispute to continue. 97 COMMISSIONER’S ABILITY TO TRUNCATE THE DISPUTES PROCESS UNDER A TAXPAYER-INITIATED DISPUTE (Clauses 236 and 241) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments ensure that truncation is allowed in a taxpayer-initiated dispute after the taxpayer has issued a Statement of Position without requiring the Commissioner to first issue a Statement of Position. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features An amendment to section 89M(6BA) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will ensure that after the taxpayer has issued a Statement of Position the Commissioner and the taxpayer can agree in accordance with section 89N(1)(c)(viii) to submit the dispute to the court or Taxation Review Authority without requiring the Commissioner to issue a Statement of Position. The change is only relevant for taxpayer-initiated disputes. An amendment to section 138G will mean that if a taxpayer-initiated dispute proceeds in this way, the taxpayer will be bound by the exclusion rule and the Commissioner will not. This avoids the Commissioner not being able to raise any issues in the challenge and ensures the Commissioner can rely on information that would otherwise have been included in her Statement of Position. Background In a taxpayer-initiated dispute, the completion of the disputes procedures is either by the Commissioner agreeing to make any amended assessment or by issuing a challenge notice at which point the disputant is able to file challenge proceedings in the High Court or Taxation Review Authority. Section 89P(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner cannot issue a challenge notice without Statements of Position being exchanged. An exception to this rule is when the Commissioner and taxpayer agree in writing not to follow the full disputes procedures and go directly to court. However, section 89M(6BA) states that the Commissioner is required to issue a Statement of Position when the taxpayer has issued a Statement of Position. The combination of these provisions means that, under the current law, the Commissioner must issue a Statement of Position in response to a taxpayer’s Statement of Position even though both parties agree that the dispute should proceed to the challenge phase. This has the potential to delay a dispute unnecessarily and also impose unnecessary administration costs. 98 PETROLEUM MINING RULES (Clauses 97, 98, 100, 101, 213(49), (50), (72) and (73)) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to the definitions of “mining permit”, “petroleum exploration expenditure” and “existing privilege”:  correct unintended legislative changes made in rewriting those definitions into the Income Tax Act 2007; and  implement a “savings” provision for taxpayers to protect tax positions taken in relation to the definition of petroleum exploration expenditure on arrangements entered into before the introduction of the bill. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that the petroleum mining rules contain unintended legislative changes in the definitions of “mining permit” and “petroleum exploration expenditure”. The submitter noted that the use of the term “existing privilege” was potentially ambiguous as it refers to both mineral mining and petroleum mining privileges issued under the 1937 Act. The change identified is that these definitions inadvertently do not refer to petroleum mining privileges issued under the Petroleum Act 1937 (1937 Act). The policy intention is that the tax treatment for costs relating to mining privileges issued under the 1937 Act is intended to be determined under the petroleum mining rules. The bill amends the definitions of “mining permit” and “petroleum exploration expenditure” to clarify that they include petroleum mining privileges issued under the 1937 Act. The use of the definition of “existing privilege” is clarified in the bill to distinguish more clearly when it refers to petroleum privileges issued under the 1937 Act. The “savings” provisions protect a taxpayer’s tax position taken in relation to an arrangement for the acquisition of a petroleum mining asset that was entered into before the introduction of the bill. 99 TREATMENT OF EXPENDITURE FOR COMMERCIAL FIT-OUT (Clauses 82 and 83) Summary of proposed amendment A specific rule relating to expenditure on items of commercial fit-out (section DA 5) is proposed to be removed from a subpart intended for general provisions relating to deductions and re-enacted in a more appropriate place (section DB 22B). No change in effect of the provision is intended. Application date The amendment applies from the beginning of the 2011–12 income year. Background Section DA 5 is concerned with how the capital limitation rule applies to certain expenditure incurred on commercial fit-out. In particular, it is intended to ensure that:  capital expenditure incurred for commercial fit-out is not immediately deductible as repairs and maintenance on the building; and  the replacement or improvement of a previously separately depreciated item of commercial fit-out is capitalised and depreciated over its estimated useful life. The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that section DA 5 is inconsistent with the scheme and purpose of subpart DA, which:  contains the general permission; and  sets out principles and rules for understanding the relationship of the general permission with specific deduction provisions in Part D. The Rewrite Advisory Panel noted that the risks of retaining the current section DA 5 in subpart DA are the potential for:  misunderstanding and misinterpretation of the scheme and purpose for subpart DA; and  section DA 5 to be cited as an example/precedent in support of placing other targeted provisions in subpart DA. 100 ELECTION TO BE A COMPLYING TRUST (Clauses 167 and 170) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to sections HC 10 and HC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (election to be a complying trust):  correct an unintended legislative change made in relation to an election to be a complying trust; and  allow a trust to continue to be treated as a complying trust after the settlor migrates from New Zealand if, since that time, the trustee has continued to comply fully with New Zealand income tax obligations. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Key features Rewrite matter The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that the rules relating to the election for a trust to be a complying trust (sections HC 10 and HC 33 of the Income Tax Act 2007):  are partially ineffective and this is caused by an unintended legislative change; and  do not reflect the policy intention. A complying trust is a trust for which the trustees:  are liable for tax at the trustee rate on all their world-wide trustee income; and  have always met their income tax compliance obligations. A foreign trust is a trust which does not have a settlor resident in New Zealand at all times since the trust was formed, but is not a complying trust because the trustee either:  is not liable for tax at the trustee rate on foreign-sourced income; or  derives non-resident passive income that is not subject to full rates of tax in New Zealand. It is intended that a foreign trust may be treated as a complying trust if:  a settlor, trustee or beneficiary of the trust elects for the trust to pay tax at the trustee rate on its world-wide trustee income; and  the trustees continue to meet their income tax compliance obligations. 101 However, due to the unintended legislative change, a foreign trust is restricted to choosing to satisfy the income tax liability for taxable income of the trust. The taxable income of a foreign trust does not normally include foreign-sourced income. This unintended legislative change could prevent the trust from meeting the requirements to be a complying trust. The amendment ensures that the election to be a complying trust relates to paying tax at the trustee rate on the world-wide trustee income of the trust. Remedial matter The amendments also address a minor remedial matter, mainly relating to situations that have arisen for trustee companies, such as the Public Trust. These trustees act for many trusts and are not always made aware when a settlor's residence changes. If the trustee is not aware when a settlor migrates from New Zealand, the trustee may:  continue to treat the trust as a complying trust, calculating and paying tax at the trustee rate on the world-wide trustee income of the trustee; and  indicate in the annual return of income that the trust is a complying trust. The amendment clarifies that if a settlor of a complying trust migrates from New Zealand, the trust will continue to be treated as a complying trust if:  the trustee continues to pay New Zealand tax at the trustee rate on the world-wide trustee income of the trust; and  the trustee indicates in the annual return of income the intention for the trust to be a complying trust. 102 BAD DEBT DEDUCTION AND CAPITAL LIMITATION (Clauses 84(4), (7) and 257) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment to section DB 31(6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2007 (and section DB 23 (6)(b)(iii) of the Income Tax Act 2004) clarifies that the capital limitation does not prevent a deduction for a bad debt of the principal amount of a financial arrangement entered into in the normal course of business. This amendment does not alter the current treatment of debts owed by associated persons. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year (2007 Act) and the 2005–06 income year (2004 Act). Key features The Rewrite Advisory Panel has agreed with a submission that there is an unintended legislative change in the bad debt deduction rule relating to taxpayers carrying on a business of holding or dealing in financial arrangements (business holder or dealer). The Panel recommended that the unintended legislative change to the bad debt deduction rule should be corrected retrospectively to the beginning of the 2005–06 income year (the first year to which the 2004 Act applied). The retrospective remedial amendment addresses the potential adverse consequence identified by the Panel that the bad debt rule in section DB 31 may deny a deduction to a business holder or dealer for the principal amount of a financial arrangement. An example of this possible adverse consequence is for a holder of securitised financial arrangements, if those securitised assets are entered into in the normal course of business. The policy intent for the bad debt deduction rule for a business holder or dealer is to allow a bad debt deduction to a business holder or dealer for both accrued interest and the principal amount of a debt entered into in the ordinary course of business. This policy stems from the 1987 recommendations of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure (the Brash Committee) 7 to maintain the common law position in relation to bad debt deductions, except for bad debts entered into between associated persons. 7 Report of the Consultative Committee on Accrual Tax Treatment of Income and Expenditure, April 1987, paras 32-41, comment on drafting para 2.632-41, comment on drafting para 2.6. 103 Under the common law, 8 a bad debt suffered by a business holder or dealer which related to a financial arrangement entered into in the ordinary course of business was considered to be on revenue account. In this circumstance, the common law held that a bad debt deduction was allowed for a loss of principal and accrued interest, provided some procedural requirements were satisfied. The common law also considered that a debt entered into outside the normal or ordinary course of business would be usually treated as a non-deductible capital loss as a result of applying the capital/revenue tests. The bad debt deduction rule has always been intended to replicate this common law effect for business holders and dealers. The Brash Committee also considered that the common law treatment for bad debts should not apply to debts between associated persons. The policy concern identified was that the common law treatment of bad debts could allow associated persons to convert truly capital losses into revenue deductions simply by substituting what would ordinarily be equity capital for a debt instrument. Current legislation ensures that the principal amount of a debt between associated persons is not deductible as a bad debt. The amendment does not change that outcome. 8 Summarised in Levin and Co., Ltd. v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1963\] NZLR 801. 104 TRANSFER OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS ON AMALGAMATION (Clause 160) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will ensure that when two companies amalgamate, the income or expenditure arising in the year of amalgamation under a financial arrangement held by the amalgamating company (the company that ceases to exist) is allocated on a fair and reasonable basis between the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company (the company that continues to exist). Application date The proposed amendment will apply to amalgamations occurring in the 2008–09 and later income years. There will be a “savings” provision for tax positions taken by taxpayers in these income years based on the current legislative wording. Key features When two companies amalgamate, and as a result, a financial arrangement is transferred by the amalgamating company to the amalgamated company, in most cases the amalgamating company must perform a base price adjustment (BPA). In calculating the BPA, the amalgamation rules intend to ensure that the amalgamating company is allowed a deduction for expenses incurred (or returns any income derived) up until the date of the amalgamation. Any amounts incurred or derived after this point should be incurred/derived by the amalgamated company. This ensures that the rules give the correct amount of expenditure or income over the remaining life of the financial arrangement. The current wording of section FO 13(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 does not achieve this result. This is because section FO 13(2) provides the incorrect amount of “consideration” to be included in the BPA formula. The BPA formula (found in section EW 31) is: BPA = consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted Section FO 13(2) states: The amalgamating company is treated as having disposed of the financial arrangement. In calculating the base price adjustment, the consideration \[emphasis added\] is the amount that would fairly and reasonably represent the income or expenditure that the amalgamating company would have derived or would have incurred in the income year if the amalgamation had not taken place. 105 Before 1999 (section FE 7(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and section 191 WD(17)(b) and (18)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976), the provision read: The consideration for which the succession has taken place shall be deemed to be equal to such amount as will result in the base price adjustment \[emphasis added\] in relation to the amalgamating company calculated in respect of the succession under section EH 4 being such amount (whether negative, positive, or a nil amount) as will result effectively in a fair and reasonable allocation, having regard to the tenor of section EH 1, between the amalgamating company and the amalgamated company, of the expenditure or gross income which would have been deemed to be incurred or derived by the amalgamating company in respect of the financial arrangement in the income year in which the amalgamation takes place had the amalgamation not taken place. The difference between the sections is that the pre-1999 legislation deemed the result of the BPA to be a fair and reasonable allocation of income and expenditure between the amalgamating and amalgamated companies. The post-1999 provision deems the consideration component in the BPA formula to be a fair and reasonable allocation of income and expenditure between the amalgamating and amalgamated companies. As demonstrated by the example below, the latter approach gives the incorrect result and will sometimes result in too much income being derived and sometimes result in excessive deductions. The proposed amendment restores section FO 13(2) to the pre-1999 position. Example An amalgamating company borrows $100 and pays interest in year 1 of $3, in year 2 of $3 and in year 3 an amalgamation takes place and the amalgamating company only pays $1.50 interest. The amalgamated company pays the remaining $1.50 for year 3. Under the current drafting of section FO 13, the BPA for the amalgamating company gives the following result: BPA = consideration − income + expenditure + amount remitted = –$1.50 – $0 + $6 + $0 = $4.50 Accordingly, the amalgamating company has $4.50 income in the year of amalgamation, whereas it should receive a $1.50 deduction. Under the proposed amendment, section FO 13 will give the following result under the BPA for the amalgamating company: Result of the BPA = –$1.50 Therefore, the amalgamating company will be entitled to a $1.50 deduction in the year of amalgamation. The amalgamated company will also be entitled to a $1.50 deduction in the year of amalgamation. 106 TRANSITIONAL RESIDENT DEFINITION (Clause 176) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments to section HR 8 are proposed to clarify the position that persons who would otherwise be transitional residents are not treated as such if they have elected not to be a transitional resident. This was clear in the Income Tax Act 2004 and the proposed amendments will make this clear for the Income Tax Act 2007. Other wording changes to section HR 8(2) to (4) are proposed to improve clarity in the section as a whole. Application date The amendments will apply from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. 107 DRAFTING AMENDMENT TO SECTION 10(7A) OF THE GOODS AND SERVICES TAX ACT 1985 (Clause 251) Summary of proposed amendment Currently, section 10(7A) requires that if goods and services are deemed to be supplied by a person under sections 5(3) and (3B), the consideration in money for the supply is treated as being the open market value of the supply. However, section 5(3) and (3B) would never apply simultaneously. Instead, the value of the supply should be at market value where either 5(3) or (3B) apply \[emphasis added\]. Application date The amendment will apply beginning on 1 April 2014. 108 HERD SCHEME LIVESTOCK PURCHASED OR SOLD BY COMPANIES (Clause 69) Summary of proposed amendment Herd scheme livestock are held on capital account. Section CD 44 of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that the net tax-free herd scheme gains of a company are a capital profit, and therefore tax-free upon a liquidation of the company, to prevent their eventual taxation as a dividend. A consequential amendment is proposed, to ensure that new capital amounts created by the recent livestock valuation reforms are also tax-free upon their eventual distribution by a company. Application date The amendment will apply from 28 March 2012, the date the original amendments came into effect. Key features Section CD 44 is being amended to extend the definition of “capital gain” to ensure that new capital amounts created by the livestock valuation reforms are tax-free upon liquidation of a company. This is necessary to recognise that the recent amendment that provides that herd scheme livestock transfers between associated parties are at herd values for taxation purposes. However, the parties may have agreed a different valuation for the actual transaction and this amendment provides that the difference between the valuations, which is on capital account, is regarded as a capital gain or a capital loss by parties to the transaction that are corporates. 109 REMOVAL OF SPENT TERMINOLOGY (Clauses 77, 123, 213, 245 and 252) Summary of proposed amendment References to “new start grants” are being repealed in the Inland Revenue Acts as they are no longer part of the suite of responses the Government uses for primary sector adverse events. Application date The amendments will apply from the day after the date of enactment. 110 BAD DEBTS REMEDIAL (Clause 84) Summary of proposed amendment Amendments were made to the tax rules last year to ensure taxpayers take bad debt deductions only when they suffer economic losses. Further technical amendments are required to ensure that the correct outcomes are achieved. Application date These amendments will apply from 20 May 2013 to align with the application of the original amendments. Key features The new base maintenance rules included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, Foreign Superannuation, and Remedial Matters) Act 2014 for deductions for bad debts for financial arrangements had the policy objective of ensuring taxpayers take bad debt deductions only when they suffer economic losses. The operation of the rules is quite complex, and as currently drafted, the application of subsections DB 31(4B) to (4E) does not give the intended result. The proposed amendments ensure that the subsections give the correct bad debt deductions at appropriate times, consistent with the policy objective. The requirement for these changes was signalled to taxpayers in the Tax Information Bulletin published in May 2014, which discussed the original amendments. 111 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT REMEDIAL – SPREADING INCOME (Clauses 121 and 146) Summary of proposed amendments In very limited circumstances, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) allow an amount associated with a financial arrangement to be taken directly to equity as a contribution to capital, and not be further dealt with. Accordingly it is then argued that this amount is not recognised for taxation purposes. The proposed amendment requires the amount to be recognised as taxable income, and provides for a catch-up calculation for past years, to be completed by companies that have taken this position. Application date The core amendment will apply from the start of the 2014–15 tax year. The catch-up will be required to be done in the 2015–16 tax year. Key features Most types of debt are taxed under the financial arrangement rules. These rules require taxpayers to spread the income or expenditure that is expected to arise over the term of the debt. There is an issue with how the IFRS financial reporting spreading method operates because of a particular transaction between two companies. Under the specific wording of that spreading method, one of the companies can exclude a portion of its income from the ambit of the spreading method (technically, because the company has been able to treat the income as a contribution to capital). This means the company will not be required to pay tax on the income until the debt expires, which will provide it with a significant timing advantage. This is inappropriate. Technical amendments are proposed to section EW 15D of the Income Tax Act 2007 to address this. When a catch-up is necessary, proposed section EZ 36B will provide for this. 112 REWRITE AND OTHER MINOR TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS (Clauses as shown) Summary of proposed amendments The following amendments reflect minor technical maintenance items arising from both the rewrite of Income Tax legislation and subsequent changes. Until its disestablishment on 2 December 2014, the Rewrite Advisory Panel monitored the working of the Income Tax Act 2007 and reviewed submissions on what may have been unintended changes in the law as a result of its having been rewritten. The Panel recommended legislative action, when necessary, to correct any problems. Since the Panel’s disestablishment, this process is being managed by Inland Revenue within its normal remedial tax policy work programme. Application dates Unless otherwise stated, all the amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 (2007 Act) will apply retrospectively, with effect from the beginning of the 2008–09 income year. Minor maintenance items The following amendments relate to minor maintenance items to correct any of the following:  ambiguities;  compilation errors;  cross-references;  drafting consistency, including readers’ aids – for example, the defined terms lists;  grammar;  punctuation;  spelling;  consequential amendments arising from substantive rewrite amendments; or  the consistent use of terminology and definitions. 113 Clause Section Act Amendment Commencement date 68 CD 39 2007 Act Repeal redundant provisions Assent 74(2) CQ 2 2007 Act Repeal redundant provisions Assent 78 CX 56C 2007 Act Terminology corrected 1 April 2010 79 CZ 10 2007 Act Repeal redundant provision Assent 80 CZ 29(3) 2007 Act Insert subsection heading 4 September 2010 86 DB 35 2007 Act Terminology corrected 1 April 2015 103 EC 41 2007 Act Terminology corrected 108 EE 32 2007 Act Terminology corrected 120 EW 9 2007 Act Cross-references corrected 131 EX 25 2007 Act Repeal redundant provisions Assent 144 EZ 5 2007 Act Terminology corrected 157 FE 28 2007 Act Grammar corrected 159 FO 12 2007 Act Ambiguity and cross-reference corrected 161-164 GB 8, GB 9, GB 11, GB 13 2007 Act Repeal redundant provisions Assent 185 LP 6 2007 Act Repeal redundant heading Assent 186 LU 1 2007 Act Terminology corrected 1 April 2014 193 OB 1 2007 Act Drafting consistency 196-198 OP 27, OP 50, Table O19 2007 Act Terminology corrected 199 RC 7 2007 Act Terminology corrected 202 RD 27 2007 Act Terminology corrected 213(16), (17) YA 1 “employee”, “employer 2007 Act Cross-reference corrected 5 Jan 2010 213(33) YA 1 “mineral miner” 2007 Act Insert index entry for definition 1 April 2014 213(41), (42) YA 1 “non-filing taxpayer” 2007 Act Cross-reference corrected 213(64), (65) YA 1 “tax position”, “tax situation” 2007 Act Cross-reference and terminology corrected Assent 190 MC 5 2007 Act Terminology corrected

The bright-line test will require income tax to be paid on any gains from the disposal of residential land that is acquired and disposed of within two years, subject to some exceptions. The Government announced plans to introduce a new land sale rule to supplement the “intention test” in the current land sale rules, as part of Budget 2015. The “intention test” makes gains from the sale of land taxable when bought with an intention or purpose of resale. This intention test is difficult to enforce due to its subjectivity. The bright-line test is intended to deal with the problem by supplementing the current intention test with an objective test. Proposals for the bright-line test were consulted on in an officials’ issues paper, Bright-line test for sales of residential property, released on 29 June 2015. The two-year period for the bright-line test runs from the date of acquisition of the land to the date of disposal. The date of acquisition is the latest date on which the person acquires an estate or interest in the land. Generally, this will be the date the title to the land is registered for the purchase of the property. The date of disposal is generally the date that a person enters into an agreement for the sale of the property. An additional rule applies for sales “off the plan”. The bright-line test applies only to the disposal of “residential land”. Residential land includes land where the owner has an arrangement to build a dwelling on it as well as bare land that is capable of having a dwelling on it. Residential land does not include business premises or farmland. A disposal of property that is the main home of the owner will be excluded from the bright-line test when the property has been used predominant ly, for most of the time that the person has owned the property, as their main home. When a person has two or more homes, their “main home” is the property with which they have the greatest connection. The main home exception can apply to properties held in trust; there are rules preventing trusts being used to obtain the exception for multiple properties. A person cannot use the main home exception if they have already used the exception twice in the previous two years. Taxpayers are allowed deductions for property subject to the bright-line test according to ordinary tax rules. Losses arising only as a result of the bright-line test are ring-fenced so they can only be used to offset gains on other land sales that are taxable under any of the land sale provisions. A person cannot recognise a loss under the bright-line test arising from a transfer of property to an associated person. 3 Anti-avoidance rules will prevent land-rich companies or trusts being used to circumvent the bright-line test. The proposed bright-line test will apply to land for which an agreement for sale and purchase is entered into on or after 1 October 2015, and which is subsequently disposed of. When the land is acquired other than by way of sale, the proposed bright-line test will apply when registration of title occurs on or after 1 October 2015. 4 TWO-YEAR BRIGHT-LINE TEST (Clauses 4, 15(2), (3) and (4)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that an amount a person derives from disposing of residential land is income of the person if it is disposed of within two years from acquisition. The bill proposes to define the acquisition and disposal dates for the two-year bright-line period depending on the nature of the transaction. Key features Standard sales of land For most standard sales of land there are four relevant dates: For standard sales of land, the proposed start date for the bright-line period is the date the transfer of the land is registered to the person under the Land Transfer Act 1952. The proposed end date is the date that a person enters into an agreement to dispose of the land. There are a number of situations when land is acquired that do not follow the standard land sale-process. For these situations, there are separate rules for when the bright- line period starts and ends. Start dates Type of acquisition Start date of bright-line test Standard purchase of land Registration Sales “off the plan” Date of entry into a contract to purchase Other sales where no registration Latest date property acquired (according to ordinary rules) Subdivided land The original date of registration for the undivided land CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) RP Registration of title for purchase CS Contract to sell (sale and purchase agreement) RS Registration of title for sale 5 Sales where there is no registration of title When there is no registration of the tit le, the proposed start date of the bright-line test is the latest date that the person acquired the land under ordinary rules. For sales of a contract to buy land, this will be the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the property. This means that for sales of contracts to buy, the bright-line period runs from the date that a person enters into a contract to purchase the land to the date that a person enters into a contract to sell the land. Subdivisions The proposed start date for the bright-line period when land is subdivided is the date the owner originally acquired the undivided land. Example: Subdivision The start date for the bright-line period is 1 May 2016 and the end date is 1 May 2022. As a result, Bob’s sale of the second section to Carla is not covered by the bright-line test. Disposals of land where there is no contract to sell There are several situat ions when land is disposed of and there is no agreement to dispose of the property. In these situations, the proposed end date for the bright-line period differs from the standard rule. CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) CS Contract to sell If less than 2 years then the gain is taxed RP Registration of title 1 May 2016 Bob acquires registered title to residential land 1 May 2021 Bob subdivides the land into two sections and builds a house on the second section 1 May 2022 Bob enters an agreement to sell the second section to Carla 6 Type of disposal End date of bright-line period Standard purchase of land Date of entry into agreement for sale Gift Date of gift (generally registration of title) Compulsory acquisition Date of compulsory acquisition Mortgagee sale Date land disposed of by mortgagee Other disposals where no contract to sell Date of disposal according to ordinary rules Gifts For gifts, the proposed end date for the bright-line period is the date the person makes the gift of the residential land. This will be the date when the donor has done everything necessary to be done in order to transfer the property and render the settlement binding. For a gift of a registrable interest in land, this will mean the end date for the bright- line period is the date the interest is registered. Gifts – start and end dates Compulsory acquisition Where the land is compulsorily acquired by the Crown, the proposed end date of the bright-line period is the date that the land is compulsorily acquired. This will generally be 14 days after the proclamation taking the land is published in the Gazette. 1 Mortgagee sale When land is disposed of by a mortgagee exercising their right to dispose of the property, the proposed end date for the bright-line period is the date when the land is disposed of by the mortgagee. Other sales If there is another type of disposal of land, the date of disposal is the date that the land is disposed of according to ordinary rules. 1 Public Works Act 1981, section 26(3). CP Contract to purchase (sale and purchase agreement) RP Registration of title for purchase RS Registration of title for gift 7 RESIDENTIAL LAND (Clause 15(5), (7) and (11)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed bright-line test will only apply if the land disposed of is residential land at the date of disposal. Key features The proposed definition of “residential land” is land that: • has a dwelling on it; or • the seller of land is a party to an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling on it; or • is bare land and because of its area and nature is capable of having a dwelling erected on it. The first criterion includes land that has a dwelling on it. The definit ion o f “dwelling” is the same as that currently used in the Income Tax Act 2007 and Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. However, two new adjust ments are proposed to the definition for the purposes of the bright-line test. The two adjustments are to include serviced apartments wit hin the definit io n o f “residential land” and exclude all rest homes and retirement villages fro m the definit io n. The second criterion is intended to ensure that the bright-line test covers land that does not have a dwelling on it at present but there is a plan or understanding to build a dwelling on it. For example, this criterion would apply when the owner of a commercial office has an arrangement to convert it into dwellings. The third criterion is intended to ensure the bright-line test applies to bare land that, because of the characteristics of the land, is likely to have a dwelling on it in the future. This would include bare land zoned as residential under the relevant unitary or district plan. 8 Example: Development Andrew buys an empty plot of land. He plans to develop the plot by subdividing it into four lots and building houses on each lot. Andrew sells Lot 1 off the plan to Bob. One month later, Bob sells Lot 1 to Carla. Lot 1 is residential land as it is bare land that, because of its area and nature, is capable of having a dwelling on it. Therefore, Bob would be subject to the bright-line test. Business premises or farmland Residential land does not include land used predominantly as business premises or farmland. Business premises “Business premises” has its ordinary meaning as within the rest of the Income Tax Act 2007. Properties rented out for residential purposes are not “business premises”. However, properties rented out to other businesses to use as premises are covered by the exclusion. Example: Bed and breakfast Mary owns a bed and breakfast. She provides food to the residents, room service and cleans the rooms she lets out every day. The land has a dwelling on it so meets the first criterion for “residential land.” However, the land would not be residential as it is used predominantly as the business premises for the bed and breakfast. Farmland Farmland is defined as “land that because of its area and nature is capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business”. A farming or agricultural business includes forestry, horticultural and pastoral businesses. To be capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming or agricultural business, the land must be capable of producing revenue sufficient to cover all costs of holding and operating the land. This includes the cost of capital employed and a reasonable recompense for the proprietor’s labour. 9 Example: Lifestyle block Marama purchases a lifestyle block with a house and a small area of farmland. A small number of sheep are kept on the land to keep the grass down. The farming exclusion will not apply as the land is not capable of being worked as an economic unit as a farming business. It is a hobby farm rather than a genuine farming business. If the area of farmland was larger and capable of being used as an economic unit for farming purposes, it would likely be covered by the farming exclusion. 10 MAIN HOME (Clauses 6, 15(5), (10) and (11)) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to generally exclude the sale of a person’s main home fro m the bright-line test. The main home exception is proposed to be based to some extent on the current residential exclusion in section CB 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007. Key features Requirements for the main home exception It is proposed that for a property to qualify for the “main home” exception, the land must have been used predominantly, for most of the time the person owns the land, for a dwelling that was the main home of the person or a beneficiary of the trust that owns the property (subject to some limitations). Used predominantly as person’s main home The proposed requirement that the land is used predominantly as the person’s main home means that most of the area of the land must have been actually used for the home. The test is based on a person’s actual use of the property and not the person’s intended use of the property. In some circumstances, a person will be required to determine the area of land used for their private residential purposes and the area of land used for other purposes. For example, when a single property has been used by the owner partly as a residential home and partly as a rental property, the relative areas will need to be determined. In many cases, a taxpayer will have determined the relative areas in working out the tax deductions (insurance and rates, for example) that can be claimed. The determination of the areas includes any land used for the relevant purposes (for example, a backyard for the home). It is proposed that the main ho me except ion either applies or it does not apply; it does not apply on a proportionate basis. As a result, when the property is used less than 50 percent for the main home of the person then the main home exception will not apply. Used for most of the time as their main home It is proposed that the land must have been used for most of the time that the person owns the land as their main home. This requires the property to have been used more than 50 percent of the time as their main home for the period the person owns the land. The land does not need to have been used without interruption as their main home. For example, a main home can be rented out for short periods while the owner is on vacation or prior to settlement of the sale of the property, as long as the time is less than the private residential use. 11 It is also proposed that the owner, or a beneficiary of a trust that owns the property (subject to some limitations), must have resided in the property as their main home. As a result, it is proposed that the exception will not apply when only a family member has used the property as their main home (and not the owner or relevant beneficiary). Further, if the owner of a property does not reside in New Zealand, they cannot use the main home exception. Trusts The bill proposes that a trustee of a trust can use the main home exception when they sell a property if it is the main home of a beneficiary (subject to some limitations). However, a trustee cannot use the main home exception when: • the principal settlor of the trust owns a main home that is not the property being sold; or • the principal settlor of the trust is a beneficiary of a trust that owns the settlor’s main home (and that is not the property that the trustee is disposing of). The principal settlor is the one settlor that has settled the most property, by value, on the trust. Example: Student flat Dave has two properties, a family home which he lives in, and a student flat which his son lives in while studying. Dave settles the student flat on a trust and makes his son a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The trust cannot use the main home exception because the principal settlor of the trust (Dave) has another main home. More than one home – “greatest connection” test If a person has two homes, the bill proposes that the “greatest connection” test will determine which of the two properties is the person’s main home. In other words, the “greatest connection” test operates only as a t ie-breaker when a person has more than one home. The “greatest connection” test determines, on an objective basis, which property is the person’s main home. The test does not allow a person to elect their main home. Various factors may be relevant in determining which property the person has the greatest connection wit h, including: • the time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family (if any) live; • where their social ties are strongest; • the person’s use of the dwelling; • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and 12 • whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling. These factors are similar to those used to determine if a person has a permanent place of abode under current tax law. Therefore, existing guidance on the “permanent place of abode” test could assist in determining which property the person has the greatest connection wit h. Using the main home exception for two properties The bill proposes that, in limited circumstances, a person may use the main home exception for two properties sold at the same time. An example is when a person lives in a home for less than one year as their home, and moves into a new home while trying to sell the original home. The original home may satisfy the requirements to be the person’s main home (as discussed above) for the period before mo ving into the new home. The new home may also satisfy the requirements to be the person’s main home for the subsequent period. The ownership overlap of the properties will no t mean the original ho me fails to satisfy the requirements to be a main home for the previous period. If the two properties were sold at the same time, the owner will be able to use the main home exception for both properties (if they both satisfied the requirements to be a main home for the different periods). Example: Main home exception for multiple properties The main home exception is available for both properties. Property 1 was the main home for 9 out of the 11 months the property was owned. Property 2 was the main home for the entire time it was owned. January 2016 Purchases Property 1 October 2016 Moves out of Property 1 Main home December 2016 Sells Property 1 October 2016 Purchases Property 1 December 2016 Sells Property 2 Main home 13 Different owners can have different main homes It is proposed that co-owners of property can have different main homes. For example, a person living in one city may have a different main home from their spouse living in another city. The bright-line test is proposed to apply to the extent the property is not the main home of an owner on disposal. Habitual sellers The bill proposes that a person cannot use the main home exception if they have already used the exception twice in the previous two years. An example is when a person habitually buys property to renovate and sell, and lives in the property while they undertake the renovations. The person will only be able to use the main home exception twice in a two-year period. If they sell a third property in the two-year period they will not be able to claim the main home exception for that property. 14 INHERITANCE (Clauses 4(3) and 11) Summary of proposed amendment When a person dies, their property may be sold or transferred to a beneficiary, who may subsequently sell the property. The bill proposes that those transfers and disposals will not subject to tax under the bright-line test. Background When a taxpayer dies, an estate can be dealt with in several ways, depending on whether a will exists. A will usually provides for the appointment of one or more executors. In the absence of a will, a court will appoint someone to administer the deceased’s estate (an administrator). The executor or administrator is vested with legal and beneficial ownership of the deceased’s property from the time of death to the end of the period of executorship or administration. The beneficiaries have a right to have the deceased’s estate administered properly during this period but do not have a legal or beneficial interest in the assets. The duties of the executor or administrator are to collect the assets of the deceased, pay all debts, testamentary expenses and taxes and to distribute the legacies. At the end of the period of executorship or administration, the executor or administrator becomes a trustee of the residual assets on behalf of the beneficiaries. Property that has been bequeathed or devised under a will may be gifted as a specific legacy, general legacy or residuary gift. Specific legacies are treated as taking effect from the date of transfer to take effect from the date of death, so income arising from the property is derived by the beneficiary from the date of death. A general or residuary legacy vests in a beneficiary at the time of distribution. Detailed analysis The bright-line test proposes rollover relief for all transfers following a death and an exemption for any disposals by the executor or administrator or subsequent disposals by the beneficiaries. The rollover relief is achieved by deeming the transfers from the deceased person to the executor or administrator, and from the executor or administrator to the beneficiary, as a disposal and acquisition of the property at the total cost of the land to the deceased person at the date of transfer (rather than at the land’s market value). The effect of this is that no tax liabilities under the bright-line test arise under the transfers. 15 Disposals by a beneficiary, executor or administrator of residential land transferred to them on the death of a person are specifically excluded from the bright-line test. However, the disposals may still be subject to tax under the current land sale rules. 16 RELATIONSHIP PROPERTY (Clause 10) Summary of proposed amendment When a relationship breaks down, property may be transferred between the spouses or partners. The property may then subsequently be sold. Transfers of property under a relationship property agreement are proposed to be excluded from the bright-line test. However, any subsequent sale of the transferred property will be subject to the bright- line test. Background During a marriage, civil union or de facto relationship, the parties hold any property according to the conventional laws relating to property. As a result, the parties are free to deal wit h their property during the relationship without regard to the provisions of the Property (Relationships) Act 1976. When a relationship breaks down, the Property (Relationships) Act 1976 may be invoked by a court order or an agreement between the parties. When the statutory regime is invoked, new property rights operate from the date of the court order or agreement. The property of the spouses or partners is reapportioned between them under principles derived from the statutory regime. Each item of property is divided into one of two statutory categories: • relationship property; and • separate property. The fact that a particular item of property is placed within one of these two categories then produces a prima facie result in the way it is treated as between the two spouses or partners. Prima facie, all relationship property is divided in equal shares, while separate property is retained by the owner. Rollover relief A transfer of property under a relationship property agreement will be entitled to the current rollover relief that applies to such transfers. This will mean that no tax liability under the bright-line test arises for the transfer of the property under the relationship property agreement. However, the person to whom the relationship property has been transferred may be liable under the bright-line test for any subsequent disposal of the property. A tax liability will arise if the property is disposed of within two years of the registration date on the acquisition by the person who transferred the property (and the property was not their main home). 17 Example: Scenario Jack and Jill get married in June 2015 and purchase a house and a rental property together on 15 December 2015. Six months into the marriage they decide to separate. Jill gets the house and the investment property under the relationship property agreement. The transfers of property to Jill under the relationship property agreement will not be subject to the bright-line test. Jill continues to live in the house as her main home. She decides to sell the house and the investment property in July 2016 (that is, within two years of purchasing the properties). Jill will not be taxable on the sale of the house because it has been her main home for the period she has owned the property (either jointly or subsequently on her own). The sale of the rental property will be subject to the bright-line test because it has been bought and sold within two years. 18 ROLLOVER FOR LAND TRANSFERRED UNDER A RESIDENT’S RESTRICTED AMALGAMATION (Clause 12) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to extend the current rollover relief for amalgamations to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the new bright-line test. The amalgamation rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 contain a rollover provision for property transferred as a result of an amalgamation. 2 The rules provide that where property is held on revenue account by an amalgamating company solely due to the application o f a 10-year rule in sections CB 9 to CB 11 and CB 14, the property is transferred to the amalgamated company at cost. If the amalgamated company disposes of the property within 10 years of the original date of acquisition of the property by the amalgamating company, any gain from the sale is taxable. The bill proposes to extend this rollover relief to property that is revenue account property of an amalgamating company due to the application of the bright-line test. Example: Land held on revenue account solely due to bright-line test On 1 May 2018 the property is transferred from A to B at cost ($500k). A does not have a tax liability from the transfer as there is no gain from the disposal. On 1 June 2018, B is taxable on the $150k gain from the sale. This is because B disposed of the property within two years of the original date of acquisition of the property by A (1 May 2017). 2 That meets the criteria to be a “resident’s restricted amalgamation” under section FO 3. 1 May 2017 A purchases property for $500k 1 May 2018 A transfers property to B as part of an amalgamation Market value of property is $600k 1 June 2018 B sells property to C for $650k Transferred for $500k – no gain Sale for $650k – gain is taxable as disposed of within 2 years of original acquisition A B C 19 DEDUCTIONS (No clause) For property that is liable for tax under the bright-line test, it is proposed that taxpayers will be able to deduct expenditure according to the ordinary tax rules. The cost of the property can be deducted A person who sells property that is subject to the bright-line test will be allowed a deduction for the cost of the property at the time of sale. The cost of the property includes the amount that was paid to acquire the property (the initial acquisition price of the property). The cost of the property also includes any expenditure related to the acquisition. As a result, the costs of lawyers, valuers, surveyors and real estate agents are deductible. The incidental costs of disposing of the property are also deductible as part of the cost of the property. The cost of the property also includes any capital improvements to the property made after acquisition, such as renovations. Holding costs deductible to the extent sufficient nexus and not private in nature While a property is owned there will be periodic holding costs (of a non-capital nature) such as interest, insurance, rates and repairs, and maintenance expenses. To be deductible as incurred, the holding costs must satisfy the normal deduction requirements. In other words, the holding costs are deductible to the extent they have a nexus with income and are not private in nature (or otherwise subject to any of the general limitations on deductions). A deduction will be considered to be of a private nature if it is exclusively related to living as an individual. This will be determined by the specific facts of any given situation. However, interest costs can automatically be deducted if the property is owned by a company (subject to some limitations). For example, when the property is part of a business or profit-making undertaking or scheme, and there is no private use, it is likely that the nexus would be satisfied. Further, when the property is rented out there would likely be a nexus between the holding costs and the rental income. However, if a person purchases a bach for family use, but sells the bach within two years, the holding costs would not be deductible because of the private limitation. 20 LOSSES (Clause 8) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that losses from deductions that are claimable solely against bright- line income (bright-line deductions) will be ring-fenced, so they can only be offset against gains on other land sales that are taxable under any of the land sale provisions. Key features The amount of bright-line deductions allowed in any income year is proposed to be limited to the amount of bright-line income and land net income for that year. Land net income is the amount of net income for the year as if the person’s only income they derived was from the disposal of land under sections CB 6 to CB 15. Any excess deductions not allocated to the income year will be treated as the cost of revenue account property and carried forward to the next income year. However, any excess deductions will not be able to be carried forward if the general continuity requirements for carrying forward tax losses are not satisfied. Losses from transfers to associated persons It is proposed that a person will not be able to recognise a loss under the bright-line test arising from a transfer of property to an associated person. 21 LAND-RICH COMPANIES AND TRUSTS (Clause 14) Summary of proposed amendment To address the risk of people using land-rich companies and trusts to circumvent the bright-line test, a specific anti-avoidance rule is proposed in the bill that deems disposals of residential land to have occurred when companies and trusts are used to defeat the intent and application of the bright-line test. Land-rich companies The proposed specific anti-avoidance rule for companies deems a shareholder to have disposed of residential land whenever the following three requirements are met: • The company is land rich – this means at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential property. • 50 percent or more of the shares in the company are disposed of within a 12- mo nth period. • The disposal of shares had a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. Definition of land-rich company A “land-rich” company is one where at least 50 percent of the value of the company is attributable to residential land either directly or indirectly. This is intended to mirror similar provisions contained in international double tax agreements. Resident ial land can be attributable to a company either through the company owning the residential land in its own name or holding shares in another land-rich company. Purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test This provision is intended to align with other specific anti-avoidance rules contained in the Income Tax Act 2007. 3 As with other specific anti-avoidance rules, principles from the general anti-avoidance rule are intended to apply to this specific anti-avoidance rule. This means that when determining whether a disposal of shares has “a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test” the principles outlined in the general anti-avoidance cases should apply. 4 3 See, for example, sections GB 49 and YC 9(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 4 See Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. 22 In particular, in determining whether there is a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test it is intended that the key question be whether the disposal of shares, viewed in a commercially and economically realistic way, makes use of the bright-line test provisions in a manner that is consistent with Parliament’s contemplation. Land-rich trusts The proposed specific anti-avoidance rule for trusts deems a trustee to have disposed of residential land whenever all three of the following requirements are met: • The trust is land-rich – this means that at least 50 percent of the value of the trust is attributable to residential land. • And: a. the trust deed changes; or b. a decisio n-maker under the trust deed changes; or c. an arrangement under the trust changes • The action in (b) was done with a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. The same considerations as for land-rich companies apply in determining whether the trust is land-rich and whether there was a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the bright-line test. 23 24 Consequential and remedial amendments 25 26 DEFINITION OF “LAND” (Clause 15(6) and (8)) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment clarifies the definition of “land” to make clear that “land” includes interests in land. Application date The amendment will come into force on 1 October 2015. Key features It is proposed that the definit io n o f “estate” and “interest” in land are replaced with a definition of estate and interest in land that clearly includes interests in land. The definition of land clearly includes an interest in land prior to the rewrite of the definit ion. In addition, the proposed new definition clarifies that an interest in land includes the right to possession of land. Background As a result of the rewrite of income tax legislation, there was an unintended change to the definition of “land”. This change created uncertainty over whether it included an interest in land. 27 CLARIFYING TREATMENT OF LAND TRANSFERRED UNDER A RESIDENT’S RESTRICTED AMALGAMATION (Clause 13) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to clarify the treatment of revenue account property transferred as a result of a resident’s restricted amalgamation when, at the time of the amalgamation, it is unclear whether the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue or capital account. Application date The proposed amendment will come into force on 1 October 2015. Key features The amendment applies so that property is deemed to be transferred at market value when: • the land is held on revenue account for the amalgamating company; and • the land is, or may be, revenue account property of the amalgamating company solely because of the 2-year bright-line test or a 10-year rule in any of sections CB 9 to CB 11, and CB 14. When the two criteria above are met the property is deemed to be transferred at market value. Background When two companies merge under an amalgamation, the transfer of assets between the companies is generally exempt from tax. However, the transfer is not exempt from tax if the property leaves the tax base. The amalgamation rules achieve this result by transferring property either at cost or at market value, depending on whether the amalgamating and amalgamated company hold the property on revenue or capital account. This is illustrated in Table 1. 28 Table 1 B Holds on capital account Holds on revenue account (except if solely due to 10-year rule) Holds on revenue account solely due to 10-year rule A Holds on capital account Cost Market Market Holds on revenue account (except if solely due to 10-year rule) Market Cost Cost Market Holds on revenue account solely due to 10-year rule Cost Cost Cost However, when the amalgamated company holds the property on revenue account, if it disposes of the property within 10 years, it is unclear for the amalgamating company whether they transfer the property at cost (and have no tax liability) or at market value (and have a tax liability). 29 NON-ACTIVE TRUSTS MAY BE EXCUSED FROM FILING RETURNS (Clause 16) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment proposes to introduce a new section into the Tax Administration Act 1994. It will allow non-active trusts (which are currently required to file nil income tax returns) to be exempted from the obligation to file, thereby reducing their compliance costs. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Trusts that are non-active will no longer be required to file annual income tax returns, if: • throughout the tax year the trust is a non-active complying trust; and • the trustee of the trust has filed a declaration that the trust is non-active (and the trust has not become active since making the declaration). A trust will be non-active if it: • has not derived or been deemed to have derived any income; • has no deductions; • has not disposed of, or been deemed to have disposed of, any assets of the trust; and • has not been a party to, or perpetuated or continued with, any transactions wit h assets of the trust in the tax year, which give rise to income in any person’s hands, or fringe benefits to any employee or to any former employee. Certain minimal amounts of income or deductions can be ignored in determining whether a trust is non-active. The amendment sets out the process by which a non-active trust may make application for exemption from filing income tax returns. This process entails the completion of a declaration – first, that the trust is a non-active trust and secondly, that a trustee of the trust will inform the Commissioner if it ceases to be so. The trustees of the trust are thereby placed under a statutory obligation to inform the Commissioner upon the cessation. 30 The Commissioner will retain the power to request the trustees of a trust to furnish a return of income even if it holds an exemption under the proposed provision. The proposed amendment is based on a similar provision for non-active companies in section 43A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 31
Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill Commentary on the Bill First published in July 2015 by Policy and Strategy, Inland Revenue, P O Box 2198, Wellington 6140. Taxation (Land Information and Offshore Persons Information) Bill; Commentary on the Bill. ISBN 0-978-0-478-42413-3 CONTENTS Overview 1 IRD numbers and tax identification numbers 2 New Zealand bank accounts 9 OVERVIEW The Income Tax Act 2007 (the ITA 2007) contains provisions that impose income tax on certain property transactions, and also on rental income earned from property. Current tax rules include provisions which tax gains from property bought with the intention of disposal and provisions which tax land acquired for the purposes of a business dealing in land. However, although the ITA 2007 creates these obligations, the Government is concerned that compliance with these provisions may be relatively low. This may come about as a result of ignorance of the tax rules. It is recognised that enforcing tax rules on non-residents is very difficult, especially those with only limited engagement with New Zealand. In order to investigate compliance with the ITA 2007 provisions, Inland Revenue does have the capacity to access records of land transfers in New Zealand. But this process is historic, rather than in real-time. Information received might also not give a complete picture of the activities or identity of a particular taxpayer. The fact that Inland Revenue is not aware of certain transactions means that the scope of the problem is not able to be quantified. To address these concerns, the Government is introducing a suite of measures aimed at providing clearer rules and providing more useful information to Inland Revenue to assist in its enforcement of the rules, including increased funding to Inland Revenue to investigate property compliance. This bill contains two of those measures, to come into force on 1 October 2015. First, transferors and transferees will be required to provide their IRD numbers (and, if they are also resident in another jurisdiction for tax purposes, their equivalent of an IRD number from that foreign jurisdiction) at the time of transfer. This information will be provided to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) as part of the transfer documentation and then forwarded to Inland Revenue. An important feature of the proposal to provide IRD numbers is that all parties to a land transaction will be expected to have an IRD number, even if they are non-resident. A person who is not an “offshore person” as defined and who is purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home, or selling a property that was their main home, will be exempt from the requirement to supply this informat ion. Second, an “offshore person” (as defined) will be required to provide evidence of a New Zealand bank account as a prerequisite to obtaining an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person looking to obtain an IRD number has first been subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. A separate legislative change, not contained in this bill, is planned to introduce a “bright-line” test, which is to come into force on 1 October 2015. The bright-line test will, in general terms, make the disposal of residential property taxable if the property is bought and sold within two years (subject to certain exemptions, such as if the property was the person’s main home). An issues paper on the bright-line test was released at the end of June 2015. 1 IRD NUMBERS AND TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments would require transferors and transferees of real property to provide their IRD numbers, and if they are currently tax-resident overseas, their foreign equivalent of an IRD number, and the relevant country code of the jurisdiction in which they are tax-resident. This information will be passed on to Inland Revenue, to help compliance with New Zealand’s tax legislation. It could also be provided to overseas tax authorities by Inland Revenue in accordance with existing information- sharing legislation. A person who is purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home, or selling a property that was their main home, will be exempt from the requirement to supply this information. The main home information exemption is not available where the person is an “offshore person”, where the property is to be or was owned by a trust, or if the person is selling their main home for the third time in a two-year period. References in this section are to the Land Transfer Act 1952 unless stated. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 October 2015. Key features The bill proposes amendments to the Land Transfer Act 1952, the Tax Administration Act 1994, and consequential Land Transfer (Computer Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002. The proposed amendments require transferors and transferees of real property to provide their Inland Revenue Department (IRD) numbers. If they are currently tax- resident in another jurisdiction, they must also provide their equivalent of an IRD number from the foreign jurisdiction and the relevant country code of the jurisdict io n in which they are tax-resident. A New Zealand individual who is purchasing a property with the intention of that property becoming their main home, or selling a property that was their main home, will be exempt from the requirement to supply this information (unless they are selling their main home for the third time in a two-year period). When a person is acting in another capacity (for example, as trustee of a trust), the information provided must relate to the capacity in which they are acting, rather than their individual capacity. A person buying or selling property as a nominee must provide the information relating to their principal. 2 This information will be collected by conveyancers from property transferors and transferees, and provided to Land Information New Zealand (LINZ), which in turn will provide the information to Inland Revenue, along with details about the transfer to which the tax information relates. An offence will be committed if a transferee or transferor provides false or misleading tax information. Under this legislation, regulations will be able to be made under these provisions to provide exemptions for particular transfers or parties to transfers that meet the fo llo wing criteria: • collecting the IRD number must be impractical or involve high compliance costs; or • the transaction or person must represent a low tax avoidance risk. Regulations will also be able to be made to include transfers of other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement. Detailed analysis Requirement to provide a tax statement Proposed section 156B provides that all transferors and transferees of real property who are transferring a “specified estate in land” must provide a “tax statement” before the transfer can be registered. The tax statement must be provided to LINZ, or a certifier, who will provide it to LINZ, in accordance with existing conveyancing processes as specified in proposed section 156B(2) and (3). The definit io n of a specified estate in land is contained in proposed section 156A, and includes freehold estates, leasehold estates, and certain unit titles and licences to occupy, as well as any other estate in land that is declared to be a specified estate in regulat ions. Proposed section 156C states that a tax statement must contain the following: • full name, date and signature of the transferor or transferee; • if the person is exempt, what category of exemption applies to them; and • if the person is not exempt, the information set out in section 156C(2). Information required for persons who are not exempt A person who is not exempt must provide the information contained in proposed section 156C(2). In all cases, the non-exempt person must supply their IRD number. (If the person does not currently have an IRD number, they must obtain one from Inland Revenue before they can complete the transfer). They must also state whether they are currently a tax resident of another jurisdiction. (If they are tax-resident in another 3 jurisdiction, they will generally be taxable on their world-wide income by that other jurisdiction.) If they are currently a tax resident of another jurisdiction, the person must state the name and country code of that jurisdiction. The country code for a jurisdiction will be prescribed by Inland Revenue. The person must also provide the equivalent of their IRD number in that jurisdiction that is, the unique identifier that they use in their dealings with the tax authority in that jurisdiction. Persons acting in different capacities Where a non-exempt person must supply information about their IRD numbers (and where applicable, their foreign equivalent of an IRD number and relevant country code), proposed section 156C(3) provides that a person who is acting in a different capacity must provide the information as it relates to the capacity in which they are acting. For example, where trustees of a trust are buying or selling trust property, they must provide the trust’s IRD number, not their own personal IRD numbers. Similarly, partners in a partnership who are buying or selling partnership property should provide the partnership’s IRD number, not their own IRD numbers. Nominees must provide the IRD number of the person for whom they are acting as nominee. Exemptions from requirement to provide information There are two categories of exemptions from the requirement to provide information. The first is for individuals who are not “offshore persons” who are buying or selling their main home. The second is for particular transfers or parties to transfers that have been specified in regulations to the Act and which meet the following criteria: • collecting the IRD number must be impractical or involve high compliance costs; or • the transaction or person must represent a low tax avoidance risk. Having to supply an IRD number does not necessarily mean that tax must be paid on the sale of property. Conversely, while a person who does not have to provide their information will generally not have to pay New Zealand tax on their gain, in some circumstances this might not be the case. 4 Main home information exemption This exemption is intended for individuals who are buying or selling their main home. This is dealt with by proposed section 156A(2). The information exemption is not available where: • the person is an “offshore person”; • where the property is to be or was owned by a trust, or • for the sale of a property where the main home exemption has been used twice or more in the past two years immediately preceding the date of transfer. For the main home exemption to apply, the land must be residential land. The main home information exemption is not available for where the residence is on a commercial farm. Where a property is used mainly for investment purposes the main ho me informat ion exemption will not apply. Where a person has multiple homes (for example, a holiday home), the main home information exemption will not apply more than once. The concept of a main home and similar concepts such as a principal place of abode are well established under case law. Where a person has more than one place of residence, their “main home” would be determined according to which property a person has the greatest connection with. The factors that determine these connections would include: • the time the person occupies the dwelling; • where their immediate family (if any) live; • where their social ties are strongest; • the person’s use of the dwelling; • the person’s employment, business interests and economic ties to the area where the dwelling is located; and • whether the person’s personal property is in the dwelling. Offshore persons Proposed section 156A(2)(b)(iv) will provide that the main home exemption is not available to “offshore persons” (to be defined in section 3 of the Tax Administration Act). This means that the main home exemption will only be available to a person if one o f the following applies: • they are a New Zealand citizen or permanent visa holder who is currently present in New Zealand; or • they are a New Zealand citizen who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than three years; or 5 • they are a permanent resident visa holder who is not currently present in New Zealand but they have been away from New Zealand for less than one year. All other persons who are transferring a property must supply their IRD number, and if they are a current tax resident of another country, their equivalent of an IRD number and the country code of the other country. Trusts Where the property being bought or sold was or will be trust property, proposed section 156A(2)(b)(i) and (ii) provides that the main home information exception will not be able to be used. This means that the trustees of a trust will need to provide the trust’s IRD number (and foreign equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) when purchasing trust property. Persons selling their main home a third time within two years Proposed section 156A(2)(b)(iii) provides that a person who has sold their main home at least twice in the past two years must provide their IRD number (and foreig n equivalent of an IRD number and country code, if applicable) if they sell their main home a third time within that two-year period. This is to address the situation where a person has a regular pattern of buying and selling a property in which they live, for profit. Such a person may be taxable under existing law on gains from the sale of these properties. Collecting information in relation to those who have sold their home for the third time within two years is intended to help Inland Revenue identify those situations. Examples of main home information exemption Example 1 George bought his first home in Seymour Street a year ago. However, his neighbours complain about the noise when he plays his drum kit, so he decides to sell it and buy a new home with better soundproofing. When he puts his Seymour Street house on the market he is pleasantly surprised to discover that his house has risen in value. He has an offer accepted on a new house in Taradale Street, with new neighbours who love the sound of drums. George does not need to provide his IRD number for the sale of the Seymour Street property, which he lived in as his main home, or the purchase of the Taradale Street property, which is to be his main home. Example 2 Mr and Mrs Brown and their children live in a house on a small lifestyle block in Oamaru. Mrs Brown works in Christchurch for three days a week. She plans to buy an apartment in Christchurch city. She will live in that apartment while she works in Christchurch. The main home information exemption will not apply in relation to Mrs Brown’s Christchurch apartment as it is not the home with which she has the greatest connection, and she will have to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property. However, if Mr and Mrs Brown were to sell their Oamaru property, they would not need to provide their IRD numbers in relation to that sale because that property was their main home. 6 Example 3 Sarah is a New Zealand citizen who has been living in the United Kingdom (UK) for the past 10 years. Prior to returning to New Zealand, she decides to buy a house in Te Awamutu to live in. As she is an “offshore person” at the time she purchases the house, she cannot use the main home information exemption for this property and she will need to supply her IRD number in relation to the purchase of that property. Because she is a tax resident of the UK at the time that she purchases the property, she will also need to supply her UK National Insurance number (which is the equivalent to a New Zealand IRD number, and the UK country code.) Information exemptions under regulations Proposed section 236(l)(ha) will provide for information exemptions for particular types of transfers or parties to transfers. These must be specified in regulations to the Act. In order for a type of transfer, or party to a transfer, to be specified in regulations, proposed section 236(4) provides that the Minister must be satisfied that the t ype o f transfer or party to a transfer meets the following criteria: • collecting the IRD number must be impractical or involve high compliance costs; or • the transaction or person must represent a low tax avoidance risk. Regulations will also be able to be made to include transfers of other estates in land to be covered by the tax information requirement, where these are economically equivalent (see proposed section 236(l)(hb)). Offence to supply misleading or false tax information Proposed section 156E provides that a person who knowingly, or with intent to deceive, gives false or misleading tax information, commits an offence. A person who commits such an offence is liable to a fine of up to $25,000 if the conviction is a first time offence, and a fine of up to $50,000 for every subsequent offence. A person who provides information that they genuinely believe to be true but which is not in fact correct will not be committing an offence. Correction of errors or omissions Proposed section 156D provides a procedure for an omission or error that was contained in a tax statement provided to LINZ to be corrected. Such omissions or errors do not affect the validity of any registration of transfer instrument. Information disclosure and retention Proposed section 156H provides that tax information must not be disclosed unless authorised or required by law. Proposed section 156F requires LINZ to supply Inland Revenue with the tax information and the details of the related property transaction that it collects. 7 Proposed section 156I of the Land Transfer Act and section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would permit tax information to be disclosed between authorised persons in specified circumstances, which is intended to allow for information matching between Inland Revenue and LINZ in relation to the information collected by LINZ. Proposed section 156F also permits the chief executive of LINZ to release or to give tax information to any person who requests it, provided that the information is given in aggregate form only and in a manner that prevents any person, estate in land, or transaction from being identified. Under proposed section 156G, certifiers and LINZ must hold tax statements for 10 years. A copy of a statement must be provided to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue if requested in writing. Consequential amendments • Clause 5 makes consequential amendments to section 164B of the Land Transfer Act. • Clause 7 makes a consequential amendment to the Land Transfer (Computer Registers and Electronic Lodgement) Amendment Act 2002. 8 NEW ZEALAND BANK ACCOUNTS (Clauses 9 and 10) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments require an “offshore person” to have a New Zealand “bank account number” as a prerequisite to being issued an IRD number. If a person (other than an individual) becomes an “offshore person” after they have an IRD number, the obligation to provide a bank account number arises at the time they become an offshore person. The intent of this particular requirement is that it will provide Inland Revenue with more confidence that it knows who it is dealing with by first ensuring that a person has satisfied a financial institution’s anti-money laundering verification of identity requirements. Application date The amendments will come into force on 1 October 2015. Key features Proposed section 24BA(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner must not allocate a tax file number (commonly known as an IRD number) to an offshore person unless she first receives a bank account number for that person. The main features of the rule are: • the definition of “offshore person”; and • the definition of “bank account number”. Offshore person The definition of “offshore person” applies both to individuals and non-individuals (for example, trusts and companies). For individuals, a New Zealand citizen or person that holds a residence-class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009 will generally not be classed as an offshore person unless: • in the case of citizens, they have not been in New Zealand for the last three years; and • in the case of residents, they have not been in New Zealand for the last year. 9 A non-individual will be an “offshore person” if they would be an overseas person under section 7(2)(b) to (e) of the Overseas Investment Act 2005 (modified to include the test for individuals described above). This test looks through structures that are New Zealand-tax resident and looks at their underlying ownership or control. The test is necessary to prevent offshore individuals avoiding the rule by interposing a New Zealand-resident structure. Generally speaking this means a non-individual will be treated as being “offshore” if: • It is a body corporate (such as a company) and: - it is incorporated outside New Zealand; or - 25 percent or more of its shares are owned by a body corporate incorporated outside New Zealand; or - an offshore person(s) has 25 percent or more of:  any class of securities;  the power to control the composition of its governing body; or  the right to exercise or control the voting power. • It is a partnership or other unincorporated body of persons (other than a trust) and: - 25 percent or more of its partners or members are offshore persons; - an offshore person(s) has a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the profits or assets (including on winding up); or - an offshore person(s) has the right to exercise or control the exercise o f 25 percent or more of the voting power at a meeting. • It is a trust and an offshore person(s): - constitute 25 percent or more of its governing body; or - has a beneficial interest in or entitlement to 25 percent or more of the trust property; or - are 25 percent or more of those that have the right to amend or control the amendment of the trust deed; or - are 25 percent or more of those having the right to control the composition of the trust’s governing body. • It is a unit trust and an offshore person(s): - are the manager or trustee, or both; or - has a beneficial interest in, or entitlement to, 25 percent or more of the trust property. 10 Bank account number A “bank account number” is an identifying number of an account at either a “registered bank”, as defined in the Reserve Bank of New Zealand Act 1989, 1 or a “licenced non-bank deposit taker”, as defined in the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. The Reserve Bank publishes lists of both types of entity on its website. The account number submitted to the Commissioner must be an account held by the IRD number applicant. Becoming an offshore person Proposed section 24BA(2) is intended to prevent the bank account requirement being circumvented by, for example, a New Zealand company being established, obtaining an IRD number and then being sold to an offshore person. The proposed section requires a person to give their bank account number to the Commissioner immediately upon becoming an “offshore person”. However, this requirement to provide a bank account number at this later time only applies to non-individuals. This means that, for example, a New Zealand citizen that emigrates will not be obliged to provide a bank account number after being away for three years. Penalties for non-compliance No new penalties are proposed as part of these amendments. If an offshore person does not provide a bank account number they will not be issued an IRD number. For instances, such as the requirement to provide a bank account number upon becoming an offshore person, existing penalties are in place – failing to provide information to the Commissioner when required to do so by a tax law is already an offence under sections 143 and 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 1 This definition is already contained in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007, and so is incorporated in the Tax Administration Act through the operation of section 3(2) of that Act. 11

The proposal is intended to deal with the significant problem of student loan borrowers who move overseas and do not remain engaged with the scheme and consequently default on their repayment obligations. It will do so by allowing Inland Revenue to have borrower’s names matched against the Australian Taxat ion Office database of Australian taxpayers. Inland Revenue will be able to contact matched individuals and, where appropriate, recover outstanding loan repayments. Other amendments make write-off of loan interest more accessible to borrowers who are volunteering overseas, update the student loan rules and ensure that other policies introduced in recent years work as they should. 3 DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUSTRALIAN TAXATION OFFICE ABOUT BORROWERS WHO ARE, OR MAY BE, OVERSEAS-BASED (Clauses 26 and 73) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment to the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 will give effect in domestic law to the Arrangement for the Exchange of Information regarding New Zealand Student Loans, which was signed by the Commissioner of Taxation (Australia) and the Commissioner of Inland Revenue (New Zealand) in March 2015. It will prescribe what information may be communicated to the Australian Taxation Office and who may receive the information. An amendment to the Tax Administration Act 1994 will create an additional exception to taxation secrecy provisio ns to allow the two organisations to communicate this information in accordance with the Arrangement. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Proposed new section 209A sets out the purpose of the exchange of information, which is to facilitate the exchange of information between Inland Revenue and the Australian Taxation Office in order to verify contact details of New Zealand student loan borrowers who are, or may be, overseas-based so the student loan scheme can be administered in relation to those borrowers. It limits who in the Australian Taxation Office is authorised to receive the information from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The information that may be provided by the Commissioner is prescribed and must be relevant for the purposes. The requirement in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for officers to maintain secrecy will be amended by providing a new exception in section 81(4)(gbb) of the Tax Administration Act. Background One of the keys to collecting overdue student loan repayments is holding up-to-date contact details for defaulters. Not having contact details makes engaging with overseas-based borrowers, many of whom are believed to be living in Australia, difficult. 4 The proposed information exchange would allow Inland Revenue to receive up-to- date contact details for New Zealand student loan borrowers residing in Australia through matching borrower details against the Australian Taxation Office database of Australian taxpayers. Inland Revenue would then be able contact those individuals to keep them engaged with their loan obligations and, where appropriate, recover outstanding student loan repayment amounts. 5 APPROVAL OF CHARITABLE ORGANISATIONS (Clauses 4, 7, 22, 23, 27, 29, 32, 33 and 40) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes to delegate to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue authority to approve charitable organisations for the purposes of the student loan scheme. When student loan borrowers are volunteering overseas or working for a charitable organisation for a token payment they may apply to be treated as New Zealand-based and eligible for write-off of interest on their student loans. However, the charitable organisation must itself be approved for the purposes of the scheme. Delegation for that approval currently sits with the Governor-General, acting on the advice of Cabinet. Delegating approval authority to the Commissioner will speed up the approval process so that students will have more timely access to the interest write- off. To improve the integrity of the list, the Commissioner will also be able to remove an organisation from it, if the organisation no longer meets the criteria for listing. If that happens, a borrower who has already been approved as eligible for interest write -off will remain eligible until the end date of the period for which the borrower’s status had been approved, or until they cease volunteering for that organisation, whichever happens first. The Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011 will be consequentially revoked. The list of approved organisations will continue be published on the Inland Revenue website, but this will now be a legal requirement. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Proposed new rules will specify what is required for a charity to be listed for student loan purposes, relying on existing requirements in the Charities Act 2005 and the Income Tax Act 2007. The Commissioner will be required to maintain and publish a charities list for these purposes and will have the power to de-list organisations that no longer meet the requirements. When the Commissioner de-lists an organisation, student loan borrowers who have already been approved for interest write-off will remain eligible until they complete their volunteering assignment or reach the end of the 24-month approval period, whichever is earlier. 6 Background Under current law, charitable organisations must be approved by Cabinet for the purposes of the student loan scheme interest write-off and listed in regulations. The student loan borrower’s status of being treated as physically present in New Zealand and therefore eligible for interest write-off cannot commence earlier than the date on which the organisation is listed in the regulations. However, the approval process, which currently requires Cabinet approval and the making of regulations, is slow, so that some borrowers do not have access to the interest write-off because the organisation is not approved and listed in the regulat ions before the borrower’s volunteer term is completed. Detailed analysis The definit io n o f “charity” in section 4 of the Student Loan Scheme Act is proposed to be amended to remove the reference to the regulations, which will be revoked. Proposed new section 27A will require the Commissioner to keep and publish a list of charities that have been approved. The list must include the date from which each charity’s listing applies and the date of de-listing, if applicable. Proposed new section 27B will prescribe the primary matters with which the Commissioner must be satisfied before listing a charity. The criteria rely on the definit ion o f “tax charity” in the Income Tax Act 2007 for the purposes of eligibility for exemption from income tax and the essential requirements for registration under the Charities Act 2005. Supplementary criteria will be set out in guidelines for the exercise of the Commissioner’s discretion. The application requirements are set out in proposed new section 27C, allowing the Commissioner to seek more information if necessary and to list those charities that qualify under section 27B. The Commissioner will also be required to give an applicant prior advice of her intention to refuse a listing, with reasons, and allow the organisation time to rectify any deficiencies in their application. Applicants will be required to be notified of the final Commissioner’s decisio n. Under proposed section 27D the Commissioner will be able to list a charity even if no application has been made under section 27C. This is likely to occur when a borrower applies to be treated as being physically present in New Zealand while volunteering, but the organisation, although on the Charities Register or approved as a tax charity, has not yet been listed for student loan scheme purposes. Proposed section 27E will allow the Commissioner to remove a charit y fro m the list if she determines that the charity no longer meets the criteria for listing. The Commissioner will be required to give a charity prior advice of her intention to de-list, with reasons, allow the organisation time to make any arguments against the proposed decision and consider any such arguments before making and notifying the charity of the final decision. 7 The proposed amendments to section 173 remove a decision made by the Commissioner to refuse to list a charity or remove a charity from the list, from the process for disputing assessments under Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Instead the decision can be challenged by the charity under new section 176A, which will bring the challenge under part 8A of the Tax Administration Act. Transitional provisions in clause 20, part 4 of schedule 6 will provide for charities already listed in the regulations to continue to be treated as qualifying charities and will require the Commissioner to include them in the list referred to in section 27A. Proposed section 32 in part 2 will consequentially revoke the Student Loan Scheme (Charitable Organisations) Regulations 2011. 8 TREATMENT OF OVER-RECOVERED ADDITIONAL DEDUCTIONS (Clauses 8 and 9) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments will align the treatment of over-recovered additional deductions of student loan repayments with the treatment specified for over-recovery of standard deductions made for student loan repayments. This will simplify administration by having one standard process. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed new sections set out the procedure to be followed when addit io nal deductions have continued beyond what is required to fully recover the previous shortfall in student loan repayments. The proposed replacement of the cross-heading above current section 63 will clarify that the section applies only to standard deductions. Proposed new section 68A defines what is a Commissioner over-deduction and sets out what a borrower can do when the borrower believes there has been an over- deduction of additional deductions. The requirement for the Commissioner to respond is set out in proposed section 68B. Under proposed section 68C, when the Commissioner identifies or determines that an over-deduction has been made, she will be required to notify the borrower of the amount of the over-deduction, that it has been offset against a borrower’s consolidated loan balance, and give the borrower the option of requesting a refund of the over- deducted amount within a specified timeframe. The time limit on requests for refunds will be six months from the date of notification. If, however, another shortfall in repayment obligations is concurrently identified, the over-recovered amount will be offset against that shortfall. Background The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is able to require a New-Zealand-based student loan borrower’s employer to make additional deductions from the borrower’s wages or salary to meet a previous shortfall in repayment obligations. In doing so, the Commissioner advises the employer of the total additional amount to be deducted. However, sometimes employers continue the additional deductions beyond the amount necessary to fully recover the shortfall. Although the Student Loan Scheme 9 Act prescribes what the Commissioner must do when there is an over-deduction of standard deductions, it does not include an over-recovery of additional deductions. 10 APPLICATION OF REPAYMENT THRESHOLDS FOR OVERSEAS- BASED BORROWERS (Clause 32) Summary of proposed amendment A transitional provision will make it explicit that the repayment thresholds for overseas-based borrowers introduced in 2014 apply to income tax years beginning on 1 April 2014 and later, as was intended. Application date The amendment applies to income tax years starting on 1 April 2014. Key features A “savings” provision in proposed clause 18 in part 3 of schedule 6 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 ensures that previous amendments to repayment obligations of overseas-based borrowers do not apply to tax years that commenced before 1 April 2014. Instead, the previous repayment obligations apply to those years. Background New repayment thresholds for overseas-based borrowers introduced in the Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 2014 were intended to apply for the tax years commencing on and after 1 April 2014, but that was not made explicit in the legislation. The effect was that the new rules could be applied to the assessment of repayment obligations for tax years prior to 1 April 2014, when the actual assessment is carried out after 1 April 2014. 11 NOTIFYING “ADJUSTED NET INCOME” (Clauses 4, 5, 10 to 21, 24, 25, 31 and 32) Summary of proposed amendment Provisions for prescribed adjustments to net income were introduced to the student loan scheme in 2013 to ensure a borrower’s repayment obligations more accurately reflected their ability to repay that loan. The proposed amendment will require all borrowers to notify Inland Revenue if they have income of the type specified in schedule 3 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 for adjustments to be made to their inco me. These types of income are generally not subject to income tax. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features New definitions of “adjusted net income”, “schedule 3 adjustments” and “statement of adjusted net income” will support the proposed changes that will require all borrowers with the relevant types of income to provide the necessary details. A number of consequential amendments are also proposed, to reflect the new terminology. The proposed replacement of section 73 introduces new defined terms to clarify that adjusted net income is made up of net income as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 and any adjustments provided for in schedule 3 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. A borrower may fulfil requirements to make a statement of adjusted net income by filing a return of income only, notifying schedule 3 adjustments only, if they are not required to file a return of income, or filing a return of income and notifying schedule 3 adjustments. Proposed replacement section 74 sets out when the section applies to New Zealand- based borrowers and the timing of required notification of schedule 3 adjustments. Sections 75, 76, 79, 82 and 83 are to be amended to reflect the new terminology. New section 114 deals with the notification of schedule 3 adjustments by New Zealand-based non-resident borrowers, similar to the requirements under section 74. Sections 114A, 146A, 155, 156, 185, and clauses 1(f) and 2(c) in schedule 4 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 are also amended to reflect the new terminology. 12 Background The provisions introduced in 2013 require only borrowers who are not required to file a return of income for income tax purposes to make a declaration of their adjusted net income. However, the use of the term “declaration” places an unreasonable burden on borrowers to meet the requirements of the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957, including having the form witnessed by a person specified in section 9 of that Act. In addition, the nature of adjusted net income amounts means that they are not required to be included in income tax returns. Borrowers who file income tax returns are effectively excluded from the requirements to provide details of their adjusted net income. 13 MAIN INCOME EQUALISATION SCHEME INCOME (Clauses 4 and 30) Summary of proposed amendments The proposed amendments will ensure that refunds of main income equalisation scheme deposits made by an associated entity of a borrower are not included in the income of the borrower, to the extent of the borrower’s interest in the associated entity. However, any interest earned on those deposits that is refunded will be included in the adjusted net income of the borrower in the same proportion as the borrower’s interest in the entity. Similarly, adjustments to net income to reflect deposits by associated entities of a borrower are to be further adjusted so that they are proportional to the borrower’s interest in the entity. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Proposed amendments to schedule 3 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011, which sets out the required adjustments to net income, will ensure that when a deposit has been made into, or a refund received from, a main income equalisation account by an associated entity of a borrower, the adjustments will affect the adjusted net income of the borrower only to the extent of the borrower’s interest in that associated entity. Proposed replacement clause 7 of schedule 3 and new clause 7A will apply only to deposits into or refunds from main income equalisation accounts made by a borrower. However, new clauses 8 and 11 will apply respectively when a borrower is a major shareholder in a close company or is the settlor of a trust. These clauses set out the calculations to be used to ensure that the adjustments to the borrower’s net adjusted income accurately reflect the extent of the borrower’s interest in the associated ent it ies. Background The main income equalisation scheme allows taxpayers carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business to smooth their incomes for income tax purposes to deal with large fluctuations in income over several years. A deposit to a main income equalisation scheme is allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes. However, the effect of allowing the deposit as a deduction is to reduce the borrower’s income for student loan purposes when that income would have been available to the borrower to contribute to loan repayments. An adjustment is necessary to net income to add back 14 the deduction for student loan purposes. The treatment extends to deposits made by the borrower or associated entities, such as companies or trusts. To prevent double counting, refunds from the accounts (excluding interest earned on deposits) are not counted for student loan purposes when they are received. However, the current provisions relating to refunds do not extend to refunds to associated entities (companies or trusts) of the borrower, with the risk that the associated entit ies’ refunds would be counted in a borrower’s income for a second time. In addition, the adding back of deductions for deposits made by associated entities is not currently required to be adjusted in proportion to the borrower’s interest in the entity. The proposed amendment will ensure that the borrower’s net adjusted income accurately reflects the extent of the borrower’s interest in the associated entity. 15 RETENTION OF ADJUSTED NET INCOME RECORDS (Clause 70) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendments will make student loan borrowers who have adjusted net income subject to the record-retention requirements of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and explicitly subject to the obligations set out in that Act relating to retention and disclosure of information. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Section 15B of the Tax Administration Act sets out a taxpayer’s obligations. To ensure that there is no doubt that student loan borrowers are subject to these obligations, where appropriate, section 15B is being added to the list in section 202 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 of provisions of the Tax Administration Act and Income Tax Act 2007 that apply to the Student Loan Scheme Act. Section 22 of the Tax Administration Act requires taxpayers to keep business and other records. Student loan borrowers with adjusted net income will become subject to these requirements through the addition of proposed paragraphs 22(2)(fc) and 22(2)(n). Background Borrowers with income for which they are required to file annual tax returns are automatically subject to the requirements for retention of records in the Tax Administration Act 1994. However, with the introduction of the adjusted net income provisions in 2013, borrowers should also have been required to retain records of the adjustments to their net income. This is necessary to allow Inland Revenue to review source records to ensure the correctness of assessments, either as a result of borrowers exercising their dispute or challenge rights, or through its own audit activities. 16 CANCELLATION OF LOAN CONTRACTS (Clause 6) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment will allow a person to cancel their loan contract in writing or by electronic means. Application date The amendment is deemed to have come into force on 1 January 2012, when the current provision came into force, to ensure that borrowers who have already had their cancellations accepted by electronic means are not inadvertently in breach of the law. Key features The proposed amendment to section 15 will change the requirement for cancellation of a loan contract from “formally notify” to “notify in writing”. The latter term is already defined for the purposes of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 and allows communication by electronic means, subject to compliance with relevant provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. Background Before January 2012, cancellation of loan contracts by electronic means was acceptable in accordance with the terms of the contract. However, an earlier amendment to the Act imposed a requirement of cancellation by formal notification, which, in accordance with the definition of that term, excludes notification by electronic means. Following advice of their entitlement to a student loan, a student has seven days in which to give notice of their intention to cancel the contract. It is therefore more efficient, and in accordance with the Ministry of Social Development’s current procedures, to accept cancellation by electronic means. In addition, the 2012 change was one of a number intended to ensure consistency wit h the spirit and intent of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act 2003, even though that Act allows cancellation of contracts by giving written notice, including in electronic form. 17 18 Residential land withholding tax 19 20 OVERVIEW The bill proposes a new withholding tax – residential land withholding tax (RLWT) on sales of residential property made by “offshore persons” within two years of acquisit ion. The new measure is primarily intended to support the “bright-line test” announced by the Government in Budget 2015 as part of a package of proposals to improve compliance with the residential investment property tax rules. The bright-line test requires income tax to be paid on any gains from the sale of residential property bought and sold within two years, with some exceptions. At the same time the Government announced its intention to investigate a wit hho lding tax to improve compliance with the proposed bright-line test. Proposals for the RLWT were consulted on in an officials’ issues paper, Residential land withholding tax, released in August 2015. Feedback from that consultation has helped shape the RLWT measures proposed in this bill. As the RLWT will be a collection mechanism for the proposed bright-line test, the proposed RLWT follows as closely as possible the concepts used in the bright-line test. RLWT will apply when: • the property being sold is “residential land” located in New Zealand and defined for the purposes of the bright-line test as introduced in the Taxation (Bright-line Test for Residential Land) Bill; • the vendor (seller) acquired the property on or after 1 October 2015 and has owned the property for less than two years before disposing of it (the two-year holding period used in the bright-line test); and • the vendor (seller) is an “offshore person”. An “offshore person” includes all non-New Zealand citizens and non-permanent residents. It also includes a New Zealand citizen who is living overseas, if they have been overseas for the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa may be an offshore person if are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. New Zealand trusts and companies may also be “offshore persons” if there are significant offshore interests in them. No exception for the vendor’s main home will be available for the purposes of the RLWT. This is because RLWT will only apply to offshore persons, so it is unlikely that the property being sold is an offshore person’s main home. However, there will be an exemption from RLWT for transfers upon death, and for transfers made in relation to a property relationship agreement, as in the bright-line test. The obligation to pay RLWT will primarily be the vendor’s conveyancing agent. A conveyancing agent provides conveyancing services as defined in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006. If the vendor does not have a conveyancing agent, the obligation to pay RLWT will be on the purchaser’s conveyancing agent. In the 21 absence of either, the obligation to pay RLWT will be on the purchaser themselves. If the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser will be the person who is primarily liable for the payment of RLWT. The amount of RLWT required to be withheld will be the lower of: • 33% (or 28% if the vendor is a company) x (current purchase price – vendor’s acquisition cost); and • 10% x the current purchase price. RLWT will be paid before other disbursements are made at the time of settlement. If the vendor’s conveyancing agent is required to pay RLWT, this will be paid after the amount required to discharge the vendor’s mortgage obligation with a New Zealand- registered bank or non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. If this would result in insufficient funds being available to pay RLWT, the amount of RLWT payable will be restricted to the difference between the current purchase price and the amount required to discharge the New Zealand mortgage. The person required to withhold must pay the required amount to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. The proposed RLWT is not a final withholding tax. The vendor will be able to claim a tax credit for the amount of RLWT withheld and paid to the Commissioner against their final income tax liability in relation to the sale of the residential property. In some cases, this may result in a tax refund. The proposed RLWT will come into force on 1 July 2016. 22 NEW TAX TYPE: RESIDENTIAL LAND WITHHOLDING TAX (Clauses 35, 36, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 72 and 73) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes a new refundable and creditable tax called residential land withholding tax (RLWT). Key features New section RA 6C of the Income Tax Act 2007 provides that a person required to pay RLWT under new section RL 2 and a person required to withhold and pay RLWT under new section RL 3, must pay RLWT to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by the due date. The RLWT rules are set out in new subpart RL. RLWT will apply to certain disposals of residential property. RLWT will be, in effect, a new type of withholding tax. It will only be a true withholding tax if the vendor and purchaser are associated persons. This situation is specified in new sections BE 1(6) and RL 3. In other cases, the person required to pay RLWT on behalf of the vendor (the paying agent) will be able to retain the amount of RLWT from the purchase price to be paid to the vendor, similar to a withholding tax, but RLWT will instead be listed in section BF 1 (and in section YA 1 as an ancillary tax). The ability to retain an amount of RLWT from the purchase price is provided for in new section RL 2(7). This distinction is necessary because, in general, the RLWT paying agent will not be liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. The exception to this general rule is when the vendor and purchaser are associated persons. In this case, the purchaser may be liable for the underlying amount of RLWT. The section titled “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)” provides further discussion on this issue. When the obligation arises The obligation to retain/withhold and pay RLWT is intended to arise upon settlement when, in most cases, the bulk of the purchase price will be paid by the purchaser to the vendor via a conveyancing agent. At this point the RLWT paying or withholding agent should retain or withhold RLWT from the funds being paid. Further information about who will be the paying agent or withholding agent can be found in the section titled “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)”. New section RL 1 provides that in general, the obligation to pay RLWT will arise if there is a “residential land purchase amount” and the conditions for withholding are satisfied. The section titled “When RLWT applies” discusses when RLWT will apply. 23 The definition of “residential land purchase amount” proposed in section YA 1 means an amount paid or payable for the disposal of the residential land in question, but excludes deposits and part-payments as long as all deposits and part-payments total in aggregate less than 50 percent of the purchase price for the land. This rolling aggregate is to ensure that part-payments are not used to circumvent the application o f the RLWT. Example Elizabeth agrees to sell her house to Rebecca for $500,000. The contract requires Rebecca to pay a 10 percent deposit of $50,000, with the remaining $450,000 to be paid upon settlement. The $50,000 deposit is not a residential land purchase amount, but the $450,000 paid upon settlement is a residential land purchase amount. Due dates for RLWT to be paid to the Commissioner Once the obligation for RLWT has arisen and the appropriate amount of RLWT has been withheld or retained from a residential land purchase amount, new section RL 5 and an amendment to section RA 15 provide that the standard due dates for interim and other tax payments made on a monthly basis will apply. The due date is specified in section RA 15(2) as being the 20 th day of the following month. This will provide for the “batching” of various RLWT amounts, which may be preferable for a paying or withholding agent who handles a number of RLWT transactions in a month. Paying or withholding agents will also be allowed to pay RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on a transaction-by-transaction basis before the due date stipulated in section RA 15. The transaction-by-transaction approach may be preferred by conveyancing agents who handle RLWT transactions on occasion, and by vendors who want to square up the amount of RLWT paid with their income tax liability in relation to the disposal of the residential land fairly soon after its disposal. Example Susanna is a conveyancer and retains RLWT from four transactions during the month of March. Susanna pays the retained RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on the stated due date, 20 April. Example Bill is a conveyancer who normally pays RLWT amounts to the Commissioner on the 20 th of the following month. However, for a particular transaction, Bill agrees with his client to pay the amount RLWT to the Commissioner immediately. 24 Example Scott is a solicitor who only occasionally handles RLWT transactions and prefers not to hold onto the retained funds. Scott retains RLWT from a residential land payment amount on 1 August. He is not required to pay this amount to the Commissioner until 20 September, but chooses to pay the RLWT amount to the Commissioner the following week. Tax credit for RLWT paid Under a proposed amendment to section LA 6 and new section LB 6B, a person will have a tax credit for a tax year equal to the amount of RLWT paid in relation to residential land they have disposed of. It is expected that a credit under new section LB 6B will be used primarily to offset the person’s income tax liability from the disposal of residential property. To the extent that the amount of RLWT paid exceeds their income tax liability in relation to the disposal of the residential property, a proposed amendment to section LA 6 provides that the RLWT credit can be used to satisfy the person’s other income tax liabilities. If the person has no other income tax liabilities, the excess RLWT may be refunded. Example Patrick sold his residential property and $40,000 of RLWT was withheld from the settlement amount. Patrick’s income tax liability in relation to the disposal is only $35,000. Patrick has no other tax liabilities. Inland Revenue issues a refund to Patrick of $5,000. A person will be able to file an interim income tax return before the end of an income year, returning their taxable income arising from the disposal of residential land, in order to obtain a refund of excess RLWT. This return will not be considered final until the end of the income year. RLWT will need to be paid to the Commissioner before a refund will be issued as part of an interim income tax return. There is the possibility that a person’s tax liability in relation to the disposal of residential land will arise in one tax year, but the RLWT will not be collected until the following tax year due to the timing of a property settlement. The proposed addition of RLWT to section LA 6 ensures that a person’s RLWT credit may be used for earlier tax years. RLWT must be paid before other disbursements RLWT must be paid before other disbursements made as part of the settlement process – for example, mortgages. This is so RLWT cannot be easily circumvented by gearing up before disposal of the residential property. 25 Sometimes, the payment of RLWT before other disbursements may leave insufficient funds for the vendor’s mortgage obligation to be discharged. New section RL 4(6) provides that the amount of RLWT payable by the vendor’s conveyancing agent will be reduced to the extent required to discharge a mortgage obligation held with a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013. Further information can be found in the sections titled “Calculating RLWT” and “Person required to pay RLWT (the paying agent and the withholding agent)”. Officials will monitor the situation to ensure that this provision is not used to undermine the integrity of the RLWT and the broader tax system. Non-fulfilment of RLWT obligations This is discussed in further detail in the section titled “When RLWT obligations are not met”. 26 WHEN RLWT APPLIES (Clauses 44 and 45) Summary of proposed amendment For RLWT to apply to a particular disposal, three conditions must be met. The first is that it must be a disposal of residential land located in New Zealand. The second is that the disposal is or would be treated as income of the vendor under the bright-line test, ignoring the “main home” exception. The third condition is that the vendor must be an offshore person. Key features Residential land in New Zealand New section RL 1(2) provides that RLWT will only apply to residential land located in New Zealand. This restriction is necessary otherwise RLWT could apply to disposals of property situated overseas where the transaction has no link to New Zealand. The meaning of “residential land” follows the definition used for the bright-line test, and is: • land that has a dwelling on it; • land for which the owner has an arrangement that relates to erecting a dwelling; • bare land that may be used for erecting a dwelling under the rules in the relevant operative district plan; • but does not include land that is farmland or used predominantly as business premises. Further information on the meaning of “residential land” will be provided in Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletin on the bright-line test legislation. Bright-line income The second requirement is that the residential land purchase amount must be or would be treated as income for the vendor under the bright-line test, ignoring the “main home” exception. This is provided for in new section RL 1(2)(a). Proposed section RL 1(2)(a) refers specifically to new sections CB 6A and CB 16A, which provide for the bright-line test and the main home exception. This is because the RLWT is designed to be a collection mechanism for the bright-line test. Note that this reference to “income” under the bright-line test means that there will not need to be a land title transfer for an RLWT obligation to arise; there will only need to be a residential land purchase amount. This means that off-the-plan sales, for example, will be subject to RLWT if other conditions are also met. 27 A disposal of New Zealand residential land will therefore be subject to RLWT if the vendor acquires the residential land on or after 1 October 2015 and disposes of it within two years of acquisition. Further information on how to calculate the two-year period will be provided in the Tax Information Bulletin on the bright-line test legislation, but in most cases the holding period will begin on the date the person’s title to the residential land is registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952, and will end on the date that the person enters into the agreement for the disposal of the residential land. The bright-line test contains an exception, if the residential land being disposed of is the vendor’s main home. The exception is not available for the purposes of the RLWT as it will only apply to offshore persons, and it is unlikely that the property being sold would be an offshore person’s main home. However, there will be an exemption or rollover relief from RLWT for inherited property and for transfers of relationship property, as provided under the bright-line test. This is achieved under section RL 1(2)(a), which refers to an amount that is, or would be “income” under section CB 6A but for the main home exception in section CB 16A. A disposal of New Zealand residential land that is income for the vendor under both section CB 6A and another provision of the Income Tax Act 2007 (for example, the intention test) will be subject to RLWT. Offshore persons Under new section RL 1(2)(b), the vendor must be an “offshore person” for RLWT to apply. “Offshore person” is defined in section YA 1 and covers both individuals and non-individuals, such as companies or trusts. Individuals An individual will be an “offshore person” if they are not a New Zealand citizen and do not hold a New Zealand residence class visa as defined in the Immigration Act 2009. A residence class visa is a resident visa and or a permanent resident visa. Example Mary is an investor in residential property. She sells a piece of residential land located in Auckland to Jim. Mary is in New Zealand at the time of the sale, but she is not a New Zealand citizen and does not hold a residence class visa granted under the Immigration Act 2009. Mary is an “offshore person”. A New Zealand citizen will nevertheless be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last three years. A holder of a New Zealand residence class visa will be an offshore person if they are outside New Zealand and have not been in New Zealand within the last 12 months. 28 Example Tane is a New Zealand citizen and is relocated overseas with his job. Eighteen months after moving overseas, he sells his residential property. Tane has not been back in New Zealand since relocating. Tane is not an offshore person at the time of the sale. In most cases it is likely that a New Zealand citizen or holder of a residence class visa who is selling their property within two years could satisfy the proof requirement by meeting with their New Zealand conveyancing agent in person and showing them their passport. The conveyancing agent would be able to copy the documentation and record that they have seen the person in New Zealand. As the vendor is currently in New Zealand, this means they would not be “an offshore” person. If an individual is selling their property from outside New Zealand, a certified statement or other suitable proof from the vendor that they are not an offshore person should be provided to their conveyancing agent. This could include evidence of flights to New Zealand within the relevant timeframe. The withholding tax will apply when two or more individuals jointly own a property, and at least one of them is an offshore person. This will help to ensure the integrity of the RLWT rules. Further information can be found in the section titled “Information requirements”. Non-individuals (including companies) A non-natural person will be considered to be an offshore person if any of the following condit io ns are met: • it is incorporated outside New Zealand • it is registered outside New Zealand • it is const ituted under foreign law • it has a member that is an offshore person • it has an executive or director that is an offshore person • it is a company and 25 percent or more of the company’s shareholder decision- making rights are held directly or indirectly by offshore persons. Accordingly, for a company (including a unit trust) to qualify for the non-offshore exempt ion, the fo llowing condit ions must all be met: • the company is registered in New Zealand; and • all directors of the company are non-offshore individuals; and • no more than 25 percent of the shareholder decision-making rights of the company are held by offshore persons. 29 This could be satisfied, for example, by proof such as: • a copy of the company’s New Zealand registration; and • a copy of each director’s New Zealand passport or residence class visa sighted during a meeting with the conveyancing agent; and • a statement from each director that, to their knowledge, no more than 25 percent of the shareholder decision-making rights of the company are held by offshore persons. Further information can be found in the section titled “Information requirements”. A partnership will be an “offshore person” for the purpose of the RLWT rules if at least one of the partners is an offshore person. A discretionary trust will be considered an offshore person if any of the trustees is an offshore person. A discretionary trust will also be considered an offshore person if any settlor of the trust is an offshore person. This is to prevent the situation of a trust with an offshore settlor and resident trustees selling the property (without being subject to a withholding tax), with the settlor then replacing resident trustees with trustees who are offshore persons and beyond the reach of Inland Revenue. This requirement is consistent with the settlor focus in New Zealand’s income tax rules. In addit io n, the trustees of a discretionary trust have the ability to shift the tax liability to one of the beneficiaries by distributing the income to the beneficiary and treating it as beneficiary income. To ensure that the gain does not escape tax by being transferred to an offshore beneficiary, a trust will be an offshore person if: • all natural person beneficiaries and all natural person discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are offshore persons; • all beneficiaries and discretionary beneficiaries of the trust are offshore persons; or • one or more of the beneficiaries are offshore persons, and the offshore beneficiary received a distribution from the trust within the last six years of a relevant disposal of residential land. The definition of “offshore person” for the purposes of the RLWT rules has been designed so that it will not normally apply to properties held in ordinary family trusts where some of the beneficiaries may be New Zealand citizens but now reside overseas. 30 Example Debbie and Greg are the settlors and trustees of a family trust. They are both New Zealand citizens and live in New Zealand. Dan and Natalie are discretionary beneficiaries of the trust and are also New Zealand citizens. Dan lives in New Zealand, but Natalie has lived in Australia for the past five years and has not been back to New Zealand. Debbie and Greg as trustees of the trust are not offshore persons, because they themselves are not offshore persons and, of the two beneficiaries, only Natalie is an offshore person. To prevent a trust being set up in which all beneficiaries are foreign investors who are natural persons, with a New Zealand charity appointed as a discretionary beneficiary simply to avoid being classed as an “offshore person”, the definition of “offshore person” includes the situation where all natural person beneficiaries and natural person discretionary beneficiaries are treated as “offshore persons”. Example Matilda and Madeline are natural persons who are also offshore persons. They are the only individual beneficiaries of a trust. A New Zealand charity is appointed as a discretionary beneficiary of the trust. The settlor and trustees of the trust are not offshore persons. The trustees are treated as offshore persons for the purposes of the RLWT rules, because all natural person (individual) beneficiaries of the trust (Matilda and Madeline) are offshore persons. A corporate trustee will be able to qualify for the non-offshore exemption if it meets both the company and trust criteria above. 31 PERSON REQUIRED TO PAY RLWT (THE PAYING AGENT AND THE WITHHOLDING AGENT) (Clauses 35, 36, 41, 44 and 45) Summary of proposed amendment The vendor’s conveyancing agent will be the paying agent for RLWT purposes, and will be required to fulfil the vendor’s RLWT obligations. If the vendor does not have a conveyancing agent, the purchaser’s conveyancing agent will be the paying agent. If neither the vendor nor purchaser has a conveyancing agent, the purchaser will be the paying agent. If the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser must withhold the RLWT. Key features The concept of a conveyancing agent will be incorporated into the Income Tax Act 2007 through a proposed definition of “conveyancer”. The proposed definition of “conveyancer” in section YA 1 means a lawyer, incorporated law firm, conveyancing practitioner, or incorporated conveyancing firm that provides conveyancing services, as that term is used in the Lawyers and Conveyancers Act 2006, using a New Zealand-based trust account. Under new section RL 2 the vendor is liable to pay an amount of RLWT, but the vendor’s conveyancer is treated as the agent of the vendor’s agent in relation to RLWT and must make assessments, provide returns and satisfy the vendor’s liability. That is, the vendor’s conveyancer is the “paying agent” in relation to RLWT. If neither the vendor nor purchaser has a conveyancer as defined, the paying agent for RLWT will be the purchaser, as described in part (b) of the proposed definition of “conveyancer” in section YA 1. What it means to be a paying agent or withholding agent is discussed in the section tit led “New tax type: residential land withholding tax”. Associated persons Under new section RL 3, if the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the vendor is not liable to pay RLWT. Instead, the purchaser must withhold the requisite amount of RLWT in a separate bank account, segregated from other money, for the benefit of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. In this case, the purchaser will have a withholding tax obligation under section BE 1 and the standard requirements for other withholding taxes will apply. The purchaser will not be precluded from using the services of a conveyancer to fulfil their RLWT obligat ions. 32 Not the vendor’s agent for other purposes While the paying agent is considered to be the vendor’s agent for the purposes of RLWT, new section RL 2(3) ensures that the paying agent will not be considered the vendor’s agent more generally, just because of their role as the RLWT paying agent. New section RL 2(4) ensures that a paying agent who is only the vendor’s agent in relation to RLWT will not be subject to sections HD 2 to 4, which relate to agents. No liability for underlying RLWT New section RL 2(5) provides that a paying agent will not be jointly and severally liable in relation to the vendor’s RLWT debt, despite their obligation to satisfy the vendor’s RLWT liability. They may, however, be liable for the RLWT debt, if they have retained the RLWT amount from a residential land payment amount and have failed to pay the retained RLWT to the Commissioner. New section RL 2(6) provides that the rules relating to penalties as set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply. Cost recovery by paying agent While it is not included in the bill, a paying agent is not precluded from recovering the costs incurred in satisfying the vendor’s RLWT obligations. 33 CALCULATING RLWT (Clauses 44 and 45) Summary of proposed amendment There are two main calculation methods for RLWT, with the amount of RLWT payable being the lesser of the amounts calculated under these methods. A third method is available, where the paying agent is the vendor’s conveyancer and the amount of RLWT would exceed the amount available from the total purchase price once a mortgage obligation with a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker has been discharged. Key features New section RL 4 provides that the amount of RLWT to be paid will be the lesser of: • 33% (or 28% if the vendor is a company that is not acting as a trustee) x (current purchase price – vendor’s acquisition cost) (set out in proposed section RL 4(2)); and • 10% x current purchase price (set out in proposed section RL 4(4)). New section RL 4(3)(b) defines “current purchase price” as the price agreed by the vendor and purchaser for the disposal of the residential land that the residential land purchase amount relates to. This figure includes deposits and part-payments. New section RL 4(3)(c) defines the “vendor’s acquisition cost” as being the purchase price paid by the vendor for their acquisition of the residential land being disposed of. It is expected that the vendor’s acquisition cost will generally be available from Quotable Value. Example Virginia agrees to sell her residential property in Tauranga to Thomas. Thomas pays a $100,000 deposit and another $400,000 upon settlement. In determining Virginia’s RLWT liability, the “current purchase price” is $500,000. Virginia originally acquired the residential property for $350,000. The “vendor’s acquisition cost” for the purposes of determining Virginia’s RLWT liability is $350,000. RLWT calculated using the formula in section RL 4(2) is 33% x ($500,000 – $350,000), or $49,500. RLWT calculated using the formula in section RL 4(4) is 10% x $500,000, or $50,000. Therefore the amount of RLWT payable is $49,500. When RLWT exceeds the funds available following discharge of mortgage obligations To maintain the integrity of the RLWT and the broader tax system, RLWT will generally be paid before other disbursements. 34 A vendor may have a mortgage secured over the residential land being disposed of. The mortgagee may require the vendor’s mortgage obligation to be discharged before the title to the residential land can be released. In most cases this should not be a problem, due to the vendor’s gain approach used in new section RL 4(2), but in some situations, the amount of RLWT payable calculated using the two methods outlined above may result in insufficient funds to discharge the vendor’s mortgage. A third calculation method will be available when the vendor’s conveyancer is the paying agent and the amount of RLWT payable will be the lesser of the amounts calculated using the methods set out in proposed sections RL 4(2), RL 4(4), and RL 4(6). The amount of RLWT payable using the method in new section RL 4(6) is the current purchase price less the “security discharge amount”. The security discharge amount is defined in section RL 4(7) and (8) and will be the total amount required by a New Zealand-registered bank or non-bank deposit taker (as licensed under the Non-bank Deposit Takers Act 2013) to discharge their mortgages or other securities over the residential land. Officials will monitor the situation to ensure that this provision is not used to undermine the integrity of the RLWT and the broader tax system. It is expected that the vendor’s conveyancer will be the paying agent in the majorit y of transactions. However, when the paying or withholding agent is the purchaser’s conveyancer or the purchaser themselves, this third calculation method will not be available. This is consistent with other withholding tax rules. Example Consider the previous example of Virginia and Thomas. Recall that the RLWT payable using the methods set out in section RL 4(2) and (4) will be $49,500. Virginia has a mortgage with a New Zealand bank for $460,000. The New Zealand bank requires the full $460,000 to be discharged upon settlement. This would not be possible, because after RLWT has been retained by the paying or withholding agent, only $450,500 will remain from the current purchase price. Virginia’s conveyancer is the paying agent for the purposes of RLWT. This, combined with the fact that Virginia’s mortgage is with a New Zealand bank means that the third method in proposed section RL 4(6) will be available. The amount of RLWT payable will be $40,000 ($500,000 – $460,000). 35 INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS (Clauses 44, 45 and 72) Summary of proposed amendment New section RL 1(4) of the Income tax Act 2007 and new sections 54B and 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 set out the information requirement in relation to RLWT obligations. Key features Information to be provided by vendors to paying and withholding agents New section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 sets out the information that vendors will be required to provide to their paying or withholding agent so that the agent will be able to fulfil any RLWT obligations. The information requirements in section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will only apply if the vendor is within the two-year bright-line test. An amendment is proposed to the definition of “bright-line date” in section YA 1, so that the calculat io n of the two-year period for the purposes of RLWT will be the same as the bright-line test. The bright-line date is defined in new section CB 6A. The calculation of the two-year period in new section 54C(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be almost identical to proposed section CB 6A(1) in the bright-line test. The only exception will be that section CB 6A(1)(a)(ii) will not be required in the context of RLWT, as it relates to land outside New Zealand. In most cases, the start-date of the two-year period will be the date on which the instrument to transfer the land to the person was registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952. This information will be readily available on Landonline to conveyancers, and on Quotable Value’s website. The end-date will, in most cases, be the date on which the person enters into an agreement for the disposal of the residential land. This date will be available to both the vendor’s and purchaser’s conveyancers. As a result, the paying or withholding agent should, in most situations, be able to determine, with little involvement from the vendor, whether the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period. If the paying or withholding agent determines that the vendor is outside the two-year bright-line period, RLWT will not apply and the vendor will not need to provide any further information to the paying or withholding agent. If the paying or withholding agent determines that the vendor is within the two-year bright-line period, new section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will require the vendor to give information in relation to the RLWT in the form prescribed by the 36 Commissioner of Inland Revenue. New section 54C(4) will require vendors to provide at the very least their full name, address, IRD number, and whether or not they are an offshore person. If they are an offshore person, the vendor must also state whether they are associated with the purchaser and whether their disposal of the residential land is or would be considered “income” under the bright-line test, ignoring the bright-line test’s main home exception. New section 54C(3) provides that a vendor’s statement will need to be accompanied by certified copies of relevant and appropriate documents. The Commissioner will prescribe what documents will be acceptable in supporting the person’s statement. For example, a vendor may need to provide a certified copy of their New Zealand passport or residence class visa to support their statement that they are not an offshore person. If a vendor states that they are an offshore person (and will therefore be subject to RLWT), there should be no need for the vendor to provide evidence to support that statement. Information to be provided by paying and withholding agents to the Commissioner New section 54B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will require paying and withholding agents to provide a statement detailing their RLWT withholding obligations at the time they pay RLWT to the Commissioner. The Commissioner may also allow further time for paying and withholding agents to furnish their RLWT statements. However, this may affect a vendor’s ability to apply for a refund if he or she wants to file an interim income tax return shortly after the disposal, as refunds will not be issued until the payment of RLWT to the Commissioner is reconciled with the vendor’s account. Information retention and the Privacy Act 1993 New section 54C(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will require anyone who receives information under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to retain that information for at least seven years. This rule will apply to everyone who receives information under this section, irrespective of whether RLWT is ultimately paid. The provisions of the Privacy Act 1993 will also apply to information collected under section 54C of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Where the recipient of the information is a conveyancing agent, they will also have professional obligations regarding confidentiality. 37 WHEN RLWT OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT MET (Clauses 42, 44, 72 and 73) Summary of proposed amendment The standard penalties that apply to other withholding taxes will also apply to RLWT. However, when RLWT has not been retained from a residential land purchase amount by a paying agent, late payment penalties will not apply. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to report details of non-compliant paying agents to their relevant professional bodies. Key features Penalties Under new section RL 2(6) the rules relating to penalties as set out in the Tax Administration Act 1994 will apply to paying agents as though they have failed to pay an amount of withholding tax equal to the amount of RLWT they failed to satisfy. This will mean that the general penalties rules that apply to withholding taxes (such as late filing penalties) will apply to RLWT, irrespective of whether the person required to satisfy RLWT is a paying agent or a withholding agent. Late payment penalties New section RL 2(6)(b) provides that when the paying agent has not retained the amount of RLWT from the residential land purchase amount, late payment penalties will not apply. This is because in most cases, the paying agent will not be liable for the underlying amount of RLWT and once they have released the funds to the vendor, they will not be able to pay the RLWT out of the residential land purchase amount. However, new section RL 2(6)(a) provides that when a paying agent has subtracted or retained an amount of RLWT from a residential land purchase, but has failed to pay the RLWT to the Commissioner, late payment penalties will apply. The late payment penalties are set out in section 139B of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Liability for underlying RLWT As noted previously, under new section RL 2(5), a paying agent will not be jointly and severally liable in relation to the vendor’s RLWT debt, despite their obligation to satisfy the vendor’s RLWT liability. However, if a paying agent has retained RLWT from a residential land purchase amount, but has not paid the RLWT to the Commissioner, they may be liable for the RLWT. If the vendor and purchaser are associated persons, the purchaser will be the withholding agent and will therefore be liable for the underlying RLWT, in a similar way to standard withholding taxes. 38 Reporting to professional body An amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is proposed, to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide details of RLWT paying agents to their relevant professional body when they have failed to fulfil their RLWT obligations. These professional bodies might include, for example, the New Zealand Law Society, Auckland District Law Society, and the New Zealand Society of Conveyancers. This will allow professional bodies to take appropriate action against members who do not comply with their legal obligations under the proposed RLWT. This is an important design feature that will support the integrity of the RLWT, as paying agents will not be liable for the underlying RLWT in most circumstances. 39 40 GST on cross-border supplies of remote services 41 42 OVERVIEW In principle, Goods and Services Tax (GST) should apply to all consumption that occurs in New Zealand, as this ensures that the system is fair, efficient and simple. Under the current rules, however, GST is not typically collected on cross-border services and intangibles that are purchased from offshore suppliers. When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased offshore services, and online digital products were not available. At that time, the compliance and administrative costs that would have been involved in taxing imported services outweighed the benefits of taxation. The growth of e-commerce means the volume of services and intangibles on which GST is not collected is becoming increasingly significant. Many are concerned that the current tax settings distort consumer and business decisions, placing New Zealand suppliers of services and intangibles at a competitive disadvantage relative to offshore suppliers. The non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles has also resulted in a growing gap in New Zealand’s GST revenue base (estimated at around $40 million per year). The amendments proposed in the bill apply GST to cross-border “remote” services and intangibles supplied by offshore suppliers (including e-books, music, videos and software purchased from offshore websites) to New Zealand-resident consumers, by requiring the offshore supplier to register and return GST on these supplies. The new rules would apply GST to a broad range of “remote” services, rather than targeting the rules at specific digital services. This avoids complexity in the design of the rules and is more consistent with the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system. A “remote” service is defined as a “service where, at the time of the performance of the service, there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the recipient and the place of physical performance.” Non-digital services, such as consulting, accounting and legal services, will be subject to the proposed rules when they are supplied as remote services. To ensure compliance costs are minimised, offshore suppliers will not be required to return GST on supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses, nor will they be required to provide tax invoices. Furthermore, offshore suppliers will only be required to register and return GST when their supplies of remote services to New Zealand resident consumers exceed NZ$60,000 in a 12-mo nth period. This is consistent with the registration threshold that applies to domestic suppliers. The amendments are intended to maintain the broad base of New Zealand’s GST system and to create a level playing field between domestic and offshore suppliers of services and intangibles. The effect will be to reduce the extent to which differences in GST treatment distort consumers’ purchasing decisions. Non-collection of GST on cross-border services and intangibles is an international challenge faced by countries that have a GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) system. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released 43 guidelines that establish an international set of principles for determining when countries should have the right to tax these supplies. The guidelines suggest that, for remotely provided services and intangibles, the consumer’s usual place of residence is the predominant test for determining which country has the right to tax. They also suggest that offshore suppliers could be required to register and return the GST on remote supplies to consumers. The proposed amendments broadly follow the OECD guidelines, as well as the rules that apply in other jurisdictions, such as Member States of the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and South Africa. Australia has announced plans to introduce similar rules that will apply from 1 July 2017. Other features of the proposed rules include: • Supplies of remote services by non-resident suppliers to New Zealand GST- registered businesses will not be subject to GST unless the supplier and recipient agree otherwise, in which case the supply will be zero-rated (taxed at a rate of zero percent). The supplier would then be able to claim back any New Zealand GST costs incurred in making the zero-rated supplies. • Offshore suppliers will be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of commercially available evidence (for example, a billing address and the country code of their mobile phone SIM card). The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to prescribe an alternative method of determining whether a customer is resident, in circumstances when sufficient information is not commercially available to apply the test. • Offshore suppliers will be required to presume that a New Zealand-resident customer is not a GST-registered business unless the customer has provided their GST registration number, New Zealand Business Number or notified their status as a registered business. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue is also able to agree to an alternative method of determining whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. • If a GST-registered business is inadvertently charged GST, it will have to seek a refund from the non-resident supplier. However, if the payment for the supply (including GST) is $1,000 or less, a non-resident supplier will have the option to provide a tax invoice to the purchaser to allow them to claim a deduction, rather than to refund the GST charged. • When certain conditions are satisfied, an operator of an electronic marketplace (such as an app store) will be required to register and return GST on supplies made through the marketplace instead of the underlying supplier. • General insurance and gambling services are subject to special GST rules that apply GST on a net basis. Amendments will extend and modify these rules to apply where non-resident suppliers provide these services to New Zealand- resident consumers. • The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will have the discretion to require a person to register and pay the GST in cases when a person provides false or 44 misleading information about themselves in order to avoid GST, if the GST amount involved is substantial or the behaviour is repeated. • A simplified “pay-only” registration system should be made available to offshore suppliers that are only required to return GST and who do not have any New Zealand GST costs to claim back. • For the period from 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services will have a default taxable period of six months (or an optional taxable period of two months). After this transitional period, these suppliers will have quarterly taxable periods. • A new rule will prevent double taxation from arising on supplies of remote services performed in New Zealand to a non-resident consumer, by allowing a deduction against the supplier’s liability for New Zealand GST to the extent that the supply has already been taxed in another jurisdiction. The proposed amendments follow proposals outlined in the discussion document GST: Cross-border services, intangibles, and goods released in August 2015. Submissions generally supported the proposals in the discussio n document. The new rules will apply to supplies made after 1 October 2016. All references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (GST Act) unless otherwise specified. 45 CROSS-BORDER SUPPLIES OF REMOTE SERVICES TO NEW ZEALAND- RESIDENT CONSUMERS (Clauses 47(1), 47(4), 47(8), 49(1), 49(2), 50, 53(1), 55(3), 62 and 63) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes amendments to the GST Act that will apply GST to cross-border “remote services” provided to New Zealand-resident consumers, by requiring offshore suppliers to register and return GST on these supplies. Key features Changes to the place of supply rules A definition of “remote services” is inserted in section 2, which defines a “remote service” as a service where, at the time of the performance of the service, there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the customer and the place where the services are performed. An amendment to the definition of “goods” under section 2 is proposed to further exclude a product that is transmitted by wire, cable, radio or other electromagnetic system, regardless of whether it is transmitted by a non-resident supplier to a resident recipient. Proposed section 8(3)(c) is inserted into the place of supply rules, which deem supplies of “remote services” (as defined) supplied by a non-resident to a person resident in New Zealand to be a supply made in New Zealand, and therefore subject to GST. Supplies of remote services that are physically performed outside New Zealand to residents in New Zealand who are not registered persons will be excluded from zero- rating through amendments proposed to section 11A(1)(j). Registration threshold As a consequence of proposed section 8(3)(c), non-resident suppliers will be required to register and return GST when their supplies of remote services to New Zealand exceed NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period. Supplies to New Zealand GST-registered businesses will only count towards this threshold if the parties agree that the supply is zero-rated (discussed in the next section of this commentary). Determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand Proposed section 8B establishes rules that non-resident suppliers of remote services must follow to determine when a remote service is supplied to a person resident in New Zealand. Proposed section 8B(2) will require the non-resident supplier to treat a customer as a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non-conflicting pieces of evidence that support the conclusion the person is resident in New Zealand. 46 Proposed section 8B(2) provides a list of proxies that can be used for these purposes: • the person’s billing address; • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the person or another geolocation method; • the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank; • the mobile country code (MCC) of the international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the person; • the location of the person’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied to them; and • other commercially relevant information. Proposed section 8B(3)(a) provides that, if a supplier has more than one set of evidence that meets the test of two non-conflicting pieces, where one set supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in New Zealand and another supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in another country, the supplier is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Proposed section 8B(3)(b) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe another method to determine a recipient’s residence if a supplier is unable to establish a recipient’s residence by two non-conflicting pieces of evidence as described above. Non-double taxation rule Proposed section 20(3)(dc) prevents double taxation from arising on supplies of remote services that are physically performed in New Zealand and received by a non- resident consumer in New Zealand, by allowing a deduction against their liabilit y for GST in New Zealand, when the supply has been taxed in another jurisdiction, to the extent that the supply is taxed in the other jurisdiction. Background When GST was introduced in 1986, few New Zealand consumers purchased offshore services and online digital products were not available. The rules that determine whether GST applies to a supply of services (the “place of supply rules”), therefore envisaged GST applying on the basis of whether a service of a more tangible nature is physically performed in New Zealand. Under these rules, supplies of services that are physically performed outside of New Zealand are not subject to GST, even if they are supplied to New Zealand-resident consumers. International developments Non-taxation of cross-border remote services and intangibles is an international issue faced by countries that have a GST or VAT system. The OECD has developed international VAT/GST guidelines, which establish an international set of principles for determining when countries have the right to tax these supplies. This is expected 47 to minimise the potential for double taxation or double non-taxation in the trade of cross-border services and intangibles. The OECD guidelines recommend two general rules for determining the place of taxation for supplies of services and intangibles to consumers: • for “on-the-spot” services, where it is necessary for the supplier and customer to be in the same location when the services are supplied, the jurisdiction where the service is performed should have taxing rights; and • for “remote” services, where it is not necessary for the supplier and customer to be in the same location when the services are supplied, the jurisdiction in which the customer has their usual residence should have taxing rights. The distinction between “remote” and “on-the-spot” services is intended to allocate taxing rights to the jurisdiction where it can reasonably be assumed that the consumer consumes these supplies. The OECD guidelines suggest that in order to collect GST on these supplies, offshore suppliers could be required to register and return GST in the jurisdiction of the consumer’s usual residence. The OECD guidelines can be found at the link below: http://www.oecd.org/ctp/consumption/international-vat-gst-guidelines.htm The offshore supplier registration model has been adopted for cross-border services and intangibles in a number of jurisdictions, including the European Union, Norway, South Korea, Japan, Switzerland and South Africa. Australia has also announced plans to introduce the model. Countries that have implemented such a system report success in collecting GST/VAT on these supplies. Current place of supply rules The GST Act adopts an iterative approach to determining whether a good or service is considered to be supplied in New Zealand, and therefore whether GST applies to the supply. The place of supply rules in section 8 of the Act are then followed by a range of exclusions that determine whether the supply is zero-rated or exempt. The current place of supply rules generally apply GST on the basis of where services are physically performed. Services that are physically performed outside New Zealand will generally not be subject to GST if supplied by a non-resident, and will generally be zero-rated if supplied by a resident. Under section 8(2) of the Act, when a New Zealand-resident person supplies services, the supply is deemed to be made in New Zealand and therefore subject to GST. However, if the services are physically performed outside New Zealand, the supply will be zero-rated under section 11A(1)(j). If a non-resident person supplies services, the starting point is that the supply will be deemed to be made outside New Zealand, and therefore not subject to GST. However, under section 8(3)(b), services are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand if 48 the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of performance. However, section 8(4) provides that if a supply is made to a GST-registered business for the purposes of carrying on their taxable activity, the services are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand, and therefore are not subject to GST, unless the parties agree that GST will apply. 49 Summary of the current place of supply rules for services NoYes Are the services physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed? section 8 (3 )(b ) Are the services supplied by a resident supplier? section 8 (2 ) Are the services supplied to a registered person for the purposes of their taxable activity? section 8(4 ) Are the services supplied to a non -resident who is outside New Zealand at the time of performance (unless exceptions apply) ?

No GST applies GST applies at the 15% rate GST applies at the 0% rate section 11A( 1)(k) GST applies at the 15% rate (unless other specific rules apply) No Yes No Yes YesNo No Yes No Yes 50 Detailed analysis Changes to the place of supply rules The amendments propose changes to the place of supply rules, so that GST applies to supplies of remote services that are physically performed outside New Zealand, where the services are supplied to a New Zealand resident. Proposed section 8(3)(c) provides that services will be treated as being supplied in New Zealand (subject to GST) when a non-resident supplier supplies remote services to a New Zealand resident, unless the services are physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed (in which case the supply would be subject to GST under existing section 8(3)(b)). Section 8(4) will apply to supplies made under proposed section 8(3)(c), so that remote services that are supplied to GST-registered businesses will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand (not subject to GST), unless the supplier and the GST- registered recipient agree that the supply is a taxable supply. Where the parties have agreed, these supplies will be zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x). (See following section of the commentary for more information on business-to-business supplies.) Section 11A(1)(j) currently zero-rates services that are physically performed outside New Zealand or supplies that arrange services that are physically performed outside New Zealand. An amendment excludes supplies of remote services to a person resident in New Zealand that is not a registered person from this zero-rating rule. This creates a level playing field between resident and non-resident suppliers, as in both cases, GST will apply at the 15% rate when remote services are physically performed outside New Zealand and supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer. Example Movie Co. is a non-resident company that provides remote services to consumers in a number of countries, including New Zealand. As some of these services are remote services supplied to a New Zealand-resident consumer, these supplies will be subject to GST under proposed section 8(3)(c). If Movie Co. exceeds the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on these supplies. If Movie Co. was a resident of New Zealand that physically performed remote services outside New Zealand, its supplies would also be subject to GST at the 15% rate when supplied to New Zealand- resident consumers, due to the proposed exception to section 11A(1)(j). The new place of supply rule in section 8(3)(c) applies to services that are not physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time of performance. The place where a service is “physically performed” can be considered to be the place where the service is actually carried out or performed. For these purposes, all services are “physically performed”, even if they are delivered through an automated process. Services that are already exempt (such as supplies of financial services) or zero-rated under a specific rule would retain that character under the proposed amendments. 51 Summary of the new place of supply rules for non-resident suppliers of services No – new rulesYes – existing section 8(3)(b) Are the services “remote services” supplied to a person resident in New Zealand? proposed section 8(3)(c) Are the services physically performed in New Zealand by a person who is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed?

Treating intangible digital products as services is consistent with the OECD framework, and recognises that it is impractical to treat these products like imported goods, as they cannot be taxed at the border. The bill proposes an amendment to the definition of “goods” to remove the reference to a non-resident supplier and resident recipient, in order to ensure that intangible digital products will be treated as services regardless of the tax residence of the supplier and recipient. A “remote service” is defined as a service that, at the time of the performance of the service, has no necessary connection between the physical location of the recipient and the place where the services are performed. Whether a service is a “remote service” will depend on whether the nature of the service requires that the recipient is present when the service is physically performed. If a service is eit her actually or is capable of being supplied when the recipient is not present, the test will be satisfied, as there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the recipient and the place of physical performance. Requiring a necessary connection between the physical location of the customer and the place of physical performance of services means that the definition of “remote services” includes services that are capable of being supplied remotely, but that happen to be provided when the recipient and provider are in the same location. Examples of services that could be supplied as remote services include: • supplies of digital content such as e-books, movies, TV shows, music and online newspaper subscriptions; • online supplies of games, apps, software and software maintenance; • webinars or distance learning courses; • insurance services; • gambling services; • website design or publishing services; and • legal, accounting or consultancy services. Examples of services that would not be remote services include: • accommodation services; • hairdressing, beauty therapy and physiotherapy; • car rental services; • entry to cinema, theatre performances, sports events and museums; • gym memberships; 53 • passenger transport services; and • restaurant and catering services. Example Legal Co. is a non-resident company based in Australia. Sam, a New Zealand tax resident, seeks general advice from Legal Co. about investing in an Australian company. The nature of the service is such that Sam is not required to be present when the advice is provided, and in fact the advice is provided via telephone and email, rather than in person. The services are remote services, as there is no necessary connection between Sam’s physical location and the place where the service is physically performed. If Legal Co exceeds the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on this supply. Telecommunications services The GST Act includes special rules for cross-border supplies of telecommunications services, including specific place of supply and zero-rating rules. These rules determine the GST treatment of the supply based on the place that the customer is located when initiating or receiving services. These rules zero-rate domestic telecommunications providers’ supplies of international roaming services to New Zealand residents who are temporarily offshore. Offshore telecommunications providers are, however, required to charge GST on services used by non-resident consumers that are temporarily in New Zealand (known as inbound roaming services), if the total value of their supplies exceeds the registration thresho ld. However, if the threshold is exceeded only because of supplies to non-residents that are physically present in New Zealand, they are not required to register. Offshore telecommunications providers must register for GST for services provided to New Zealand residents if they exceed the $60,000 threshold. The amendments proposed in the bill are not intended to disturb the current tax settings for telecommunications services. Section 8(5) of the GST Act excludes these services from the application of the relevant provisions. “Telecommunications services” are defined in the GST Act to include the transmission, emission or reception of information by certain technical systems, including access to global information networks, but to exclude the content of the telecommunication. This means that telecommunications services, such as telephone calls or access to the internet via an internet service provider, will not be subject to the new place of supply or electronic marketplace rules. GST registration threshold Non-resident suppliers of remote services to New Zealand customers will be required to register for GST if their total value of supplies made in New Zealand exceed NZ$60,000 in a 12-month period, which is equivalent to the existing registration threshold for resident suppliers. 54 As these suppliers will be subject to the rules contained in section 51 of the GST Act, non-resident suppliers will be required to register if: • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the past 12 months exceeded NZ$60,000 (unless the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is satisfied that their supplies in the next 12 months will not exceed this threshold); or • the total value of their supplies made in New Zealand in the next 12 months is expected to exceed NZ$60,000. As remote services supplied by a non-resident to a New Zealand GST-registered business are generally treated as not being supplied in New Zealand (and therefore not subject to GST), these supplies will not count towards the registration threshold. However, if the parties agree that the supplies will be zero-rated, these supplies will count towards the threshold. Where a non-resident supplier of remote services is carrying on a taxable activity in New Zealand, and their supplies fall below the NZ$60,000 threshold, they will be able to voluntarily register for GST. The existing rules that allow non-resident businesses to register for GST, which are contained in section 54B of the GST Act, will continue to apply. These rules allow a non-resident business that has been charged GST on goods or services received in New Zealand, but that does not carry on a taxable activity in New Zealand, to register and claim back the GST paid, provided certain conditions are met. Example Music Co., a non-resident company based in the United States, supplies access to music on a subscription basis over the internet. Music Co also supplies licences for businesses such as restaurants and bars to play music in a commercial setting. Each year, Music Co. makes supplies valued at NZ$50,000 to New Zealand customers who are not GST-registered. It makes supplies valued at NZ$20,000 to New Zealand GST-registered customers. Unless Music Co. chooses to agree with its GST-registered business customers that these supplies that would bring them over the registration threshold are zero-rated, Music Co. will not be required to register and return GST on any of its supplies in New Zealand, as it has not exceeded the NZ$60,000 registration threshold. Determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand When applying the new place of supply rules, a supplier will not be required to determine precisely whether their customer is a tax resident of New Zealand, and will instead be able to use objective proxies to determine the GST treatment of the supply. Under the proposed rules, an offshore supplier of remote services would be required to determine whether a customer is a New Zealand resident on the basis of two non- conflicting pieces of evidence. This test is intended to strike a balance between accuracy in determining whether New Zealand GST should apply and the compliance costs imposed on offshore suppliers. The proposed rules will provide non-resident suppliers with certainty when determining whether a recipient of a supply should be treated as a New Zealand- 55 resident. The test should also be familiar to many non-resident suppliers as the proposed approach is consistent with similar rules that apply in the European Union. Proposed section 8B(2) provides a list of proxies that can be used for these purposes: • the person’s billing address; • the internet protocol (IP) address of the device used by the person or another geolocation method; • the person’s bank details, including the account the person uses for payment or the billing address held by the bank; • the mobile country code (MCC) of the international mo bile subscriber ident it y (IMSI) stored on the subscriber identity module (SIM) card used by the person; • the location of the person’s fixed landline through which the service is supplied to them; or • other commercially relevant information. The supplier can use one or more pieces of other commercially relevant information to determine whether a person is resident in New Zealand, rather than using the other proxies that are listed. Examples of other commercially relevant information are the customer’s trading history (such as the previous billing address of the customer) or the product purchased if it is linked to a geographic location (for example, some gift cards may only be used in a particular country). Information provided by a third party, such as by a payment service provider, can also be used if it is commercially relevant. The rules are therefore intended to provide flexibility for suppliers, as the information that will be available to different businesses will vary and may change due to changes in technology and new business models. Compliance costs are reduced when a business is able to use information that it routinely collects through its normal processes, rather than having to request additional information from its customers for tax purposes. Under proposed section 8B(3)(a), if a supplier has more than one set of evidence that meets the test, where one set supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in New Zealand and another supports the conclusion that the customer is resident in another country, the supplier is required to choose the more reliable set of evidence. Which items are more reliable will depend on the circumstances. For example, where the supplier applies the same price regardless of the country of the customer, the recipient’s billing address could be a more reliable indicator than would otherwise be the case. 56 Example Jacob, a New Zealand tax resident, purchases a navigational app on his phone while on holiday in the United States. The app store collects two pieces of evidence that supports the conclusion that Jacob is resident in New Zealand, which are his credit card information and the records of his billing addresses from transaction history with the app store. The app store also has two pieces of evidence that suggest Jacob is resident in the United States, which are the SIM card in the phone he is using and his IP address. Proposed section 8B(3)(a) requires the app store to use the set of evidence that is more reliable to determine whether GST applies in New Zealand. The app store has implemented system rules that give priority to its customers’ credit card information and transaction history, as these indicators are more reliable in the context of their business. On this basis, the app store treats Jacob as a New Zealand resident, and charges New Zealand GST on the supply. To provide additional flexibility, proposed section 8B(3)(b) enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe an alternative method of determining whether a customer is resident in New Zealand, in circumstances where sufficient information is not commercially available to apply the test. This information could be published by the Commissioner. Non-double taxation rule Under the current place of supply rules, GST would apply to services that are physically performed in New Zealand and supplied to a non-resident who is in New Zealand. However, according to the OECD guidelines, if that service was a remote service, the country of the consumer’s usual residence would have taxing rights over this consumption. Proposed section 20(3)(dc) prevents double taxation from arising on supplies of remote services that are physically performed in New Zealand to a non-resident consumer in New Zealand, by allowing a deduction that offsets their liability for GST in New Zealand to the extent that the supply has already been taxed in another jurisdiction. Proposed section 20(3)(dc) provides a deduction for the New Zealand GST charged when: • there is a supply of remote services that are physically performed in New Zealand and supplied to a non-resident person in New Zealand who is not registered for New Zealand GST; and • the supplier has, in relation to the supply, incurred liability for, returned and paid a consumption tax in another jurisdict ion. The deduction will be limited to the extent of the consumption tax paid in the other jurisdiction. 57 Example After the proposed Australian rules for cross-border services are implemented, Book Co. a New Zealand seller of e-books, supplies e-books to an Australian resident who is temporarily in New Zealand on holiday. Book Co. is liable for and has returned and paid GST in Australia. Therefore, new section 20(3)(dc) will allow it to claim a deduction against the New Zealand GST charged on the supply. As the Australian GST rate is 10%, Book Co. effectively returns output tax of 5% on the supply. Effect on suppliers’ residency and income tax obligations Although these amendments treat certain services provided by non-residents as “supplied in New Zealand”, there is no intention that this will have a broader impact on whether a supplier is a resident of New Zealand for GST or income tax purposes, or whether a supplier has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand. The definition of “resident” in the GST Act includes a resident as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007. For GST purposes, a person is also considered to be a resident of New Zealand to the extent that the person carries on a taxable activity or other activity in New Zealand, and has a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity. The proposed amendments will not affect the extent to which a person carries on an activity in New Zealand, despite their effect of making certain supplies taxable for GST purposes. Double tax agreements primarily deal with whether a resident of one country is subject to income tax on income derived in another country. The concept of “permanent establishment” is used in double tax agreements between New Zealand and other countries. Under double tax agreements, a company that does not have a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand will have no New Zealand income tax. The fact that a supplier is registered for New Zealand GST under the proposed rules should not affect whether or not the supplier has a “permanent establishment” in New Zealand for double tax agreement purposes or the application of the definition of resident used for GST purposes. 58 SUPPLIES TO NEW ZEALAND GST-REGISTERED BUSINESSES (Clauses 47(2), 47(5), 47(6), 47(7), 49(1,), 49(2), 50, 52(2), 53(2), 53(3), 55(4), 55(5), 56, 57(1), 57(2), 59(1), 59(2), 60(1,) 60(2) and 64) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes that supplies to New Zealand-registered businesses (business-to- business supplies) will not be subject to GST unless the supplier and recipient agree to zero-rate the supply. Zero-rating the supply would allow the offshore suppliers to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred (in the same way as resident suppliers). There will be special rules when GST is inadvertently charged to a New Zealand GST-registered person and when a GST-registered person receives a remote service fro m a non-resident supplier and uses it, or intends to use it, for non-taxable purposes. Key features Currently, section 8(4) treats supplies of goods and services by a non-resident person to a GST-registered person, as being made outside New Zealand (and so not subject to GST) unless the suppler and recipient agree that the supply is treated as being made in New Zealand (subject to GST). Under the proposed rules, this section will also apply to remote services supplied to persons resident in New Zealand to which proposed section 8(3)(c) applies. This means that remote services provided by a non-resident to a GST-registered person will be considered to be supplied outside New Zealand, unless the supplier and recipient agree that the supply be treated as being supplied in New Zealand. If the supplier and recipient come to an agreement, proposed section 11A (1)(x) will apply to zero-rate the supply. This allows the supplier to deduct any New Zealand GST costs incurred in relation to the supply. As a consequence of these rules, non-resident suppliers may be required to identify whether a New Zealand-resident recipient of the supply is GST-registered. Proposed section 8B(4) and (5) require the supplier to treat the recipient as not being a registered person unless the recipient: • notifies the supplier that they are a registered person; or • provides the supplier with their registration number or New Zealand business number. GST-registered recipients of remote services should not identify themselves as a GST- registered person, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the service for 100 percent non-taxable purposes. 59 The Commissioner will be able to agree with a supplier on the use of another method to determine whether the supply is made to a registered person (see proposed section 8B(6)). Invoices A non-resident supplier will not need to provide a tax invoice in relation to supplies of remote services under section 8(3)(c) (see proposed amendments to section 24(5)). However, under proposed section 24(5B), a non-resident supplier can choose to provide a full tax invoice if the recipient has been inadvertently charged GST and the payment for the supply is NZ$1,000 or less (inclusive of GST). Input tax deductions Under proposed section 20(4C), a recipient will not be able to claim an input tax deduction for a supply of remote services, unless the recipient has obtained a tax invoice under section 24(5B), result ing fro m the recipient being inadvertently charged GST and the consideration for the supply is NZ$1,000 or less. The recipient will not be denied an input tax deduction when the supply is treated as made in New Zealand by the recipient of the supply (under section 5B) and the recipient has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). Incorrect GST treatment When a GST-registered recipient is inadvertently charged GST, a non-resident supplier may make an output tax adjustment in the return when it is apparent that a mistake has been made, under amendments proposed to section 25(1)). These amendments apply when: • the supply was standard-rated when it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see proposed subsection 25(1)(aab)); or • the supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated (see proposed subsection 25(1)(abb)). A non-resident supplier will have the option to issue a tax invoice when the recipient has been inadvertently charged GST at the standard-rate when it should not have been taxed or should have been taxed at zero percent (see proposed section 24(5B)(a)(i) and (ii)). However, the non-resident supplier may only provide a tax invoice when the consideration for the supply is NZ$1,000 or less, and the recipient notifies the supplier that he or she is a registered person (see proposed section 24(5B)(b) and (c)). When the remote supply has been incorrectly taxed, and the supplier opts to issue an invoice, the invoice must contain all the details in existing section 24(3) (see proposed section 24(4)). The provision of a tax invoice allows the GST-registered recipient to claim the inadvertently charged GST to the extent to which the recipient uses the services, or the services are available for use in, making taxable supplies. The option to provide a tax invoice is not available to the supply of a contract of insurance (see proposed section 24(5C)). 60 When a non-resident supplier opts to provide a tax invoice under section 24(5B): • the supplier must not make an adjustment under section 25 to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii) and exception to section 25(1)(abb)); • the supplier and recipient are deemed to have agreed that the supply is made in New Zealand (and so is subject to GST) under section 8(4) (see proposed section 24(5D)); and • the proposed zero-rating provision under section 11A(1)(x) does not apply (see proposed exception to the zero-rating provision under section 11A(7)). Reverse charge A proposed amendment to section 8(4B) extends the existing reverse charge to supplies of remote services that are not treated as being made in New Zealand under section 8(3)(c) and (4). The reverse charge applies if the percentage intended or actual use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. The reverse charge treats the services as being made in New Zealand by the recipient in the course and furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the recipient (see section 5B). A new reverse charge is also proposed in relation to zero-rated supplies received by a registered person. Proposed section 20(3JC) will require the recipient of a remote service under new section 8(3)(c), that is zero-rated under 11A(1)(x), to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the services. Consistent with section 8(4B), this proposed section will only apply when at the time of acquisition, or at the end of an adjustment period, the taxable use of the service is less than 95 percent. Background A feature of the proposals is the fact that business-to-business supplies are excluded (unless the parties agree to zero-rate the supply). From a revenue perspective, there is little value in applying GST to business-to-business supplies as the GST-registered recipient would, in most cases, be able to claim back the GST in their normal GST return, resulting in no net GST liability. Other advantages of excluding business-to- business supplies include: • Tax invoice requirements can be relaxed because no New Zealand consumers charged with GST would be in a position to claim back the GST. • There are some fiscal risks associated with applying GST to business-to- business supplies, which would arise if any offshore supplier purported to charge GST but did not return the GST. Registered New Zealand businesses would then seek to claim the GST back in the normal manner. • Excluding business-to-business supplies is consistent with how similar rules have been applied in other countries. 61 Because business-to-business supplies are proposed to be excluded, special rules are required when a GST-registered recipient acquires or uses the services they receive fro m a non-resident supplier for non-taxable purposes (such as private purposes or for making exempt supplies). In these situations, a GST-registered recipient should be treated in a similar way to a final consumer, otherwise the services may be under- taxed. It is therefore proposed that the existing reverse charge (section 8(4B)) and a proposed reverse charge for the receipt of zero-rated supplies (section 20(3JC)) will apply to ensure GST is returned by the GST-registered recipient on the portion of non-taxable of the service. This would ensure that businesses receiving services and intangibles from an offshore supplier, other than for making taxable supplies, are treated in the same way as individual consumers. Detailed analysis Section 8(4) will apply to supplies made under proposed section 8(3)(c), so that remote services that are supplied to GST-registered businesses will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand, unless the supplier and the GST-registered recipient agree that the supply is a taxable supply. Where the parties have agreed, these supplies will be zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x). Example Accommodation Co. is a non-resident company that provides facilitation services, in that it matches customers who are looking for accommodation in a particular location with local providers of these services. The facilitation services provided by Accommodation Co. to the local accommodation providers are remote services, as there is no necessary connection between the location of the recipients and the place where the facilitation services are performed. If the local providers are not registered for GST, these supplies will be subject to GST under section 8(3)(c), as the facilitation services are remote services that are supplied to a New Zealand resident who is not a GST-registered business. If the local providers are registered for GST, then under section 8(4) the facilitation services will be treated as being supplied outside New Zealand, unless Accommodation Co. and the local accommodation providers agree that these supplies are zero-rated. If Accommodation Co. incurs New Zealand GST costs, it may wish to agree with the local providers of accommodation to make these supplies zero-rated, as this would allow them to deduct these costs incurred in New Zealand in making the supplies. As a result of these rules for business-to-business supplies, non-resident suppliers will need to differentiate between individual consumers and GST-registered businesses. When similar rules have been applied in other countries, GST or Value Added Tax (VAT) numbers are used to identify a business customer. Similarly, the proposed rules require the supplier to treat the supply as being to a consumer, unless the recipient notifies the supplier that they are registered or provides their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number. Note that GST-registered recipients of remote services should not identify themselves as a GST-registered 62 person, or provide their GST registration number or a New Zealand business number, if they intend to use the service for 100 percent non-taxable purposes. Non-resident suppliers with services targeted at individual consumers can assume those recipients are not GST-registered and apply GST at the 15% rate. Suppliers may collect further information if it is likely that the services they provide may be purchased by GST-registered businesses. It is recognised that it may not be practical for all suppliers to ask for evidence that a customer is GST-registered. Therefore, to provide additional flexibility, the proposed rules allow the Commissioner to agree an alternative method to determine whether the supply is made to a GST-registered person. The Commissioner’s discretion is expected to apply in situations when a supplier distinguishes between businesses and individual consumers due to the nature of the services they supply and can provide evidence that the services targeted at businesses are supplied to GST-registered businesses. Example Software Co. is a non-resident that provides software to New Zealand businesses and individual consumers. Factors such as price, and licensing terms and conditions mean that there is a clear division between the software purchased by businesses and individual consumers. Businesses that purchase the software are likely to be GST-registered persons. Software Co. has a large number of customers and it is impractical to ask for evidence to identify their customers as GST-registered. Software Co. is able to apply to the Commissioner to use an alternative method for identifying whether their customers are GST-registered persons. Evidence such as the nature of the products, pricing, licensing terms and other conditions could be used, as well as a sample of their customer base that supports the notion that future customers will be GST-registered. GST inadvertently charged to a GST-registered recipient There may be instances when a non-resident supplier accidently treats a GST- registered business as an individual consumer and therefore charges the business GST. In this situat ion, the GST-registered recipient should seek a refund from the non-resident supplier and not claim an input tax deduction for the inadvertently charged GST (see proposed deduction prohibition under section 20(4C)). There is, however, a proposed exception to the deduction prohibition for supplies under NZ$1,000 (see commentary below). Proposed amendments to section 25(1) will allow a supplier to make adjustments to the payment of output tax in the return in which it is apparent that the mistake has been made. This will apply when the supply was standard-rated when it should not have been treated as a taxable supply (see proposed subsection 25(1)(aab)), or the supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated (see proposed subsection 25(1)(abb)). Note that an adjustment will only be required if the non-resident supplier has already furnished a return and has accounted for an incorrect amount of output tax as a result of the mistake (see existing section 25(1)(e)). If the mistake becomes apparent before 63 the relevant return has been furnished, the mistake will be able to be rectified before the return is filed. Since non-resident suppliers are not required to provide a tax invoice under the amendment to section 24(5), they will not be required to issue a credit note under section 25(4). Supplies of $1,000 or less An exception to the above rules applies when the payment for the supply (including GST) is NZ$1,000 or less. In this situation, when the supplier inadvertently charges a GST-registered recipient GST, the supplier can choose to provide a full tax invoice to the GST-registered recipient. This option is intended to be a compliance-saving measure for non-resident suppliers in relation to low-value supplies, when the cost of issuing a refund may exceed the cost of issuing a tax invoice. Note that if the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice, the supplier must provide a full tax invoice, even if the payment for the supply (including GST) is less than $50 (see amendments to section 24(5)). The tax invoice must be a full invoice as set out in section 24(3), and therefore must contain the following particulars: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; • the date upon which the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the services supplied; • the quantity of the services supplied; and either— • the total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or • where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. An exception to the deduction prohibition (discussed above, under section 20(4C)) allows the GST-registered recipient to claim an input tax deduction under the normal deduction provisions to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. If the supplier chooses to provide a tax invoice; • the supplier is not required to make an adjustment under section 25 to correct the amount of GST shown on the invoice (see section 25(1)(aab)(ii) and exception to section 25(1)(abb)); 64 • the supplier and recipient are treated as having agreed that the supply is made in New Zealand (and therefore subject to GST) under section 8(4); and • the proposed zero-rating provision under section 11A(1)(x) does not apply (see proposed exception to the zero-rating provision under section 11A(7)). These provisions are intended to turn a supply that should not have been taxed or was taxed at zero percent, into a supply that is taxed at the standard rate of 15%. In this situation, the correct amount of GST is returned by the supplier and therefore an adjustment to the supplier’s GST return, under section 25, is not required. The diagram below summarises how these rules will apply. Is the consideration for the service less than $1,000? A non-resident supplier has supplied a remote service to a GST-registered business and GST is inadvertently charged Supplier can provide a tax invoice The supplier must make an adjustment of tax payable in the period when the incorrect treatment becomes apparent. Supplier can provide a refund of GST charged The service is treated as a standard-rated supply. The GST- registered recipient is able to claim an input tax deduction. The non-resident supplier will not make an adjustment. No Yes Supplier has an option 65 The option to provide a tax invoice is not available for the supply of a contract of insurance (see section 24(5C) and the commentary on the special provisions that apply to contracts of insurance). Reverse charge (GST-registered recipient of remote services) An amendment to the existing reverse charge under section 8(4B) will require recipients of a remote service under new section 8(3)(c), that are not treated as being supplied in New Zealand, to return output tax on the supply if the percentage intended or actual use of the services is less than 95 percent of the total use. An exception (proposed section 20(4D)) to the prohibition on input tax deductions (proposed section 20(4C)) allows a recipient of remote services, that is required to return output tax under the reverse charge, to claim an input tax deduction to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. Example 1 Melissa is a self-employed project manager who is registered for GST. She purchases a software package from an offshore supplier for $400 and identifies herself as a GST-registered person and therefore is not charged GST. She uses the software 50 percent for her taxable project management services and 50 percent for home/recreational use. Under the reverse charge, Melissa is treated as making a supply to herself of $400 at the 15% rate. She must return output tax of $60 ($400 x 15%). However, Melissa can claim an input deduction for the portion of the value of the software package (50 percent) that is attributed to her taxable use. This input tax deduction is $30 ($60 x 50 percent). Her net position in the relevant return (assuming no other supplies) is therefore an output tax liability of $30 ($60 output tax minus $30 input tax). If Melissa’s taxable use of the software package had been 95 percent or more, she would not have been required to apply the reverse charge. The existing reverse charge only applies when the supply of services is not treated as a supply being made in New Zealand. Therefore, the reverse charge under section 8(4B) will not apply when the non-resident supplier and the recipient agree to treat the service as being made in New Zealand under section 8(4) as the service will be zero- rated under section 11A(1)(x). In this situation, proposed section 20(3JC) requires the recipient of a remote service under section 8(3)(c), that is zero-rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x), to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the services. The nominal GST component is the tax that would be chargeable on the value of the supply, as if the value were equal to the consideration charged on the supply. This proposed section will only apply when at the time of acquisition, or at the end of an adjustment period, the taxable use of the service is less than 95 percent. This is consistent with the application of the reverse charge under section 8(4B). This provision is also similar to the existing reverse charge applied to recipients of zero- rated supplies of land under section 20(3J). 66 Example 2 Consider the same example as above (example 1), however, this time Melissa agrees with the supplier to treat the service as a supply in New Zealand, in which case the service is zero-rated under section 11A(1)(x). Because the supply is zero-rated, Melissa will be required to return output tax on the nominal GST component for any non-taxable use of the services under section 20(3JC). Since the value of the software is $400, the nominal GST component is $60 ($400 x 15%). The amount of output tax Melissa is required to return is $30; this is calculated by multiplying the nominal GST component ($60) by the non-taxable use of the service (50 percent). Note that an equivalent amount of tax is paid on the services as with the application of section 8(4B). Amendments are also proposed to existing sections 10(15C) (reduction of value of related party internal charges), 24B (records to be kept by recipient of imported services), and 56B (branches and divisions in relation to certain imported services) to ensure these provisions apply when the recipient is required to apply the proposed reverse charge under section 20(3JC). Reverse charge for supplies of $1,000 or less There may be instances when a GST-registered recipient applies the reverse charge and the non-resident supplier also inadvertently charges the GST-registered recipient GST. In this situation, GST may be returned twice on a single supply (by the non- resident supplier and the GST-registered recipient). This issue will likely be resolved if the non-resident supplier subsequently returns the GST to the GST-registered recipient and makes an adjustment under section 25 as described previously (note that an adjustment may still be necessary under section 25AA(1)(a)(iii) to ensure the correct amount of tax is accounted for under the section 8(4B) reverse charge). To ensure the correct amount of tax is paid in a situation when the supplier provides a tax invoice under section 24(5B), an addition to section 25AA will allow the GST- registered recipient to correct the amount of output tax paid and deductions claimed as a result of the application of the reverse charge under section 8(4B). The recipient will then be able to claim, in the normal manner, the portion of the GST charged by the non-resident supplier to the extent to which the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies. Example 3 Consider example 1 again, where Melissa has applied the reverse charge under section 8(4B). However, she subsequently finds out that the price for the software included GST at the standard 15% rate (3/23 x $400 = $52.17). Melissa contacts the non-resident supplier and seeks a refund for the incorrectly charged GST. Instead of providing a refund, since the consideration for the supply is $1,000 or less, the supplier issues Melissa with a full tax invoice. The tax invoice enables Melissa to claim an input tax deduction to the extent the services are used for, or available for use, in making taxable supplies, which means she can deduct $30. The non-resident supplier is also not required to make any adjustments under section 25. 67 Under proposed section 25AA(1)(a)(v), Melissa makes an adjustment in the return during which it is apparent that a mistake has been made to the amount of output tax and deductions claimed as a result of the application of section 8(4B). Melissa can claim a deduction under section 20(3) for the output tax actually accounted for ($60 – section 25AA(2)) and return output tax for the deduction actually claimed ($30 – section 25AA(3)). 68 ELECTRONIC MARKETPLACES (Clauses 47(3), 65 and 66) Summary of proposed amendment Special rules will apply when remote services are supplied through an electronic marketplace to a New Zealand-resident consumer. The proposed rules will require the non-resident operator of the marketplace, as opposed to the underlying supplier, to register and return GST. Key features Definition of “electronic marketplace” An addition to section 2 will define an electronic marketplace as a marketplace that is operated by electronic means through which a person (the underlying supplier) makes a supply of remote services by electronic means through another person (the operator of the marketplace) to a third person (the recipient). This definition includes a marketplace operated via a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace. It excludes a marketplace that solely processes payments. Non-resident electronic marketplace rule Proposed section 60C will apply to supplies of remote services made to a person resident in New Zealand through an electronic marketplace operated by a non- resident. The section treats the operator of the electronic marketplace, as opposed to the underlying supplier, as making the supply in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Proposed section 60C will not apply when: • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; and • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed in a document signed by them that the supplier is liable for the payment of tax; and • the electronic marketplace does not: - authorise the charge to the recipient; - authorise the delivery to the recipient; or - set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made. Subsection 60C(3) will apply when multiple electronic marketplaces may be liable to register and return GST in relation to a supply of remote services. In this situation, the first operator that authorises a charge or receives payment for the supply is treated 69 as making the supply. If no operator exists that meets this requirement, the first operator that authorises delivery of the supply is treated as making the supply. Subsection 60C(4) ensures that the electronic marketplace rules override the general agency rules under section 60(1). Specific rule for resident underlying suppliers Proposed section 60(1B) is a specific rule that applies to New Zealand-resident suppliers supplying remote services through an electronic marketplace. In this situation, the supplier and marketplace may treat the supply as two separate supplies: • a supply of services from the underlying supplier to the operator; and • a supply of those services from the operator of the marketplace to the recipient. Background An electronic marketplace is generally in a better position to register and return GST on supplies than the underlying suppliers. Typically, the electronic marketplace would be larger, better resourced and have a closer relationship with the customer. Requiring the electronic marketplace to register may also reduce the compliance costs, from a large number of smaller suppliers not having to register for GST. Requiring intermediaries to register for GST in this context has been a relatively recent international development. Australia announced proposed rules that would require an operator of an “electronic distribution platform” to register and return the GST. This will occur when the operator controls any of the key elements of the supply such as delivery, charging or terms and condit io ns. These proposed rules are modelled on similar rules currently in operation in the European Union and Norway. It is likely that many of the electronic marketplaces that will be required to register under the proposed rules will already be registered in Member States of the European Union and Norway. Therefore, to avoid confusion and to promote compliance, the rules proposed are intended to be consistent with the rules in these other jurisdictions. Detailed analysis Definition of “electronic marketplace” A marketplace is a medium that allows consumers and suppliers of goods and services to interact in order to facilitate the sale and purchase of the goods and services. The marketplaces we envisage here are virtual marketplaces where consumers and suppliers do not physically interact (typically, online marketplaces). The proposed definition of electronic marketplace requires that: • the marketplace allows underlying suppliers to make supplies of remote services through the marketplace to customers; 70 • the marketplace must be operated by electronic means, including by a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace; and • the supplies made by the marketplace must be made by electronic means. In the context of the proposed rules that apply to supplies of remote services, the proposed marketplace rules will apply to virtual or electronic marketplaces. The proposed definition of “electronic marketplace” therefore captures marketplaces that are operated by electronic means, including via a website, internet portal, gateway, store, distribution platform or other similar marketplace. The supplies made through the marketplace must also be made by electronic means. Payment providers will be excluded fro m the definit io n o f “electronic marketplaces” as these providers merely facilitate the exchange of money between the supplier and consumer, rather than the exchange of the remote service itself. Non-resident electronic marketplace rule Proposed section 60C states that when a supply of remote services is made through a non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace to a person resident in New Zealand, the operator of the marketplace will be treated as making the supply in the course or furtherance of their taxable activity. As the rules will only apply to non- resident operators of electronic marketplaces through which supplies of remote services are made to New Zealand residents, this rule is not expected to affect existing GST arrangements that apply in the domestic context. Proposed section 60C will treat the non-resident operator of the electronic marketplace as the supplier, when a supply of remote services is made through a non- resident electronic marketplace to a New Zealand resident. However, the operator of the electronic marketplace will not be considered to have made the supply if they do not control any of the key elements of the supply, and the liability of the underlying supplier is made clear in the documentation relating to the transaction. Accordingly, under proposed section 60C, the non-resident operator of an electronic marketplace will be the supplier, unless all of the following conditions are satisfied: • the electronic marketplace does not authorise the charge to the recipient, or authorise the delivery of the supply, or set the terms and conditions under which the supply is made; • the documentation provided to the recipient identifies the supply as made by the underlying supplier and not the marketplace; • the underlying supplier and the operator of the marketplace have agreed in writing that the supplier is liable for GST. 71 As a result of being treated as making the supply, the operator of the electronic marketplace will be responsible for returning GST. The operator of the electronic marketplace will include these supplies in their turnover for the purpose of determining whether the registration threshold is exceeded and, if it is exceeded, will be liable for the GST. The operator will make any adjustments arising from the supply, for example, when GST is refunded to a GST-registered business. Specific rule for resident underlying suppliers A specific rule in proposed section 60(1B) will apply to New Zealand-resident suppliers supplying remote services through an electronic marketplace. These underlying suppliers may already be registered for GST under the existing rules. If these suppliers were subject to the general rule under proposed section 60C(3), the services they supply through the electronic marketplace would no longer be taxable, as the operator of the marketplace will have been treated as the supplier. This would mean that GST incurred by the underlying supplier in making these supplies would be unrecoverable. A specific rule is therefore proposed to treat the supply of remote services as two separate supplies – a supply of services from the underlying supplier to the operator, and a supply of those services from the operator of the marketplace to the recipient. The first supply to the marketplace is likely to be zero-rated under the existing provisions as the supply is to a non-resident outside New Zealand. This will generally enable the resident underlying supplier to recover the GST costs incurred in making the supply. Example Gaming Co. a New Zealand GST-registered app developer, contracts with Applications Co. a non- resident operator of an app store, to distribute its smartphone games. Applications Co. collects payments from customers and authorises delivery of the app. Applications Co. is treated as the supplier under proposed section 60C, and therefore is responsible for GST on the supply. If Applications Co. makes supplies that exceed the registration threshold, it will be required to register and return GST on supplies of the remote services that are made through it to New Zealand-resident consumers. Even though Applications Co. is treated as a supplier of the app due to proposed section 60C, under proposed section 60(1C), Gaming Co. and Applications Co. can agree to treat the supply from Gaming Co. to Applications Co. as a separate supply. This will allow Gaming Co. to deduct its GST costs incurred in making supplies to Applications Co. 72 GST ON CROSS-BORDER SUPPLIES OF INSURANCE (Clauses 48(3), 48(4), 49(1), 55(1), 55(2) and 57(2)) Summary of proposed amendments Consistent with the new rules for other supplies of remote services, the amendments will extend the special rules for general insurance to cross-border supplies of insurance services provided to New Zealand-resident consumers. Key features Insurance services are an example of “remote services”, as there is no requirement for the recipient to be present when the services are performed. As with other supplies of remote services under the amendments, the proposed new rules will: • apply GST to insurance services supplied by offshore insurers to New Zealand- resident consumers (proposed section 8(3)(c)); and • exclude insurance services supplied by offshore insurers to New Zealand GST- registered businesses from GST, unless the insurer and the recipient agree that these supplies will be zero-rated (existing section 8(4) and proposed section 11A(1)(x)). The proposed amendments will ensure that when an offshore insurer and a GST- registered recipient agree that supplies of insurance services will be zero-rated, the insurer will not be entitled to a deduction for insurance payments on payments to that GST-registered recipient (proposed section 20(3)(d)(vii)), and the GST-registered recipient of the payment will not be required to return output tax under section 5(13) (proposed section 5(13)(d)). The reverse-charge provisions in section 8(4B) and proposed section 20(3JC) will apply when a GST-registered business purchases insurance services that relate partly to private or exempt use. The option to provide a tax invoice when GST is inadvertently charged on a supply for consideration of NZ$1,000 or less will not be available for insurance premiums charged to GST-registered businesses (proposed section 24(5C)). Background The GST Act contains special rules for general insurance that apply GST on a net cashflow basis, where a GST-registered insurer is required to return GST on insurance premiums received and claim a deduction for insurance payments. A GST-registered business is able to deduct input tax on the premiums it is charged and is required to return GST on insurance payments received. 73 These rules do not apply to the provision of life insurance, which is treated as exempt supplies of financial services under the GST Act. Insurance services are an example of a remote service, as there is no necessary connection between the physical location of the insured party and the location where the insurance service is performed. Insurance services are performed and consumed over the period of the contract of insurance. In the OECD’s guidelines, insurance services are listed as an example of a remote service that, when supplied to a consumer, should be taxed in the consumer’s usual residence. Detailed analysis The proposed rules that apply to cross-border supplies of insurance services provided by non-resident suppliers will differ depending upon whether the services are supplied to resident consumers or GST-registered businesses. Supplies of general insurance services to New Zealand-resident consumers Under the proposed amendments, a non-resident provider of insurance will be required to return GST on premiums charged to New Zealand-resident consumers (if its supplies to New Zealand residents exceed the registration threshold), as the supply of the contract of insurance will be taxable under proposed section 8(3)(c). If registered, a non-resident insurer would also be able to claim a deduction when making an insurance payment under a contract with a New Zealand-resident consumer (through existing section 20(3)(d)), or on New Zealand GST costs incurred in paying for replacement goods or repair services. The diagram below shows how the rules will apply to cross-border supplies of insurance to New Zealand residents who are not GST-registered businesses. 74 Cross-border supplies of general insurance services to New Zealand-resident non GST-registered consumers Supplies of general insurance services to New Zealand GST-registered businesses Unless the insurer and the GST-registered recipient agree that the supply will be zero- rated under proposed section 11A(1)(x), cross-border supplies of insurance services to a GST-registered businesses will continue to be excluded from GST under the proposed amendments. Consequently, a non-resident insurer will not return GST on premiums charged to GST-registered business customers, and will not be entitled to a deduction under section 20(3)(d). A GST-registered recipient of an insurance payment will not be required to return output tax on the payment under existing section 5(13). This means that the current arrangements for GST on supplies of insurance services by a non- resident insurer to a GST-registered business will not change, unless the parties agree that the contract of insurance is a zero-rated supply. The diagram below shows how the proposed rules will apply. Insurance company Offshore NZ A deduction is available to the insurance company when an insurance payment is made Consumer GST applies at the 15% rate on the insurance premiums charged 75 Cross-border supplies of insurance services to New Zealand GST-registered businesses (when the supply is not zero-rated) If the non-resident insurer and GST-registered business customer have agreed that the supply of a contract of insurance will be zero-rated, GST will apply at 0% on the insurance premiums. This will allow the insurance company to claim back GST costs incurred in New Zealand in making these supplies, which could include costs incurred in repairing or replacing goods. This should mean that non-resident insurers, in the same way as resident insurers, are indifferent, from a GST perspective, about whether they make a payment to the insured GST-registered business, or replace or repair damaged goods. However, amendments will ensure that an insurer is not entitled to claim a deduction for insurance payments under these contracts (proposed section 20(3)(d)(vii)), and that a GST-registered recipient of an insurance payment is not required to pay output tax under section 5(13) (proposed section 5(13)(d)). This treatment is equivalent to that in situations when the supply is treated as being made outside of New Zealand and the insurer and GST-registered business have not agreed that the supply will be zero-rated, with the exception of the non-resident insurer’s ability to claim back related New Zealand GST costs. The diagram below shows how these rules will apply. Insurance company Offshore NZ No deduction is available on the insurance payment under existing section 20(3 )( d ) GST-registered business Insurance premiums are not subject to GST No deemed supply when the business receives an insurance payment under existing section 5 (13) 76 Cross-border supplies of zero-rated insurance services to New Zealand GST- registered businesses No option to provide a tax invoice The option to provide a tax invoice when GST is inadvertently charged on a supply for consideration of NZ$1,000 or less will not apply to supplies under a contract of insurance. Allowing this option would require changes to ensure that GST applies correctly on a cashflow basis, which would lead to significant complexity in the operation of the rules. Due to the nature of insurance services, an insurance company is likely to have access to the information to determine whether their client is a GST- registered business. Insurance company Offshore NZ No deduction is available on the insurance payment due to proposed new section 20(3)(d)(vii ) GST -registered business GST applies at the 0 % rate on the insurance premiums charged No deemed supply when the business receives an insurance payment due to proposed new section 5(13)(d) 77 SUPPLIES OF REMOTE GAMBLING SERVICES (Clauses 48(1), 48(2), 51 and 52(1)) Summary of proposed amendment Payments made for remote gambling services or prize competitions by a New Zealand resident performed outside New Zealand are treated as a supply for GST purposes. Special rules will apply to determine the consideration for a remote supply of gambling services or prize competitions, based on amounts received from New Zealand residents, less a share of worldwide prizes. Key features Proposed section 5(10B) will treat payments for remote gambling services or prize competitions by a New Zealand resident performed outside New Zealand as payment for the supply of services by the person who conducts the gambling or prize compet it ion. An addition to section 5(11) will apply the definition of “gambling” under the Gambling Act 2003 to proposed section 5(10B). Proposed section 10(14B) will apply to determine the consideration for the supply of remote gambling services or prize competitions for the purposes of proposed section 5(10B). The amount of consideration is: resident amount − worldwide prizes× ( resident amounts worldwide amounts ) Resident amounts, worldwide prizes and worldwide amounts are defined under section 10(14C) as fo llows: • “resident amounts” is the total amount in money received in relation to the supply by the non-resident who conducts the gambling or prize competit ion from all the persons resident in New Zealand; • “worldwide prizes” is the total amount of all prizes paid and payable in money worldwide in relation to the supply; and • “worldwide amounts" is the total amount in money received worldwide in relation to the supply by the non-resident person who conducts the gambling or the prize co mpet it ion. 78 Background Gambling and prize competitions conducted in New Zealand are currently supplies for GST purposes. Gambling is defined under the Gambling Act 2003 as: • paying or staking consideration, directly or indirectly, on the outcome of something seeking to win money when the outcome depends wholly or partly on chance; • includes a sales promotion scheme; • includes bookmaking; and • includes betting, paying, or staking consideration on the outcome of a sporting event. A “prize competition” is defined in the GST Act as a scheme or competition: • for which direct or indirect consideration is paid to a person for conducting the scheme or compet ition; • that distributes prizes of money or in which participants seek to win money; and • for which the result is determined: - by the performance of the participant of an activity of a kind that may be performed more readily by a participant possessing or exercising some knowledge or skill; or - partly by chance and partly by the performance of an activity as described above, whether or not it may also be performed successfully by chance. Currently, when these services are performed in New Zealand, the person who conducts the gambling or prize competition must determine the consideration for these supplies using the following formula: amounts received − prizes The amount received is the total of all amounts in money received in relation to the supply for gambling or a prize competition. Prizes are the total amount of all prizes paid and payable in money in relation to the supply. The rules proposed ensure that gambling services and prize competitions performed in New Zealand are treated in the same way as supplies performed remotely outside New Zealand. Detailed analysis Gambling and prize competitions conducted outside New Zealand are likely to be supplied electronically (such as through an offshore gambling website). The person who conducts the gambling or prize competition is therefore likely to have participants in a number of countries. Prizes can also be paid out to any of these and the supplier is likely to have little influence over which participant receives a prize. 79 In this context, a rule for calculating consideration (the value of the supply with the addition of the tax charged) that reflects the existing rule for calculating consideratio n for gambling services performed in New Zealand (such as determining consideration by amounts received by New Zealand residents less prizes paid to New Zealand residents) may not be appropriate for gambling services performed outside New Zealand. This approach could produce arbitrary results, depending on the country in which the winner resides. Example 1 Gambling Co. operates an offshore gambling website. Gambling Co. offers a game of chance to two participants, one in Australia and the other in New Zealand. The Australian resident and the New Zealand resident each make a payment of $100 to participate in the game of chance for a 50 percent chance to win $150. Depending upon who won the prize, the amount of consideration calculated by Gambling Co. could vary significantly if consideration was solely based on amounts received by New Zealand residents less the amount of prizes paid to New Zealand residents. If the Australian resident wins, the amount of consideration in New Zealand would be $100 ($100–$0); if the New Zealand resident wins, the amount of consideration in New Zealand would be nil ($100–$150). To better reflect the level of services supplied to New Zealand residents, and to smooth out the amount of consideration for the gambling services attributed to New Zealand residents, the proposed rules determine the consideration for a remote supply of gambling services or a prize competition based on amounts received from New Zealand residents less the appropriate share of worldwide prizes. The amount of consideration is proposed to be calculated using the following formula: resident amounts − worldwide prizes× ( resident amounts worldwide amounts ) Example 2 Consider again Example 1. Using the proposed formula for calculating consideration, the amount of consideration attributed to supplies to New Zealand residents will be $25 regardless of whether the prize is won by the Australian resident or the New Zealand resident: $25 = $100 − $150 × ( $100 $100 + $100 ) The proposed formula reflects the fact that remote gambling services performed outside New Zealand are likely to be supplied to a number of participants in a number of countries and will produce outcomes more consistent with the rules that apply to gambling services performed in New Zealand. 80 ADMINISTERING THE OFFSHORE SUPPLIER REGISTRATION SYSTEM (Clauses 48(5), 54(1), 54(2), 58, 61, 67, 68 and 71) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment proposes that the Commissioner will have the discretion to require a person who has knowingly provided altered, false or misleading information to register for GST and to repay the GST that should have been charged, when their behaviour is repeated or when a substantial amount of GST is involved. The proposed amendments contain several features that are intended to reduce the costs for offshore suppliers in complying with their obligations under the rules. These measures will be complemented by simplified registration and return filing processes that Inland Revenue is developing for these customers. Key features Misrepresentations by recipients of remote services Proposed sections 5(27) and 51B(7) will provide a discretion for the Commissioner to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged, when the person has knowingly provided incorrect information that leads to GST not being charged on a supply, and this behaviour is repeated or a substantial amount of GST is involved. Taxable periods Proposed section 15(6) provides that between 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, a non-resident supplier of remote services that are taxed under the new rules will have a default taxable period of six months, with the option of a two-monthly taxable period. From 1 April 2017, these suppliers will have calendar quarterly taxable periods. Inland Revenue intends to develop a tailored, simplified registration process for offshore suppliers registering under the new rules, which will be accessible through its website. A simplified GST return is also expected to be developed that is tailored to the needs of offshore suppliers registering under the new rules. As many offshore suppliers would not incur GST costs in New Zealand and therefore would not need to claim back any GST in their returns, a simplified “pay-only” return would not include the fields that are not relevant to these customers. This “pay-only” GST return should be available when the Business Transformation programme is deployed in 2017. Offshore suppliers that are claiming input tax deductions for any New Zealand GST costs will be required to use the existing GST return. 81 Expressing amounts in a foreign currency Amendments to section 77 are proposed that will allow a non-resident supplier of remote services that are taxed under the new rules to choose to express the amount of consideration for their supplies in a foreign currency at the time of supply, with the amounts being converted into New Zealand currency at the date of filing (or the due date if the return is filed after the due date). Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English Proposed section 75(3F) will provide an automatic exception for non-resident suppliers who only supply remote services from the requirement to apply to the Commissioner for authorisation to keep and retain records in a language other than English or at a place outside New Zealand. Exception from the bank account requirement Proposed section 24BA(1B) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will provide an exception for non-resident suppliers to the existing requirement for an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account to obtain an IRD number, if this is required solely because they are a non-resident supplier of remote services that are taxed under the proposed rules. Detailed analysis Misrepresentations by recipients of remote services Proposed sections 5(27) and 51B(7) provide a discretion for the Commissioner to require a person to register and pay GST that should have been charged, when: • the person has knowingly provided information that is altered, false or misleading, which leads to a supply being treated as being zero-rated or as not being supplied in New Zealand; and • the person has repeatedly knowingly, provided altered, false or misleading information, or the amount of GST that was not charged is substantial. The existing “knowledge offences” are also expected to apply when a person deliberately supplies incorrect information for the purpose of avoiding GST by misrepresenting themselves as a registered business or as a resident of another country (section 143A of the Tax Administration Act 1994). A person convicted of a knowledge offence is liable for a fine of up to NZ$25,000 for a first-time offence, or NZ$50,000 for repeated offences. If a customer provided incorrect false information to access content that is geographically restricted, which consequentially resulted in GST not being charged, the reverse charge in proposed section 5(27) and the existing knowledge offences would not be expected to apply. 82 Example Luke purchases a number of remote services online, including online dating services, music and movie content. To avoid paying GST, Luke has used a false IP address, billing address and other details to mask the fact that he is a resident of New Zealand. On other occasions, he has provided a false GST registration number. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue exercises her discretion to register Luke from the time the services were physically performed, and requires him to repay the GST that was not charged, plus penalties and interest. Taxable periods Currently, GST returns must be filed on a one-monthly, two-monthly or six-monthly basis, depending on turnover levels. Current systems are unable to support other taxable periods. However, these systems are expected to be replaced with a new solution during the first quarter of 2017, as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. For the period beginning 1 October 2016 to 31 March 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services will have a default taxable period of six months, or an optional taxable period of two months. This initial six-month taxable period provides a “soft start” to the rules, as a non-resident supplier of remote services will be able to register, file and pay by 7 May 2017 without facing interest or penalties. From 1 April 2017, non-resident suppliers of remote services that are subject to GST under the new proposed rules will have quarterly taxable periods. This is intended to align with these suppliers’ filing obligations in other jurisdictions, to reduce their compliance costs. Expressing amounts in a foreign currency Currently, the GST Act requires that all amounts are expressed in New Zealand currency at the time of supply. This means that if a supply is paid for in a foreign currency, the value of the supply must be expressed as the amount of foreign currency converted to New Zealand currency at the exchange rate applying at the time of supply. As this requirement could result in significant compliance costs for offshore suppliers who register under the new rules, amendments are proposed to section 77 that will provide non-resident suppliers of remote services with the option of expressing amounts in a foreign currency. The foreign currency amounts would then be converted into New Zealand dollars at the time of filing their return (or at the due date for filing, if the return was filed past the due date). To ensure that suppliers to do not switch between currencies to take advantage of currency movements, a “lock-in” rule will prevent the non-resident supplier from changing their election within two years. Holding records outside New Zealand and in a language other than English Proposed section 75(3BA) will provide an automatic exception to the requirement to keep and retain records in English or at a place in New Zealand for non-resident suppliers of remote services that are subject to GST under proposed section 8(3)(c). 83 Current ly, a GST-registered person must apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for authorisation to keep records at a place outside New Zealand or in a language other than English. Exception from the bank account requirement Recent amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 require an offshore person to have a fully functional New Zealand bank account in order to obtain an IRD number. This is to ensure that an offshore person has first been subjected to New Zealand’s anti-money laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism rules. Proposed section 24BA(1B) will provide an exception to this requirement for non- resident supplier who required an IRD number solely because they are a non-resident supplier of remote services that are taxed under the proposed rules. As these suppliers will often have no connection with New Zealand other than supplying a remote service to New Zealand customers, this requirement would otherwise impose compliance costs, and may discourage GST registration. 84

The main policy measures in this bill have been developed from a consideration of the reforms necessary to progress the Government’s transformation of tax administration in New Zealand. The objective of this bill is to make necessary changes to tax legislation which will enable future bigger changes. Simplification of the tax system can be achieved by simplifying rules around processes, administration and taxation. This overview provides a brief discussion of some of the proposed changes in those categories: • facilitating easier communication with Inland Revenue; • simplifying tax rules; and • sharing information. Improving communication Communications between taxpayers and the Commissioner are primarily governed by tax legislation which predates the widespread use of digital services. As a result, many of the provisio ns are restrictive in their description of communication and methods of communication delivery, stipulating for example that communication be provided “in writing” or delivered “by post”. The current rules are also unclear as to what electronic communications are permissible for tax matters. The proposed amendments clarify the communication options available and also provide general rules governing methods of communication delivery. These proposed general rules provide greater certainty for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Employee share purchase agreements Benefits an employee receives from a share purchase agreement are treated as employment income under the Income Tax Act 2007. These benefits are not subject to tax at source under the PAYE or FBT rules. Instead, the employee is required to file an individual tax return and include the benefit as income and pay an appropriate amount of tax on the benefit. For some employees who are not used to filing tax returns, the current method for collecting tax on employee share benefits may not be well understood and create taxpayer uncertainty. This uncertainty can also deter employees from accepting shares offered under a share purchase agreement. This bill contains a proposal to allow employers to withhold tax on these benefits and pay it on their employees’ behalf. The proposals were the result of public consultation in April 2015 – Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes. 3 Information sharing Tax information is governed by strict secrecy but in certain situations, sharing specific informat ion within defined criteria can be beneficial. This bill proposes: • to allow information to be shared where it could assist in identifying breaches of workplace legislation; • to establish a pilot project to investigate whether voice recordings used currently to verify identity could be matched between Inland Revenue and the Ministry for Social Development as a means for increased efficiency; and • that secrecy provisions applying to Inland Revenue staff are amended to allow for IRD staff working in shared office space with another government agency. 4 Electronic communications 5 6 COMMUNICATIONS FRAMEWORK (Clauses 5 to 34, 36 to 46, 48 to 51, 55 to 58, 60 to 66, 68 to 69, 71, 74 to 82, 88 to 100, 103 to 104, 106 to 108, 110, 112 to 121, 123 to 129, 132 to 135, 137, 139 to 144, 146 to 152, 154 to 176, 178 to 202, 212, 220) Summary of proposed amendments These amendments remove references throughout the Income Tax Act 2007, the Goods and Services Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 which restrict interaction with the tax system to paper-based transactions. In addition, where legislation requires the Commissioner, a taxpayer or a third party to ask, request, inform, apply or notify, these verbs have been defined to allow a freer interpretation of how those actions are to be undertaken when communicating on tax matters. The amendments govern how all information must generally be communicated. They also provide general rules applicable to various methods of communication delivery. The delivery rules consolidate current practices and legal requirements and extend these to electronic communications putting emails, for example, on the same footing as paper letters delivered by post. The purpose of these proposals is to remove any legislative barriers to receiving and sending electronic communications, as the necessary first step towards accommodating the better use of digital services. This is achieved by both removing the outdated references and also specifically providing for electronic communications within the new framework. This framework will facilitate greater use of electronic and other new communication channels in step with the planned transformation of Inland Revenue’s systems and processes over the coming years. Inland Revenue’s simplification programme aims to provide greater use of digital channels for increased convenience and reduction in compliance costs. These proposals would provide the legislative backing for that change. The proposed amendments would preclude the need to amend the tax legislation to specifically cover the new channels, thus future-proofing the legislation. Application date This amendment takes effect from the date of enactment. Key features Clause 74 establishes the new communications framework, contained in new sections 14 to 14G, for facilitating the information flows between the Commissioner and a person, and between two persons where the tax legislation governs that interaction. The framework picks up and expands on the rules governing notice requirements in the current section 14 to 14C in the Tax Administration Act 1994. 7 It establishes the general rules and standards for communications on tax matters in the Income Tax Act 2007, the Goods and Services Act 1985 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. This includes a range of communications such as a taxpayer making a phone call or submitting a GST registration application, or the Department issuing a notice or income statement to the taxpayer. It can also cover communications between third parties on tax matters such as the requirement for a bank to provide an investor with an RWT certificate for example. However, because the framework is intended to apply broadly, in order to ensure that the amendments do not unnecessarily disturb established practices or specific legislative requirements new section 14E allows for some general overrides. The framework provides for varying levels of communication formality, ranging from telephone conversations to formal notification requiring personal delivery. This allows the framework to accommodate a variety of options for communications which may range from low risk or importance to more restricted formal procedures for significant communications. The amendments allow for the Commissioner to permit new modes of communication, thereby allowing the framework to be expanded and adapted as systems are upgraded or new technologies emerge, without the need to extensively amend the legislation each time. Broadly new section 14F preserves the various elements of the current sections 14 to 14C with respect to paper based communications, and extends them to electronic modes of communication. With regard to electronic notices, the rules in the current section 14 to 14C are maintained and extended to all electronic communications. This includes the consent override for electronic notices, currently as per section 14(7). Therefore under these amendments the same rule would apply in circumstances where the Commissioner seeks to electronically ‘inform’ a person for example. The majority of the remaining amendments simply replace existing terminology referring to specific modes of communication, for example the requirement for certain communications to be “in writing”, with terminology corresponding to an appropriate tier in the communications framework as established by clause 74. There are also a number of amendments where a more significant redraft was required to fit the requirements of the provision into the new framework. With regard to these amendments there is no broad intended change in the meaning of the provisions, other than with regard to any changes to the form or format of the communication or its delivery consistent with the new framework. Background The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 overrides other legislation and allows for the use of electronic forms of communication when written communication is otherwise required by legislat ion, where the recipient of the communication consents. 8 However communication under the tax legislation is primarily reliant on paper-based communications. Partly this reliance stems from an uncertainty as to the validity of electronic communications. This uncertainty arises from the fact that communications between taxpayers and the Commissioner are primarily governed by tax legislation which predates the widespread use of digital services. As a result, many of the provisions refer to now outdated modes of communication and methods of communication delivery, including for example requirements for communication to be provided “in writing” or delivered “by post”. These amendments seek to clarify any uncertainty arising from the interaction between the application of the ETA and the outdated requirements of the tax legislation. Detailed analysis The proposed new communications framework intentionally applies broadly. It covers all communications between the Commissioner or Inland Revenue officers and other persons; as well as communications between two or more other persons not involving the Commissioner where those interactions are governed by provisions of the tax legislation. An example may be the requirement for the company to provide a dividend statement to its shareholders. These proposed rules preserve the precedence of prescribed forms and formats and any specific requirements covered within particular sections. For example it is not intended that the general nature of the framework would allow a taxpayer to file tax a tax return by sending the required information in an email, in circumstances where no email return forms have been prescribed by the Commissioner. Practically this means that where paper forms have been prescribed, but no electronic equivalents have been made available, taxpayers will be required to continue to file paper returns on prescribed forms until electronic equivalents are made available. Equally with regard to employer monthly schedules, for example, the specific requirements for these to be completed electronically are not intended to be relaxed as a result of the broad framework amendments in this bill. New section 14E also preserves the overriding effect of double tax agreements and other inter-governmental treaties, by applying the new communication rules only to the extent to which they are not inconsistent with the application of the particular agreement. New sections 14B to 14D create three distinct tiers to accommodate various modes o f communication ranging from the informal (including oral communication) to electronic (whether by electronic filing through Inland Revenue’s website, email or other electronic means) to more formal methods requiring paper or original documents. The tiers are signalled by the use of the following verbs – ask, request, or inform, apply or notify, and formally notify. Each tier sets out the options available for a person providing information or communicating something in response to one of the abovementioned verbs. For example a section requiring a person to inform the Commissioner of something can be satisfied by a telephone call, whereas a requirement to notify the Commissioner of something would require a document either electronic or printed. 9 Each tier also allows for the Commissioner to permit new modes. This allows for the framework to be expanded over time. Once a new channel becomes available for use, it would be sufficient to publish a notice that this new option is available to those who wish to use it, without the need for a separate legislative amendment. New section 14F and 14G establish delivery rules which ensure that communications, in particular electronic communications, are delivered only to appropriate contact addresses. This is important in order to protect both Inland Revenue and taxpayers from the risk of misdirected communications and to guard against an inadvertent breach of the tax secrecy provisio ns. For example this amendment ensures that if the Commissioner sends a notice to a corporate taxpayer via email that it is sent to a person who is acting for the corporate taxpayer in relation to that matter. This ensures that the notice is not treated as ‘delivered’ if it is simply sent to a generic email box at that corporation. In addition, the current rules allow for the Commissioner to post a notice to the recipient’s current or last known address. The proposed new rules extend this to allow the Commissioner to send a notice via email to the recipient’s current or last known email address. These amendments preserve the Commissioner’s ability to send an electronic notice to the recipient without first obtaining the recipient’s consent, as required by the ETA. For Inland Revenue which processes large volumes of communication this is important in order to ensure the electronic communication is workable as an alternative to paper-based communications. Inland Revenue will aim to always preserve integrity and confidentiality in its communications. Where possible and practical Inland Revenue staff seek, from each individual recipient, their consent for electronic communication. This may not always be feasible, particularly for large groups of recipients receiving a generic batch email notice, or in circumstances where the email address is the only contact address available for the recipient as they are overseas based for example. In the interests of maintaining confidentiality and integrity, the proposed amendment preserves the condition that the Commissioner may not send the electronic notice where there are reasonable grounds to suppose that the notice will not be received. This requirement is maintained and extended to all forms of electronic communications by the Commissioner. The intended result of these amendments is to ensure that electronic communications are not unnecessarily restricted when compared with paper equivalents sent by post. Finally, as discussed above, these amendments are not intended to allow for filing tax returns by email, unless that service is made available by the Commissioner either by direct agreement with the taxpayer or generally consented to by a notice on the Inland Revenue website for example. This restriction on the receipt of electronic communication by Inland Revenue is necessary in order to protect taxpayers from misdirected communications falling outside of the net, for example tax returns being sent via email and never being picked up for processing. 10 However, where the Commissioner has made a specific Inland Revenue email contact address for a particular purpose available on the website for example, this proposed amendment does not affect the ability to use this address to send emails to Inland Revenue with regard to that specific purpose. 11 ACCEPTING ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES (Clauses 72, 73, 105) Summary of proposed amendment This amendment inserts a new section into the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow for documents to be ‘‘signed” with a digital or electronic signature. It applies to all information provided to the Commissioner including, for example, electronically submitted tax returns or application forms. Once operational this amendment will eliminate the need for handwritten signatures where an acceptable and valid electronic signature is used instead. This has a number of positive impacts for the use of digital services including improving customer interactions and lower compliance costs. This amendment does not mandate the use of electronic signatures, and valid handwritten signatures will continue to be acceptable. Application date This amendment is intended to take effect from the date of enactment. Key features The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 allows for an electronic signature to satisfy a legal requirement for a document to be signed, where the recipient of the document consents to the use of the electronic signature. This amendment provides the necessary consent for the use of valid electronic signatures on information provided to the Commissioner. It also brings the Tax Administration Act 1994 into line with the Electronic Transactions Act 2002. Because of the legal significance of a signature, it is important that the use of electronic signatures is both secure and reliable for both taxpayers and Inland Revenue. The amendment allows for the Commissioner to set criteria and technical requirements for the use of electronic signatures. In order to be able to use electronic signatures in place of hand written signatures, users will need to first comply with the Commissioner’s published requirements and technical criteria. There are also likely to be approval criteria for users of this technology to further minimise the risk of signature forgery or misuse. The criteria will be set by the Commissioner following consultation with interested parties. Once the criteria have been set, the Commissioner will publish guidelines to provide advice and support to interested users. 12 Finally the amendment allows for the Commissioner to place reasonable reliance on the user of the electronic signature. This means that when a person provides an electronically signed document, unless there are reasonable grounds to suppose otherwise, the document will be treated as signed by that person. Background The Tax Administration Act 1994 requires handwritten signatures on paper forms. From the legal viewpoint a person’s signature is the visual representation of an intention to be legally bound by the information contained in the signed document. So for example a taxpayer’s signature on a tax return both identifies them as the person signing the return but also evidences that taxpayer’s certification that the contents of the return are true and correct. From a technological perspective an electronic signature can inextricably link a particular version of a document to the sender or a point in time and can be used to indicate any subsequent alterations to the document, or give information about the identity of the sender. As part of Inland Revenue’s focus on simplifying processes by improving digital services, this amendment would allow tax agents and taxpayers to submit electronically signed documents to Inland Revenue. The proposed amendment would also reduce compliance costs associated with current processes. For example tax agents filing their client’s returns electronically will no longer have to first mail out a paper copy of the return for the client to hand sign, instead the entire process could become paperless. 13 14 Employee share schemes 15 16 SIMPLIFYING THE COLLECTION OF TAX ON EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES (Clauses 2(3), 52 to 54, 109, 204 and 222) Summary of proposed amendments Changes are proposed to the general PAYE collection rules in the Income Tax Act 2007 to improve the collection of tax on benefits received as employment income under a share purchase agreement. Share purchase agreements in this context are often referred to as “employee share schemes”. The proposed changes: • allow the employer to choose to withhold tax on any employment income an employee receives under a share purchase agreement using the PAYE system; and • require employers to disclose the value of any benefits an employee receives under a share purchase agreement via the employer monthly schedule (EMS). Application date The changes apply on and after 1 April 2017 to employment income received after that date. Key features Amendments are proposed to the rules governing the collection of tax on employment income for employees who receive a benefit under a share purchase agreement. The new rules will give employers the choice to pay and return tax on employees’ behalf on employment income arising from a share purchase agreement. The amendments set out: • how the employer exercises their choice to withhold tax on such benefits; and • when benefits an employee receives from a share purchase agreement under section CE 2 are to be disclosed by the employer to Inland Revenue. The definition of “extra pay” in section RD 7 will be amended by adding to the list of payments in that section a benefit an employee receives as employment income under a share purchase agreement to the extent that new section RD 7B applies to the amount of the benefit. New section RD 7B sets out the conditions when employers exercise the choice as to whether to withhold and pay an amount of tax on a benefit under a share purchase agreement that is treated as an “extra pay” under section RD 7. The employer’s choice applies to all members of the share purchase agreement. The choice is irrevocable for that agreement. 17 Employees of an employer who has not chosen to withho ld tax on emplo yment income received under a share purchase agreement continue to be treated as filing taxpayers and include such income in their individual tax return. The timing and disclosure of amounts an employee receives as employment income is set out in section RD 6 and requires employers to disclose such amounts to Inland Revenue at the end of the pay period in which the employment income is treated as received by the emplo yee. Changes are also being made to section 46 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for when an employer chooses not to withhold tax on benefits an employee receives from a share purchase scheme. It is proposed that the employer must disclose details of the amount of the benefit received along with other pertinent details relating to the employee. The definition of “employee” in section 46 is amended to include former employees who receive a benefit under section CE 2 to which section RD 7B does not apply. Consequential changes are also made to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006. Background Benefits provided to an employee under a share purchase agreement are “employment income”. Unlike most employment income or benefits (such as salary and wages or a use of a company car), such benefits are not currently subject to tax at source under either the PAYE or FBT rules. This means that employee recipients of a benefit under a share purchase agreement must currently file an individual tax return including the benefit as income and pay the tax on those benefits themselves. For employees unused to filing returns and paying tax directly to Inland Revenue, the current collection mechanism may not be well understood and impose unnecessary compliance costs. These compliance costs can affect voluntary compliance and perceptions about the integrity of the tax system. From Inland Revenue’s perspective, the current rules impose a number of administrative costs. If an individual employee does not return the income from an employee share scheme, the Commissioner has to expend resources to collect a potentially small amount of tax from an individual. In April 2015, officials released an issues paper Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes which discussed the problems with the current collection of tax on benefits received under an employee share scheme. The issues paper discussed changing the collection of tax on employment income received under a share purchase agreement using the PAYE system, the FBT rules or a separate withholding tax. Changing the method of tax collection would shift the tax compliance obligation to file and pay from employees to emplo yers. Submitters were broadly supportive of the idea of shifting the point of taxation to source, provided the employer could choose whether to withhold tax. The PAYE system was the generally preferred method of tax collection. 18 Submitters argued that an elective approach would allow employers to balance the cost of compliance they would incur relative to the benefits their employees would receive when making a decision whether or not to collect and pay tax on their employees’ behalf. Submitters also generally recognised that any elective use of the rules would need to be accompanied by suitable disclosure requirement to allow Inland Revenue to know which employees had received a benefit under an employee share scheme. Inland Revenue does not hold comprehensive information about employee entitlements under share purchase schemes. The issues paper Simplifying the collection of tax on employee share schemes noted that if collection of tax on employment income under a share purchase agreement was elective, Inland Revenue would need information about the names and tax file numbers of participating employees and the value of benefits received under the agreement. As set out in the Regulatory Impact Statement to this bill, Inland Revenue considered a number of ways this information could be collected and concluded that the employer monthly schedule (EMS) was the best option as the necessary information is provided in a timely and administratively efficient manner. The proposed changes in this bill take into account submitters’ views. The objective of changing the tax collection rules on employment income received under a share purchase agreement is to improve the efficiency of the tax system from the perspective of encouraging taxpayer compliance and improving the integrity of the tax system. The change should also, where appropriate, reduce compliance costs on employees. Further analysis of the reasons for the proposed changes to the collection of tax on emplo yee share schemes may be found in the regulatory impact statement to this bill, published on Inland Revenue’s tax policy website, www.taxpolicy.govt.nz . Detailed analysis Shifting the tax collection point on employment income under a share purchase agreement to its source – the employer If the employer so elects, benefits received from a share purchase agreement under section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act will be treated as an “extra pay” for the purposes of section RD 7 of the PAYE rules. Such benefits will consequently be treated as a “PAYE inco me payment” under section RD 3. This ensures that the obligation to pay tax is transferred from the employee to the employer under the PAYE rules. The applicable rate of tax on the benefit will be determined by section RD 10 and schedule 2. It also ensures, for the purposes of section 33A of the Tax Administration Act, the employee is treated as a non- filing taxpayer because the employer returns and pays tax on the employee’s behalf. Emplo yers have the choice under section RD 7B whether to withhold tax on the extra pay. The choice is exercised for a share purchase agreement. The choice, once made for that agreement as it applies to a class of employees, is irrevocable. The timing for when disclosure is required (new section RD 6(1)(d)) is the pay period when the employee is treated as receiving the benefit under section CE 2 and should be provided in an employer monthly schedule for that pay period (sections RD 22 and RD 4 refer). 19 Consequences if employer does not withhold tax on employment income under a share purchase agreement If the employer chooses not to withhold tax on employment income an employee receives under a share purchase agreement, the obligation to file and pay tax remains with the employee. The employer, however, will have an obligation under the Tax Administration Act to provide Inland Revenue with details about the employer and the amount of any benefits an employee (including a former employee) receives under a share purchase agreement. Proposed amendments to section 46 of the Tax Administration Act define the term “emoluments” as including a benefit an employee receives under section CE 2 in situations when the employer does not make an election under new section RD 7B to withhold an amount of income tax. Section 46 is further amended by changing the definition of “employee” to include former employees who are party to a share purchase agreement to which section CE 2 applies. Including the value of these benefits in the EMS does not automatically create an obligation to withhold tax because if the employer chooses not to withhold and pay tax, the benefits received by an employee under a share purchase agreement are not treated as “PAYE income payments”. For the immediate future, disclosures made using the electronic EMS may generate reconciliation errors on the schedule. It is expected that such reconciliation errors would be eliminated in the future as part of the redesign of Inland Revenue technology platforms under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. Inland Revenue is preparing appropriate materials for employers to explain the changes and implications for completing electronic EMS. Interaction with social policy programmes administered by Inland Revenue The officials’ issues paper noted that changing the method of collecting tax on share purchase agreement benefits should not impact employees’ current entitlements or obligations for any of the social policy programmes by Inland Revenue. To this end, employment income received under a share purchase agreement will continue to count for the purposes of child support, student loans and entitlements to Working for Families tax credits. It is expected that the requirement for the employer to disclose this income via the EMS will improve the overall integrity of these programmes. Also consistent with this objective, consequential changes are necessary to the Accident Compensation Act 2001 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to ensure that any amounts disclosed to Inland Revenue via the EMS as a result of the recommended proposal are not taken into account. Changes are being made to the definition of “salary and wages” in section 4 of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to exclude benefits an employee receives from a share purchase scheme under section CE 2 of the Income Tax Act. A similar change is made to section 11(1) of the Accident Compensation Act 2001 to ensure that benefits under a share purchase agreement, proposed to be part of the PAYE rules, will not be counted for the purposes of assessing the ACC levy on employee earnings. 20 Information sharing 21 22 RELEASE OF GENERAL INFORMATION (Clause 117) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment will allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to release general information such as statistical data without needing to seek approval from the Minister of Finance. The current tests required to safeguard the privacy of taxpayers when releasing general information will remain but will be transferred from the Minister of Finance to the Commissioner. The proposed change is an administrative efficiency measure. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features • New section 81(4)(j)(i) requires that the release must be in the public interest; and • New section 81(4)(j)(ii) ensures that the information being released does not identify any taxpayer; • New section 81(4)(j)(iii) refers back to the considerations in 81(1B)(b) which inform whether the release is reasonable. Background Under section 81(4)(j) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 the Commissioner may release general information which does not identify any taxpayer if the release is approved by the Minister of Finance. The Minister must first be satisfied that the release is in the public interest, and that the information is readily available and can be communicated easily. Under the proposed changes in the bill, the three tests currently contained in section 81(4)(j) will be maintained but will be transferred from the Minister to the Commissioner. The test for whether the information is readily available and can be communicated easily is replaced with a reference to five considerations already legislated in 81(1B)(b). These considerations look at the effects on integrity, compliance, the impact on individuals or businesses, the resources available and whether the information is already publicly available. The reference to an “authorised person” will be removed as this will no longer be needed when the Commissioner is making the release. 23 ENFORCEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS (Clause 117) Summary of proposed amendment A consequential amendment is being made to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow Inland Revenue to share information with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and with WorkSafe. The amendment will allow informat ion to be shared for the enforcement of employment standards. This amendment is a consequence of the changes to workplace legislation due to be introduced this year. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features Following the amendment Inland Revenue will share information with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, and WorkSafe to facilitate and place greater emphasis on the enforcement of employment standards. Inland Revenue records should enable inspectors to identify and proceed against a breach. In respect of health and safety breaches Inland Revenue records will assist WorkSafe in identifying relevant entities and employer/employee relationships to assist it with enforcement. Background Wage and time records are a key tool which enables labour inspectors to investigate possible breaches of employment standards assisting with targeting non-compliance and investigating cases. Sometimes wage and time records are absent, inaccurate or falsified. Following the amendment Inland Revenue records will support the goal of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, in the Employment Standards Bill, to facilitate the enforcement of employment standards. Inland Revenue records should enable labour inspectors to identify and proceed against a breach. The Employment Standards Bill is due to be introduced this year. Where health and safety breaches are concerned, the aim is narrower. Inland Revenue records will assist WorkSafe in identifying relevant entities and employer/employee relationships to assist it with enforcement. Under section 81(1), Inland Revenue officers must maintain secrecy. Currently there is no specific exception in section 81(4) to allow the sharing of entity information for the purposes of enforcing employment standards. 24 SHARING BIOMETRIC INFORMATION (Clause 117) Summary of proposed amendment An amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is proposed to allow Inland Revenue to share biometric information with the Ministry of Social Development. This will allow research to be undertaken to determine whether Inland Revenue’s biometric information can be used to identify and verify callers to the Ministry. Application date The amendment will apply from the date of enactment. Key features An amendment is proposed to section 81(4), to allow for the sharing of information with the Ministry of Social Development which would allow for the verification and identification of callers to the Ministry. Background Approximately 1.3 million taxpayers have registered to use their voiceprint to validate their identity when they contact Inland Revenue. The technology is voice biometrics. Inland Revenue and the Ministry of Social Development are looking at a pilot where the Ministry will also use this service and access Inland Revenue’s bank of voiceprints. When a caller rings the Ministry of Social Development, if they are registered for biometric validation and agree, the Ministry’s systems will sample their voice, send it to Inland Revenue, and Inland Revenue will return a “confidence level” based on how well the voice matches. This is an information matching exercise. The Ministry of Social Development, taking that confidence level into consideration, will then decide whether further checks are needed before they continue with the call. Under section 81(1), Inland Revenue officers must maintain secrecy. In order to undertake the match, an amendment to section 81 is necessary to enable Inland Revenue to share the voiceprint information as the existing exemptions do not cover this use. 25 26 KiwiSaver membership 27 28 FUND TRANSFERS AND CONTACT DETAILS OF MEMBERS (Clause 213) Summary of proposed amendments The amendments seek to simplify the administration of the KiwiSaver scheme rules under the KiwiSaver Act 2006 by allowing Inland Revenue and KiwiSaver fund providers to share certain information about KiwiSaver members for account maintenance purposes. This information would include: • the names of members who have transferred out of a scheme and the name of the member’s new provider; and • member contact details that would not only encompass their email and address but also telephone numbers and any future mode of communication related to the member that emerges as technologies develop. The first amendment is intended to improve the service provided to KiwiSaver members when transferring from one scheme to another. The second proposal is intended to help scheme providers engage with, and communicate more efficiently with their members, and reduce the volume of returned correspondence to scheme providers because member contact details are not up-to-date. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features Sharing information on KiwiSaver fund transfers The proposed amendment to the KiwiSaver Act 2006 extends section 220B of that Act to allow Inland Revenue and fund providers to share certain information about members who have transferred out of one scheme and into another, including: • the name of the member; • their contact details; • the name of the member’s new provider; and • the member’s tax credit information. The amendment is intended to help improve service to KiwiSaver members. 29 Sharing KiwiSaver member contact details The proposed amendment expands the current information sharing provision under section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006 to allow a broader range of contact details to be shared between Inland Revenue and KiwiSaver fund providers. The new definition would encompass not just the member’s email and address, as the provision currently does, but also a telephone number and any future mode of communication related to the member that emerges as technologies develop. Background Under section 220B of the KiwiSaver Act 2006, information sharing between Inland Revenue and KiwiSaver fund providers for KiwiSaver account maintenance purposes is limited to sharing email and address contact details with scheme providers for account maintenance purposes. An extension to these current rules would allow Inland Revenue to also share a KiwiSaver member’s telephone number with a fund provider, allowing the provider to communicate more effectively with its members. In addit io n, Inland Revenue would be able to supply a scheme provider with certain information, including the names of scheme members who have transferred out of their scheme and the name of the member’s new provider and vice versa. This is not possible under the current rules. Inland Revenue is in the unique position of knowing a member’s contact details and transfer history and also has an on-going relationship with all scheme providers. Where there are differences in account information held by the parties, Inland Revenue can help facilitate reconciliation and resolution of administration issues. 30 MINORS OPTING OUT (Clauses 205 to 211) Summary of proposed amendment The bill proposes a new provision that would allow minors who have been incorrectly enrolled into KiwiSaver to opt out before their 19th birthday. This would provide some protection to minors who may not know that they have been enrolled and want to exit the scheme. Members who opt out of KiwiSaver under this new provision would have the contributions they had made returned to them, their Government contributions returned to the Crown and their compulsory employer contributions returned to their employers. Application date The amendment will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features • New section 50CD allows members who have incorrectly been enrolled in KiwiSaver when they were minors to opt-out of KiwiSaver up until their 19th birthday if: – they are aged under 16 and they have the consent of one of their guardians; or – under their own authority if they are 17–19 years old. • New section 59D applies the current rules which extend invalid membership for non- residents and over-65s to incorrectly enrolled minors. Background KiwiSaver is a workplace savings scheme that is open to all New Zealand residents under the age of 65. People can join KiwiSaver by contracting directly with a KiwiSaver provider, electing to join through their employer, or through automatic enrolment when they start a new job. Minors (children under the age of 18) can only join KiwiSaver if they have the consent of all of their legal guardians (if under 16) or co-sign with a guardian (if 16 – 17). These restrictions recognise that joining KiwiSaver, which locks in funds until the member is 65, is a serious undertaking and minors should be protected while they are vulnerable and supported as they get older. For this reason, minors are only able to join KiwiSaver by directly contracting with a KiwiSaver provider. These providers are best equipped to receive and review the necessary parental consent. Minors are not able to elect to join KiwiSaver through their employer and they are not subject to the auto-enrolment rules. 31 To date Inland Revenue has not received any complaints from minors who have been incorrectly enrolled into KiwiSaver through their employers. However, should a member challenge their enrolment there is no remedy available under the KiwiSaver Act that will allow the member to exit the scheme. Unlike a person over 65 or a non-resident, a minor is entitled to join KiwiSaver, albeit only by contracting directly with a provider. The current provisions available to reverse an invalid enrolment are only applicable to members who never should have been enrolled at all, not members who were enrolled through the wrong mechanism. 32 Other policy matters 33 34 FIF EXEMPTION SIMPLIFICATION FOR ASX (Clause 35) Summary of proposed amendment The bill amends the exemption contained in section EX 31 which operates to exclude certain share investments listed on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) from attribution under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules. Currently the ASX exemption broadly applies to shares in certain Australian-resident companies that are listed on an approved index under the ASX Operating Rules. The requirement that the shares must be listed on an approved index creates considerable uncertainty for investors and administrative cost for Inland Revenue as companies move on or off an approved index from period to period. To relieve the uncertainty, as well as reduce the administration cost for Inland Revenue, the bill amends the exemption to apply to shares in companies listed on the ASX irrespective of whether they are also listed on an ASX approved index. Application date This proposal takes effect from the beginning of the 2016–17 income year. Key features The bill amends section EX 31(2)(c) to remove the requirement that shares must be listed on an approved index under the ASX Operating Rules, and replace this with a requirement that the shares are in a company listed on the ASX. As a result of this amendment all shares in companies listed on the ASX which meet the remaining criteria contained in section EX 31 – including the requirement that the company is Australian tax resident and maintains a franking account for example – will qualify for the exemption whether or not these companies are also listed on an approved ASX index. Background Investments that qualify for the ASX exemption are not taxed under the FIF rules but are treated in the same way as New Zealand investments (i.e. they are taxable on dividends if the investment is held on capital account or on dividends and realised gains if held on revenue account). Dividend-only taxation, as compared to an attribution method under the FIF rules, is a reasonable approach for Australian-resident listed companies because the Australian tax system encourages dividend distributions, as the New Zealand tax system does. 35 The drafting of the current section EX 31(2)(c) restricts the application of the ASX exemption to shares included in an index that is an approved index under the ASX Operating Rules. The broadest equity index on the ASX for ordinary and preferred equity stocks is the Standard & Poor’s All Ordinaries index which consists of the top 500 securities measured by market capitalization. This index is re-balanced regularly so that it includes what is, at the re-balance date, the top 500 listed companies based on capitalisation (i.e. share price multiplied by number of shares). As a result companies can drop off or appear on the index from time to time. The periodic re-balancing of indexes, such as the All Ordinaries index, creates uncertainty for taxpayers as the tax treatment of the same investment changes with the re-balancing of the index from one period to the next. The amended ASX exemption, which applies to shares in all companies listed on the ASX irrespective of whether they are also listed on an ASX approved index, relieves the uncertainty and reduces the administration cost for Inland Revenue. It also better supports the policy that the ASX exemption is intended to capture the majority of New Zealanders' FIF investments in Australia. This amendment makes it easier for taxpayers to self-assess their compliance with the ASX exemption, as it is much simpler to check whether share investments are listed on the ASX (this information is publicly available) as compared to listed on an approved index (information generally only available from specialist market information providers such as Bloomberg). Further the amendment allows for more accurate and timely information access for taxpayers, as the ASX listings are updated more regularly than the indexes which are typically balanced quarterly. Improved certainty and information accuracy is likely to reduce compliance time and costs for affected taxpayers. 36 SUPPORTING CO-LOCATION (Clause 117 and 122) Summary of proposed amendment To increase efficiency in the delivery of government services and to achieve cost reductions across the public service, government agencies are increasingly co-locating. In this situation, Inland Revenue employees are exposed to the risk of inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government agencies at the co-located sites in the normal course of duties. Such disclosures would be a breach by the relevant employee of the current secrecy provisions in the Tax Administration Act 1994, and they could face severe penalties. This acts as a barrier to co-locating with other government agencies. The proposed amendment supports co-location by providing that an employee does not breach the secrecy provisions when they unintentionally disclose tax secret information in a co- locat ion environment. Application date The amendments apply from the date of enactment. Background The current secrecy provisions in the Tax information Act 1994 do not allow Inland Revenue employees to pass taxpayer information on to other government agencies except in limited, defined circumstances. There are severe penalties for any Inland Revenue employee who knowingly breaches secrecy provisions. Further, under section 6 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 every Inland Revenue employee must use their best endeavours at all times to protect the integrity of the tax system (including the rights of the taxpayers to have their individual affairs kept confidential). Inland Revenue is co-locating with other government agencies in some offices and call centres across New Zealand. While some co-locations have been able to be achieved while still maintaining physical separation between agencies (which minimises secrecy risks) such separation is not always possible – for example, in post-earthquake Christchurch co- locations are “open-plan”. Inland Revenue employees are exposed to the risk of inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government agencies at co-located sites. This could arise if the other agency’s employees were to overhear conversations (between Inland Revenue staff discussing a case, and conversations with taxpayers themselves), or if they happen to see Inland Revenue correspondence, or as a result of shared office facilities and equipment. 37 Given that further co-location is planned (including in open-plan sites) this gives rise to the issue of proximity with other government employees and inadvertent disclosure of taxpayer information with those employees. It is considered that no amount of training or best practice guidelines or adopted behaviour is likely to adequately address the substantial risk of Inland Revenue employees inadvertently disclosing taxpayer information to other government employees in the co-location environment. Detailed analysis Under the proposed amendment to section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, an Inland Revenue employee will not be considered to have breached the secrecy provision where: • the employee unintentionally discloses taxpayer secret information; • to an Inland Revenue employee or an employee of another government agency subject to same secrecy standards; • in a place in which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue expects Inland Revenue officers to perform their duties. The proposal will only protect the employee where the disclosure is unintentional. Unless otherwise excused under section 81, an Inland Revenue employee will have breached section 81 when they intentionally disclose information to another Inland Revenue employee or an employee of another government agency. Further, an Inland Revenue employee will only be protected where the disclosure is to an Inland Revenue employee or an employee of another government agency that has signed a secrecy certificate under section 87 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. A person who has signed a secrecy certificate under section 87 is subject to the same penalties for disclosing taxpayer secret information as an Inland Revenue employee. As a result, the proposed amendment to section 81 will align the approach to co-located staff working in open-plan areas, with the current approach to Inland Revenue staff working in open-plan areas. In other words, the proposal will apply the same high-level of protection for tax secret information to co-located areas as is currently imposed in open-plan Inland Revenue areas. The amendment will only apply to places in which the Commissioner expects Inland Revenue officers to perform their duties. This will provide the Commissioner of Inland Revenue with some flexibility as to the types of co-locating arrangements that are entered into. The amendment also confirms that employees of a government agency, required by their emplo yer to perform their dut ies in a co-located environment, can sign a secrecy certificate under section 87. 38 SPECIAL TAX CODES (Clauses 71, 83 to 87, 101 and 102) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to allow the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to provide special tax code certificates directly to the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) to help people receiving New Zealand Superannuation or a veterans’ pension to meet their income tax obligations. These amendments reduce the compliance costs imposed on superannuitants or veteran pension recipients in providing the certificate to MSD and remove any delay in the application of the correct tax deduction rate. Application date The amendments will come into force on the day of enactment. Key features Several amendments are being made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to: • enable the Commissioner to provide a special tax code certificate directly to MSD when the superannuitant or veterans’ pension recipient has applied for a special tax code certificate and advised the Commissioner they want the certificate to apply to their New Zealand Superannuation income or veterans’ pension income; • require MSD to apply the special tax code to the next payment of New Zealand Superannuation or veterans’ pension, or when this payment has already been calculated by MSD, the certificate will commence from the payment following the next payment; • require the Commissioner, once the certificate has been sent to MSD, to notify the superannuitant of the special tax code and that it has been forwarded to MSD; and • reflect the introduction of new section 24IB. These amendments are made to section 24F(4) (special tax code certificates) and to the definition of “responsible department” in section 3 (interpretation). Enabling Inland Revenue to send superannuitants’ special tax code certificates directly to MSD would reduce the compliance costs faced by New Zealand superannuitants or veterans’ pension recipients in complying with the special tax code certificate requirements and minimise delays in the application of the special tax code, thereby reducing the extent of any over- or under-deduction of tax at year-end. 39 Background The PAYE tax deduction system requires employers to deduct tax from the salary and wages that employees earn during the year. There are standard tax rates that apply to the deduction of tax from salary and wages and these are accurate for most employees. However, for a group of taxpayers the standard tax rates are not accurate because of the emplo yee’s particular circumstances. In these instances an employee can apply to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for a special tax code certificate. A special tax code is a personalised tax deduction rate that is calculated by the Commissioner to help the employee avoid an under- or over-deduction of tax at year-end by having the right amount of tax deducted during the year. An over- or under-deduction of tax during the year can occur as a result of such things as an end-of-year tax refund, tax losses carried forward from previous years, changes in personal circumstances, fluctuating earnings or the PAYE deduction system not deducting the correct tax amount on an annual basis. New Zealand superannuitants or recipients of a veterans’ pension, like any other PAYE income earner, can apply for a special tax code certificate and ask that it be applied against their New Zealand Superannuation or veterans’ pension income. The current legislation requires that the certificate be sent to the superannuitant and veterans’ pension recipient, who in turn, provides it to MSD. However, this imposes compliance costs on superannuitants and veterans’ pension recipients who, as part of the application process, would have already advised Inland Revenue that they want the certificate to be applied against their New Zealand Superannuation or veterans’ pensio n income. It would also delay the application of the special tax code, which increases any over- or under-deduction of tax at year end. 40 NOTICES OF DEDUCTIONS FROM SALARY OR WAGES (Clauses 169, 185, 217, 219 and 221) Summary of proposed amendment The Tax Administration Act 1994 allows the Commissioner to require an employer to make additional deductions from an employee’s salary or wages when the employee has defaulted on tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. To do this the Commissioner must first notify the employer and send a copy of the notice to the emplo yee. Currently these additional deductions are prevented when the defaulter has failed to notify a change of address so Inland Revenue is unable to advise them of the intended additional deductions. This amendment is intended to correct an administrative problem so the proper intent of the rules – that people in default of their tax and social policy obligations should make restitution – are realised. The TAA 1994 allows the CIR to require an employer to make addit io nal deduct ions fro m an employee’s salary or wages when the employee has defaulted on tax, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment obligations. To do this the CIR must first notify the employer and send a copy of the notice to the employee. Currently these additional deductions are prevented when the defaulter has failed to notify a change of address so Inland Revenue is unable to advise them of the intended additional deductions. This amendment is intended to correct this administrative problem so the proper intent of the rules – that people in default of their tax and social policy obligations should make restitution – are realised. Application date The amendments will come into force on the date of enactment. Key features When a defaulting taxpayer, liable parent, gaming machine operator or student loan borrower is already having PAYE, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayment deductions made from their salary or wages, Inland Revenue will be able to require the employer to make additional deductions from the person’s wages or salary to recover outstanding taxes, child support, gaming duty or student loan repayments, without concurrently notifying the employee. This will be achieved through amendments to similar provisions in each of the following: • The Tax Administration Act 1994 • The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 • The Child Support Act 1991 • The Gaming Duties Act 1971 • The Student Loan Scheme Act 2011. 41 Background Deductions from wages or salary are one of the most efficient means of debt collection available to Inland Revenue. If they are imposed soon after a default is detected they have the effect of limiting the growth of late payment interest or penalties as well as ensuring early recovery of the debt. Current law requires Inland Revenue to issue a notice to an employer when it requires deductions to be made from an employee’s wages or salary. Inland Revenue must also provide a copy of the notice to the employee at the same time. This requirement can pose a problem if people do not advise Inland Revenue promptly that they have changed their address, as the returned correspondence creates an “invalid” address and prevents the issue of further correspondence to that address. This means that although Inland Revenue has confirmation of the person’s employer it cannot issue a notice to make deductions from the person’s wages or salary because it cannot issue the copy to the employee. The proposed changes will help to ensure that people in default of their tax and social policy payment obligations repay their debts in the shortest possible time, minimising the application of late payment interest and penalties. Detailed analysis The bill proposes the following changes: Section 157 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will be amended by replacing current subsection (5) with a new subsection which maintains the same general requirement for Inland Revenue to issue a copy of a deduction notice to the affected taxpayer. However, new subsection (5B) will allow Inland Revenue to dispense with the requirement to send a copy to the taxpayer at the time the deduction notice is sent to the taxpayer’s employer for deductions to be made from the taxpayer’s wages or salary. New subsection (5B) will also first require Inland Revenue to make reasonable enquiries to find a valid address for the taxpayer. Section 43 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 will be amended by replacing current subsection (5) with a new subsection which maintains the same general requirement for Inland Revenue to issue a copy of a deduction notice to the affected taxpayer. However, new subsection (5B) will allow Inland Revenue to dispense with the copy to the taxpayer at the same time the deduction notice is going to the taxpayer’s employer for the deductions to be made from the taxpayer’s wages or salary. New subsection (5B) will also first require Inland Revenue to make reasonable enquiries to find a valid address for the taxpayer. Section 50 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 2011 will be amended by inserting new subsection (2B), which will allow Inland Revenue to dispense with the copy of the deduction notice to the student loan borrower at the same time the deduction notice is going to the borrower’s employer for the deductions to be made from the borrower’s wages or salary. New subsection (2B) will also first require Inland Revenue to make reasonable enquiries to find a valid address for the borrower. 42 Section 12L of the Gaming Duties Act 1971 will be amended by inserting new subsection (4B), which will allow Inland Revenue to dispense with the copy of the deduction notice to the gaming machine operator at the same time the deduction notice is going to the operator’s employer for the deductions to be made from the operator’s wages or salary. New subsection (4B) will also first require Inland Revenue to make reasonable enquiries to find a valid address for the operator. Section 156 of the Child Support Act 1991 will be amended by inserting new subsection (3), which will allow Inland Revenue to dispense with the copy of the deduction notice to the liable person at the same time the deduction notice is going to the liable person’s employer for the deductions to be made from the liable person’s wages or salary. New subsection (4B) will first require Inland Revenue to make reasonable enquiries to find a valid address for the liable person. 43 EXEMPTION FROM REQUIREMENT TO APPLY FOR CHILD SUPPORT (Clauses 215 and 216) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are proposed to section 9 of the Child Support Act 1991 to exclude some social security beneficiaries from the compulsory requirement to apply for child support when there is insufficient evidence to establish paternity, there is risk of violence or similar compelling circumstances to warrant an exemption. The amendments, which reflect exemptions already contained in the Social Security Act 1964, will align the two pieces of legislation and result in greater certainty for beneficiaries, and administrative efficiencies for Work and Income and Inland Revenue. Consequential changes are proposed for section 122 of the Child Support Act 1991. Application date The amendments will apply on the date of enactment. Key features Sole parent beneficiaries and recipients of the Unsupported Child Benefit are required to apply for a formula assessment of child support. It is proposed that section 9 of the Child Support Act be amended to include exemptions from the requirement to file for a formula assessment of child support. The grounds for the exemptions would mirror the grounds in section 70A of the Social Security Act. A social security beneficiary would not be required to apply if Work and Income is satisfied that: • There is insufficient evidence to establish who is, in law, the other parent. • The beneficiary or any of the beneficiary’s children (and the child’s immediate family where applicable) would be at risk of violence if the beneficiary makes an application for formula assessment or takes steps to make an application for formula assessment. • The potential liable parent died before an application for a social security benefit was made (they are widowed). • The qualifying child was conceived as a result of incest or sexual violation. • There is another compelling circumstance for the beneficiary not to apply. Sections 9(6), 9(7) and 122(2) of the Child Support Act are also to be updated to reflect that section 70A of the Social Security Act 1964 only applies to sole parents and not to Unsupported Child Benefit recipients. 44 Background The Social Security Act 1964 was amended in 2005 to increase the penalty that applied to a beneficiary for failure to apply to child support and to introduce new exemptions from the penalty. At the time, the responsible Minister indicated that if sole parents could prove such things as violence against them or their children, or it is proper that they are able to be exempted because they are refugees or asylum seekers or the other parent is deceased, they would not be required to establish paternity or apply for child support. However, the legislative changes only exempted beneficiaries from the penalty for not applying for child support – it did not amend the principal requirement to apply. The policy intent of the 2005 changes was that sole parents should apply for child support to ensure the other parent provides financial support for the child (or bear a financial penalty directly). In some special circumstances, however, it was accepted that involving the other parent was impracticable or inappropriate – for example, when taking steps to apply for child support would result in violence to the child or the beneficiary. Detailed analysis Currently, the Child Support Act 1991 requires all beneficiaries to apply for child support, while the Social Security Act 1964 implies that child support applications are not required when specified criteria are met. This creates uncertainty for beneficiaries over their legal requirements and inefficient administrative practices between Work and Income and Inland Revenue. Section 9 of the Child Support Act 1991 requires all social security beneficiaries to apply for child support at the time they apply for a benefit if: • they are expected to meet the definition of “receiving carer” by providing at least 35 percent of the ongoing daily care of the child; and • they are not already a receiving carer in the child support system. Social security beneficiaries are defined in the Child Support Act as sole parents in receipt of a main benefit and people receiving the Unsupported Child Benefit. If they fail to apply, the Child Support Act says they will be subject to a penalty under section 70A of the Social Security Act 1964. The two agencies can share information to determine which beneficiaries have failed to apply and therefore are subject to the penalty. There is no cross-reference in the Social Security Act 1964 to the requirement for a sole parent beneficiary or an Unsupported Child Benefit recipient to apply for child support. However, section 70A provides authority for a benefit to be reduced if a beneficiary has failed to meet certain obligations, including applying for child support in accordance with section 9 of the Child Support Act 1991. 45 Section 70A goes on to exempt beneficiaries from the penalty if Work and Income is satisfied that specified criteria apply. These criteria are: • there is insufficient evidence available to establish who is, in law, the other parent; or • the beneficiary is taking active steps to identify who is, in law, the other parent; or • the beneficiary or any of the beneficiary’s children would be at risk of violence if the beneficiary carried out or took steps to carry out any of the required actions (including making an application for child support); or • there is a compelling circumstance for the failure or refusal to carry out the required actions and even if the beneficiary did carry out the actions, there is no real likelihood of child support being collected in the foreseeable future from the other parent; or • the child was conceived as a result of incest or sexual violation. Furthermore, section 70A only applies to benefits for sole parents – it does not provide authority to impose a penalty on Unsupported Child Benefit recipients. While the Social Security Act provides grounds for when a sole parent need not meet the obligation to apply for child support, the Child Support Act indicates that applications are compulsory for all social security beneficiaries (as defined in the Child Support Act). The disconnect between the two pieces of legislation can lead to conflicting advice about whether a person needs to apply or not and creates uncertainty over the scope of the information-sharing powers between Work and Income and Inland Revenue. 46 CHANGES TO PERSONAL TAX SUMMARY REFUND THRESHOLDS (Clauses 59 and 116) Summary of proposed amendment When a salary or wage earner (not a business taxpayer) needs an end of year assessment they are issued (or can request) a personal tax summary (PTS). If the result is a refund they can confirm the PTS and the refund will be issued. If the refund is less than $200 and they do not confirm their PTS, the refund will be automatically released to the individual after 30 days. The bill proposes reducing the time delay and increasing the threshold so credits would be released 15 days after the PTS was issued if the refund is less than $600. Reducing the time delay to 15 days still gives the taxpayer sufficient time to receive, check and if necessary correct their PTS before any refund is released. Increasing the threshold to $600 will mean taxpayers who are entitled to the independent earner tax credit of up to $520 per year can receive this without having to contact the department. This tax credit is automatically calculated by Inland Revenue and does not require additional information from the taxpayer. Application date The amendment is proposed to come into force on 1 April 2016 and will apply to all PTSs issued from this date. Key features The proposed change to section RM 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007 raises the threshold at which a person must confirm their PTS before receiving their refund to $600. The proposed change to section 80H(3)(c) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that a PTS is considered an assessment on the 15 th day after it is issued, if a refund showing on that PTS exceeds the threshold set in section RM 5(1) of the Income Tax Act 2007. 47 CHANGES TO RULINGS REGIME (Clauses 130 to 131, 136 to 138, 145, 148 and 152) Summary of proposed amendments The purpose of the binding rulings regime is to provide certainty on a tax position for a taxpayer. The proposed amendments remove some unnecessary restrictions on Inland Revenue’s ability to provide a binding ruling and some unnecessary compliance costs by: • allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to fix minor errors in financial arrangement determinations; • allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to rule on issues that are not the same as the issues that are the subject of a dispute; • clarifying when a ruling ceases to apply when an assumption stated in the rulings proves to be incorrect; and • allowing the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to notify the publication of a status ruling in a publication other than the Gazette. Application date The amendment will come into force on the day of enactment. Background A binding ruling is Inland Revenue’s interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement. If a binding ruling applies to a taxpayer and they follow it, Inland Revenue is bound by it (provided that the taxpayer has entered into the arrangement exactly as described in the ruling, and that they satisfy any stated assumptions or conditions). A taxpayer is not required to follow the approach in the ruling. Binding rulings can provide certainty on the tax position for a wide range of transactions, from complex financing transactions to land subdivisions. Anyone can apply for a binding ruling on a transaction, but there are some restrictions on Inland Revenue’s ability to provide a binding ruling and some unnecessary compliance costs. Key features The proposed amendments remedy four problems with the current binding rulings regime. First, the Commissioner does not have to withdraw and reissue a ruling to correct a typographical or minor error in a ruling. However, there is no provision allowing Inland Revenue to correct minor errors in a signed financial arrangement determination. Instead, even if there is only a minor or typographical error in a financial arrangement determination, the Commissioner must make a new determination to correct the original determination. The proposed amendment will allow the Commissioner to correct a 48 typographical or minor error in a financial arrangement determination without having to withdraw and reissue it. Secondly, the Commissioner is currently prevented from ruling on an arrangement where the same tax type is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment (that is, it is going through the disputes process). This unnecessarily restricts the Commissioner from ruling on issues that are not the same as the issues that are the subject of the dispute. The proposed amendment will allow the Commissioner to rule on an issue unless a notice of proposed adjustment has been issued that relates to: • the person; • the arrangement; and • the same tax type or a separately identifiable issue. Thirdly, there is currently a lack of clarity about when a ruling will cease to apply because an assumption listed in a ruling subsequently proves to be incorrect. The amendment clarifies that: • an assumption must be material to be included in a ruling; and • a breach of an assumption must be a material breach before the ruling ceases to apply. Fourthly, there is currently a requirement that a status ruling be notified in the Gazette. In contrast, product rulings are only required to be notified in a publication chosen by the Commissioner and a publication of the department. The proposed amendment allows a status ruling to be notified in the same way as a product ruling. A similar amendment is also being made to allow the Commissioner to publish an extension of a public ruling in a publication chosen by the Commissioner and a publication of the department. 49 REPEAL OF SPECIAL HOME OWNERSHIP ACCOUNT PROVISIONS (Clauses 4, 47, 67, 68, 71, 111, 153 and 169) Summary of proposed amendment The proposed amendment repeals the obsolete special home ownership account provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. The amendment will allow an account to be closed without paying the withdrawal tax that would otherwise have applied. Application date The amendment will co me into force on the date of enactment. Key features The proposed amendment repeals the special home ownership account provisions in the Income Tax Act 2007 and the Tax Administration Act 1994. Importantly, the amendment repeals section RZ 8, which requires a financial institution to withhold the withdrawal tax from an amount payable to a person when the money has not been withdrawn to purchase a house. The repeal of section RZ 8 will allow an account to be closed without paying the withdrawal tax that would otherwise have applied. Background Special home ownership savings accounts were introduced in 1974 to help people save to purchase a house. The amount of the annual increase in a person’s account (up to a maximum of $3,000 per annum) received a tax credit of 45%. This occurred until the account: • reached a maximum of $10,250; • was closed to purchase a house; or • was otherwise withdrawn. When the account was closed and the money was withdrawn (and not used to purchase a house), a tax of 45% was imposed on the amount of the withdrawal. No new home ownership accounts have been able to be opened on or after 1 August 1986, and no tax credits have been able to be generated since 1 August 1991. Although these accounts are now very old, under the current law withdrawal tax of 45% still applies to any withdrawals that are not used to purchase a house. 50
