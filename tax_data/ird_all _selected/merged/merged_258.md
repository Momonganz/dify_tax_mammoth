KPMG Centre 18 Viaduct Harbour Avenue PO Box 1584 Auckland 1140 New Zealand The Chair The Tax Working Group 30 April 2018 Dear Sir Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper We are pleased to present KPMG’s submission to the Tax Working Group (the TWG). KPMG’s purpose is to fuel New Zealand’s prosperity. The tax system plays a pivotal role in the lives of all New Zealanders. We are therefore concerned to contribute to the effective development of New Zealand’s tax policy and administration. We do this by fully engaging in the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). This includes responding to Government and Inland Revenue policy documents and statements, and engaging with Tax Policy Officials and the legislative process. It also involves helping our clients to understand and comply with their tax obligations. The GTPP requires significant involvement by members of KPMG’s Tax Team. However, we consider this investment necessary to assist with ensuring New Zealand’s tax settings are fit for purpose. We are generally guided by a Broad Base, Low Rate (BBLR) approach to taxation. We apply a business overlay, however. We consider it important that the practicalities and costs of a policy are appropriately considered. As a result, departures from BBLR can be and are justified. The TWG has a broader focus beyond the usual measures of tax policy to include, particularly, fairness and the Living Standards framework. We have taken the opportunity of thinking about the tax system in a wider context but we have continued to test our response against the traditional measures. One of our concerns is the extent to which the tax system should be used to deliver wider public policy objectives, rather than raising revenue efficiently and fairly (while minimising the cost to administer and comply) to fund Government spending. That is not to devalue more holistic considerations in the development of tax policy. Those are important. The tax system does not stand in isolation. It works with and in context of New Zealand society. Further, tax policy may in turn impact on society. Tax policy has to have regard to that wider context. We have attempted to include those connections in our response, where possible. However, there remains questions of judgement throughout. © 2018 KPMG, a New Zealand partnership and a member firm of the KPMG network of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative (“KPMG International”), a Swiss entity. The TWG has been set an ambitious agenda and a demanding timetable. This makes it difficult for us to traverse the same grounds to make concrete and supportable recommendations. (This is particularly so as we prefer evidence-based decision- making. We have had insufficient time to consider and conclude on the full range of evidence.) We recently said to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee on the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Taxation Bill, “we have as many questions as we have answers”. We have used in our submission a series of “Judgement Boxes”. These, as the name suggests, confirm that it is difficult to find a single right answer. There are effects to be balanced and judgements to be made. As the societal context changes, the balance and judgements may change. We think it is important that, equally for policies supported and discarded, the factors considered and judgements made should be clearly stated. We would be pleased to present on our submission to the TWG, if the opportunity is available. Please do not hesitate to contact us, John Cantin on or Darshana Elwela on should you need any further information in relation to KPMG’s submission. Yours sincerely John Cantin Darshana Elwela Partner, Tax Partner, Tax \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 6 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper We describe the TWG’s task as “doing a jigsaw puzzle with pieces that don’t fit” or “like poking at jelly, pushing in one spot, makes another stick out”. It is difficult to provide a coherent, evidence based response to the TWG’s requests. Our response is more focused on particular issues. This does not necessarily produce a coherent result. With that caveat, our main observations and responses are: — Tax can be complex. It involves trade-offs and judgements. It is important that the trade-offs and judgements are transparent. This applies to a tax policy which is recommended by the TWG as well as for those policies that are not recommended. There is a role for the TWG to formalise and clearly state those judgements so they can be tested and, in time, reviewed. — There is also an education role for the TWG on the basic principles and issues of taxation. This will be facilitated by making clear its assumptions and correctly stating the basis for a particular recommendation. It should consider recommending particular methodologies for reporting on the tax burden. — We acknowledge the fairness case for a comprehensive capital gains tax. We can also see the opportunity that would provide for desirable simplification and rationalisation of the current ad hoc regimes which tax gains as income. However, it will not be easy to design a fully effective capital gains tax. The international experience confirms this. If one is to proceed (excluding the family home), we would prefer a tax as close as possible to the theoretical ideal, to minimise distortions. This means, for example, that it should be included in the income tax base with as few exemptions as possible. Targeted rules should be used to deal with specific problems. For example, a specific portfolio asset loss offset rule is better than a general loss prohibition. — We consider a single company tax rate is best. However, integration of the personal and company tax bases should be considered as a solution to possible over taxation of small businesses. The Portfolio Investment Entity tax Executive Summary 7 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper regime provides a possible framework for reform. — The international dimension of income taxation is one of the areas of highest risk to New Zealand’s tax system. New Zealand appears to be pursuing a tax policy ideal when it is not clear that the policy is ideal and when other countries are pursuing a self-interested approach. We are unconvinced that New Zealand’s approach, given its need for foreign capital, is in its best interests. It should continue to pursue a global consensus which best fits its position in the world. — Consideration should be given to options for reducing the differential taxation of savings. Fiscal constraints may mean that options for desirable reductions are limited. However, we would expect the TWG’s total package to consider the trade-offs. — The Māori economy has an important role to play in fuelling New Zealand’s economic development. The Māori Authority taxation regime needs to be modernised to include the different commercial structures being utilised by Māori organisations. We note its objective is to tax Māori Authority beneficiaries at their own tax rates. This is also consistent with our integration comments above. — To better target the “gig” and “sharing” economies (and address “black economy” concerns), we believe, on balance, a reporting regime for contract payments made to the self- employed is better than a withholding tax regime. — Similarly, the current limitation on employees deducting their work-related expenses may no longer be appropriate tax policy. It reduces fairness in return for administrative and compliance cost savings. Technology, including Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme, may reduce those costs so that fairness benefits have greater weight. — New Zealand’s GST regime is world class and we strongly urge the TWG to keep it this way. In our view: — The perceived benefit of zero-rating certain goods and services (e.g. healthy foods) to reduce their cost is unlikely to be the best means of targeting the social concerns. — The current “exempt” boundaries (for financial services and residential accommodation) should be reconsidered for their continued position as good tax policy. — Corrective taxes can serve multiple purposes – to prevent an activity, to compensate for the social costs of that activity, and to contribute to general revenue. In implementing (or continuing with) a corrective tax, the tax policy should be clear about the desired objective and there needs to be good evidence that tax, and not a regulatory or other, response is the best tool. Care also needs to be taken that a corrective tax sends the right signal regarding who is responsible for remediating the perceived harm. — We do not support wealth taxes or specific transactions taxes (such as stamp duties). Other tax bases are likely to be more efficient and effective and can be modified to achieve fairness objectives. — We support the GTPP, but consider that greater trust in the GTPP needs to be built to address shortcomings in how it has been applied. — There is a case for the Commissioner being limited in the positions she can take and for sanctions being imposed on failures of her process. — The methodology for costing tax policy initiatives can inhibit good tax policy, especially for remedial amendments. The fiscal costing methodology should be updated to allow remedial tax changes. 8 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Background 9 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper The terms of reference for the TWG are broad. They encompass the traditional focus areas for a review of the tax system, but also other issues, which require more holistic considerations. Their resolution involves judgements about whether the tax system should be used to achieve wider social and economic outcomes, rather than simply to raise revenue efficiently and fairly. The TWG’s Terms of Reference The terms of reference for the TWG encompass a number of broad objectives. These include consideration of the fairness of the tax system, whether it is flexible enough to cope with the economic environment of the future (which is likely to be defined by the changing nature of work and new business models driven by technological advances) and, of course, whether it can raise sufficient revenue to fund future government spending. These are the traditional focus areas for a review of the tax system. There are also a number of specific areas the TWG has been asked to consider, such as the impact of the tax system on housing affordability, the role of (and for) environmental and corrective taxes, whether there is the case for a different small business tax rate or changes to exclude GST on certain goods and services. These are more holistic considerations. They involve judgements about whether the tax system should be used to achieve wider social and economic outcomes, rather than simply to raise revenue in the most efficient and fair manner. The current system We make some observations and comments on the tax system in support of our response. A function of base and rate For any particular tax there is a simple formula: Base x rate = tax revenue The revenue raised is affected by both. Since the reforms of the 1980s, the political focus has largely been on the rate – increasing or lowering personal, company and GST rates. There has, with the exception of a comprehensive capital gains tax, been a bi-partisan approval to changes to the base. The reality is that many equity objectives have been met by changes to the base, rather than to rate changes. By way of anecdote... “Post the 1980s reform a KPMG partner compared his tax paid, before and after. It showed a significant increase in tax despite the lowering of the highest personal rate from 66 to 48%”. This illustrates that a singular focus on the rate is misguided. The total picture needs to be considered. 10 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Types of taxes We broadly divide taxes that tax: What comes in The income tax is an example. The debate is what should be taxed as income? Should this be a broad economic definition or the classical trust law based definition, which has been steadily broadened to include much of what is in the economist’s definition? A capital gains tax would fall within the former. Importantly, these taxes also require a definition of what can be deducted from income. This is important for most New Zealanders as they are unable to deduct any expenses incurred to derive salary and wages. They are taxed on their “gross” income from employment. This may play a role in how tax compliance by businesses is perceived, as we discuss later on in our submission. The private and capital expenditure boundaries, which deny deductions, also affect the total tax payable. What goes out The GST, a consumption tax, is NZ’s best example. The GST taxes private spending as well as activity (financial services and residential accommodation being two limited exceptions). Excise taxes are also taxes on spending. User pays and corrective taxes are typically taxes on spending. New Zealand has multiple levies that finance Government spending in particular areas. These include certain ACC and EQC levies and excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco/cigarettes and fuel. What you own New Zealand’s main example is local government rates – they are based on ownership and the value of property. The Fair Dividend Rate method, under the Foreign Investment Fund Rules, is another. A wealth tax and a land tax are other examples. Balance A single person, a household, and business, may be subject to some or all of these types of taxes. The appropriate balance between them is a matter of judgement. That judgement needs to weigh efficiency and effectiveness, keeping in mind that ultimately the same people may be bearing the tax. For example, a comprehensive land tax will affect salary and wage earners that are also owners of land. Therefore, when considering whether a land tax is appropriate the relevant questions would include: — Is it more efficient to impose two taxes (i.e. taxing both their salary and wages and the land) or raise the same amount through taxing just one base (salary and wages)? — Are there behavioural or other consequences that make the administrative and compliance costs of the land tax worthwhile? — Are there changes to behaviour that make the tax problematic (e.g. emigration of the person and others which may ultimately reduce the value of the land tax base)? The answers to these questions will be a matter of judgement. We have attempted to set out our analysis of the different tax bases under the broad headings above. As the TWG’s terms of reference and specific consultation questions overlap in a number of areas (e.g. the taxation of capital and the interaction of the tax system and the housing affordability objective), this may not be an exact fit. Key propositions We also highlight some key propositions which we have used in making our specific responses. BBLR New Zealand’s current “BBLR” framework, which successive Governments have retained, has as its main drivers economic efficiency and, to some extent, equity (fairness). The principle is that by taxing different economic activities relatively uniformly, regardless of how they are carried on and by whom, the efficiency costs of taxation should be minimised. That should also contribute to horizontal equity. That is the broad intent, if not the exact result, of the current system. Legal versus economic incidence of the tax New Zealand imposes income tax on individuals and their various entities. They are the ones legally obliged to pay - they bear the “legal” incidence. The tax system uses businesses and various other intermediaries to charge and collect the tax that is due. This disguises who actually bears the tax - the “economic” incidence. 11 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper For example: “A payroll tax looks like a tax on employers, but employees bear the tax because it is factored into employee remuneration.” This makes it easy for those advocating a particular policy to ignore this dimension (see our comments on removing GST from healthy food and the taxation of foreign direct investment into New Zealand). We acknowledge that the evidence for who actually bears a tax is not always clear. For example, the economic incidence of company taxation potentially falls on customers, employees and shareholders. The extent to which any particular group bears the tax is not clear. However, explicit consideration of who bears the tax is required to ensure appropriate tax policy judgements are made. The TWG should make explicit its assumptions on the economic incidence of tax when making its policy recommendations. The difficulty of determining the economic incidence of a tax also means that those paying may confuse the tax they bear with the tax they collect or pay on behalf of others. We consider there is a role for the TWG to make clear where it considers the economic rather than legal incidence of tax falls. This would make it easier to assess statements made on the contribution, or lack of, to the tax system by various stakeholders. The paying “unit” and differing attitudes to tax and spending Administrative and compliance costs factor into decisions on who legally has to pay a particular tax. This also disguises the position that ultimately it will be individuals who suffer the economic incidence of a tax. A company pays tax effectively on behalf of its ultimate individual owners, but legally pays that tax separately from its owners. This contrasts with social policy measures, such as Working for Families tax credits, which include income earned through an individual’s company or trust to determine their entitlements. The result of this effectively stricter test for determining a person’s social assistance entitlements versus tax obligations is that some of the most complex rules apply to those earning the least. Although this may reflect a view that there should be greater accountability for, and better evidence of a need, to justify Government spending, it is a notable difference of approach between the expenditure and income sides of the Government’s ledger. Testing who receives the benefit from tax paid The submissions background paper reports, by income groups, tax and transfer payments of different household deciles. This focus provides some insights. However there are potentially misleading simplifications. From a purely tax perspective, it ignores the GST, which all income groups pay. Taking that into account may reduce the highlighted “tax gap” between households in the highest and lowest deciles. Further, the analysis potentially ignores the wider role of Government spending. At a direct level, a public servant in the top income band is, at least to the extent of their salary, fully funded by the tax system. Less obviously, someone dependent on consumer spending is also funded, at least in part, by the New Zealand transfers system providing money to be spent on their particular goods and services. In short, such analysis, may suggest that the measure of the benefit from a tax is the return from the spending on it. This is relevant, for example, when considering corrective taxes or hypothecating taxes. It is less obviously relevant for taxes which fund general Government spending. As with the incidence of tax, the assumptions made around who benefits from a tax need to be clearly articulated to ensure that appropriate policy judgements can be made. Labour and capital taxation The economic literature and theory consider the different effects of labour and capital taxation. These concepts are not readily distinguished in New Zealand’s system. For example, the engineer owners of a professional engineering company contribute both their personal labour and their capital. The return from that contribution will be taxed in both the personal and company tax bases. The personal and company tax systems do not generally distinguish between labour and capital. (The personal services attribution rules are an exception.) There is a further complication in that the return to personal labour includes a return to human capital as well as physical endeavour. Note too that the other capital 12 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper aspects of labour income, for example restraints of trade and share benefits, are increasingly taxed as labour income. The lack of distinction is consistent with a BBLR approach. However, it does highlight a potential inconsistency in the taxation of assets which largely continues to make that distinction. To the extent that evidence or theory suggests there are advantages to differential taxation of labour and capital, its implementation requires clear consideration of boundary issues. Firstly, what is labour or capital and, secondly, related questions of deductible expenditure. 13 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 1. Taxing what comes in 14 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper This part of our submission considers what we consider to be the traditional tax bases – taxing income however defined. It therefore considers extensions to what is currently in the income tax base as well as possible modifications to existing taxes. A. Taxation of capital This section comments on the taxation of capital, both the income from and the capital itself. (This includes what comes in and what is owned.) Included in this section are some general comments and consideration of: the company tax (as the closest to a capital taxation regime), capital gains taxes (and taxes aimed at improving housing affordability), and the taxation of savings. 1. General comments BBLR in the context of taxation of capital There is the question of whether BBLR is still the right tax policy framework for New Zealand when considering the taxation of capital. Alternatives include basing the level of taxation on the sensitivity of the behavioural response to the tax. This is arguably more efficient – taxing only those assets or economic activities which are insensitive to the tax, or taxing these more highly, creates less distortions. However, there are trade-offs including the implications for the fairness of the system. For example, taxing land is considered very efficient by economists because it is in fixed supply (i.e. its availability does not shrink or expand as a consequence of the tax). In comparison, capital and labour are mobile. However, taxing land owners more heavily than business income (or employees) is likely to raise fairness concerns, particularly if the tax on land is not by reference to actual cash flows. Similarly, a lump sum tax (e.g. poll tax) is considered efficient because it is paid by everyone and the amount that is taxed remains constant regardless of income or wealth (i.e. the assets owned). It therefore does not alter individuals’ economic decisions. However, lump sum taxes are regressive as they have no regard to the ability to pay. There is also the inability to precisely estimate the sensitivity of different activities and investment decisions to tax. Therefore, there is a risk that policy makers could under or overestimate the behavioural impact, with the consequence that particular taxes may not be efficient (or as efficient as originally thought). Taxation of inbound investment One area where New Zealand’s tax system incorporates a behavioural-based element in its design is the taxation of non-residents who provide debt capital. New Zealand’s Approved Issuer Levy rules reflect the concern that New Zealand withholding tax on non-resident lenders will ultimately be passed on to New Zealand borrowers by 15 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper way of a higher cost of capital. (The economic logic for this approach is that foreign lenders will demand a total rate of return that is set by reference to global rates, irrespective of the NZ tax cost.) In our view, this is a valid concern for a country which is highly dependent on foreign capital to fund New Zealand businesses and households. This is also a relevant issue when discussing New Zealand’s corporate tax rate (and base) for equity investment by non-residents (i.e. Foreign Direct Investment or FDI). 2. Company tax The tax rate on inbound equity investment is effectively the NZ company tax rate. (The repatriation of NZ tax paid profits attracts a nil withholding rate for FDI.) However, the considerations for setting the New Zealand company tax rate are wider than just the tax rate faced by non-residents. KPMG believes the relevant considerations here include: Importance of company tax to the overall tax take This poses challenges not only in terms of the rate, but the future sustainability of the corporate tax base having regard to international developments (discussed further below) and increasing global tax competition. The latter’s impact is directly through company tax rate competition (with the US and UK leading the reduction in their headline rate to attract new investment) and indirectly through more aggressive positions being taken by various Governments and global tax authorities in claiming their shares of the global tax payable by multinationals. In KPMG’s view there is a risk that New Zealand’s company tax base will not be sustainable (certainly not in terms of its current revenue raising capacity) in the medium to long term as a result of these pressures. Desirability of company and marginal tax rate alignment With imputation, the NZ company tax is effectively a form of withholding tax on resident shareholders, with a “top up” on distribution to those on higher rates. Therefore, misalignment of the company and top marginal rates is not as big a problem as in other countries. In KPMG’s view, this provides scope for some differentiation between the company tax and top personal rates, without importing significant integrity issues. However, we acknowledge that there are limits to the sustainable differential between the company and top marginal rate (and other entity rates, such as the trust rate). That is, similar to the experience with the top marginal and trust rate differential in the early 2000s, a material misalignment over the medium to long term could give raise to unintended (but not unexpected) consequences. Whether broader integration of capital and personal income tax is feasible Imputation was introduced in the late 1980s as a solution to the double taxation of company profits for NZ shareholders. It relies on distribution of retained earnings for taxation to be levied at shareholders’ rates. Further, it overtaxes those shareholders on lower rates than the company rate as imputation credits are not refundable and restricts the ability to pay out non-taxed amounts to liquidation. NZ has other attribution regimes – the partnership and look through company rules – which mean investors, and not the entity, pay the tax. These have their own complexities and are not available for wide application. In 2007, the multi-rate Portfolio Investment Entity (PIE) regime combined final entity taxation with attribution of income at investors’ marginal tax rates (with some adjustments). With the advance of technology, KPMG urges the TWG to consider whether broader integration of company and NZ shareholder taxation is feasible. Impact of Australian company tax developments Australia both as a source of, and competitor for, FDI will influence New Zealand’s corporate tax settings. While small differences between the Australian and New Zealand company tax rates are unlikely to create significant imbalances or distortions, Australia repealing its imputation system or making deep company tax cuts will warrant a response. In KPMG’s view, this is an example where headline tax rates will be relevant to non-resident investors. Under-taxation of New Zealand “economic rents”? The question is whether there are economic rents (i.e. excess profits/returns above the global rate of return required by non-residents to invest here) that can and should be taxed. If not taxed by New Zealand, this would result in a windfall gain to foreign capital owners. This has 16 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper been expressed as a concern in Officials’ previous analyses. KPMG accepts that there will be some industries and sectors where there may be economic rents. However, setting different tax rates for different sectors based on the existence of economic rents does not seem practical. The evidence to support or dispute the case is not likely to be easily available or robust. If there is strong evidence of economic rents, then specific changes would appear to be better than a blanket policy response. Again, given the sensitivity of the New Zealand economy to foreign capital, we reiterate the need for our business tax settings to be evidence based. KPMG therefore urges caution in relation to differential company tax rates. Separate company tax rates for small and large business This includes setting differential rates for small and large business, which raise a number of concerns for us. In the context of a lower company tax rate for small business, this includes: — The rationale. What is the problem that a lower small business tax rate is seeking to solve? This seems to be ill defined. — Targeting of the lower rate. There is no consistent definition of a small business. Should this be based on turnover, number of employees, a combination of the two, or some other basis? How should it interact with the taxation of sole-traders, which are micro- businesses but not corporatised? What about small businesses operating through other entity structures, such as trading trusts? — The appropriate rate differential. The higher this is, the higher the tax “cliff edge” when businesses cease to be small. In New Zealand there is already anecdotal evidence of small businesses not taking that next step to grow. The tax system should not, in KPMG’s view, be a further disincentive for business to expand. In KPMG’s view, a better approach would be to address the specific tax issues and concerns facing small business. This includes: — The complexity of certain tax regimes, such as the potential application of the financial arrangements rules for businesses of this size, or the provisional tax rules. In relation to the latter, the Accounting Income Method (AIM) method is an example of how making it easier for small businesses to calculate provisional tax may be compromised. (In KPMG’s view the take up may be adversely affected by the need to make tax adjustments to accounting income when AIM payments are not a final liability.) — The need for simpler and clearer deductibility rules and higher de minimis thresholds for automatically deducting certain expenses. Small businesses should not be expected to have the sophistication of larger taxpayers when resolving capital/revenue issues. Further, an integration regime for small businesses would appear to be a better option than differential tax rates. The effect of integration would be to tax company business income at the shareholders’ tax rates. A “fair” allocation of international income – implications for NZ and other countries’ taxing rights As we have noted earlier, the taxation of international capital flows is very important to New Zealand as a capital importing and an exporting country. It is also one of the most difficult and, in our view, riskiest areas for New Zealand. The previous international consensus on allocating taxing rights to countries is changing. The global economy makes change appropriate. However, the revenue needs of nations means, in our view, that a consensus definition of “fair” taxation is yet to be agreed. We have described the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) international tax recommendations as an understandable compromise rather than a principled resolution to the problems. Other countries’ implementation of the OECD recommendations, if they are implemented at all, is generally focused on self- interest (often based on domestic political considerations). New Zealand’s approach has focused on tax principles, which leaves New Zealand as an outlier in the BEPS process. The risk is the result of the BEPS recommendations, which were aimed at combatting double non-taxation, will actually produce double taxation. Income taxation can act as a tariff. The chair of the TWG recently noted that New Zealand’s position is that tariffs are harmful to trade and consumers. In some ways, New Zealand is proposing to tax amounts that are not justified as amounts relating to 17 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper business or economic activity undertaken in New Zealand. Increasing taxation in this way means New Zealand’s response to BEPS has the potential to harm its position. New Zealand’s response should be reviewed to confirm its appropriateness, particularly in the context of the following international developments: 1. Tax base widening but with rate reductions overseas Overseas countries’ responses to BEPS have tended to be in two parts: 1. Implement base broadening BEPS measures that increase revenue; and 2. Reduce the corporate tax rate and/or introduce other relieving measures (such as “patent box” regimes, which apply concessionary tax rates to intellectual property held/developed in those countries). New Zealand’s response has been to implement the BEPS measures in full with no corresponding adjustments. We note that New Zealand’s ability to reduce the company tax rate is more nuanced than for most countries. The imputation system and the fact that companies have labour as well as capital income means that the company tax system is more aligned to the personal tax system, than in other countries. Differentiation in the base and rates can cause and has caused problems for the tax system. However, the lack of any movement on the company tax rate to compensate for tax base changes means New Zealand will be potentially less competitive in the post- BEPS environment. The TWG should have regard to New Zealand’s competitive position. 2. “User value” – defining the future tax base and taxing rights The particular problems of identifying the fair allocation of the tax base of the digital economy have led the EU and the OECD to consider the appropriate method of taxing digital economy providers. The proposition being considered is that users of a digital platform provide value, so the users’ country should be allowed to tax the platform provider. (The measure of that “value add” remains undefined but, to the extent taxes have already been introduced, the favoured measure is the income earned by the digital provider from business located in the relevant country.) This proposition is superficially attractive but New Zealand should take care: — New Zealand’s user base is comparatively small. In any allocation of global profit, an allocation based on user numbers (population) will also be small. — The proposition has wider implications that are more difficult to rebut from a principled perspective. As examples: o New Zealand’s tourism industry is at risk of other countries seeking to tax its profits on the basis that its residents (the users) add value to its products and services. o Equally, countries importing New Zealand goods could argue that the profits of the New Zealand producer (and potentially even the salary and wages of New Zealanders who are employed in the manufacture of those goods) should be taxable in their country for the same reason. From a value chain perspective, once value is disassociated from the places where the valuable inputs are provided and the value of customers is taken into account, it is difficult to argue the same argument does not apply beyond the digital economy. That has the potential to significantly erode New Zealand’s tax base. New Zealand therefore needs to carefully consider its position on the user value debate to ensure that it is not disadvantaged. Taxation of foreign capital – the impact of debt vs equity We have in our various submissions on New Zealand’s proposed adoption of the OECD’s BEPS recommendations noted that the taxation of foreign capital has not been addressed on a principled basis. Capital is taxed where it is employed. However, equity provided is allowed no deduction while debt provided generates an allowable deduction so it is partly taxed in the country of use and partly in the country providing the funds. New Zealand allows foreign capital to be provided in both equity and debt form. The effect of the tax rules is to allocate taxing rights to both the foreign country provider of capital and to New Zealand as the user of that capital. 18 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper The rate of tax on interest is less than the company tax rate. This naturally means that the total New Zealand tax rate on foreign capital is less than the company tax rate. We consider that the New Zealand tax system, through this mechanism, has a proxy for allocating taxing rights between the country providing capital and New Zealand. We accept that where that allocation is drawn is a matter of judgement. However, the consistent direction of change has been to allocate less to the capital provider’s country and more to New Zealand. To the extent that income tax acts as a tariff and FDI is mobile, the risk of: — not having a clear global consensus on allocating taxing rights for capital; and — increasing effective tax rates is that it reduces the available capital for New Zealand. The TWG should consider the appropriate allocation of taxing rights for the provision and use of foreign capital. Summary on the company tax Our analysis illustrates that with the New Zealand company tax rate there is a fine balancing act between factors supporting change and the status quo. That balance will also shift over time, as other countries’ tax policies (particularly Australia’s) evolve. Accordingly, the case for the status quo is unlikely to be enduring. However, we urge caution in considering: — segmenting the corporate base between small and large business, as we do not believe the appropriate case has been made; or — retaining current settings because there is a risk that economic rents may otherwise be under-taxed while keeping the current rate risks over-taxing normal returns. Globally, the adoption of BEPS and declining company tax rates represents a potential challenge to New Zealand. New Zealand’s approach of adopting the OECD’s BEPS recommendations but leaving the headline company tax rate unchanged will, in KPMG’s view, impact our relative competitiveness, whilst providing no real assurance that our company tax base will not be eroded away. 3. Taxation of capital gains This section of our submission deals with other ways in which income from capital can be taxed, starting with the most common form – a capital gains tax. KPMG acknowledges at the outset that the absence of a general capital gains tax is increasingly a deeply held concern for many New Zealanders. This is generally on fairness grounds, which forms part of broader concerns around inequality and relatedly housing affordability. We note the TWG’s questions in relation to a capital gains tax are explicitly linked to the latter. The economic case for a capital gains tax is, other things constant, to improve both (unarguably) “horizontal” and (arguably) “vertical” equity. It improves horizontal equity by removing the under (or non) taxation of assets whose return is by way of capital growth rather than a regular cash flow (e.g. interest or dividends). It improves vertical equity as the economic literature suggests that those on higher incomes disproportionately make capital gains, as owners of the majority of capital assets, and therefore benefit most from their under (or non) taxation. We note that New Zealand’s tax system has been ad hoc in its approach to taxing capital gains as income: — The most common situation where the gain is taxed is where an asset is acquired with the purpose or intention of sale. — In the case of land, there are special rules which tax gains made in relation to certain (e.g. dealing, development, building or subdivision) activities, but also land that is not held for these purposes if that is disposed of within 10 years if the relevant activity is carried out at the time of acquisition (including by an associated person). The bright line rules are a further extension. — The denial of tax depreciation for buildings has the same effect as taxing gains. This is because commercial buildings do depreciate, from obsolescence, as illustrated by the need to earthquake strengthen buildings. — The New Zealand’s financial arrangements and Fair Dividend Rate rules tax capital gains on an unrealised basis. These are often the most complex areas of the tax system and the source of greatest frustration for those affected. There are also other specific rules which also tax capital gains or elements thereof (for 19 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper example, the restraint of trade rules, the lease inducement rules and employee share benefit rules). KPMG submits that if the TWG recommends a capital gains tax, then there should be a rationalisation of the existing range of ad hoc regimes, including those listed above. Design considerations with a capital gains tax The ad hoc extensions to New Zealand’s income tax rules have been in response to specific tax base concerns. This is an approach which previous tax reviews, including the 2001 and 2010 Tax Reviews, have largely supported. This appears to be due to the practical implementation issues with introducing a comprehensive capital gains tax. KPMG’s submission does not re-iterate these issues as they have been well canvassed previously (we refer to the detailed work done by and for the 2010 Tax Review in particular). Solutions to those issues will need to be developed. However, we do wish to highlight some specific areas which will need to be resolved if the TWG sees fit to recommend a capital gains tax: 1. Double taxation A capital gains tax that applies to a company and the shares in that company will double tax. For example, say a company owns a capital asset that it realises for a gain of $100 (of which $28 is payable as tax) It does not distribute the gain as a dividend. A shareholder that disposes of all the shares in the company will face tax on a gain of $72 (i.e. as the net gain of $72 made by the company should be reflected in a higher share price), resulting in double tax. While we acknowledge this issue can currently arise (i.e. if both the company and shareholder are on “revenue account”) a capital gains tax will make this double taxation issue much more widespread. 2. Over-taxation of inflation gains This will be particularly problematic for long-held assets as the inflationary component of any taxable gain, even at low inflation rates, will be significant. The international experience is mixed. Some countries have attempted to inflation index and discount tax rates for capital gains. However, this comes at the cost of (often considerable) complexity. Therefore, if a capital gains tax is recommended, we suggest incorporating this as part of the income tax system (i.e. tax payable on the nominal gain and at marginal rates) to maximise simplicity. 3. Application date In KPMG’s view, this is likely to be one of the “make or break” implementation issues with a capital gains tax. In our view, the most equitable application is for gains made after the date of introduction to be within scope. This avoids applying a capital gains tax to gains made before the application date (if those were taxed) and providing a tax preference to assets acquired prior to the application date (if those were exempted). However, this will require consideration of available valuation options for illiquid and less marketable assets and the use of cost for assets which have lost value since acquisition. 4. Application to PIE funds A capital gain tax will be of particular relevance to investment vehicles that have exposure to affected assets. KiwiSaver funds and other investment vehicles, which are multi-rate PIEs, are required to attribute income and losses to investors each year. This makes a tax which applies only on a future realisation difficult. One option is to make a capital gain tax apply on an unrealised basis for such entities (similar to the application of the Fair Dividend Rate to foreign equities held by multi-rate PIEs). However, this will result in KiwiSaver funds (and other investment vehicles) being disadvantaged relative to direct investment. Notwithstanding our earlier comment, this may support introducing a discounted rate of taxation on capital gains for such vehicles if a realisations basis is not practical. 5. Ring-fencing of capital losses The rationale for ring-fencing capital losses is to prevent capital losses being brought forward to offset other taxable income. However, if a capital gains tax is included as part of the income tax system, there should be no quarantining of capital losses in KPMG’s view. One of the advantages of including capital gains as income is that it should be designed so as to remove boundary issues between capital and revenue amounts. Ring-fencing capital losses will mean that advantage is not realised. We note the current ad hoc taxation of 20 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper gains, other than under the residential bright-line test, does not ring-fence losses. If there are specific concerns with respect to the ability to advance realised losses and defer gains (with respect to, for example, portfolio investments), targeted rules should be considered rather than blanket ring fencing. 6. The private expenditure boundary. Much of the complexity of a comprehensive capital gains tax is due to questions regarding what assets should be included. Assets such as family cars and boats, lottery winnings can be problematic from a compliance perspective. One simplification that could be considered is to test whether the expenditure on such assets is denied as a tax deduction because of the current capital rather than private prohibition. In other words, if the cost would be denied as a deduction because of the private expenditure rule, any gain or loss should remain non-taxable under a capital gains tax. 7. The capital/revenue boundary for personal services. The capital/revenue boundary has continuously been eroded. The returns from human capital, for example, education and other attainments, are not separated from the return from personal exertion. Both are equally taxed. Other capital returns, for example, in relation to limitations on the right to work wherever desired under a restraint of trade are also taxed. These extensions are justified on a BBLR basis. They indicate that there is an element of inequity when all returns from a capital asset are not presently taxed. The related design issue is, as these items are taxed, should expenditure which is currently treated as non- deductible be made deductible? Amounts which need to be considered included the costs of obtaining qualifications for employment. 4. Taxation and housing affordability The concern over the lack of a capital gains tax appears to be most particularly acute around residential housing. As a general comment, it is not clear to us that a capital gains tax on residential rental property, which due to the TWG’s terms of reference must necessarily be the focus of any capital gains tax which affects the housing market, would make housing more affordable. Countries which apply a capital gains tax to residential rental properties do not uniformly show more affordable housing. We acknowledge this observation is anecdotal. But this is necessarily the case as extricating the impact of tax settings from other variables on house prices is a difficult exercise due to both the time and the practicality of testing for the effect of other measures. The point we would emphasise is that the TWG should be clear to highlight the support for its conclusions. Assuming, however, that there is a tax impact on housing affordability, and that a CGT would help correct that (and that the TWG’s own research confirms this), we respond to the TWG’s specific design questions. The family home exemption It is not helpful that the TWG is unable to consider any form of taxation on the family home and/or the land beneath it. While this may reflect the prevailing political reality, in our view it does make the question of defining the appropriate base, conceptually, difficult. It also means, in our view, that the answer to the question of whether the tax system adversely impacts housing affordability is even less clear. This is because the relative under-taxation of the family home, which forms the single biggest asset class in New Zealand, must be a material factor if tax is a factor in house prices. While all OECD countries have family home (or principal residence) exemptions, not all countries fully exempt this. Some countries attempt to tax gains above a standard level, the aim being to still tax “high-value” properties (to preserve progressivity). This design feature is worth considering if progressivity is a desired feature of a capital gains tax. Further, the exclusion of the family home means that potentially the reasons for its exclusion are not documented. We have in the accompanying Judgement Box attempted to document the pros and cons which support the constraint on the TWG’s terms of reference. We consider that the TWG should formally confirm and document the pros and cons so that the continued exclusion can be tested in the future. 21 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Current taxes on residential land The asset class that is typically perceived as benefiting most from the lack of a capital gains tax is residential investment (rental) properties. This is notwithstanding the changes in 2010 to deny depreciation deductions and in 2015 and 2018 to tax such property under the “bright-line” test. Therefore, this asset class is already subject to a form of capital gains taxation. The Government’s rental loss ring-fencing proposal, if implemented, will further raise the effective tax rate on residential rental investments. KPMG believes the ring fencing proposal should be deferred until the full effect of the TWG’s position and the Government’s response to it is made clear. There is an obvious overlap and possible changes recommended by the TWG would likely reduce the need for complex ring-fencing rules. Economically, it is not clear why a residential property investment that is taxable on the rental stream only is different from, say, a share investment held on capital account that is taxable on the dividend stream only. We note that equally, it is possible to have “dual purpose” interest expenditure to acquire a share as it is to acquire a rental property. The difference is that, practically, it may be easier to borrow to acquire a rental property but that is not a tax driven decision by the lender. However, there is a perception that residential rental property investment is potentially more egregious than share investment, and should be an explicit target of reform. We note that an undefined use of “speculator” in this context is unhelpful to developing an appropriate policy response. In our view, limiting the scope of a capital gains tax to a particular class of asset is not principled. While current perceptions about unfairness in the taxation treatment of residential rental investment need to be addressed, KPMG does not believe that in itself should be a basis for treating this asset class differently. The case for a specific tax on land needs to be evidence, rather than emotion, based. Again, the TWG’s conclusions should be explicitly supported by evidence. The case for a land tax We have similar concerns with any other form of taxation that specifically targets land, such as a land tax, if the principal objective is to specifically increase taxation on land. That should not be the driver in the absence of clear evidence that land is undertaxed relative to other assets, on a “like-for-like” comparison basis. (Discussion of land tax and other property taxes are included here, rather than under Part 3, due to their linkages with the housing affordability question.) KPMG notes that economists’ support for a land tax is based on a land tax being more efficient than other tax bases (and applying only to the land value, not any improvements). Its support is not based on correcting perceived or real under-taxation of land. That efficiency argument is premised on application of the tax to all land. The inability to apply a land tax to the family home land is likely to considerably narrow the efficiency gain from introducing such a tax, whilst also reducing the potential revenue base. When New Zealand did have a land tax previously it was narrowly targeted, applying primarily to non-residential land, due to various Judgement: Family home exemption from a capital gains tax Pros: — Not politically sustainable to tax the family home so — Gains may be overstated as own labour to make improvements is not reflected in the cost base — Deductions for mortgage interest would have to be allowed if the gain is made taxable, which are likely to be of most benefit to higher income earners Cons: — Reduces fairness (for example, it under-taxes owner-occupiers compared to renters) 22 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper exemptions that made it uneconomic and inefficient. Its practical application was limited. Another practical concern with a land tax is ability to pay the tax, as it will apply regardless of how the land is utilised or whether it is sold or not. This will particularly impact land which cannot, or will not, be disposed of (so would therefore not be taxable under a realised capital gains tax, for example). Potential examples include certain Māori settlement land. This again raises equity concerns around who will end up bearing the tax. We are also concerned around the potential macroeconomic effects from introduction of a land tax. Work done at the time of the 2010 Tax Review suggested the negative impact on land values (which given the family home carve-out will be borne by some residential rental but in the main non-residential landowners) could be between 17% and 26%, if a 1% land tax was introduced. It is unclear whether this magnitude of economic impact would make a land tax politically acceptable, which impacts its feasibility in our view. That was a concern raised by the 2010 Tax Review. The above factors makes a land tax difficult to support, in practice, particularly if other types of land are also exempted. The case for other land-specific taxes KPMG notes that stamp duties on land are common overseas. The closest examples are stamp duties that apply in the Australian states. As stamp duties are transactions based, they are relatively inefficient compared to a land tax, for example. Their revenue potential (like a land tax) is based on application to a broad base. The exclusion of the family home land will impact that revenue potential, if stamp duties are considered in New Zealand. (For example, we understand the majority of revenue that is collected in Australia from stamp duties is attributable to the sale of residential property, including the family home.) Therefore, stamp duties on land are not supported on either efficiency or revenue potential grounds. Overall conclusion on capital gains tax and land- specific taxes The strongest argument for the adoption of a capital gains tax in New Zealand is fairness. This is both in terms of ensuring people with the same ability to pay (but with different assets or means) are taxed the same and also to ensure the progressivity of the tax system (which is a stated objective of the review). We do not underestimate the impact of that argument, particularly for New Zealanders who have been “shut out” of the housing market. The fairness objective is severely compromised, in our view, by any exemption for the family home and the land below it. Such an exemption is also likely, in our view, to impact on whether a capital gains tax can and will have any meaningful effect on housing affordability. Finally, the fairness objective has to be weighed against the practical issues with introducing a capital gains tax, which this submission has briefly touched on, but others (including the previous tax reviews and the academic literature) have covered in detail. These are not simple design issues to be overcome. They involve some complex trade-offs. The vast majority of OECD countries have capital gains taxes excluding or exempting the family home. It can be made to work (and it works better in some jurisdictions than others). The question for New Zealand is whether a capital gains tax would improve the tax system overall. That will be a matter of judgement for the TWG. We note its 2010 predecessor concluded that the implementation trade-offs did not justify the introduction of a general capital gains tax. KPMG’s analysis in 2018 approaches a similar conclusion but we have elevated the impact on perceived fairness and the ability to have follow on simplifications as positive indicators compared to the 2010 position. As with other areas of the TWG’s remit, it is important that it makes clear the factors it has taken into account in making this judgement call. These need to be transparent and testable so that its position can be readily confirmed. We are clearer in our conclusions on the merits of a land tax. The likely exemptions mean it is unlikely to be an efficient replacement for other taxes while the estimated 23 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper impact on the price of land to which it will apply is likely to make a land tax politically difficult. Stamp duties are not supported on either efficiency or revenue potential grounds. 5. Taxation of savings One of the areas of policy concern noted by the TWG is the current taxation treatment of different savings (that is, capital that is invested for savings purposes, including retirement savings). Figure 21 and accompanying commentary in the submissions background paper notes the different marginal effective tax rates that can apply to different savings options. We agree that the current differential taxation treatment is problematic, from both a fairness and efficiency perspective. Factors for consideration We note that there are a number of factors that need to be considered: 1. The over taxation of gains attributable to inflation, which results in compounding savings in a bank account being taxed materially higher on their real return. (We note that this effect will also be observed for any taxed savings income that compounds, but the tax disincentive is most apparent for bank accounts.) 2. The introduction of specific regimes, such as the Fair Dividend Rate for taxing offshore share investments but also the financial arrangements rules which can tax both realised and unrealised gain on certain debt investments. We note that the rationale for these regimes is often mired in complexity and history. We have suggested earlier that a general capital gains tax may allow rationalisation of these rules. However, reform is warranted in any case. 3. The Portfolio Investment Entity (“PIE”) taxation regime (introduced to complement the then Labour Government’s KiwiSaver work-based savings scheme) is to ensure that saving through a collective investment vehicle is not tax disadvantaged compared to direct investments. A number of trade-offs have been made so that the tax regime is workable for managed funds: — The maximum PIE tax rate was based on the prevailing superannuation fund tax rate (i.e. then 33% compared to a 39% top marginal tax rate for individuals). As superannuation fund distributions were exempt, the then 33% on fund earnings was effectively a final tax. — The need to make PIE tax a final entity tax liability to remove KiwiSavers from having to file tax returns for their PIE income. A consequence of this approach was to have broader income bands at which the lower PIE tax rates still applied, to prevent over-taxation (of those whose only income was from a PIE as they would not get the benefit of NZ’s marginal tax rate structure). This also reflected previous policy decisions to remove most wage and salary earners from income tax return filing. — The non-taxation of PIE trading gains on NZ and certain Australian share investments reflected the practical reality that such gains were generally not being taxed if made by individuals holding these equities directly. — A more restrictive (i.e. daily) version of the Fair Dividend Rate for PIEs than for individuals investing in offshore shares directly, to make that regime work for funds. In KPMG’s view, the PIE regime needs to be viewed in that practical context, not as the introduction of deliberate tax concessions for retirement saving. 4. The under taxation of owner occupied housing, due to non-taxation of “imputed rents”. The issue of taxation of the family home is, as noted earlier, unhelpfully outside the scope of the TWG’s purview as it limits consideration of potential reform options. 5. Whether New Zealand’s current “Tax, Tax , Exempt” (TTE) approach for retirement savings, which is an application of the BBLR approach, is appropriate. Most other countries apply either a EET, EtT, or some other variant thereof. The submissions background paper suggests that moving to an EET model would impose significant upfront fiscal costs, particularly if current universal Government entitlements in retirement are retained. 24 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper How should savings be taxed? In the context of how savings are taxed, KPMG believes that the BBLR objective needs to be considered against the following: The low effective tax rate on owned occupied housing. The current tax system contains a significant “gap” in this respect. While the taxation of the family home is understandably a difficult and emotive issue, and there are a variety of different motivations for owning one’s home, there is nevertheless a current tax advantage to saving (and potentially over-investing) in this asset class. As the response of the TWG cannot be to increase the effective marginal tax rate on owner occupied housing, this leads to the inevitable conclusion that effective tax rates on other savings types should be reduced to introduce greater fairness and consistency in the taxation treatment of savings. The significant over-taxation of savings through debt instruments Figure 21 potentially underestimates the effective tax rate on saving through debt instruments – for example, foreign currency denominated debt – as New Zealand’s financial arrangement rules will fully tax any gains (including unrealised ones, if certain thresholds are breached), while potentially limiting the availability of losses (e.g. if the debt instrument is held with a “private or domestic purpose”). This can be a single-sided “bet” for investors from holding debt instruments. Similarly, the rules can give rise to significant volatility for those holding foreign debt liabilities (e.g. foreign currency denominated mortgages). KPMG therefore believes that the scope and application of the financial arrangements rules need to be reconsidered as part of any savings tax reform. Whether there is a social or public good reason for encouraging retirement savings through the tax system This appears to be the justification for many jurisdictions adopting more concessionary models for taxing retirement savings. The EET model is considered by economists to be an “expenditure tax”. That is, the income from such saving is not taxed as it compounds, resulting in a higher real return to such activity. Given the challenges and risks noted in the submissions background paper, including the projected increase in NZ Superannuation and Health costs as a share of future Governments’ spending commitments, KPMG believes it would be prudent to encourage greater self-reliance for funding some of these future costs through the tax system. We make three observations in this respect: — The current PIE regime is not a proxy for an EET model, for the reasons noted above. At best it can be said to replicate a TtE model (with the size of the middle “t” debateable). There is no broad equivalence, in KPMG’s view, to the concessionary retirement savings tax regimes in other countries. Using Australia as an example, the Australian model utilises both explicit concessions for employee contributions (these can be made at concessionary tax rates up to an annual cap) and earnings in funds (which are subject to a significantly lower rate than the top Australian marginal rate). — The submissions background paper notes that a move to an EET model accompanied with universal NZ Superannuation payments would impose significant fiscal costs. That, however, assumes that universality of superannuation is guaranteed in future. That assumption should be made clear so that if that Judgement: Reducing other savings tax rates to match taxation of the family home Pros: — Reduces/removes a tax advantage which is likely to incentivise over-investment in housing — Consistent with BBLR approach for taxation of savings Cons: — Misalignment with tax rates on labour and business income, meaning potential deviation from BBLR in a whole-of-system sense — Potential claw back of lower rate if not investing directly or outside the PIE regime — Fiscal cost will need to be funded from elsewhere 25 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper is no longer the position, the continued efficiency of a TTE model can be revisited. — One distinction that can be made between New Zealand and other countries is that overseas Government funded retirement schemes and pensions are often means tested or separately and directly funded by specific contributions. The latter can be seen in the tables which compare the make- up of the total tax take for different countries. New Zealand is one of the few countries that does not have social security contributions. Any tax “concessions” also need to be measured against how retirement incomes are funded in other countries and restrictions on accessing Government entitlements for those considered to have the means to self-fund their retirement. If Government is “saving” on behalf of only part of the population, then the role of the tax system in encouraging (or discouraging) the rest to save needs to be considered. Conclusion on the taxation of savings The BBLR framework is not fully effective in relation to the taxation of savings at present. Therefore, any discussion around greater consistency in the taxation of capital needs to incorporate consideration of appropriate steps to eliminate the differential in marginal effective tax rates for different savings types. This means considering reducing the over-taxation of savings compared to the taxation of owner occupied housing. That appears to have at least partly been a motivation for the previous Savings Working Group’s recommendations to reduce taxation rates on savings through bank accounts and to apply the PIE taxation treatment more broadly. KPMG supports the TWG taking forward the analysis of the previous Savings Working Group, as part of its process. 26 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper B. Taxation and the Māori economy The submissions background document notes the importance of Māori participation in the general economy, as well as encouraging the growth of the Māori economy, for New Zealand’s overall economic and social prosperity. KPMG agrees that it is important that the tax rules reflect the broad characteristics of the Māori economy. However, our focus is on the Māori Authority (MA) tax regime rather than broader questions that have been asked. In that regard, we consider there are others better placed to respond. The MA tax regime is a compliance saving measure which taxes income at source at the tax rate applying (on average) to MA beneficiaries – 17.5%. This means most MA beneficiaries do not need to file tax returns to do a square up at the end of the year. KPMG notes that there are a much wider range of commercial structures being utilised by Māori organisations than envisaged two decades ago, when the MA tax regime was introduced. This has given rise to a number of inconsistencies in how the MA tax rules currently apply. If the MA tax rules operate effectively, we believe it can be a significant enabler for further Māori economic development. We therefore consider that the TWG should ensure the MA tax rules are achieving the desired result in the current business and economic environment. We have set out in our submission some recommendations to help modernise the MA tax rules. Background The MA tax regime was designed to specifically meet the needs of Māori organisations who qualify for MA status. The MA tax rules have particular regard to the collective nature of land and other asset ownership structures, and cultural practices unique to those organisations. It also reflects the unique relationship that exists between Māori and Crown under tax law. The MA tax regime is an elective regime and is available only to entities that meet the criteria of a Māori Authority as set out under tax legislation. For most entities, the criteria is limited to entities that receive and manage settlement assets, is an asset holding entity under the Māori Fisheries Act 2004, or is established under Te Ture Whenua Māori Act 1993 (or owns land subject to this Act). The most significant aspect of the MA tax regime is that entities that qualify pay tax at a flat rate of (currently) 17.5% regardless of what type of entity structure is used. This rate is lower than the current corporate tax rate of 28% and the trust rate of 33%. The MA tax rate was set with reference to the marginal tax rate that applies on average to MA beneficiaries. It was based on evidence (including census data at the time) that the vast majority of MA beneficiaries were likely to be on the lower marginal tax rates. As tax is deducted by MAs at (on average) the right rate, this minimises the compliance requirements on MA beneficiaries from having to file tax returns and seek refunds. KPMG has discussed the TWG process and its objectives with a number of clients that are Māori organisations. These organisations, following the receipt of settlement assets, are now looking to the future and focusing on wealth creation and asset protection. They are making commercial decisions with long-term growth in mind, and no different to any other business, need to set up appropriate commercial structures to operate from and protect their valuable assets. Due to the current limitations of the criteria to qualify for MA status, however, not all Māori organisations and their commercial structures will qualify, resulting in a higher than 17.5% tax rate being paid – i.e. the 28% company tax rate or 33% trust rate instead. This results in beneficiaries of these entities potentially paying an overall tax rate higher than their marginal tax rate of 17.5%, with no ability to seek a refund by filing a tax return. (That is, the difference between 28% or 33% and their marginal rate is not automatically refundable). This results in at best a cash flow timing disadvantage or at worst (and more likely) a real cost if there is no prospect of MA beneficiaries earning other income to utilise the extra tax paid. This is unfair. The MA tax rules need to be updated to reflect the current economic and business environment that Māori organisations operate in and the different commercial structures they may choose. The importance of Māori organisations economic performance for New Zealand Māori economic development is an important driver of New Zealand’s economy and Māori organisations have an important part to play. 27 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper These have evolved over the years beyond the traditional land-based industries and their asset base is now diversified across a number of industries including construction, transport, and recreational services. The growth in their asset base has exceeded the general growth rate for all New Zealand businesses (e.g. in 2013 Statistics NZ concluded the growth rate in the assets of Māori organisations was around 9% compared to 0.7% for businesses generally). This growth is expected to continue as Māori organisations focus on long-term sustainability rather than short-term gain. KPMG’s report, quoted in the TWG’s submissions background document, provides further background and analysis. The current and former Governments have recognised that if Māori are to significantly contribute to the NZ economy, tax rules are needed to ensure that the Māori economy in particular, of which Māori organisations form the backbone, is able to perform to its potential. We note the MA tax rules have been hotly debated historically. In previous debates, concern was expressed that the MA tax rules would introduce favourable tax treatment based on race and it would provide a competitive advantage. The Government at the time supported a lower tax rate on MAs income on the basis it was about reducing compliance costs and removing unfairness in the system. That objective is still relevant, as the underlying principles behind the MA tax rules still apply today. The MA tax regime is not a charitable or concessionary regime, but rather a special tax rate regime which aims to tax at source at a rate that is reflective of the average tax rate of MA beneficiaries (currently 17.5%) thereby reducing compliance costs for MA beneficiaries from having to file tax returns. Those on a higher tax rate still pay tax by paying a top up when they file their tax return. Those on a lower than 17.5% tax rate can also file a tax return to seek refunds, but will only receive this if they have other tax paid income. The bias, if there can be said to be one, recognises that those on lower tax rates will suffer a real and unrecoverable cost if the MA rate is set too high. The business and economic environment has progressed since 2001 when the Government last engaged in an extensive review of the tax rules for Māori organisations, resulting in the MA tax regime. Māori are now engaging in business in a broader range of industries and entering existing and exploring new export markets. Māori economic development is not just about lifting productivity but also about ensuring processes, systems and structures in place are robust and effective to run profitable businesses. Accordingly, the MA tax rules need to be updated to reflect that they now apply to a much wider range of commercial structures than envisaged two decades ago, when that regime was first introduced. This means that there are gaps in the MA tax rules, which need to be addressed. If the MA tax rules are operating effectively, it can be a significant enabler for Māori economic development. We consider it is timely for the TWG, as part of its deliberations, to consider how the MA tax regime can be modernised to ensure it is achieving the desired result in the current business and economic environment. Options to modernise the MA tax rules We have outlined some recommendations to assist the TWG in its considerations. Recommendation 1 Entities wholly owned by a Post Settlement Governance Entity (“PSGE”) should automatically qualify for MA status in line with the PSGE. There is a potential for the underlying MA beneficiaries to pay a higher tax rate at 28%, resulting in a cash flow timing disadvantage or in a worst case a real cost if there is no prospect of applying the extra tax paid against other income. By way of an example to illustrate this issue: There are 2 neighbouring business operations. One is owned by a NZ corporate, the other by a MA. The MA pays tax at 17.5%, reflecting the marginal tax rates of the vast majority of its beneficiaries, and the NZ corporate at 28%. If the MA wanted to separate the business risk from its culturally significant assets, it can choose to set up a wholly-owned company to undertake the business operations. This company would not qualify for MA status and therefore pay tax at 28% resulting in an additional tax cost of 10.5% to beneficiaries. The ownership structure of the MA is the same – it seems unfair that an additional tax cost should arise simply due to what structure the MA chooses to operate 28 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper its business. The issue here is ensuring that MA beneficiaries, that overwhelmingly are likely to be on tax rates lower than 28%, are not over-taxed (when in many cases they will not be able to receive a refund). Those on rates higher than 17.5% will still need to file a tax return to pay any top-up. An alternative would be to allow the multi-rate PIE rules to apply to a wholly-owned subsidiary of a MA so that its income is attributed to the MA at 0%. However, in the absence of a fuller integration regime, this would be more complex than allowing a wholly-owned company to have MA status in its own right. Recommendation 2 Dividends received by a MA with imputation credits attached at the rate of 28% should be refundable where the MA cannot utilise the excess imputation credits against other income. This would reduce the effective tax rate on the dividend to 17.5% in line with the MA tax rate. Otherwise, the MA could end up with an effective 28% tax rate which is inconsistent with its MA tax status resulting in a cash flow timing disadvantage. This could also address the issue under recommendation 1, if a wholly-owned subsidiary of a MA is able to pay imputed dividends, with any excess imputation credits refundable to the MA. By way of an example to illustrate this issue: A MA’s only investment holdings are in NZ shares. It receives fully imputed dividends from those shares. If the MA receives no other taxable income, it cannot use the imputation credits beyond its tax rate of 17.5%. This will be a real cost to the MA and its beneficiaries as the overall tax rate would be 28% rather than 17.5%. A different answer would arise if the MA invested in cash term deposits with RWT deducted as excess RWT credits are refundable by Inland Revenue reducing the tax paid to 17.5%. We note that there is precedent for refunding excess imputation credits with the current multi-rate PIE rules. A MA should be free to determine where it chooses to invest without worrying about cash flow timing disadvantages or differing tax rates. Recommendation 3 The ability to group tax losses by MAs should extend to MAs that are not companies. MAs that are companies can currently only group their tax losses with other MA companies. It is not uncommon for a PSGE to be established as a trust rather than a company. This should not disadvantage the PSGE in offsetting tax losses with group entities that are MA companies. This change would reduce the cash flow timing disadvantages that can arise under the current tax law. By way of an example to illustrate this issue: A PSGE has tax losses and its wholly-owned company (which is also a MA) is profitable. The company pays tax at 17.5% even though the PSGE has sufficient tax losses to offset the profits. Overall, the MA beneficiaries have made no economic gain yet tax is paid on the profits of the MA company. This creates a cash flow timing disadvantage which could be a real cost if the PSGE has no prospect of using the tax losses in future. Recommendation 4 Imputed dividends paid to a MA should have no RWT deducted. This is to ensure the MA does not bear the compliance burden of seeking a refund of the RWT (usually 5%) and suffering a cash flow timing disadvantage. We note that this option can currently be achieved for a company shareholder if the company paying the dividend so elects. 29 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper C. Taxation of labour We believe the labour taxation base taxes a combination of returns to (human) capital and exertion (physical labour). It is not clear that interaction is appropriately reflected when making judgements on how different tax rates are set. It is important. For example, New Zealand cannot simply increase the top personal tax rate to fund revenue shortfalls or tax reductions elsewhere. This may result in those particularly that have acquired human capital (through education) deciding to leave our shores. This reflects that human capital is comparatively more mobile than other factors, as that capital is in high demand worldwide. This is especially an issue for New Zealand, given the high proportion of our population already residing overseas (estimated to be the second highest in the OECD, after Ireland). It also covers those who provide labour services as a “business” activity (i.e. operate as self-employed contractors) and those who provide labour services to a business (i.e. as employees). This distinction is important as the present rules can result in significant differences in the relative tax treatments, due to deductibility/non- deductibility of expenses. The self-employed versus employee distinction also has implications for the sustainability of New Zealand’s personal income tax base. The increasing shares of the “gig” and “sharing” economies are likely to see a larger part of the labour force moving from the employee to self-employed/contractor classification, with implications for the tax base. We have set our below our views on how NZ needs to respond to some of these challenges. Options to improve compliance The effectiveness of New Zealand’s PAYE system is based on it being a reliable third party withholding system (i.e. employers take on the responsibility of calculating and withholding PAYE on behalf of their employees). For self-employed contractors, one option is to introduce greater third party withholding by businesses that engage contractors. The NZ tax rules already require NZ businesses to withhold tax on certain contract payments. This option would extend the covered contracts. The alternative option is to require information reporting only and maintain the status quo, whereby contractors are required to disclose and pay tax on their income by filing a tax return. The information reporting option is likely to more closely meet the objective outlined in the submissions background paper of maintaining high compliance with low compliance costs, in KPMG’s view. We believe access to information can be as effective in ensuring compliance as withholding. If self-employed taxpayers know that details of their activities are being disclosed to Inland Revenue by parties they contract with, this should improve compliance. Effective third party reporting should allow Inland Revenue to construct an accurate profile of a self- employed contractor’s gross earnings and target enforcement action where there is clear non-compliance or where there is a lack of access to information (e.g. where services are provided to non-residents or in the “black economy”). We note that this reporting framework is already being developed under Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. (We refer to the recently enacted legislation with changes to PAYE and investment income reporting from 2019 and 2020, respectively). The withholding option, in contrast, raises boundary issues in terms of the scope of the rules and the deductibility of expenses. The boundary concern is that some contractors are engaged for relatively long periods of time (via fixed term contracts that are renewed), as is common in the public sector, while others will be contracted for a matter of days, weeks or months. It may not be efficient to target the latter for withholding. In terms of expense deductibility, some contractors provide services that contain a substantial capital component (e.g. a plumber), while others will provide labour-only services (e.g. a freelance writer). This means expenses will vary depending on the contractor. Further, contractors who provide labour-only services are treated differently from employees as they can deduct any work- related expenses. One option would be to treat contractors on an equivalent basis to employees and deny a deduction for all their expenses. However, this seems overly harsh and 30 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper requires judgement as to which types of contractors are providing capital-intensive versus labour intensive services, to the extent this distinction is justified. Other options would be to allow a standard deduction or introduce a lower rate of withholding to take into account deductible expenses. We note that all of these options are inherently arbitrary. In addition, neither withholding nor reporting will address the issue of expense inflation (the flipside of under- reporting income). Reporting would avoid some of the boundary issues noted above. However, this option will require Inland Revenue to be resourced appropriately to use the information that is reported. (We assume, however, that Information reporting would avoid some of the boundary issues noted above. However, this option will require Inland Revenue to be resourced appropriately to use the information that is reported. We assume, however, that Business Transformation should allow it to more easily cross match information received from multiple third parties, and to pre-populate returns to make it easy for taxpayers to comply. Employment limitation for claiming expenses More fundamentally, considering how best to tax the self- employed leads to questions about the policy validity of the current “employment limitation” for work-related expense deductibility. Historically, this removed wage and salary earners from filing income tax returns. However, with the Business Transformation design it is highly likely that individuals will have greater interaction with Inland Revenue. (This will be electronically and may require confirmation of pre- populated information, but there will be “touch points” in the system which can be used to prompt employees for information about their deductions.) Therefore, the current operational constraints around allowing expense deductibility for employees should not be an issue in the new system. From a purely equity perspective, it is not fair that an employee is treated differently to a self-employed contractor providing the same services. This also has consequences for how individuals may view tax equity in a larger sense. Much of the commentary around BEPS has focussed on how foreign businesses may not be paying their fair share of tax in NZ. This is often by reference to their domestic sales, not the profits of those business. By way of example, a New Zealand wage and salary earner may conclude that a foreign multinational with $100m of sales in NZ should pay tax on the $100m because they pay tax on their $60,000 salary without deductions. To them, this would be comparing “apples” with “apples” as in both cases the tax is on gross income. This is notwithstanding that the foreign business’s actual NZ profit, after deducting expenses, may only be $10m. KPMG recommends that the TWG use Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation as an opportunity to re-focus on the rationale and desirability of the employment limitation for expense deductibility. Judgement: Reporting of, rather than withholding on, contract payments to self-employed Pros: — Eliminates boundary questions (and may allow more contracts to be reported) — Eliminates need to factor deductible expenses to determine a withholding rate — Disclosure should encourage tax compliance Cons: — May still encourage “outside the books” activity — Difficult to match as income information, but not expenditure, will be provided to Inland Revenue — Imposes some systems development costs on businesses from having to report electronically — Lack of comfort that Inland Revenue will actually use the information provided 31 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper The “black economy” Non-compliance by the self-employed is a significant part of the black economy. We believe greater access to information, including from third parties, should assist with reducing non-compliance. We refer to KPMG Australia’s submission to Australia’s Black Economy Taskforce and the thinking contained therein (available here). Many of these ideas should be applicable and adaptable to the New Zealand context. Interaction between the tax and transfers systems It is important that compliance is not viewed in isolation – instead, it should be viewed in the context of the broader tax and transfers systems. Business Transformation provides an opportunity to consider whether it is possible to integrate social policy entitlements further into the tax system to get it right the first time. This should include consideration of whether the existing rules for the abatement of social policy entitlements work appropriately for the self-employed. If a withholding option is chosen for contract payments, the withholding deduction could potentially take into account social policy obligations such as student loan repayments, in a similar way to PAYE. Judgement: Removing the employment limitation Pros: — Applies BBLR to equalise self-employed and employment tax treatment — Increases fairness — Requires employees to be proactive in co nfirming their tax position (may include cash jobs in their returns which they don’t consider necessary currently) — Makes personal tax payments more transparent Cons: — Increases interactions with Inland Revenue which has compliance/physic costs — The cost of filing and administration may be greater than the benefits (but technology should assist) 32 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 2. Taxing what goes out 33 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper This part of our submission considers New Zealand’s GST as well as environmental and corrective taxation. 1 In combination with changes to the taxation of income, the introduction of GST also played a role in reducing the distortions that existed within the New Zealand tax system at that time. A. New Zealand’s GST “GST is simplest when applied across the board. There’s definitely a case for taxing goods harmful to health, as NZ has long done w/ tobacco” Former Prime Minister Helen Clark on Twitter (12 October 2017), responding to a question on taxing sugar and fast food and taking GST off fresh food. What is the primary objective of the GST? The primary objective of the GST when introduced was to raise tax revenue in a manner that imposed the lowest possible costs on New Zealand as a whole 1 . Thirty years on, this objective, taken in the context of the overall tax regime, should continue to inform decisions made by the TWG in relation to the future of the GST regime. “New Zealand’s GST is one of the simplest and most comprehensive in the world.” KPMG strongly agrees with the above statement in the submissions background paper. We believe this is a clear strength of the current GST regime, which the TWG should aim to preserve. We believe this approach is important to achieving, as far as practicable, the original policy objective. While the GST regime is not without issue, generally speaking, this approach minimises: — Technical and practical issues and uncertainty; and — Compliance and administrative costs. Current use of exemptions In our experience, the issues and uncertainty that arise under the current GST regime often relate to where the boundaries lie 2 . 2 Boundary issues currently primarily arise in relation to financial services and residential accommodation. 34 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper If the primary objective of the GST remains to raise tax revenue in a manner that imposes the lowest possible costs on New Zealand as a whole, KPMG consider that the current exemptions should not be expanded. However, we do discuss the possibility of relaxing or removing current exemptions and options for reducing the associated costs. Use of zero-rating to drive non-tax policy outcomes The current exemptions generally deal with technical and practical issues in applying the GST to particular goods or services. The submissions background document asks whether targeted GST exemptions, such as removing GST on (healthy) food, could also be used to: — Make goods and services beneficial to the wellbeing of society more affordable, particularly for lower- income households; and — In doing so, incentivise behaviour that is desirable. We assume that the policy question being asked is whether to zero-rate these items, rather than exempt them, from a GST terminology perspective. Otherwise, these items would be “input taxed” (in the Australian terminology) meaning businesses would not be able to claim input deductions for their costs. As well as boundary issues, exempting these items would generate cascading problems (i.e. irrecoverable GST would be built into the cost rather than being charged on the value add) as well as apportionment issues for relevant businesses. Zero-rating, would still have boundary issues but the other problems are less likely to arise. From a public policy perspective, KPMG supports the objective of increasing the affordability of goods and services that are beneficial to the wellbeing of New Zealand society. However, in our view, removing GST on these items may not be the most efficient or effective way to achieve that objective. Removing GST on “healthy” food as a case study A common public policy objective is to encourage greater consumption of healthy foods (or at least healthier alternatives). Its corollary would be to discourage consumption of foods that are considered unhealthy (note: a “sugar tax” is discussed separately). This has its basis public health policy. The question is whether the tax system, specifically the GST, is an appropriate mechanism to help deliver this public health objective. The first question this raises is what items should be within scope of any GST exemption? This goes to the wider public policy objective being sought. It is also where other countries have struggled with boundaries. For example, Australia does not apply GST to fresh food, but does apply GST to cooked food (including restaurant and fast food). This means a store bought sandwich is subject to GST but the raw ingredients are not, if purchased at a supermarket. The consequence of this distinction is also that the ATO has had to publish detailed lists of what foods qualify for GST-free status and not. The UK’s Value Added Tax has similar issues. Closer to home, the Labour Party’s previous tax policies have included zero-rating the GST on “fresh fruit and vegetables”. That raises the question: what if those items are included in ready-made meals? Should those also receive the same GST treatment? And whose judgement should be relied up as to which foods are deserving of GST zero-rating rating – e.g. is it just fruit and vegetables; should it include staples, meats, dairy, etc? In KPMG’s view, notwithstanding being driven by the best of intentions, designing carve-outs of this type can be fraught as they require judgements that not everyone will necessarily agree with. This makes sustainability a potential issue Secondly, we consider that further work should be done to confirm that the benefit of removing GST would be passed on to consumers. If it is not, the policy objective will not be met. Globally, we understand that a variety of “anti- profiteering” and price monitoring and control measures 35 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper have been used. Questions regarding the cost of food generally in New Zealand suggest that such measures may be impractical or difficult to implement. In our view, there is a real risk that the benefit from removing GST cannot be measured, to ensure it is passed on. There is a further risk that even if initially passed on, it could be lost over time as prices change. Measures to ensure the benefit is passed on and remains with consumers would have a regulatory or compliance cost. We understand that a focus may be to make healthy food, for example, more affordable for lower-income households, particularly given concerns regarding the regressive nature of GST. Again, while KPMG supports the broader policy intent, we doubt the GST system is the best means to deliver that. Anecdotal evidence suggests that removing GST may not benefit lower-income households, based on their consumption patterns. The benefit may go to higher income households instead. That needs to be tested. 3 Zero-rated in New Zealand terminology Wider empirical support in relation to consumer behaviours should be sought to ensure the removal of GST actually benefits lower-income households. Given the question of whether the benefit from removing the GST would be passed on to lower income households, we consider that more targeted non-tax measures may be more effective. Whether a rebate or grant scheme could be used to more effectively target assistance to lower-income households could be considered, although we appreciate that such schemes generally come with increased compliance and regulatory costs. Extension of exemptions to other goods and services We are aware that other countries provide exemptions beyond food. For example, Australian “GST-free 3 ” goods and services include some education, medical and childcare services. We acknowledge that it may be easier to quantify the benefit, and verify that the benefit is in fact passed on, for these types of supplies compared to food. (In part because provision of these items are likely to be more tightly regulated than general supplies of food items, meaning greater scrutiny already.) Our question here is one of scope and balancing public policy benefits against the complexity that will arise from narrowing the GST base. A single exclusion may not significantly increase compliance and administration costs. However, there is a risk of “scope creep” which could call into question the integrity and coherence of New Zealand’s GST. If an objective of the GST regime is to address wider public policy outcomes (e.g. in health, education or other areas) or incentivise certain behaviours in the future, it is important that the TWG clearly outlines the scope of the exemptions and its reasoning. Failure to do so risks damaging the current simple and comprehensive GST regime, through scope creep, and creating distortions and inefficiencies. Judgement: GST zero-rating healthy food to encourage consumption by low-income households Pros: — May reduce the cost of healthy food Cons: — Boundary issues are likely to be difficult for consumers and businesses – e.g. what is “healthy” and who decides? — Will apply to all consumption of healthy food so not targeted to low-income households — The revenue lost from availability of zero-rating to higher income households will need to be collected from other taxes 36 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper If GST exemptions are used to achieve wider public policy objectives or to incentivise behaviour, the TWG must clearly articulate the benefits against the additional complexity and risk to the GST base when outlining what exemptions should be made. Effect of exemptions on compliance and administration costs The above comments focus on the effectiveness of removing GST in achieving wider public policy objectives. Our experience in respect of current exemptions, and anecdotal feedback from our colleagues in other jurisdictions, leads us to believe that adding new exemptions will also create uncertainty and increase compliance and administrative costs. The further New Zealand moves away from the current relatively comprehensive GST regime, the more likely it is for errors to arise. A simple example that is often used to illustrate the uncertainty that can arise in the context of GST on food is the UK VAT treatment of a Jaffa Cake 4 . Is it a cake or biscuit? 5 Such questions illustrate the need for certainty in relation to any exemptions or narrowing of the GST base to minimise uncertainty and costs. The TWG needs to consider the effect of additional uncertainty and compliance and administration costs when assessing the benefit of removing GST relative to other options. Changing the objectives of the GST regime If the TWG decides that the future objectives of the GST regime are to influence consumption decisions, this change in objective should be explicit. The increased costs borne by registered persons should be acknowledged as a consequence of that decision. Equity and fairness of the GST KPMG acknowledges the potentially regressive nature of the GST. 4 https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-food/vfood6260 The perceived regressivity from the introduction of GST in 1986 and subsequent rate increases in 1989 and 2010 were offset by income tax rate cuts and the provision of transfers to lower-income households. We consider this is, in principle, the most effective means of addressing the regressive effect of the GST. However, the “compensation” should be reviewed periodically to ensure it remains appropriate and sufficient to address the effects, rather than just considered at the time of any change. We acknowledge that this may be adjusted through welfare system benefit changes that are made from time to time. However, it is not apparent that the effect of any tax mix change is explicitly factored into such decisions. Changes to the GST rate Increasing the GST rate Increasing the GST rate is outside of the TWG’s terms of reference. We believe this should have been included in the scope of the TWG’s review as it is material to the discussion on the overall tax revenue mix for New Zealand, particularly given some of the risks and challenges identified in the submissions background paper, which may impact the sustainability of the company and personal income tax bases. Lowering the GST rate This should similarly be part of the discussion on the appropriate tax revenue mix for New Zealand KPMG believes the current GST rate should be maintained at 15% given the efficiency and relatively low compliance and administrative costs of the GST regime compared to other taxes. These factors were considered by the 2010 Tax Review as a rationale for its recommendation to increase the GST rate, in addition to the fact that New Zealand has a low GST rate by international standards (at 12.5% prior to and 5 It was ruled to be a biscuit partly covered in chocolate and accordingly standard-rated. 37 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 15% post the 2010 rate change). Therefore, to the extent that revenue is raised from other, new taxes, we would support lowering the corporate and/or personal income tax rates rather than the GST rate. Alternatively, new revenue bases may provide scope for the GST exemptions discussed above. Lowering the GST rate would benefit all consumers. In principle, and subject to any further work being done by the TWG, any regressive effects of the GST for lower- income households would remain. That alone would not appear to justify a lowering of the GST rate. In addition, a significant part of the benefit would be passed-on to non- residents visiting New Zealand. Whether this would have a positive, or any, effect on the tourism industry and New Zealand’s overall GDP would need to be considered. To the extent there is a reduction in overall Government revenue that would need to be made up elsewhere (i.e. by New Zealand residents in other taxes that they pay). In light of the above comments, we consider that further work would need to be done by the TWG to establish the rationale for lowering the GST rate as part of any rebalancing of the overall tax revenue mix. Destination principle We consider that the design of the GST regime, which is based on the “destination principle” 6 , remains appropriate. This is consistent with OECD principles, which should serve to minimise the potential for double taxation. In addition, this reflects the generally accepted view that the alternative, being the application of GST based on the “origin” of the goods or services, has valuation and fairness issues. Revenue authorities worldwide continue to look for new ways of increasing tax revenue. Looking forward, we consider that Government and Officials should remain alert to any proposed changes to the destination principle. 6 That is, based on the jurisdiction where the goods and services are consumed In particular, a GST regime based on the residency of the consumer would have a significant risk of eroding the New Zealand tax base in respect of tourism 7 and the export of goods and services. Expanding the current GST base 1. GST on imported goods and (remote) services KPMG supports the policy of applying GST to goods and services consumed in New Zealand. The proviso is that this should be done as efficiently and at the least cost as possible. In this regard, we support a practical approach rather than looking to capture every last dollar of revenue. 2. Financial services We have considered whether there is a basis for relaxing or removing the current financial services exemption, particularly given changes in technology since the GST regime was originally introduced. However, despite technological changes, we consider the fundamental difficultly in identifying and measuring the value added to many financial supplies on a transaction-by-transaction basis remains. Alternatives could be considered if there is a need to expand the GST base. For example, in the case of money lent, the net interest could be used as a proxy for the services supplied. This has some attractiveness in terms of simplifying the current regime, as often a significant amount of time is spent on GST apportionment by lenders. However, the issue of what is paid for the service and for the time value of money remains. On balance we believe it is preferable to maintain the current exemptions. This broadly aligns with international practice. The effect of the financial services exemption does, however, have material effects. This creates a bias for 7 Tourists generated $2.8 billion in GST revenue during the year ended 31 March 2016: www.tourismnewzealand.com/about/about-the-industry/ 38 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper “insourcing” rather than “outsourcing” services to reduce the GST cost for investors. In addition, Inland Revenue’s recent draft view on the GST treatment of investment management services provided to unit trusts has caused concerns in the funds management industry and has the potential to adversely affect savings 8 . We understand the latter issue is being considered by Inland Revenue. In our view, any cascading of GST as a result of exemptions should be addressed as a matter of urgency. The insource bias could be mitigated through a Reduced Input Tax Credit (RITC) scheme, similar to that adopted in Australia. Under the scheme, the financial service supplier would be entitled to recover a percentage of the input tax on costs incurred. Typically, the rate is set so as to give the supplier an input tax credit estimated to be equal to the GST on the value added by the outsourced supplier. From a longer term perspective, consideration should be given to whether zero-rating financial services is a more appropriate policy. Briefly, work done in the early 2000s suggested that applying GST to financial services was the equivalent of taxing money flows rather than consumption. The appropriate response is therefore to zero-rate financial services. We acknowledge that there are fiscal consequences of such a significant change. However, if the TWG’s analysis confirms this approach that is the right policy position to advance. 3. Residential accommodation KPMG agrees with the comments in the submissions background paper that applying GST to rent creates practical and fairness issues. 8 The specific issues relate to the boundary of what is the arranging of a financial service. 9 A key issue would be dealing with the second-hand input tax credit under existing rules. In principle, this could be dealt with by deferring GST until sale of the residential rental property. In particular: — Increased rental costs, including for the Government from increased accommodation supplements. — The question of how rental properties would be brought into the GST net 9 . — The increased number of taxpayers required to file GST returns as a result. Having said that, in theory, the cost of GST cascades into rent for the property cost and for property expenses. Further, no GST is collected when a residential property is sold for private ownership (compared to a new build acquired from a developer). Therefore, applying GST to residential rents would have the effect of making the GST more explicit. However, further thought would be required on the technical aspects of this. Judgement: Removing the residential accommodation GST exemption Pros: — Treats residential rental equally with other activities — Prevents the cascading of GST through the supply chain — Removes the insource bias for services provided for residential property Cons: — The fiscal cost of input tax on residential property is likely to require a special rule — The GST is likely to be passed on, to the full extent possible, to tenants raising rental costs 39 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Similar to financial services, the current exemption also creates an insource bias. This is particularly relevant to social housing providers, who are encouraged to in source irrespective of the best outcomes for social housing tenants. As the Government considers how best to provide services to social housing tenants, it should consider whether a scheme, similar to the RITC, could help deliver better outcomes. Effect of future technology on GST administration and compliance The broader question of technology and its impact on the GST system should also be considered by the TWG. By way of example, in Brazil most companies are now required to issue invoices electronically and these invoices are subject to real-time approval by the Brazilian tax office. We are not suggesting a similar regime be adopted in New Zealand, as the issues driving the Brazilian regime (including significant non-compliance) differ from New Zealand. However, this demonstrates how technology can be used to change practices, particularly for transactional taxes, given the significant volumes. The application of the Blockchain in the sphere of indirect tax is also becoming a much discussed topic. Whether the use of distributed ledgers can eliminate the need for tax invoices, a key aspect of the current regime, has been raised by some commentators. The potential application of future technologies is beyond the scope of this submission. However, we believe Government and Officials should have a focus on future technologies and how they can continue to increase efficiency and integrity of information and reduce compliance and administration costs. 40 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper B. Corrective and hypothecated taxes We consider below the case for corrective taxation regimes. The submissions background paper notes environmental taxation is an area where New Zealand lags behind other OECD countries (in terms of revenue collected as a percentage of GDP). The document also validly notes that the design and targeting of such taxes is critical. Earlier in our submission (and in relation to the use of the GST system) we outlined concerns with using existing tax bases in a way which conflicts with standard tax policy objectives, namely raising revenue efficiently and fairly (and at least cost to Government and taxpayers). We note that these objectives are not generally relevant in the case of tax policies whose principal objective is to change behaviour. Our concern is ensuring that, at the outset, it is clear what the objectives of a particular tax are. What is the purpose of the proposed tax? There are a number of existing excise taxes on tobacco, cigarettes, alcohol, and gaming, which qualify as “corrective taxes”. When considering any tax, it should be clear what its principal purpose is. Is the purpose of the tax to change behaviour, or to collect revenue to cover the costs of negative or harmful behaviours (i.e. a form of user pays), or to collect revenue for the “consolidated fund” (i.e. to finance general Government spending)? The issue is that, in practice, these objectives tend to overlap. If the tax is intended to influence/correct behaviour, to be successful the tax should raise little or no revenue. However, this creates an issue for Governments as such a tax cannot be relied upon to contribute to the consolidated fund. The assumption must be that the tax will not be wholly successful in correcting the behaviour – there will still be those who undertake it. This means there must be sufficient revenue to cover the costs of remediating the behaviour. Accordingly, ensuring that the tax does not inappropriately transfer the costs of remediating from an individual or business’s balance sheet to society as a whole is a related objective. For example, if set up as a cost recovery tax, if the actual costs are greater than the amount raised, the Government is likely to have to fund that difference rather than the taxpayer or business responsible. The success of behavioural taxation depends on the sensitivity of the particular activity/consumption to the tax that is levied. In economists’ terms, if demand of the activity/consumption is “elastic”, the tax will have most effect. If not, then a higher rate of taxation will be necessary to effect the desired behavioural change. Demand for alcohol, cigarettes and tobacco (and to a lesser extent fuel) are generally considered to be “inelastic” goods. Accordingly, high rates of excise duty are likely to be necessary to change behaviour away from consuming these goods. This is illustrated, we believe, by the duty revenue currently collected from these items, which is not insubstantial, and ever increasing duty rates on cigarettes and tobacco in particular. This underscores a potential conflict for Government, the need (or certainly the desire) for the revenue balanced with the behavioural change objective of the tax. This is compounded by the fact that excise duties, in KPMG’s view, could well end up hurting the very groups they are intended to help. There is evidence that excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes and tobacco tend to be regressive, as they will comprise a larger part of overall spending for those on lower incomes, compared to higher income consumers. Therefore, assuming demand is relatively inelastic, the impact of higher excise duties may well be to substitute spending away from other household spending, to continued consumption of those items the Government would like to discourage. To circle back to our first point, if excise duties were effective in changing behaviour, this should be reflected in the tax revenues collected being negligible. 41 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper This is not to say that excise duties are ineffective. The question is whether other regulatory approaches are more so. High rates of duty may also lead to increased crime and ‘black markets’ in these goods, which have wider social implications. The TWG should outline the clear purpose for corrective taxation and test whether corrective taxes meet the stated public policy objective. Sugar tax As with all corrective taxes, the introduction of such a tax should be evidence-based. Consideration should be given to the social costs (e.g. greater obesity related illnesses and need for additional healthcare spending as a result) created by the consumption of sugar and the evidence of whether the introduction of a tax will mitigate this. We have not had time to review the evidence available from other jurisdictions that have introduced a sugar tax in some form. We agree in principle that it is fair for taxes to be targeted to ensure that consumers bear the costs of their decisions (i.e. to mitigate “moral hazard”). However, we caution against singling out specific goods for corrective taxation. While not public health professionals, we note that there will be other food types that can be said to also contribute to obesity, illness and related health issues. Why should those not face similar treatment? In addition, any potential corrective tax solution should be weighed against the alternatives, e.g. targeted public education programmes and non-tax regulatory measures. Environmental taxes The submissions background paper notes that New Zealand faces environmental challenges such as climate change and the loss of ecosystem services and native species. We agree that these issues are important given the centrality of natural resources and the environment to our economy (through agriculture and tourism) and to the lives and wellbeing of all New Zealanders. It is important that consumers and producers face the costs of emissions and other negative externalities on New Zealand’s natural environment created by their consumption/production activity. Taxes may have a role to play in ensuring true costs are met but, again, the question is whether taxes are the best way to do this. We note that on entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, consideration was given to how New Zealand could best achieve its international obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A carbon tax was one option considered, but was ultimately rejected in favour of an emissions trading scheme. Again, this reflects judgements about different mechanisms that can be used to achieve the desired public policy objective. We view environmental taxes as a subset of corrective taxes. Accordingly, the introduction of any new Judgement: No sugar tax Pros: — Sends a price signal of the social cost of sugar consumption Cons: — Potential impact is not clear — Likely to be regressive — Difficult to estimate the actual cost of the behaviour so that the right tax rate can be set 42 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper environmental taxes needs to evidence-based and carefully tested against the alternatives. This include non-tax regulatory measures (including the success of existing measures such as the ETS in reducing New Zealand’s emissions) and greater public education. We note that the current Government is establishing a Climate Change Commission. Any solutions that the TWG proposes should be mindful of other measures that might be considered. Hypothecated taxes New Zealand uses a range of “hypothecated taxes” e.g. ACC and EQC levies and road user charges. The proposed Auckland Regional Fuel Tax is also a form of hypothecated tax. Its purpose will be to fund specific infrastructure initiatives in the Auckland region. While there is some crossover with corrective taxes, we view hypothecated taxes as more akin to a user pays system (i.e. the tax is not trying to discourage a particular activity or type of consumption). One of the benefits of hypothecated taxes is the direct relationship between the tax and the use of the revenue collected. This makes it easier for those being charged to judge whether the tax is justified. One area we consider is worth exploring further is hypothecation in the taxation of retirement savings. That is, using taxes paid by KiwiSaver and other retirement schemes to specifically fund NZ Superannuation. 43 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 3. Taxing what you own 44 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper We have covered these taxes in earlier parts of our submission. Some potential taxes on what is owned are covered earlier (for example, land tax was covered under part 1 due to its linkages with the housing affordability question in the submissions background paper). A wealth tax is another example. For reasons similar to our analysis of a land tax and the difficulties with a capital gains tax, we consider that a wealth tax is a low priority tax to be considered. It is also worth considering some of the quirkier wealth taxes that have historically been applied. For example, a tax based on the numbers windows in the 17 th , 18 th and 19 th century in England. (As large mansions would have greater number of windows, the window tax was approximating the homeowner’s wealth rather than their income). One of the consequences of its introduction was windows being shuttered or bricked up to avoid the tax! This highlights the potential folly of some wealth taxes. 45 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper 4. Other matters 46 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper There are many other matters which warrant consideration. A few of these follow. The Generic Tax Policy Process New Zealand applies the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP). Designed as a means of reducing the political cost of tax policy changes being made without bringing along voters or considering the practical implications and consequences of tax changes, the GTPP has been very successful, in our view, in improving both the quality and acceptability of tax policy changes. Within the context of BBLR, it has also assisted in reducing lobbying for and grating of exemptions and concessions which are a feature of many other countries. GTPP works because of the commitment of Government, through ministers of varying political persuasions, to trust that the process results in a better tax system. The TWG should confirm that the system works to achieve that objective so that a high hurdle is set for future Governments to depart from the process. However, we consider that its application is not perfect. We acknowledge that consultation does not require acceptance. It does however require that submitters agree that they have been listened to. A recent example, which might be a relevant case study for the TWG, is the consultation on New Zealand’s implementation of the OECD’s multilateral instrument to amend double tax agreements (the MLI). The MLI was recently the subject of Finance and Expenditure Select Committee consideration. Detailed comments and submissions were made on New Zealand’s position, including by KPMG. This included criticisms of the National Interest Analysis prepared by Officials to support its adoption. The Select Committee’s report supporting the adoption of the MLI was surprisingly short, give the time and effort put in by submitters. In our view, it did not demonstrate that the submissions had been heard. (We are mindful, as our submission conceded, it was unlikely that New Zealand would not proceed to adopting the MLI. However, in our view, there were important points made that should have been addressed.) Such instances (assuming that perception is reality) will tend to reduce the trust of submitters in the system. 47 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper The TWG should consider ways in which the GTPP can be improved to maintain its credibility. Better view of the law – certainty Inland Revenue is protected by the law from failure to follow process. An assessment is deemed correct except when challenged through the disputes process. This means that a taxpayer can only dispute the technical merits of the assessment but can be prevented from disputing a position with the Commissioner due to procedural failures. Further the Commissioner, in our view, increasingly takes very narrow views of the law. Often these are not consistent with the expected policy outcome. (The Commissioner’s view of the tax effect of debt capitalisation, requiring a law change to confirm the policy intent, is an example.) Taxpayers are left, often on their own to dispute idiosyncratic views of the law or are required to seek amendments to take them back to the position it was always assumed to be (again, the debt capitalisation issue is a good example). In our view, there is a good case to level the playing field by: — Removing the Commissioner’s backstop against procedural failures on her part; and — Limiting her ability to take positions contrary to the avowed policy positions communicated to Parliament (through Bill Commentary and Officials’ Reports) and to the public (through Special Reports and Tax Information Bulletins). We acknowledge that this will put pressure on Government and Officials to be clear about what is intended (and why) and to achieve it through the legislation. However, that is how it should be. Fiscal costings The fiscal cost or benefit of a particular tax policy change is important to the tax policy development process. However: — There is limited consensus on this. Particularly whether the flow on benefits of a change should be captured in the fiscal costings. The TWG could usefully review and publish the position on the accepted method of preparing a costing. — The fiscal costings assume the revenue currently collected is consistent with the law prior to the change being proposed. This is not the practical result where the tax policy is remedial. Again using the debt capitalisation tax issue as an example, the fiscal costing for the amendment would have assumed that tax was being collected from debt capitalisations. The change to the law therefore had to factor an estimate of the fiscal cost of the law change. That is patently absurd. No such tax was being collected as it was never intended that it would. The budget forecasts, prepared on the basis of existing tax collections, would not therefore include any such future tax. In our view, this fiscal costing methodology inhibits necessary improvements to the law to correct technical outcomes inconsistent with good tax policy. It calculates a non-existent cost which imposes a constraint on amending the legislation. We acknowledge that fiscal costings are a good discipline to ensure that appropriate tax policy is the result. However, we consider that this particular approach to costings should be changed. It should be possible to define the circumstances where it is reasonable to assume a nil fiscal cost of a remedial policy. The TWG should recommend accordingly. Compulsory tax returns and involvement of citizens in the tax system The current tax administration system tries to exclude as many individuals as possible from filing income tax returns. This has the advantage of reducing administrative and compliance costs, including the stress and strain (“physic costs”) for individuals from dealing with Inland Revenue. 48 / KPMG / Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper This is consistent with the view that the majority want nothing to do with Inland Revenue. The disadvantage is that it is not obvious what income tax is or is not being paid. Further, it is not obvious that tax should be paid it is due. Technology and Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation changes should lower the administrative costs of requiring income tax returns. It should also allow the decision to deny expenditure against employment income to be revisited, as discussed earlier in our submission (as there will be some additional tax system touch points required). The removal of the employee deductions and the standard deduction was originally justified by lowering of tax rates and subsequently supported by the need to exclude wage and salary earners from filing income tax returns. Both decisions are now many years old. The trade-offs are no longer obvious and as a result KPMG does not believe that the current position of denying deductions for expenses incurred in producing taxable employment income is appropriate given the flexibility allowed under Business Transformation.

A tax system that works well is vital for the future prosperity of New Zealand and its citizens. It is also vital for local government and the review provides an opportunity to look at the inter-relationships between property, income and consumption taxes, and the ability of each of these taxes to meet the challenges facing all spheres of government. We note that the Government is also planning to review local government income and expenditure later this year and we hope that each review will inform the other. Although the Group is not considering changes to local government taxation, we believe LGNZ can help you with at least two of the specific challenges with which the Government has tasked the Group. There is a clear connection between any additional taxes on property (capital gains, wealth or land tax) that the Group might consider and the way local community services are funded, as property taxes are a primary source of income for local government. Local government will be key to the effectiveness of any environmental taxes, because any environmental tax will sit alongside regulation administered by regional councils. Given these interrelationships, I am writing to offer the Group the support of LGNZ; we are likely to have the information, or access to data and analysis, which could assist the Group as it considers options to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system in the following two areas. Taxes on land and property LGNZ members are vitally interested in any proposal by central government to increase taxes on the same property base that local government relies upon for funding community services. Our historical reliance on property taxes also means LGNZ has a deep understanding of how taxes on property impacts on different New Zealand communities, and on segments within a community. We were interested that the Group’s submission background paper considered how non owner- occupied property wealth is distributed by quintile, but at this stage had yet to consider the distribution of property wealth across communities. There are two broad stories around New Zealand today: one is a story of an increasing population, relatively strong economic growth and, as a result, strong demand for more and better infrastructure and services and rising property values. The other is a story of rural and regional communities that continue to be vital parts of our national economy and identity, but that do not have the numbers of people they used to. Some communities are experiencing an aging and falling population, and local industries are facing pressure to relocate to more populous centres (including offshore). A change in property tax could be the final straw for some regional businesses – our members have been working with communities facing hard choices on how to fund essential community services while retaining local businesses. We can provide the Group with practical and applied insights, in addition to those available through its secretariat. Environmental taxes LGNZ welcomes the Government’s request that the Group consider whether there is a case to make for greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base. In its own investigations, LGNZ has recognised that environmental taxes can lead to better outcomes by changing future behaviour in ways that advance environmental objectives, such as addressing water pollution, as well as raising revenue to meet environmental objectives. 1 Again, our applied experience can assist the Group to develop and consider proposals for environmental taxes. LGNZ members apply the Resource Management Act and will be able to assist the Group evaluate how an environmental tax can be designed to work alongside the consent processes. We can help the Group understand some of the practical difficulties which have led to past proposals (typically prepared in isolation from local government) not work out as intended. For example, while there is the ability to charge for the occupation of coastal space under section 64 of the Resource Management Act 1991, charging has never been effective. The designers of the charging mechanism seem not to have had a clear understanding of the issues facing Councils in establishing and implementing the charging regime. Challenges facing local government We would also like to take the opportunity to discuss with the Working Group the broader question of how taxes fund local public services provided by councils. Local government currently receives less than 6per cent of all taxes collected in New Zealand which raises the question whether or not property taxes have the buoyancy to meet the challenges communities will face in the future. In recent years a number of issues have arisen that highlight the limitations of property taxes. One of the more pressing issues concerns difficulties councils face when attempting to meet the infrastructure and service needs of the rapidly growing visitor industry. While visitors drive economic growth in local areas, it is central government that receives the fiscal benefit through additional GST and income tax, leaving existing ratepayers to pay for the additional infrastructure and services. In our view this is an example where the taxation system is failing communities and we believe it is an appropriate question for the Working Group to consider. For your information a considerable amount of work has been undertaken on the question of local government’s financial sustainability, including a review undertaken by LGNZ in 2014. The outcomes of that review are available from LGNZ’s website and we are happy to forward these to your officials. The LGNZ review, like the many reviews undertaken over the last 60 years, highlights the need for councils to have complementary sources of income to sit alongside revenue from property taxes. I encourage the Group to take up our offer and seek information and analysis from us to help inform the development of options where those options may impact on local government.

Who are we? The Manawatū Community Trust was established as a charitable trust in 2008 to manage and develop 205 rental units for older residents and those with disabilities in the Manawatū District. All of our tenants are either on NZ Superannuation or are receiving some form of Government benefit. In line with the objectives of our Trust Deed, we set our rents at below market rates in order to ensure that they are affordable for our tenants. Why do we care about the tax system? The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper asked whether there was a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability. We believe there is an opportunity to introduce a GST rebate as a way to encourage charitable and other registered not-for- profit housing entities to increase the supply of affordable housing in New Zealand. The Manawatū is like many other regional areas in New Zealand in that the next 30 years will see unprecedented growth in the over-65 year old demographic. To cater for this growth in our region we will need to add approximately 50 additional units over the next 15 years, and another 30 to 40 in the 15 years after that. This is a significant challenge for a charitable trust that provides housing at affordable levels. What limits us increasing supply right now? Our returns from our rental accommodation are low, delivering approximately 2 to 3% net yield (before depreciation). This occurs because we charge rents at below market rates, setting them at the lower quartile level and within 27-30% of tenant income. While we make a cash surplus at these levels, this is not enough to cover depreciation (but is enough to cover refurbishment of existing accommodation). There is very little left over to fund borrowing to increase the level of supply. We could increase our rents to market levels, giving us a higher cash surplus to invest in new supply. Our tenants would be able to access higher levels of Accommodation Supplement. However, our tenants would end up paying over 35% of their income in accommodation, which is well beyond standard measures of affordability. We would also be going against our trust deed which requires us to work for the relief of poverty and promotion of well being. We could become a Community Housing Provider and access the Income Related Rents Subsidy. In cash terms this would have a similar impact to increasing to market levels. However, none of our tenants are on the social housing register and are therefore not eligible for IRRS. New tenants may be eligible, but then our existing client segment would not be catered for (or they would be catered for by others who charge market rates). When we undertake commercial developments we are able to claim back the GST component of the build, since the rental revenue we receive on those developments include GST. That makes perfect sense to us. When we undertake developments to extend our supply of affordable rental units we have to pay GST on the labour and materials. We cannot claim this GST back though, because the rent we charge on the units does not include GST. That makes sense for the general market, since it effectively gets priced in to the market rent and the investment decision. It does not make sense for affordable housing providers – we already take a knock by receiving lower income due to charging below market rates (making it affordable for tenants), and then this GST treatment skews it further by increasing the investment hurdle. What could be changed? Introducing a GST rebate on the development of new affordable housing supply by charities and other registered not-for-profit housing providers would be an effective way of resolving this issue. It would be a tidy mechanism compared to setting up administratively-heavy capital grants incentives. It would also complement, rather than conflict with, existing non- tax initiatives aimed at other segments of the housing market (such as IRRS being available when housing tenants from the social housing register). We see the mechanism working in this way: • As a charitable trust or other registered housing provider we would develop new affordable rental accommodation. • GST on expenses for the development would be captured as an adjustment on our return. • A matching amount would be recorded on our balance sheet as a liability. • We would be required to make a declaration each year that the assets remain in use for affordable housing, and this declaration would be auditable (we could also be required to disclose this as part of our financial statements). • If we sell the developed housing asset within a specified time period – say 5 years – then we would be required to pay the amount of the liability to the IRD. • If we keep the developed asset for affordable housing for the required time period, then we would be allowed to write the liability off. The housing provider must have a strong enough balance sheet to be able to carry impact of the GST amount for the specified time period (5 years in the example above). We believe this is necessary to ensure an element of sustainability in that providers will need to have sufficient assets to balance the carrying of this liability, and that the assets will continue to be used for the purposes of affordable housing. What practical impact would this have? Let’s say the units we need to build are 50 square metre 1 bedroom units and can be built for a modest construction cost of $2,300 per square metre. This means the $4.6m we have available can be used to build 40 of the 50 units we need. Simple maths shows that removing the GST brings the construction cost down to $2,000 per square metre, meaning we can build 46 units for the $4.6m we have. However, since the builds are spread over 15 years (most likely evenly in blocks of 10 at a time), we may be able to take advantage of lower borrowing levels early on to squeeze another 1 or 2 units into the mix to reach up to 48 over the 15 year period. This will depend on whether the rebate is a contingent or other type of liability and how banks would factor this into their borrowing requirements. These numbers sound small, but they only relate to one provider in regional New Zealand. Conclusion and recommendations We recognise that the Tax Working Group is likely to focus on the ‘big’ issues affecting housing affordability, such as the tax advantages available to private landlords. This submission is to encourage the Group to consider some smaller changes that could help increase the supply of affordable housing by other segments of the housing market. Our recommendation is that the Tax Working Group considers the use of a GST rebate as the mechanism to encourage increased supply of affordable housing by charitable organisations or other registered housing entities. We are willing to speak to our submission or be contacted for additional information. Yours sincerely, Trustees of Manawatū Community Trust

That the de facto New Zealand Government does not have the mandate to continue as the government over the Sovereign native peoples and therefore we Te Whare Ariki o Runga Wakaminenga Hereditary Chiefs and Ngā Hapu do hereby give Notice that we have resumed the exercise of our sovereign powers and authority to govern over our own country. \[1\] Proclaimed Sovereign Hapu Authority Lawfully Constituted in accordance with the internationally recognised He wakaputanga o te Rangatiratanga o Nu Tireni 1835, with full acknowledgment of the internationally recognised Te Tiriti o Waitangi 1840, whilst exercising Hapū Kawa Tikanga within the territory of Nu Tireni. 3 Te Whare Ariki o Runga Assenting Body of Divine Spiritual Law of the Wakaminenga o Nga Hapu o Nu Tireni 9. In respect to governing and the making of laws, dispensation of justice, the preservation of peace and good order, the regulation of trade and the social, cultural and economic advancement of the Sovereign people Ngā Hapū and the protection of our Land, Te Whare Ariki o Runga Wakaminenga Hereditary Chiefs further invoke our sovereign powers and take the responsibility for these from the de facto New Zealand Government pursuant to Article 2 & 3 He Wakaputanga 1835, Article 2 Te Tiriti o Waitangi (Māori version.) TRANSITION TO SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT OF AOTEAROA NU TIRENI 10. A Joint Declaration for the stability and the upholding of national unity and territorial integrity and taking into account the history of Aotearoa Nu Tireni and its realities will be prepared between Te Whare Ariki o Runga Wakaminenga Hereditary Chiefs of Nu Tireni, the Governor General of New Zealand, Queen Elizabeth II of England and as well the British High Commissioner that Te Whare Ariki o Runga Wakaminenga Hereditary Chiefs o Ngā Hapū o Nu Tireni (the Sovereign) has resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Aotearoa, Nu Tireni. 11. The transition implementation plan of the policies for the health and wellbeing of our peoples Ngā hapū whānau and our land are to be in place by 28 October, 2018 with full implementation of The Plan by 6 th February, 2021. 12. As part of the Joint Declaration and transition to sovereign government and to maintain social stability and economic prosperity a government management commission will be established to guide the new government to effect a smooth transition to sovereign governance and to maintain procurement and supply for public and private sector services. 13. While the implementation plan will require a phased in approach we have identified THREE PRIORITIES for immediate implementation and action. Te Whare Ariki o Runga Wakaminenga invokes their sovereign power and authority and places a Rahui (prohibition) on the use of the following toxins banned in most countries around the world and known for their indiscriminate lethal harm to human and non-human life. These toxins are;  1080 and any of its derivatives are prohibited from use. As well  Fluoride and any of its derivatives are prohibited from use in public water supplies where tāngata whenua are connected to public water supplies.  Safe alternative control methods are to be used against harm to humans, native species, plant and fauna and other animals. All animals and plants are sacred and every effort is to be used to ensure their safety and protection. 14.

We submit on behalf of Medical Assurance Society New Zealand Limited and its related companies (MAS). At this stage, our interest in the Working Group and our submission is focussed on tax considerations for business charities. About MAS MAS is a mutual group of companies that provide financial services. As a mutual, we are owned by and accountable to our membership, rather than to shareholders. MAS was founded in 1921 by a group of doctors, and has since broadened its membership to other professionals to include doctors, dentists, vets, engineers, lawyers, architects, accountants and their families. MAS’ product offering to its members includes general insurance, life and disability insurance, and investment products including KiwiSaver. We believe members of the public increasingly demand more of the businesses they interact with. It is no longer enough to provide quality products and services to attract discretionary spend. Consumers want the organisations they trade with to be able to explain what their values and beliefs are, and to show how those organisations are adhering to and promoting those values and beliefs. MAS has recently formed a proposal to put to its membership. The proposal is to establish a charitable trust to direct MAS’ profits towards charitable causes including health research, health education and health promotion. Because MAS will be registered as a charity, the money that MAS would otherwise have paid in income tax will also be available to be redirected to the charitable trust. In adopting this business structure, MAS’ members will be able to see how their choice of financial services provider can align with their support of charitable causes acting for the greater good. We support tax exemptions for business charities New Zealand’s current tax rules allow business charities to support the charitable sector by way of tax exemption. As above, MAS has formulated a proposal to put to its members that rely on these tax rules continuing. We support continued tax exemptions for businesses which distribute their profits for charitable purposes for the following reasons. Tax exemption allows the private sector to give significant amounts of capital directly to the charitable sector. We believe this is the most efficient way of allocating that capital to support the social policy objectives of both the government of the day and the public. By permitting exemption, the stakeholders of business charities (Members, in MAS’ case) can see how their discretionary spending choices directly benefit the charitable causes supported by the business, rather than by proxy through government redistribution of income tax. The charitable sector is perennially underfunded and needs appropriate support, particularly in terms of ease of access to capital. Two key points to note are: 1. Charities cannot raise traditional equity capital because of the limit on private pecuniary profit. While this makes raising capital harder for charities, that difficulty is partially offset by the tax exemption for 2 charities. We see the tax exemption as an important and appropriate tool available for charities to access capital. 2. Many charities must rely on annual funding rounds and compete for limited amounts of capital. Business charities can offer greater certainty to charities’ cashflow from year to year. In our view it should not matter how capital is generated (i.e. whether generation of capital is related to a charitable purpose or not) if that capital is ultimately directed to a charitable purpose. For this reason, we do not support business charities’ use of charitable status to avoid income tax. We understand some business charities will direct a meagre proportion of their profits towards the charitable sector, and instead allow the bulk of those profits to accumulate within the business. In the first instance we support clear problem identification and option analysis before changing the relevant tax rules, but on the face of things we submit that the relevant regulators – Charities Services and Inland Revenue – should have appropriate tools to discourage tokenism in the name of charity. However, we do not think it would be appropriate to set firm rules about what proportion of profits that firms must distribute to charity. We note: 1. A business charity’s only option is to distribute the funds it accumulates towards charitable purposes. The funds cannot be siphoned off for other purposes. This is better than the counterfactual, where funds never make it to the charitable sector because a business does not register for charitable status in the first place and 2. Business charities must be permitted the flexibility to make their own decisions about prudent retention of capital. It is not possible to generalise about appropriate proportions of capital to retain versus distribute to charity. Businesses must retain capital to reinvest to ensure they remain sustainable, and must also retain capital to buffer financial shocks. This is particularly important for insurance business like MAS, which can experience years of volatile profitability due to large loss events like earthquakes and other natural disasters. We understand there are some stakeholder concerns about distinguishing the profits of businesses that conduct activities unrelated to charitable purposes (but give their profits to charity), and business that conduct charitable activities and generate profit. This distinction is complex and there are a range of businesses that operate within that spectrum. The complexity and variety of business activities make it difficult to draw a clear line or clearly define what types of activity are related to charitable purposes, and what are not. As above, in our view, if the profit can only go to the charitable sector for a charitable purpose, then there is no need to draw additional legislative boundaries. All that would serve to do is generate an additional administrative burden for the professional advisers to government and business charities. Finally, we support a robust financial reporting framework for charities. This will promote transparency and accountability, which in turn will generate trust and confidence among the public. It will also allow for better debate about tax exemption rules applicable to business charities, because stakeholders will be able to better understand the flow of capital in to the business charity and back out to the charitable sector. We do not support punitive tax rules for businesses that deregister as charities Under the existing rules, an entity that was previously tax paying and then obtained tax exempt status as a charity would, where it is deregistered, include in the deregistration tax calculation any assets that it accumulated prior to obtaining that tax-exempt status. We understand the intention of the rule is to claw back the tax that would otherwise have been paid on amounts accumulated while the entity enjoyed tax exempt status. However, there is significant over-reach in the current legislation as the deregistration tax also applies to the value of assets that were owned by an entity prior to it becoming a charity. There does not appear to be a clear rationale, and in our view this rule is unnecessarily punitive. We agree that charitable assets should be used tor charitable purposes. We agree that assets accumulated by an entity while it has charitable status should be subject to deregistration tax. However, we do not agree 3 that accumulated assets should be taxed twice – once when those assets were accumulated before the entity had charitable status, and once again on deregistration. Contact us for more information We welcome the opportunity to discuss these points in greater depth with the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat. Please contact our General Counsel Nick Mereu on or at if you would like to discuss further with us. Yours sincerely, Matthew Judge Nick Mereu CFO General Counsel \[1\] \[1\] \[1\]\[1\]

MBIE SUBMISSION TO TAX WORKING GROUP, APRIL 2018 1 MBIE’s submission to the Tax Working Group consists of two parts: a. General comment; and b. Five thematic perspectives for consideration in designing the tax system, drawing on MBIE’s expertise in policy areas we are responsible for: o investment o urban development and housing o labour markets and the future of work o research, science and innovation o consumers. 2 The submission reiterates and adds to earlier material that MBIE has provided to the Tax Working Group. The earlier material includes a presentation to the Group in February 2018 about the changing New Zealand economy and input to the Tax Working Group Secretariat in response to discussion documents prepared by the Secretariat. Further material can be provided to support this submission if the Group or the Secretariat would like to follow up on any of the points raised. PART 1: GENERAL COMMENT Tax system as one of a suite of levers 3 The ultimate purpose of public policy is to improve wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders. The tax system is one of the levers that can help pursue this purpose. 4 The tax system plays an important role in shaping a productive, sustainable and inclusive New Zealand economy. For example: a. Tax settings can enhance or detract from New Zealand’s productivity performance, for example, by (dis)incentivising firm growth, impacting on the allocation and use of capital, or changing the industrial structure of the New Zealand economy. b. In supporting sustainability, the tax system is one mechanism by which environmental or social externalities may be internalised, levelling the playing field across the economy. c. The tax and transfer systems have a redistributive role. The broader design of the tax system can also have significant distributional impacts across a range of dimensions including across regions, incomes, gender and ethnicity. 5 The tax system needs to be considered alongside the full suite of levers that are available to achieve the government’s economic, social and environmental objectives. Taxes alone cannot achieve all the objectives sought but, if carefully designed, the tax system can complement non-tax regulatory and other policy settings to improve the overall living standards of New Zealanders. It is important that the policies – both within the tax system and across tax and non-tax levers – drive behaviour in the same direction to improve living standards. For example, to change investment patterns requires a strategy co-ordinating tax and non-tax regulatory settings, funds and grants and government signals. Future challenges and changes 6 The design of the tax system must consider future challenges and changes in New Zealand’s economy and population. Disruptive economic change will occur as a result of technological advancement, globalisation, climate commitments and other megatrends. The tax system needs to be designed with this in view, so that it is sufficiently flexible to sustain the government’s revenue base as the economy changes (which could be different to current expectations). The Tax Working Group Submissions Background Paper rightly identifies this need. 7 The rapid growth of the digital economy is a particular challenge. The presumption that income should generally be taxed in the places where the activities, or the underlying assets, are located could become increasingly difficult to apply. In a highly globalised world, the location of physical assets becomes far less relevant to generating income. Tax policy will need to continuously adapt to changes in markets and how taxpayers engage with them. 8 Technology is also facilitating a change in business models. For example, the ‘sharing economy’ and the ’gig economy’ are growth areas globally. The sharing economy monetises underutilised assets (eg spare rooms) as the growth in online marketplaces have enabled ordinary people to compete easily with companies. The sharing economy covers a wide spectrum of business models from the commercially oriented Uber and Airbnb, to ones that build local social capital like Neighbourly. The gig economy (which includes many sharing economy businesses) is increasing the casualization of the labour market. Workers in a gig economy get paid for the ’gigs’ they do, eg IT micro tasks, as opposed to a regular salary or wage. Importantly, the gig economy labour market is increasingly operating across jurisdictional boundaries. 9 Uptake of these business models still appears modest in New Zealand but is expected to grow. The implications for the tax system are that these models often involve taxation outside of our jurisdiction. 10 In addition, people are increasingly likely to work multiple small contracts, instead of holding ‘one salaried job’, and enter into more complicated employment arrangements (see Part 2 for more details). The graph below shows long-term historical trends of labour and capital share of income for New Zealand. The falling labour income share reflects wages growing more slowly than returns to capital. The labour share of income may continue to decline. In sum, future changes in the labour market are likely to affect the revenue base and make the administration of the wider tax and welfare system more complex. Enabling the tax system to respond to changes in the way New Zealanders work will also be critical for New Zealand’s success. 11 More generally, the nature of business activity is changing and will continue to change. New Zealand businesses are moving into more knowledge-intensive sectors and seeking to move up value chains. On top of this, New Zealand has insufficient domestic capital readily available to finance our investment needs and must therefore compete for high quality foreign investment. The future competitiveness of New Zealand’s business environment will be highly influenced by tax and non-tax regulatory systems. 12 New Zealand is becoming more diverse, which suggests there is no form of generic ‘kiwi’ business culture. This diversity may have implications for how well understood the tax system is, as well as compliance and enforcement. Population and gender considerations 13 Design of the tax system must also consider the implications on different population groups, particularly Māori and Pasifika given they are disproportionately disadvantaged groups of our population. In the workforce, Māori and Pasifika are over-represented in lower-skilled jobs – 28 per cent and 32 per cent respectively, versus 13 per cent being European, in 2017. This may affect the incentives for people to upskill, given the impact of marginal tax rates. 14 New Zealand’s changing demographics are expected to result in an ageing European population and a larger proportion of young Māori and Pasifika. This adds weight to the suggestion that the tax base needs to be broadened, to avoid these population groups paying a disproportionate share of tax. In addition to growing the future Māori workforce and upskilling, the key opportunities for Māori and Pacific economic development are through growing Māori small and medium-sized enterprises, and maximising the economic value of iwi and collectives (total asset base of $15 billion). Any disincentive to this type of investment introduced through tax changes could make it harder to improve the living standards of these population groups. 15 The implications of taxes designed to influence behaviours also warrant examination of the impacts on these population groups, particularly given the proportionally greater concentration of these taxes in lower income brackets. For example, the regressive impact of tobacco taxes on lower income households would reduce the amount of money these households have for other goods and limit their other choices, including their housing aspirations. 16 There may also be a need to consider the distributional impact of some elements of the tax system on women. Important factors could include women’s greater average life expectancy (currently female life expectancy at birth is 3.4 years higher than male life expectancy at birth), and the distribution across genders of income and wealth. 17 A recent Treasury Working Paper concludes that ’tax expenditures’ in New Zealand may have a negative impact on gender equality. 1 Tax expenditure is any form of spending that is provided for through the tax system. Tax expenditures alter the tax system by allowing exemptions, deductions or credits to particular groups of people or for specific activities. These include Working for Families and KiwiSaver tax credits. Deepening the understanding of the impact of tax expenditures on gender equality, and considering options to address any impact, merits further attention. Design principles for tax system 18 The tax system must be designed in a way that helps achieve the purpose of improving the wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders. Changes to the system should focus on securing and maintaining the government’s revenue base over time – it is about building a fair and resilient system, rather than seeking to increase tax revenues by capitalising on future changes in economic activity. 19 The tax system should, as far as possible, be neutral over the long term, meaning that different forms of income and different classes of assets should be taxed in a substantially similar way. 1 Morrissey, S. (April 2018). Gender Budgeting: A useful approach for Aotearoa New Zealand. Treasury Working Paper 18/02. Broad-based, low-rate principle 20 The Tax Working Group is considering whether the broad-based, low-rate design principle for New Zealand’s tax system remains relevant. The low-rate aspect is intended to reduce the costs associated with taxation and the broad base reduces distortions between different forms of saving. There are arguments, however, that the base could be broader. For example, we have differential tax treatment of asset classes and no land or wealth taxes. 21 The rationale for the principle of broad-based, low-rate tax is strong as it emphasises efficiency, it minimises distortionary incentives and it acts to widen the potential pool of taxpayers as part of maintaining the revenue base. 22 However, it would be useful for the Tax Working Group to carefully consider implications for equity alongside the application of the broad-based, low-rate principle. This should pay particular attention to cases where the principle results in regressive tax arrangements or has disproportionate impacts on specific groups of people (as discussed in the previous section on population and gender considerations) or businesses. 23 The broad-based, low-rate principle can be combined with taxes aimed at modifying behaviour, by including the positive or negative spill-over effects into decision-making. There is some merit in exploring the case for taxes to encourage (or discourage) certain behaviours, particularly to ensure negative externalities are internalised. Such taxes need to be carefully designed to ensure they do achieve their intended effect – without unintended consequences – in a cost-effective way, and to be assessed in comparison to other feasible options for achieving the desired effect. 24 There may be considerable hurdles in changing behaviours, which a tax alone is insufficient to address. Some preferences may be embedded through culture, whether as current social norms, or long-held cultural values (for example, Māori cultural values for land; New Zealanders’ interest in housing assets). Other design principles 25 The principle of taxing different forms of income, and classes of assets, in a substantially similar way is sound, subject to consideration of other principles (collection and compliance costs). There is a risk that current differences in tax treatment across income streams and asset classes may distort investment choices, and may have significant long-term implications for the structure and performance of the New Zealand economy. 26 The Tax Working Group Submissions Background Paper describes previous criteria used to assess tax system changes against the design principles and also comments on the Treasury’s Living Standards Framework as a possible tool for analysing the implications of tax system changes. Given the Government’s intention to place intergenerational wellbeing of New Zealanders at the centre of policy, changes to the tax system should be similarly assessed. It is important to understand how taxes affect and could improve the living standards of New Zealanders. In particular, it is important to understand the potential interactions and trade-offs between the dimensions of current wellbeing and the four capitals when the tax system changes. This is a complex task and again emphasises the importance of considering the design of the tax system as a part of the wider suite of government policy options. 27 In taking a living standards approach, other criteria for assessing the performance of the tax system should also be considered, including the sustainability, transparency, and effectiveness of tax policy. Efficiency, including the compliance burden, is also an important consideration. Compliance costs should be minimised where possible. In assessing compliance costs, it is important to consider not only the costs of compliance with tax obligations, but also how tax compliance adds to total (tax and non-tax) compliance costs for businesses. 28 Any consideration of new taxes, such as a wealth tax, or a land tax, should be assessed within a living standards approach, with careful analysis of the impact on the overall wellbeing of New Zealanders. PART 2: OVERVIEW OF THEMATIC PERSPECTIVES 29 This part of MBIE’s submission provides perspectives on five thematic areas for consideration in designing the tax system. These are areas in which MBIE has particular expertise given our spheres of policy responsibility. 30 Although a perspective is presented for each sector, the issues raised cross over and taxes impact across the spheres. It will be important for design of the tax system to take a wide-ranging view of the effects of proposed tax policy changes and seek to minimise distortions and carefully consider incentives across the whole economy. An investment perspective 31 New Zealand needs investment to deliver a dynamic, diversified, high-tech and low carbon economy that is inclusive. This would help deliver an economy that will help New Zealand not only to adapt to change, but to prosper in a fast-changing landscape. 32 The tax system currently incentivises investment decisions in New Zealand, from both domestic and foreign sources, into less productive parts of the economy. Our investment patterns can tend to entrench incumbent sectors and, in the short term, lift economic growth (GDP), but with no long-term benefit for productivity. For example, financial markets exposure is concentrated in the real estate and agriculture sectors – mortgages representing 50 per cent of bank lending. Further, capitalisation rules for banks favour mortgages on housing. 33 New Zealand has low saving rates compared to other countries. New Zealand’s household saving rate has been negative for most of the last 20 years (although this may underestimate rising savings into houses, foreign assets and trusts), and New Zealand has shallow domestic capital markets. The root causes are not well understood, but possible causes may be:  rapidly rising house prices and faster growth in mortgage debt relative to disposable income in many segments of the population  policy settings (including tax) along with market environments potentially leading to distortions in the market and preferences for investment to flow towards certain types or sectors of investment. 34 One possible channel to increase saving by households is through retirement savings. The Tax Working Group Submissions Background paper notes that New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings differs from most OECD countries. In New Zealand contributions to retirement savings are made out of income that is taxed, the income earned from the investment is taxed, but the amounts ‘withdrawn’ are not taxed (‘taxed-taxed-exempt’ treatment). In most OECD countries it is only during the drawdown phase that taxation occurs, where the withdrawals and accumulated earnings are taxed (‘exempt-exempt-taxed’ treatment). 35 There is merit in reconsidering New Zealand’s current treatment of retirement savings, to help minimise any serious distortions of investment choices created by New Zealand’s differing tax treatment for different types of asset. This would need to be considered as part of the overall rebalancing of the tax system, and it would be important to ensure any changes incentivise increased saving and do not result in flows shifting away from productive sectors of the economy. It may be prudent to consider limitations on the amount that could be deposited into such schemes, to ensure that distributional consequences of a form of tax saving are minimised and that a shift into tax preferred- retirement savings does not substantially decrease tax take. 36 Current and new investments should move towards existing areas of competitive advantage and new markets, new products, new processes and new firms. Tax policy is a lever that could support facilitating investment towards the parts of the economy that are more productive. However, it is important to be wary of creating new distortions in the market. 37 Dis-incentivising investment from some unproductive sectors may not automatically drive that capital into more productive areas. Some things to consider in the design of the tax system are:  ease of investing in a particular type of asset or sector – barriers to investment  distortions in the market – unintended consequences, incentives or disincentives, and  desire to achieve a balanced portfolio of investment across risky/non-risky assets and different markets (New Zealand vs foreign). 38 It is important that taxes do not dis-incentivise investment into particular sectors that drive transformation and diversification of the economy. Specifically, when considering capital gains taxes, there may be a need to consider the impact these would have on the operation of some markets, particularly where market failure characteristics would need to be addressed. The government has a range of options to do so, ranging from direct intervention through to exemptions. In this regard, it is important to consider: a. Venture capital investment in early stage activity where risks are high and returns are mostly realised through capital gains. Venture capitalists must realise any capital gains to justify to their partners the risk of the investments and to invest into promising new ventures. Without venture capital funds, certain types of entrepreneurs and start-ups will not get off the ground. b. Foreign direct investment, where there is strong global competition for high quality investment and where New Zealand’s size, distance and the limited number of opportunities reduce the potential pay-back for investors to solve co-ordination and market information asymmetry issues. c. General business decisions on expansion, choice of capital, lock-in (timing of when to sell and the need to recycle resources for optimum allocative efficiency), firm structuring and the impact this can have on distorting price signals. 39 Tax reform is just one of many levers that can be used to effect changes to investment patterns, and a co-ordinated strategy that aligns the levers is required. Other policy levers include the programmes of Crown entities (New Zealand Trade and Enterprise, New Zealand Venture Investment Fund, Land Information New Zealand), other funds (Provincial Growth Fund, Green Investment Fund), grants and subsidies (Large Screen Production Grants, Major Events Fund), non-tax regulatory settings and general government signals about where to invest. 40 In redesigning the tax regime and contemplating progressive business taxes, it is important to note such taxes may have impacts on incentives for businesses to grow (and indirect consequences for high-growth firms, exporters, employers) and on how businesses are structured. 41 Careful consideration should be given to the overall effective corporate tax rate and the imputation to shareholders, to ensure the system does not dis-incentivise foreign direct investment (and favour other types of investment flow). New Zealand has a relatively high effective corporate tax rate in comparison to ’competitor’ peer countries which compete for foreign direct investment, but a relatively attractive rate for shareholders and dividend earners. 42 The Tax Working Group is examining the impact of a lower tax rate for small companies. Differential tax settings for business size can have distortionary effects on business behaviour which reduce benefits and appear to inhibit the development of high growth firms that transform the economy. Many countries have this system and there is some evidence that it can dis-incentivise small firms from expanding and can result in income- shifting around thresholds. From an equity perspective, this can penalise certain types of firms or certain sectors more. Urban Development and Housing An urban development perspective 43 The performance of the urban economy is critical to New Zealand’s future prosperity given that cities will be a primary location for launching into new markets and creating new products, processes and firms. This relies on investment in skills and labour and on capital investment in new and existing firms, including those that build houses. 44 A tax system that incentivises investment in the purchase and trading of existing houses and land assets, and thus dis-incentivises investment into new and existing businesses (particularly those that are that are capital constrained) can affect the performance of the economy, and the urban economy in particular. 45 Successful urban development also relies on having adequate investment in growth- enabling infrastructure and ensuring urban land can flow easily to higher-value uses over time. 46 To facilitate these outcomes, consideration should be given to a land tax on the unimproved value of land. This has two potential benefits from a wider urban performance perspective:  It incentivises landowners to develop their land to its highest and best use (eg intensify, or cease land-banking), and thus helps increase housing supply, among other benefits.  It provides an efficient and relatively simple way of directly capturing a portion of the value uplift that can arise from infrastructure investment or planning changes, and directing that revenue into the investment that generates the uplift in the first place. This would help support the ability of central and local government (eg if it is hypothecated) to better plan for and support urban growth in New Zealand. A housing perspective 47 MBIE has a high-level goal of reducing the ratio of housing costs to income, underpinned by a goal of increasing median income by 40 per cent by 2025, from $1,300 per week to $1,800 per week. To meet the housing cost-to-income goal, housing costs (whether that is households paying for their own home, or paying rent), need to increase by less than the increase in median income. 48 House prices have increased sharply in New Zealand over the past 15-20 years as demand has run up against insufficiently responsive supply. In recent years, rents throughout the country have also increased sharply. There are severe constraints on the supply of housing in many New Zealand cities. These constraints reflect the impact of various drivers, including land use regulation, geography, inadequate infrastructure provision, and low building sector productivity. 49 A range of factors have contributed to strong housing demand, including rising incomes, population growth, declining interest rates, declining average household size, and investor demand. 50 Investor demand is likely to have been amplified by New Zealand’s tax settings, including the absence of comprehensive taxation of capital income and the ability to fully deduct interest expenses. In an environment of positive inflation, this allows leveraged investors to deduct the inflation component of interest expenses while accumulating the untaxed gains on the value of their property arising from general price inflation. The lack of a capital gains tax is likely to particularly amplify investor demand in sharply rising housing markets. The ability to deduct interest will be partly curtailed by the proposed loss ring-fencing rules for rental properties. 51 Owner-occupied demand is supported by the non-taxation of imputed rent, and the absence of taxation on capital income. 52 Investment is needed for new housing supply, and developing more efficient means of production. In a well-functioning market, where supply is responsive to demand, investment can also play a useful role in providing rental housing and helping establish price signals to inform new supply. The problem is that investment in housing, especially in a supply-constrained market, can lead to: a. Price inflation – investors may have greater ability to pay than other prospective purchasers and can raise prices competing for scarce assets. b. Volatility in house prices — speculative demand can increase housing above fundamental values (causing a bubble) or move it more quickly towards new equilibrium prices. c. Crowding-out of some home buyers (ie different demand markets) – for example, first-home owner-occupiers cannot get on the property ladder if they are competing with investors who can use existing properties as leverage. Property wealth may therefore become concentrated over time in a narrower band of owners. 53 A tax-neutral investment environment will be beneficial in the long run, as this will incentivise investment to flow to the most productive sectors of the economy. There are opportunities to reform the tax treatment of housing that would increase the fairness and balance of the tax system overall. There is a range of potential tax options to address this, including a capital gains tax, changes to deductible taxes, changes on taxation of the inflation component of interest income, Risk Free Return Method for property and wider options that would incorporate housing such as land taxes and value capture. 54 A broad-based capital gains tax – ie levied neutrally on all forms of capital gain, not just in the housing market – would support the overall objective of investment neutrality. In the long run, it could also contribute to fairer intergenerational distribution of wealth. 55 In the short term, in the absence of an increase in overall housing supply, the effects of a capital gains tax — and especially one levied only on investment properties and not all properties— are highly uncertain, but could potentially reduce the supply of rental properties and increase rents. These effects could arise from:  a shift in the existing stock of housing towards owner-occupation, reducing the supply of rental housing per remaining renter (given the tendency for owner occupied housing to have lower occupancy rates)  less efficient utilisation of the housing stock due to lock-in, and  reduced growth in housing supply over the longer term given likely reduced investor demand. 56 This could have regressive distributional impacts, even if the affordability of owner- occupied housing is improved. The potential effects need to be carefully researched and considered in the design and application of a possible capital gains tax. 57 For this reason, while a capital gains tax would be a potential option for an overall re- balancing of the investment environment, it will be critical to ensure there is a carefully managed transition pathway in the short term while the housing supply pipeline recovers on the back of wider government housing and urban development initiatives. This could include a clearly signalled lead-in time that aligns with the anticipated three- to-four-year ramp-up of KiwiBuild and government-led large-scale development activity, as well as the signalled changes to regulatory and other systems that affect housing supply. 58 MBIEs best advice would be to ensure neutrality of all forms of investment, including the family home. This is not available as an option as, under the terms of reference of the Tax Working Group, any capital gains tax would exclude the family home or the land under it. 59 One second best option could be to consider amending other measures (tax and non- tax) to reduce the incentive to over-invest in housing (whether rental or owner- occupied) and to increase the size and efficiency of capital markets in New Zealand. It would be worthwhile for the Tax Working Group to consider changing the tax treatment of alternative savings vehicles to housing. 60 This could include consideration of the tax treatment of bank deposits and retirement savings schemes, as discussed in the “Investment perspective” section. As Andrew Coleman 2 argued, this would move retirement savings more in line with the tax treatment of housing and erode the incentives that favour one form of savings over the other. Reducing taxes on alternative savings vehicles may also assist first-home buyers to save a deposit. The taxation of retirement savings could also be considered in this context to help move to a tax-neutral investment environment and improve the depth of capital markets, as discussed in the “Investment perspective” section of this submission. 2 Coleman, A.M.G. (May 2017). Housing, the ‘Great Income Tax Experiment’, and the intergenerational consequences of the lease. Motu Working Paper 17-09. 61 There is inherently a trade-off in alternative investments between both maintaining neutrality with owner-occupied housing, and maintaining neutrality with other forms of investment. Encouraging neutrality with owner-occupied housing through a tax-preferred alternative savings vehicle, such as the ‘exempt-exempt-taxed’ treatment of retirement savings discussed in the section “An investment perspective”, may discourage over-investment in owner-occupied housing. However, this could create other distortions across other asset classes and would reduce taxation revenue. If such a system did not include sufficient limitations, these impacts on taxation revenue could be substantial. 62 Whether or not a comprehensive capital gains tax or land tax on the unimproved value of all land (excluding the family home or the land under it) is implemented, it would be worthwhile investigating value capture or cost recovery on specific projects. This could be through either the taxation system generally (and fall under the remit of the Tax Working Group) or through rates. These interventions would need to be planned together to avoid double taxation. A perspective on the labour market and future of work 63 To achieve the outcome of an increased number of highly skilled people and innovative firms, MBIE has high-level objectives of doubling labour productivity growth and reducing the unemployment rate to below four per cent. As part of this it is also important to lift wages and to ensure there is decent work and greater job security, more skilled, adaptive and resilient workers and lower under-employment. 64 The following labour market issues are likely to affect the government’s current and future revenue base: a. The labour share of income may continue to decline, reducing the proportion of personal tax revenue from future wage and salary earners. This could affect the tax base over the longer term – it is important that the tax system retains flexibility to respond to this. b. Workers and firms may increasingly choose to enter into multiple, short-term, overlapping employment arrangements making personal tax obligations more difficult to predict, calculate and verify. These arrangements can also leave workers more vulnerable, with fluctuating incomes, raising questions of how best to protect workers in such situations. It will be important to closely monitor the extent to which these trends are emerging in New Zealand. For example, the proportion of employees with multiple jobs has declined since its peak in the late 1990s. But this may reflect New Zealand’s relatively high under-utilisation rate of labour, which increased during the global financial crisis and has not yet trended down. c. Firms may prefer to engage highly skilled workers as self-employed contractors rather than employing them as staff (more flexibility, easier to procure very specific skills). Such arrangements allow workers opportunities to net off costs against income more easily than is permissible within traditional contracts of service, hence reducing their tax liabilities. This is already an issue for the tax system. The proportion of self-employed workers has been relatively stable in New Zealand since the late 1980s/early 1990s, at around 12 per cent. Experience with the ‘gig economy’ in other countries suggests that this proportion may well rise in the future. If so, the differences between personal and company tax rates may lead to a decrease in the revenue base. d. Highly skilled workers may increasingly work across national boundaries, either by commuting or better enabled by technology to work for overseas clients or employers. Income and tax obligations may more become difficult to verify in this situation. 65 The wider tax-transfer system (including student loans and allowances) is also likely to become more complex to administer over time, as a higher proportion of workers enter into more complicated employment arrangements (as described above) and as the economy responds to the impact of technology, globalisation, climate commitments, and other megatrends. The transitional arrangements – to help workers and firms adjust to these changes – have not been designed as yet, but are highly likely to have implications for the wider tax-transfer system. 66 The issues above are already affecting the tax system to some extent, and may well become more prominent over time. The speed and magnitude of such changes are difficult to predict. The key challenge for the tax system is to have sufficient flexibility to respond to relative shifts in income share, changes in employment relationships and the likely globalisation of the workforce (particularly for high income earners), so as to maintain the government’s revenue base over time. 67 The impact of the tax system on the labour market should be thought about alongside other regulatory changes. Both create different types of incentives and it will be important to ensure that those incentives pull in the same direction. For example, any consideration of inequality should consider the tax system’s role in redistribution, as well as the non-tax regulatory system’s role in influencing pre-distribution outcomes. 68 From a labour market perspective, one possibility is to use the tax system to incentivise firm-based training (as is being implemented for encouraging research and development), given the importance of life-learning in enabling workers to adjust to changing demand for skills as the New Zealand economy adjusts. A perspective on research, science and innovation 69 Innovation is the introduction of a new, or significantly improved, product, process or technique; in essence, doing something different. It is only by doing things differently that New Zealand will generate higher wages, higher productivity, lower environmental impact, and resilience to future challenges. The process of innovation is therefore a vital component of the New Zealand economy. 70 Research and science are structured processes that generate new knowledge. New knowledge is a critical input into some of the most valuable innovation. 71 New Zealand’s research and development intensity – that is, the share of our collective national resources devoted to producing new knowledge – is very low by international standards. Total investment in research and development is equal to 1.28 per cent of GDP, compared with an OECD average of 2.38 per cent. Business expenditure on research and development has been steadily rising, but at 0.64 per cent of GDP it is low – too low – when compared to other small advanced economies, and is well below the OECD average of 1.65 per cent. 72 New Zealand firms do not tend to be as innovative as their counterparts overseas – they are less likely to adopt new-to-market product or process innovation than the OECD average 3 and patent rates in New Zealand are lower (14 per million people) compared with the OECD (40 per million people) 4 . This is a big problem for the future of New Zealand. The tax system may have some part to play in changing that picture. 73 The international context for innovation and research and development is that governments will often actively incentivise these activities, and sometimes through the tax system (the alternative to the tax system is grants). The incentives generally apply to individual firms, and increasingly to certain types of capital investment, in particular seed or venture capital invested in innovative businesses. MBIE can prepare a more in- depth briefing on the international landscape of innovation tax incentives if the Tax Working Group is interested. 74 The Tax Working Group will be aware that the Government is already in the process of implementing a research and development tax incentive. This issue is not discussed in more detail in this submission, but MBIE can engage further with the Tax Working Group if needed. 75 In the further context of the Tax Working Group’s assessment of potential changes to the tax system, the following things matter specifically for innovation and research and development: a. The tax system is best at subsidising a large number of firms to perform a clearly defined activity (eg research and development). Doing so through the tax system brings certain advantages, principally certainty of subsidy for firms through 3 OECD. (2017). OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard 2017: The Digital Transformation. Paris: OECD Publishing. Pages 98-99 and 154-155. 4 ‘Triadic’ patent families registered at EU, Japan and US offices, 2013. Taken from: MBIE. (2016). New Zealand Science & Innovation System Performance Snapshot 2016. Page 4. rules-based self-assessment, which improves the incentive effect of the subsidy. When the activity is less able to be clearly defined, or there are ambiguities about exactly what type of the activity to incentivise (eg ‘innovation’, ‘digital technology’), the tax system will be less effective, and government support may be delivered more effectively through other means. b. Innovation and research and development are high-risk activities. Embedded in both processes is the very real possibility of failure and financial loss. Both capital and firms engaged in these processes expect a higher-risk, higher-return profile than many other business activities. While New Zealand collectively shares in the benefits of success from innovation through the tax system, the losses from failures within firms or investments accrue more unevenly. Encouraging more innovative activity within firms may mean government sharing a portion of the risks, as well as the benefits. The existing research and development tax loss cash-out and forthcoming research and development tax incentive address some of those asymmetries, but much less so for capital investment than for firms. c. Patient capital with a high risk appetite, in particular seed and venture capital, is essential for growing innovation. Increasing innovation in the New Zealand economy can come from two sources – increasing innovation in existing firms, and encouraging new, more innovative firms. While existing firms have a vital part to play in increasing innovation, international evidence increasingly suggests that much transformative economic activity, including high-value job creation, comes from new high-growth firms. 5 These firms are also more productive than average. 6 These firms rely on seed and venture capital for growth. At a minimum, the tax system should not distort against seed and venture capital as an investment choice. The Tax Working Group could also consider whether an incentive for this type of investment could be desirable (such incentives exist in other countries), but this consideration should be subject first to the principle set out in point a, above. 5 Haltiwanger, J., Jarmin, R. S. & Miranda J. (2013). Who Creates Jobs? Small versus Large versus Young.

Decomposition of New Zealand firm productivity, 2001-2008. The Treasury and the Ministry of Economic Development. A consumer perspective 76 MBIE has a high-level goal of promoting the long-term interests of consumers and considers this perspective when advising on policy changes. Successfully promoting consumers’ long-term interests means that: a. Consumers can access and understand the information they need in order to transact with confidence. b. Consumers are protected from high levels of detriment. c. Consumers have access to redress if things go wrong. d. Consumers benefit from competitive prices, high quality, and innovation in goods and services. 77 The overarching consumer policy consideration for the tax and transfer system is the impact it has on consumer welfare. The Tax Working Group should continue this focus by thoroughly assessing whether any reductions in consumer welfare that may result from a tax are outweighed by the improvements to consumer welfare. 78 Within this context the Tax Working Group should consider the following issues. The influence of taxes on competition and therefore consumer welfare 79 Given the increase in cross-border purchases, ensuring that there is a level playing-field regarding tax between international and domestic firms can assist in creating a more efficient and competitive marketplace. A more competitive marketplace will benefit consumer welfare. 80 In relation to competition, when considering any potential exclusions from GST, where the line is drawn will be an important decision with the potential to impact on competitive neutrality. For example, removing GST from fresh vegetables, but leaving it on frozen vegetables, could benefit producers who sell fresh vegetables, but harm those who sell frozen vegetables. There is also a loss of simplicity in the tax system. 81 Excluding GST from goods and services that make up a significant proportion of vulnerable consumers’ budgets may be an effective mechanism to make this tax more progressive. However the basket of those goods and services would need careful consideration. Excluding GST from fresh fruit and vegetables but not from canned or frozen versions, for example, may favour higher income households. Furthermore, any reduction in competitive intensity could ultimately harm consumers. 82 The Tax Working Group should also consider the extent of the pass-through that would result from any GST exclusions. Pass-through of tax increases or decreases may differ depending on sensitivity of demand to price changes. Complementary policies may be needed to ensure consumer welfare outcomes 83 Attention needs to be paid to the consumer welfare outcomes any exclusion may be trying to achieve. Excluding some goods and services from GST is not going to result in a universal decrease in price of 15 per cent for those goods and services. Therefore further wrap-around policies may be needed to ensure the targeted consumer welfare outcomes are met without unintended consequences. The complex drivers of, and impacts on, consumers of taxes to influence behaviour change 84 When considering whether or not to impose taxes intended to influence behaviour change, the Tax Working Group should consider:  the likelihood of consumer harm if such behaviours are not incentivised (or dis- incentivised, as the case may be) – for example, taxes on alcohol are imposed to try to dis-incentivise the consumption of alcohol due to the consumer harm it can cause  the extent of cognitive biases that may be driving consumers to undertake certain behaviour – for example, a tax reduction on savings interest may not address any time-inconsistent savings biases that consumers may have  the extent to which the issue is particularly affecting vulnerable groups – for example, a tobacco excise may be regressive to the extent it falls more heavily on lower income households  firms’ capacity to, and likelihood they will, pass on costs and savings to consumers – for example, if demand is highly inelastic firms are likely to pass tax-related price changes on to consumers. The transaction costs that consumers may incur 85 Any benefits gained from changes to the current system need to be assessed against any administration or transaction costs that consumers may incur. In particular, if any specific taxes are imposed, consumers need to be provided information to assess and understand these taxes and how they may affect their consumption decisions, so that they may transact with confidence.

Introduction 2. Taxation System Comments 3. Mercer Global Pension Index 4. Contact for Submission 1. Introduction Mercer (N.Z.) Limited (Mercer) welcomes the opportunity to provide a submission to the Tax Working Group (Group). Mercer has operated in New Zealand since 1957, providing investment and funds management services, primarily in the areas of workplace savings and KiwiSaver schemes. In addition to providing advice and services to nearly 100,000 Mercer KiwiSaver members, we perform administration and related services for approximately 100 corporate client schemes. Mercer’s ultimate owner is Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE: MMC), a global professional services firm offering clients advice and solutions in the areas of risk, strategy, and people. MMC’s 57,000 colleagues worldwide provide analysis, advice, and transactional capabilities to clients in more than 130 countries. 2. Taxation System Comments a. General It is well recognised that tax is a significant lever for prompting changes to individual retirement savings behaviour. The Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper notes that the treatment of investments under the current taxation system would appear to disproportionately favour certain assets classes. This asset class treatment disparity would not appear to produce beneficial outcomes with respect to enhancing savings rates, particularly retirement savings and associated retirement incomes. We are of the view that this treatment disparity should be addressed through the appropriate alignment of taxation of asset classes, with concessions for retirement savings applied. Page 2 TAXATION WORKING GROUP – MERCER (N.Z.) LIMITED MERCER (N.Z.) LIMITED Additionally, any changes to the current taxation system should focus on encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals. This would help to increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement, and to provide retirement benefits. We are strongly of the opinion that changes to the current taxation regime should not be made on a piecemeal basis but that any taxation changes should be considered in conjunction with the current KiwiSaver and broader savings regime. b. Specific Our suggestions with respect to more specific tax treatments are as follows: • We support maintaining capital gains tax exemptions for portfolio investment entities as the current methodology is relatively well understood and further changes may have adverse impacts on any objective to enhance savings rates; • We support the current Foreign Investment Fund tax rules and would not want to see an increase in the FDR rate; and we also support the current Prescribed Investor Rate (PIR) regime and would regard any proposal to increase the top PIR rate of 28% as counter-productive; • We support the continued treatment of the supply of financial services being generally exempt from GST, as removal or reduction of this may have an adverse impact of retirement savings. 3. Mercer Global Pension Index In support of our general and specific comments, we would like to draw the attention of the Tax Working Group to research undertaken within the Mercer group, regionally and globally, including in relation to superannuation. Of particular relevance to the Tax Working Group’s remit, is the Melbourne Mercer Global Pension Index (MMGPI) published jointly by Mercer Australia and the Australian Centre for Financial Studies. MMGPI receives funding from the State Government of Victoria. MMGPI provides powerful insights into global pension trends and international comparisons and benchmarks a number of countries, with New Zealand included in the 2017 survey. MMGPI methodology entails a detailed review of the core components of any sustainable retirement savings regime, namely adequacy, sustainability and integrity: • Adequacy relates to the provision of adequate retirement incomes including the base (or safety-net) level of income provided as well as the net replacement rate for a median-income earner. • Sustainability includes components such as the economic importance of the private pension system, the level of funding, length of expected retirement both now and in the future, labour force participation rate of the older population, current levels of government debt and the rate of real economic growth. • Integrity is comprised of three general areas (a) regulation and governance; (b) protection and communication for members; and (c) costs. Private sector plans are noted as important components because without them the government would be the only provider. This is not a desirable or sustainable long-term outcome. They therefore represent a significant component of a well-governed and trusted pension system, which has the long term confidence of the community. Countries with the highest MMGPI Overall Index Scores were Denmark, Netherlands and Australia. Two of the key deficiencies identified by MMGPI in relation to the New Zealand environment appear to be directly linked to tax, the other potentially indirectly linked. These factors negatively impacted how New Zealand performed in the Adequacy sub-index of the MMGPI. Page 3 TAXATION WORKING GROUP – MERCER (N.Z.) LIMITED MERCER (N.Z.) LIMITED These deficiencies are noted below: • a negative household savings rate - of the 30 countries surveyed, New Zealand had the worst score in relation to the net household saving rate component (- 6.1%) – This was one of the key deficiencies of New Zealand in the MMGPI; • a deficient score in relation to the tax treatment of superannuation investment income compared to other countries; and • tax incentives to encourage New Zealanders to take up income streams were noted as minimal. As noted above Mercer is of the view that changes to the current taxation system should focus on encouraging a long-term savings habit and asset accumulation by individuals. 4.

No part of our submission is confidential. We would welcome the opportunity to meet with the Group and the secretariat to discuss our points in greater detail. We have engaged the services of Sapere Research Group in providing advice on the contents of this submission. Summary Mercury would support greater clarity on the objectives for the Group’s consideration of environmental taxes and whether the intention is to apply royalties or fees to water, and whether those royalties or fees would extend to non- consumptive uses such as hydro generation. Hydro generation currently provides around a quarter of New Zealand’s renewable primary energy supply. 1 Hydro will play an increasingly important role in providing flexibility to support the expansion of renewable electricity generation, which is required to meet the government’s climate change and renewable electricity targets. As the recently released Productivity Commission Low Emissions Economy 2 draft report notes, renewable electricity will be crucial for enabling New Zealand to transition to a low carbon economy. Renewable electricity will be needed to help transform the transport and process heat sectors of the economy from fossil fuel dependency to a reliance on the cleaner energy sources we are fortunate to have in abundance. As the electricity industry contemplates increasing degrees of intermittent renewables discretionary, flexible plant like hydro will become more important. The presence of any royalty that affects hydroelectricity and not other forms of electricity generation would shift the economics of future investment in favour of thermal plant. Such a shift would be contrary to the government’s environmental objectives. One of New Zealand’s strengths is that, unlike other jurisdictions, we have a well-functioning electricity market without any distortionary taxes or subsidies on particular fuel types. While we would welcome further discussion, we are concerned that the application of a royalty that affects hydro electricity generation will operate as a wealth tax on investors due to the privatisation or partial privatisation of most hydro generation assets. Water ownership is also an issue. Any royalty on water use would be challenging to apply unless the current uncertainties around rights and interests in water are resolved. International experience of resource rentals and environmental taxes suggests that it is difficult to design resource rentals in a manner that is both fair and does not result in unintended consequences. 1 Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, Renewables statistics 2 www.productivity.govt.nz \[1\] \[1\] | Page 2 of 14 Mercury Overview Mercury is one of New Zealand’s largest electricity generators and retailers providing energy services to homes, businesses and industrial consumers throughout the country. We have a long heritage in renewable energy in New Zealand serving about 1-in-5 homes and businesses under the Mercury brand and other speciality brands. We also have proven capability and technical expertise in smart metering services and solar. Our goal is to be the leading energy brand in New Zealand, inspiring our customers, owners and partners by delivering value, innovation and outstanding experiences. Mercury operates nine hydrogeneration sites on the Waikato River and five geothermal stations in the Central North Island. We are a major employer, particularly in the regions where we have 270 highly skilled renewable energy professional staff located in offices in Hamilton, Rotorua and Taupo. We also have joint ventures with a number of Maori Land Trusts in geothermal power stations. Mercury is highly committed to opportunities that deliver sustainable benefits to its customers, communities and the country. The long-lived nature of its assets has meant kaitiakitanga, or guardianship, of New Zealand’s natural resources such as hydro and geothermal is a vital foundation for Mercury. We are in the privileged position to be able to support, through long term partnerships, a number of initiatives that maintain and enhance the environmental and social wellbeing of the communities within which we operate. Examples include our 20-year relationship with Rowing New Zealand, our support since 2004 for the Waikato River Trails Charitable Trust and the significant financial contribution Mercury provides annually to the Waikato Catchment Ecological Enhancement Trust to mitigate any effects on the environment from the operation of the Waikato Hydro System and invest in environmental enhancement projects 3 . Importance of renewable electricity to government’s climate change objectives Mercury has also long been a champion of leveraging New Zealand’s 85% renewable electricity advantage further to provide real sustainability benefits for the country. The government has set a target to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2035. We welcomed the recognition in the recent Productivity Commission report that greater electrification of transport and process heat are key opportunities in achieving the government’s aspirations for a net carbon zero economy by 2050. New Zealand’s strength is promoting the market and avoiding distortions New Zealand’s renewable advantage owes much to government, particularly for key economic and regulatory reforms that have been very principled in their intent. This was to ensure that the costs and risks associated with investment in generation infrastructure were not hidden in the government’s accounts but were made transparent via the competitive market and managed on the balance sheets of corporatised entities. Key to these reforms was the establishment of a competitive wholesale market for electricity generation which has enabled significant investment in renewable generation over the past two decades, particularly in geothermal generation (which has also created significant benefits for the regions and Maori economic development), as well the rationalisation of excess carbon intensive, thermal generation. The main achievement of the market has been to improve the so-called “merit order” of generation investment, meaning those projects that are economic are allocated capital and those that are no longer economic are retired. Unlike in other jurisdictions, such as Australia and the UK, New Zealand has avoided distorting competitive market signals by attempting to pursue changing and at times conflicting policy objectives, such as the decarbonisation of electricity supply while shielding some elements of the sector from competition from renewable or other disruptive investments 4 . The resulting constant regulatory adjustments means a heightened prospect that changes are being made to the electricity sector in those jurisdictions to overcome the effects of previous regulations, at the risk of ever- 3 http://www.wceet.org.nz/ 4 The promotion of renewable electricity targets versus relying on carbon pricing being a key example here | Page 3 of 14 mounting distortions to sector performance. In such an environment, there would be little hope of converging to a stable set of regulations necessary to support long lived investments in renewable energy. It is the lack of distortions in the New Zealand electricity market which has underpinned the substantial (several billion dollars) investment in generation from renewable energy sources in recent years. Creating a conducive environment for investment has, among other factors, led the International Energy Agency to recognise New Zealand as “a world leading example of a well-functioning electricity market that continues to work effectively”. 5 The electricity market arrangements are a major contributing factor to New Zealand’s top ten ranking by the World Energy Council in achieving a balance between environmental sustainability, energy equity and reliability outcomes 6 . Hydro generation will play an essential role in achieving our climate change aspirations Looking forward, the role of the market and New Zealand’s flexible renewables will play an essential role in achieving the government’s climate change aspirations at least cost to the New Zealand economy. As the recent Productivity Commission report notes 7 , reducing carbon emissions across the economy will require significant investment in renewable electricity to meet demand from electric vehicles and for process heat currently met by fossil fuels. This renewable generation will increasingly be built from intermittent sources like wind which will need other significant sources of flexible generation that can quickly respond when wind, for example, is unavailable. This flexibility role will increasingly be filled by hydro generation. This is because the government’s recent ban of offshore oil and gas exploration means gas fired generation will become uneconomic. Gas fired generation is currently the only other major provider of substantial flexibility in the electricity system which is why it is included in all the Productivity Commission’s electricity supply scenarios out to 2050. Greater clarity on motivation for environmental taxes would be of value Mercury’s main area of comment on the Group’s paper is the topic of environmental taxation. It was not clear from the background paper the main motivation for considering environmental taxes. The Group defines environmental taxes as “charges levied on tax bases that have a proven, specific negative impact on the environment”. 8 However, it also refers to resource royalties and economic rent taxes, which, rather than being motivated by environmental impacts, are intended to “ensure that the public gets a fair share of the profits generated from the use of the country’s resources”. 9 Mercury would support greater clarity on the objectives for the Group’s consideration of environmental taxes. Hydro generation royalties would impact electricity prices A royalty will impact on electricity pricing. A royalty based on water used or electricity generated would impact on the decisions made by the hydroelectricity generator in the wholesale market. A royalty would increase the cost of generating from hydro resources and therefore flow through to retail prices by lifting the average wholesale purchase price of power. This would in turn impact on the merit order of future projects and increase the costs of hydro providing flexibility services to support the necessary expansion of renewable electricity generation to achieve the government’s climate change and renewable electricity targets. The impact of a royalty on wholesale prices is driven by two main factors: the ability of hydroelectricity generators to pass through any royalty in market offers and the incentives a royalty creates for hydroelectricity generator to spill water rather than generate. In terms of pass through, during those periods when a hydro generator is “marginal”, i.e., it is the price setter, in the wholesale market, it may have an ability to increase its marginal offer to recover the cost of any royalty. Hydro 5 International Energy Agency Review of New Zealand (2017) https://www.iea.org/countries/membercountries/newzealand 6 https://trilemma.worldenergy.org/ 7 Refer footnote 2 8 Tax Working Group ibid, page 49. 9 Tax Working Group ibid, page 41. | Page 4 of 14 generators will not always be marginal within the wholesale market and will share this role over the year with thermal plant 10 . Our analysis for the most recent three-year period indicated hydro generation has been the marginal plant approximately 80% of the time. Mercury would expect this figure could potentially increase with the progressive decommissioning of thermal plant (as has been the trend over the past 5-7 years), the government’s recent ban on offshore oil and gas exploration materially impacting on future gas investment and the need for flexible hydro generation to support renewables expansion to achieve climate change and renewable electricity targets. Royalties on hydroelectricity generation will also create incentives to spill water which will also impact on pricing. During periods when wholesale prices are low, and water in storage is plentiful, hydro operators have a high willingness to sell. It is not unusual to see prices close to $0/MWh during times of high storage, especially when demand is low. Hydro operators close to their storage bounds have the choice to either generate, or spill the water. Currently, even at these very low prices, hydro operators would prefer to generate as much as possible rather than spill. However, if each unit of generation had a positive cost (of the amount of the royalty), rational generators would prefer to spill the water at wholesale prices lower than the unit cost of the royalty (rather than generate and incur the royalty). As a result, it would be reasonable to assume an increase in spill would occur and/or (more likely) the “floor” on wholesale prices would be approximately the cost of the royalty (converted into energy terms). Rights and interests in water need to be resolved Royalties are designed to provide a fair return to the owner of a resource. A royalty imposed for a natural resource would involve a payment for a property right held by the Crown. For instance, the stated objective of the New Zealand royalty regime for minerals is to provide a “fair return to the Crown as owner of the resource” (see discussion of the royalty regime for minerals in Appendix One to this submission). However, the ownership of water in New Zealand is subject to intense debate. Before a royalty on water could be considered, it would be necessary to resolve Maori rights and interests in water. Mercury (as Mighty River Power) formally acknowledged Ngāti Tūwharetoa’s ownership of the lakebed of Lake Taupō in a long-term agreement in respect to the storage of water 11 . However, the presumption remains that water is a commons resource in New Zealand under the stewardship of the Crown. The New Zealand context differs from countries where royalties are applied We have researched how resource rentals, royalties, and environmental taxes are applied to water used in hydroelectricity generation in other parts of the World. We have identified schemes in several countries – mostly they consist of royalties and/or cost recovery fees. In contrast with these examples there are several features of the New Zealand environment which would make the application of a royalty to water used in hydroelectricity generation challenging and, we think, at odds with the established criteria identify by the Group for evaluating tax reform. 12 For example in the schemes we found in Canada, the United States, Brazil and elsewhere there is clarity as to the ownership of water and, the land surrounding the hydro dam and the royalty or tax was typically imposed prior to any privatisation of such assets. We would be happy to discuss this research in further detail with the Group. Taxing hydro would distort renewable generation and increase the costs of decarbonisation Introducing a royalty on water used for hydroelectricity generation would impact on the electricity market in ways counter to the government’s climate change and renewable energy objectives. As noted above, hydro generation will play an increasingly important role in providing flexibility to support the expansion of intermittent renewable generation to achieve a net carbon zero economy by 2050 and 100% renewable electricity by 2035. Increasing costs to hydro generation will make the costs to the economy higher and reduce the relative attractiveness to consumers and business of making investments in new technologies with material carbon reduction benefits to New Zealand like electric vehicles or process heat. The presence of any royalty that affects hydroelectricity and not other forms of 10 Hydro generation is the largest source of generation in New Zealand providing 57% of generation in 2017 according to MBIE statistics. http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/sectors-industries/energy/energy-data- modelling/statistics/electricity 11 https://issuu.com/mercurynz/docs/tuwharetoa-and-mighty-river-power-r 12 Tax Working Group, op cit, page 5. | Page 5 of 14 electricity generation would shift the economics of future investment in favour of thermal plant. Such a shift would be contrary to the Government’s environmental objectives. Most commentators expect ongoing investments to maximise the potential of existing hydroelectrical plant, to replace equipment as it ages, as well as some new small-scale hydroelectricity generation plant 13 . Given the recent government decision to ban new oil and gas exploration and coal for electricity generation, there is also potential to consider larger scale deep hydro storage projects to improve resilience to periodic dry years that longer term will not be able to be achieved by thermal generation options. Wealth tax on investors in renewable hydro-generation Royalties applying to minerals in New Zealand are known to investors prior to committing to investments. Hence, the stream of future royalty payments are part of the costs of the project, and expected returns are assessed after factoring in the royalty payments. In the case of hydroelectricity generation, the major schemes have already been completed, with very long asset lives (well in excess of 100 years). The government has partially privatised its remaining interest in hydroelectricity generation (incorporated within Mercury, Meridian, and Genesis Energy) via the Mixed Ownership Model (MOM), having earlier sold Contact Energy. The other significant hydroelectricity generator, Trustpower, is privately owned. Mercury notes that an assumed value of future profits was reflected in the listing price of the of Mixed Ownership Model (MOM) companies at time of the Initial Public Offering (IPO). In this regard the public, via the Crown as their representative, can be seen to have received compensation from usage of hydro resources by those companies for electricity generation from the proceeds of the IPO process. A royalty imposed after investments have been made would have a similar impact to any other form of tax (such as a wealth tax) levied on an existing investment; it would reduce the value of that investment. However, unlike a wealth tax, a royalty on hydroelectricity generation would tax the wealth of a small subset of population – those who had invested in firms operating renewable hydroelectricity generation. It is not evident to Mercury, how a tax targeted on just those investors (including the Crown) could improve the structure, fairness or balance of the tax system. Consideration of other taxation approaches Mercury recognises that royalties are only one of the approaches that are considered in scope of the review and that might be applied to hydrogeneration assets. We provide further commentary on resource economic rent taxes and environmental taxes in Appendix Two of this submission. In summary economic rent taxes have proven very hard to achieve internationally (and have never been applied to hydrogeneration assets to our knowledge) and domestically. Environmental taxes can be a blunt instrument and like royalties run the risk of increasing electricity costs without providing social welfare gains above for example the requirements of specific consenting regimes. Conclusion Mercury supports greater clarity being provided as to the objective for the Group’s consideration of environmental taxes and their application to non-consumptive uses. The unintended consequences of applying any form of taxation to hydro generation require careful consideration considering the government’s climate change and renewable electricity ambitions, the unresolved issue of rights and interests in water and the impacts on investors in existing hydrogeneration infrastructure. We encourage the Group to engage with the Productivity Commission on its recent report on transitioning to a low-emissions economy.

The objectives that were established for the review would likely be similar to the objectives that would be established to consider a royalty regime for water (and the objectives were the same as those applied to review royalties for petroleum earlier). They are therefore included here. The review, summarised in the Regulatory Impact Statement, used four key objectives. Namely, New Zealand’s royalty and fiscal regime for minerals should: (a) Provide a fair return to the Crown as owner of the resource: This objective was weighted far more heavily than the other three objectives for the purposes of the review as it is a key part of the purpose statement to the Act under proposed amendments. (b) Be neutral and non-distortionary: The system should not have the effect that developments that are economic before a royalty is applied become uneconomic after the application of a royalty. (c) Provide appropriate risk-sharing between private investment and the Crown: The objective relates to the need to balance the interests of the Crown and those of miners. (d) Be simple to administer for both the Crown and industry: Unit-base royalties 14 are administratively simpler than revenue-based royalties, which are in turn simpler than profits-based and hybrid-based royalties. The Regulatory Impact Statement states that the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment does not favour unit-based royalties for minerals and petroleum because they are “economically inefficient” and “do not take account either the market value of the mineral resource or the costs of extraction and production” (see, Regulatory Impact Statement for Mineral Royalties, 2012). The Ministry does not favour resource rent royalties on the basis that “it fails to provide a guaranteed return to the Crown at the outset of production (and therefore it fails to meet the fair financial return objective)”. It is also administrative complexity, both for miners and the Crown. This led the Ministry to focus on AVR, APR or a hybrid of AVR/APR royalty options. How royalties are applied The Crown Minerals Act 1991 sets out the broad legislative framework for the issuing of permits to prospect, explore and mine Crown-owned minerals within New Zealand. Crown-owned minerals include petroleum, gold, silver and uranium, and all minerals on or under Crown land. In some cases, the Crown also has rights to certain minerals in some private land. The regime is made up of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 (the Act), minerals programmes, and associated regulations. The Act establishes the framework for issuing and managing permits. The Crown owns about half of the in-ground coal, metallic and non-metallic minerals, industrial rocks and building stones in New Zealand – either by right or because they are in Crown-owned land. These resources are collectively referred to as the ‘Crown mineral estate’. 14 Unit-based royalties apply a specified price to be paid on the tonnage produced. | Page 8 of 14 The Crown automatically owns all petroleum, gold, silver, and uranium in New Zealand and has rights to all minerals in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) - offshore between 12 and 200 nautical miles (nm) - and the Extended Continental Shelf (ECS - when the shelf extends beyond the EEZ out to a maximum of 350 nautical miles). Permit holders may have an obligation to file and pay royalty returns and these are detailed within the appropriate Petroleum Programmes or Regulations. New permits granted since 24 May 2013 are subject to pay royalties under the Crown Minerals (Royalties for Petroleum) Regulations 2013. Many current permit holders operate under a past royalty regime. Permits granted under a previous minerals programme continue to pay royalties based on those programmes.

In other words, the rent-estimation task involves estimating the cost savings -from a full-cost perspective- from including the hydro site within an electricity generation system. (World Bank, 2010). In practice, estimating rents from hydroelectricity generation would be very complex. Following the Australian Henry Review if an economic rent tax was sought there might be a preference for a cash flow tax. As explained in Box 5, Under a cash flow tax, a firm is taxed on any net positive cash flow from its business before interest and dividends. When a new investment is made, this is deductible, and any revenue from it is taxable. There would be several difficulties to overcome in implementing such a tax. A key objection is that if applied to existing assets, the tax amounts to an expropriation of some of the value of the property without compensation. This argument does not apply to new generation plant, but as noted above, major new investments in hydroelectricity generation are not expected to be consented. While investors should not expect that an existing investment would never be taxed by a sovereign government, investors in hydroelectricity generation are likely to be concerned if they are singled out for higher taxation relative to investors in other assets. Such a proposal would likely create sovereign risk issues for all investment (in the sense that the business community begins to view itself as vulnerable to additional, unexpected taxes and therefore increases its risk premium). Certainly, this was the experience in Australia with the Henry Review proposals. A final objection to applying an economic rent tax to hydro electricity generation is that enforcement would be difficult. This is because electricity generators typically operate a combination of generation sources (the hydroelectricity generators also operate wind generation, and some operate geothermal and thermal plant), and are vertically integrated with retail. These factors mean there is low visibility of ‘rents’, if any exist, which can be attributed to hydroelectricity generation. An economic rent tax would require high administrative costs to prepare separate accounts and detailed internal transfer pricing rules to establish the profit and/or cashflow attributed to hydro generation plant. Box 5 Forms of resource rent taxes There are many forms of resource rent taxation, with variations based on deductibility of expenses or treatment of negative cash flows. The cash flow tax is topical because it featured in the Australian Henry Review.16 In this form of tax, a firm is taxed on any net positive cash flow from its business before interest and dividends. When an investment is made, this is deductible, and any revenue is taxable. What this means is that in a simple example with an economic rent tax at a 30% rate, the government funds 30% of the investment (by way of tax deductions) and the government receives 30% of the return on the investment. The government through the economic rent tax becomes an equity partner in the firm fronting up the tax rate percentage of the investment and receiving the same percentage of return. On the basis that the return is super profits (the high return generated by economic rents), the government shares in such rents. 15 The opportunity cost would include the factors of production employed to generate and transmit electricity produced using the least-cost alternative, including the cost of capital. 16 The Australia's Future Tax System Review, informally known as the Henry Tax Review was commissioned by the Rudd government in 2008 and published in 2010. The review was intended to guide tax system reforms over the next 10 to 20 years. | Page 13 of 14 In contrast, under an income tax the government does not front up with any of the cost of investment (this is non- deductible capital) but shares in the tax rate percentage of the profits. In not meeting any of the investment costs but sharing the profits, the post-tax return on investment is lower than the pre-tax return discouraging investment and causing an economic cost. The Australian Henry Review identified three mechanisms for a cash flow tax: 1. A “Brown” tax – the government meets the tax rate proportion of every investment and shares the same percentage of the revenue. 2. A “Arnaut and Clunies Ross” tax – the government does not contribute a share of the upfront investment costs by provides deductions (indexed by say WACC) to offset against future revenue so that the investing firm is indifferent about when it receives the government share of the investment. 3. An “Allowance for Corporate Capital” or “ACC” tax – losses are shared by the government only on an amortisation basis but these losses are still uplifted by a factor to keep the investing firm indifferent as to the timing of the government investment contribution. The Henry Review preferred the ACC on the basis that it would make tax revenue less volatile than the other options. The main issue with a cash flow tax is that it can only apply in theory to new investments since to keep it neutral the government must contribute its proportion of the investment costs. The Henry Review proposed applying the cash flow tax (ACC) to existing investments as well as new and this became the main criticism of the Resources Super Profits Tax (RSPT) they recommended. (The decision to apply the tax to existing resource permits became highly controversial. The controversy regarding the RSPT was such that an “ad war” between the government and mining interests began in May 201017 and continued until the downfall of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd in June 201018). Similar proposals never quite got off the ground The example of coastal space highlights some of the practical difficulties with applying taxes to resources like water. While there is the ability to charge for the occupation of coastal space under section 64 of the Resource Management Act 1991, charging has never been put into effect. 19 Some commentators say this is because of objections to the idea of charging for the use of unimproved space and difficulties in establishing an appropriate charge. There was also an incentives problem: Councils were put in charge of establishing and implementing the charging regime, but the revenues raised were to go into a central pool of funds. Also, prior to the introduction of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004 there was uncertainty over ownership of coastal space. The legislative regime was also unclear. These charges were initially thought to be rentals by some councils (for example, Auckland council, which set out to value the space in the coastal marine area as if it were being rented). The Act, however, requires that revenue collected by a Regional Council from a coastal occupation charge “must be used only for the purpose of promoting the sustainable management of the coastal marine area.” This establishes it as a cost recovery regime not a rental regime. Environmental taxes Hydroelectric generation schemes are not unique from other forms of land use such towns and farms and roads that have impacted on the landscape. These costs have been incurred. An environmental tax can only lead to better outcomes if it changes future behaviour in a way that advances environmental objectives. In concept, activities that would result in additional social costs should face higher taxes to discourage that activity, and lower taxes, or a subsidy, should apply to activities that have social benefits. 17 News.com.au. “Kevin Rudd defends mining ads”, 29 May 2010. 18 Money.ninemsn.com.au (AAP).“Mining stocks soar as RSPT ads axed”, 24 June 2010. 19 From 1 October 2014 all regional councils are required to amend their regional coastal plans and either introduce a charging regime or to state in their plans that no charging regime would be imposed. | Page 14 of 14 Our advisers Sapere have not been able to identify a social welfare improving behaviour change by an existing hydroelectricity generator for which a tax (or a subsidy) would be better policy instrument to encourage. Hydroelectricity generation operations are subject to detailed resource consents, and these consents can and do address such issues as limiting storage lake levels, providing for river flushes and otherwise controlling operations to achieve environmental objectives. By comparison, a tax can be a blunt instrument and would risk raising the cost of hydroelectricity generation in the merit order (discussed in earlier in our submission) and thereby running counter to other environmental objectives, such as achieving greenhouse gas reductions.

Meridian Energy Limited 30 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand By email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper Meridian appreciates the opportunity to provide feedback on the Tax Working Group’s submission background paper Future of Tax. Purpose and principles of a good tax system Meridian supports the Tax Working Groups adoption of Treasury’s Living Standards Framework, which encourages consideration of how policy changes impact the four capitals that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing:  financial and physical capital, such as roads, factories, and financial assets;  human capital, such as skills and knowledge;  social capital, such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections; and  natural capital, such as soil and water. Meridian has adopted a similar methodology for reporting on our performance. We have adopted the International Integrated Reporting Council’s Integrated Reporting Framework to broaden our reporting beyond strictly financial considerations. The framework is based on six capitals: financial, manufactured, intellectual, human, social and relationship, and natural. Strengths of the current tax system Meridian supports the long established principle that New Zealand should seek to maintain a broad-based, low-rate tax system that is: \[1\] 2 Meridian Submission – Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper – 30 April 2018  simple to understand and administer with less opportunity for tax avoidance; and  that raises substantial revenue with relatively low rates of taxation. In general, we consider there to be many strengths in New Zealand’s tax system and that, while some adjustments might be worthy of consideration, the fundamentals of the system are sound and compare well to other OECD counties. As noted in the paper, New Zealand has the sixth lowest income tax rate in the OECD yet still manages to collect the fifth highest proportion of taxes on personal income as measured against GDP. New Zealand also has the sixth lowest GST rate across the OECD yet still manages to collect the highest revenue in the OECD from GST as a percentage of GDP. New Zealand’s collects the most company tax in the OECD as measured as a proportion of GDP and New Zealand’s company tax rates are above average internationally. The evidence indicates that our broad-based, low- rate tax system is a success and we are therefore open to tax policy suggestions that fit within this framework. Unless it can be clearly shown that the benefits to society will outweigh the costs, Meridian suggests caution should be taken in the introduction of exceptions that would narrow the tax base or the introduction of complexity that would undermine the simplicity and administrative efficiency of taxes such as GST or corporate tax. Improvements to the current tax system The Tax Working Group should also take into account the work that is already underway to improve New Zealand’s tax system. The Inland Revenue Department’s tax policy work programme should in our view be retained and advanced. Interruption of policy developments would prevent the refinement of our current tax system to the detriment of New Zealand tax payers. To give a specific example, it is essential that the disincentive to invest in New Zealand created by the tax treatment of feasibility expenditure be addressed immediately. Good progress has been made by IRD officials in consultation with the Corporate Taxpayers Group, and it is vital that this work is brought to conclusion. The removal of such investment disincentives is consistent with Government policies to:  work towards an increase in research and development spending to 2 per cent of GDP over the next ten years; and  reintroduce research and development loss tax credits. The current position (where feasibility expenditure risks being non-deductible should a project not go ahead) is contrary to the intention of the Government to support sustainable investment in New Zealand’s physical capital. 3 Meridian Submission – Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper – 30 April 2018 Environmental taxes and behavioural taxes Consideration of behavioural or environmental taxes needs to be specific to identified and agreed problems. The consultation document does not contain any particular environmental or behavioural tax proposal that is capable of evaluation. If environmental taxes are to be considered further then they would need to be able to be described and effective consultation would be necessary to understand the impacts. The Working Group should recognise that taxes are one of many policy tools that could be used to address behavioural or environmental problems. Any specific problem should go through a rigorous policy process that assesses the costs and benefits of tax options (and any potential distortionary effects in the tax system) alongside other regulatory options to address that problem. Taxes might influence behaviour but cannot guarantee specific behavioural or environmental outcomes in the same way as rules, standards, or resource limits. Therefore, while Meridian would always consider the specifics of any proposal, we are more likely to support non-tax regulatory options to address any identified behavioural or environmental problems. The Working Group also needs to be aware of the links to existing environmental regulation such as the emissions trading scheme and work by the Ministry for the Environment on fresh water and nutrient allocation. Any environmental taxes would interact with existing regulatory arrangements and there would be huge potential for unintended consequences. We therefore urge the Working Group to exercise caution in considering any environmental taxes. Finally, we have read and support the submission of BusinessNZ.

The Tax Working Group on the Future of Tax Submission from the Ministry for Women Contact: Renee Graham, Chief Executive Email: 1. What does the future of tax look like? Our world is changing. How can we pass on a tax system that will continue to support future generations. A budget is the most comprehensive statement of a government’s social and economic plans and priorities. In tracking where the money comes from and where it goes, budgets determine how public funds are raised, how they are used and who benefits from them. Gender-responsive budgeting 1 seeks to ensure that the collection and allocation of public resources is carried out in ways that are effective and contribute to addressing gender gaps and advancing gender equality and women’s empowerment. The Ministry for Women (the Ministry) recognises that women are differently affected by Government investment. In many overseas jurisdictions a gender lens is applied to government budgeting to test the distributional impacts of measures. The Ministry notes that this approach would also be applicable to gather information on the impact that taxes have on different groups of society, including Māori whanau, Pasifika families and, especially where these groups intersect with women-led households. The Ministry for Women strongly recommends that gender responsive budgeting approaches be incorporated as part of our future tax system. 2. What is the purpose of tax? Should we be asking more of tax? The Ministry agrees that tax is a powerful societal influencer – duty on cigarettes and levies on polluters are excellent examples. These taxes have successfully imposed requirements on people and organisations that have merged into accepted cultural practices in our society today. Dr Marilyn Waring challenged over thirty years ago, that the current system of calculating the nation’s wealth made women’s work “count for nothing”. Today, this challenge is acknowledged in the Ministry’s advocacy and championing that all labour contributions of women should receive the recognition they deserve, especially the care work of vulnerable family members. 1 What is gender responsive budgeting: https://unwomen.org.au/our-work/focus-areas/what-is-gender- responsive-budgeting/ \[1\] Recent Ministry research confirms that parenthood and caring remains highly gendered in New Zealand today. The responsibilities of care have long-term negative impacts for women through their lower rates of participation in paid work and consequently on their lifetime earnings and provisions for retirement. Women who return to work after becoming parents earn hourly wages that are 4.4 percent lower on average than wages they would have earned had they not had children. Women with lower income before childbirth are far less likely to return to work at all. Approximately half of low income women are not in paid work ten years after their first child. The Ministry for Women strongly recommends that the Tax Working Group considers how unpaid care work, performed mainly by women, both when they are in and out of the workforce, can be recognised and accounted for in our tax system. 3. Are we taxing the right things? The Ministry for Women strongly recommends the following four groups of women and their employment circumstances warrant consideration of tax rates that support and encourage them to pursue employment opportunities of their choice. i. Women’s employment patterns differ significantly from men with more women working part-time and having less workforce attachment. The undervaluation of women’s work, especially of women working in women dominated roles, means that they are more likely to do multiple jobs and be impacted by the higher rate of secondary taxation. ii. Women are overrepresented at lower income levels and are more likely to care for dependent children. Changes to government benefits and increases in taxes often have a disproportionately negative effect on these women. Tax benefits that acknowledge childcare costs from early childhood until children become independent are required. iii. Mothers who receive a benefit, have told us that the tax they pay when returning to work often makes the return to work not worthwhile, especially when the issue of childcare is taken into account. To encourage mothers back into the workforce, a more favourable marginal tax rate for women who are receiving a benefit is recommended. iv. The characteristics of mothers in beneficiary or low income households are important. The data identifies that parenthood is wage positive for fathers in New Zealand and wage negative for mothers. In the Ministry’s work looking at the impact of parenting on earnings over time, the absence of hours worked has been identified as important to understanding income disparity. We consider this information is best collected by IRD. 4. Can tax make housing more affordable? Does tax have a role to play? The Ministry for Women strongly recommends that tax measures be used to support housing affordability, including renting, and the wider issues associated with secure housing tenure 2 . 2 The sense that a tenant has choice and control over their housing options; that they can stay in their home for as long as they decide to, and they are meeting their obligations. Over the past three censuses in New Zealand, over half of those experiencing extreme housing deprivation were women. 3 The Ministry acknowledges that the intersection of gender and ethnicity are important features in responding to low income and poor households, as are the lack of education and skills. The persistence and duration of low income on housing are matters that the Ministry considers requires (i) stronger accountable policy coordination and partnering across agencies, including IRD, (ii) extending the administrative data collections of agencies to contribute to wider information system needs, particularly the collection of hours worked by IRD, and (iii) the commitment to an intersectional approach to the development of responses to women’s housing needs at all levels. 5. Other tax issues that matter. i. Sanitary items The Ministry considers the inaccessibility of sanitary items, because it is a woman-only cost, is an issue of equity that contributes to prevent girls from low income families attending school, training or employment. It is unacceptable that New Zealand girls’ health and education is at risk due to the unavailability of affordable sanitary items. The cost of sanitary items for girls and women is an issue raised with the Ministry for Women on a regular basis. The Ministry has received numerous letters from girls and women around New Zealand highlighting this issue, including a petition asking for the removal of GST on sanitary items. The Ministry for Women recommends making sanitary items tax free so that they are more affordable for low income families. ii. Research on the impact of parenthood on earnings. The Ministry works to ensure that women have the same access to opportunities in the workforce as men. Research has shown that choices about career breaks, parental leave and flexible work can impact, usually negatively, on women’s earnings, their ability to achieve their potential and their ability to prepare for retirement. Key findings of this research 4 are:  Parenthood is highly gendered in New Zealand. The responsibility of care falls disproportionately on women, which has long term impacts on their lower levels of participation in paid work and lesser lifetime earnings.  Women who return to work after becoming parents earn hourly wages that 4.4 percent lower on average than the wages they would have earned had the not had children.  There is an employment gap for women resulting from parenthood, and it is different for different women 3 https://www.vice.com/en\_nz/article/3ka5kj/mana-wahine-single-mums-are-the-largest-homeless-group-in- nz 4 Pacheco et al (2018) Parenthood and labour market outcomes (forthcoming, available on request)  Career breaks have greater impact on women on lower incomes. Women with lower incomes before childbirth are far less likely to return to work at all. Approximately half of low income women are not in paid work ten years after their first child is born. The Ministry for Women recommends that the tax system should encourage all employers to positively impact parents and caregivers in the workforce, for example:  enable employers to continue Kiwisaver contributions during care-career breaks  create positive tax incentives to employers who offer flexible work options  support employer initiatives for return-to-work and training opportunities.

You proposed 5 key questions for consideration. Our submission relates to 2 of these: 1. What is the purpose of tax? 2. Are we taxing the right things? Milford Asset Management recommends that tax incentives be created to encourage people to save more for retirement. Our enclosed research report titled New Zealand’s Savings Health Check finds the median New Zealand household is not on track for a comfortable retirement because they are not saving and investing effectively. Despite the success of KiwiSaver, more needs to be done to encourage New Zealanders to save effectively for their retirement. We know our current setting (saving only 6 per cent of our income to KiwiSaver) is not enough to fund a comfortable retirement. Simply lifting the KiwiSaver contribution rates can be a blunt instrument because some of our population cannot afford to contribute more. Given this, Milford believes that New Zealand’s household savings rate would increase meaningfully if the tax system allowed people: - to make tax-deductible contributions (or contributions out of pre-taxed income) to their KiwiSaver account, capped at a significant but reasonable amount each year (by way of example the UK’s cap is £40,000); and - to contribute over and above the annual cap on a non-tax-deductible basis. and: - Reduce tax rates on investors’ investment earnings in KiwiSaver funds Similar incentives are used in Australia, the US, Canada and the UK. And these countries all have higher household savings rates than New Zealand. The incentives would be applicable to all income earners. Having an annual contribution cap on the incentive, means it would have a proportionally larger positive impact on the savings of lower and middle-income earners. Some may argue creating incentives would cause a substitution affect, where investors simply move money from one asset type to their KiwiSaver account. Even if this were the case, given the vast sums of money New Zealanders have in Milford Asset Management Limited Level 17, 41 Shortland Street PO Box 960, Shortland Street, Auckland 1140, New Zealand.

Importantly, tax incentives tilting behaviour towards saving as opposed to spending, will increase people’s ability to fund their own retirement, therefore relying less on NZ Super. This is a long-term win-win outcome for both the government and the individual. You can see our report by clicking here, with a summary of key findings below: • New Zealand’s household savings rate has been negative the past few years, compared to positive savings rates in Australia, US, Europe and Canada. This means households are using their existing savings or increasing debt to fund current spending. • Despite the generous NZ Super pension, the median New Zealand household is not on track for a financially comfortable retirement • Current KiwiSaver contribution rates average about 6 per cent of income. However, to achieve a comfortable retirement, the median New Zealand household needs to save and invest roughly 11 per cent of their income into growth assets. If they’re investing in conservative assets, their savings rate needs to increase to 17 per cent. These are roughly double and triple the current average KiwiSaver savings rate of 6 per cent. • Most importantly - the median New Zealander is earning about $49,000 per year. Yet anyone earning over $35,000 per year has no tax incentive to contribute more than the minimum 3 per cent to KiwiSaver. • Australia, the US, the UK and Canada all have stronger forms of tax incentives to encourage extra retirement savings – and all these countries have significantly higher savings rates than New Zealand. • Also in the report is a recommendation that new KiwiSaver members who do not actively choose their KiwiSaver fund, should be defaulted to a fund based on their age. With younger investors tilted toward more growth oriented funds and older investors tilted to more conservative oriented funds. The current conservative fund default setting is costing KiwiSaver members who do not make an active decision many thousands of dollars at retirement.

New Zealand’s Savings Health Check Introduction New Zealand’s Savings Health Check New Zealand has a poor savings history and analysis of household balance sheets and savings patterns indicate that many New Zealanders may be unhappy with their retirement. Given the importance of this issue against the backdrop of an aging population and the increasing demands on public fi nances, we believe the government should undertake a more formal review of the savings situation in this country. New Zealand’s household savings rate is negative New Zealand’s Savings Health Check While household assets and wealth have been increasing recently due to increasing house prices and surging equity markets, New Zealand’s household savings rate has actually been negative over the past few years. Savings data both here and overseas include an allowance for depreciation on houses, but even after taking this out of the equation, the household savings rate in New Zealand is still very low at just under 1 per cent. 1 This compares to savings rates of about 4.6 per cent for Australia and around 5 per cent for the USA and Europe (including the effects of depreciation on housing).

Found here https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/m6 What is a country’s household savings rate? The household savings rate is equal to gross household disposable income less household fi nal consumption expenditure and consumption of fi xed capital. Essentially when a country’s savings rate is negative, households in aggregate are spending more than they are earning. This means they are drawing on current savings or using debt to fund current spending. Why does it matter? Household saving is a primary domestic source of funds to fi nance capital investment, which is a major driver of long-term economic growth. Household savings rate by country 1 RBNZ data on Consumption of Fixed Capital, 2017. What’s the current situation for New Zealand households? New Zealand’s Savings Health Check While national measures of savings can be indicative of a problem, it is even more instructive to look at the individual situations of many households. If we compare New Zealanders to Australians – the median Australian household has over $200,000 more wealth after we deduct their loans than the median New Zealand household. 2 However, after accounting for the more generous universal NZ Super pension, New Zealand households and Australian households are roughly neck-and-neck based on current savings. The real differences are coming though. This is because Australians are saving considerably more per year and investing it more effectively. Their aggregate household savings are 6 to 7 per cent higher per year and their superannuation contributions are currently 9.5 per cent versus around 6 per cent for most KiwiSaver investors. In addition, roughly 65 per cent of Australian Superannuation is invested in growth assets compared to KiwiSaver which has only 48 per cent in growth assets. 3 The situation is even more dramatic looking at KiwiSaver default funds, which have only 15 to 25 per cent invested in growth assets. New Zealand’s lower savings rate and preference for more conservative assets will ultimately result in large differences at retirement – as explained later in this report. Massey University and Westpac produce a regular survey showing how much one-person and two-person households are spending during retirement. They then group different expenditure levels into what they call a Choices retirement and a No-Frills retirement. They found a two-person Metro Household would spend roughly $57,000 p.a. for a Choices lifestyle during retirement. A more detailed analysis of the Massey expenditure data shows that expenditure on “freedom” related lifestyle expenditures as opposed to “core needs” is around $190 per week or $9,880 per year for a two-person household. This appears to include all domestic and overseas travel, eating out and leisure activities which likely include activities such as club memberships, movies, etc. We believe this expenditure level may be understating what a true Choices retirement looks like. For example, the data appears to only provide for a couple to have one modestly priced meal out per week. It also does not allow much for travel – even smaller trips within New Zealand. Adjusting for these types of expenditures, and acknowledging the shift in lifestyle expectations amongst younger generations, we would argue a true Choices or what we are calling a Choices Plus lifestyle, could require an extra $10,000 a year in expenditure. 2 Stats NZ Household Net Worth Statistics: Year ended June 2015. ABS Household Income and Wealth Distribution 2015-16. 3 Morningstar KiwiSaver Survey December Quarter 2017. New Zealand’s Savings Health Check The Massey report also shows that based on their Metro Choices lifestyle, a couple needs to save about $486,000 (in today’s dollars) to supplement the government pension. Based on our view of a comfortable retirement, this fi gure would have to be closer to $630,000 if a couple were to retire today, and about $955,000 if they were to retire 20 years from now. Of course, those who make more income typically spend more in their retirement. Abey and Ford address this issue in their book “How Much is Enough?” which provides a range of learnings for all households as to how to balance investments with aspirations, to achieve fi nancial security and personal well-being. Arun Abey was a founder of the very successful Ipac Securities, a holistic fi nancial planning fi rm which expanded from Australia to Asia, Europe and South Africa. They provide a rule-of-thumb that assuming the mortgage is paid off, most couples need around 75% of their fi nal year’s salary to sustain a good lifestyle in retirement. They also express this rule in terms of a multiple of your fi nal year’s salary. Below we have reproduced their table from a New Zealander’s perspective, averaging the results for men and women – noting that women have longer life expectancy and hence require more savings. This rule-of-thumb has a number of critical assumptions. • First, that you are happy to consume all your liquid savings in retirement and leave your house as the only asset in your estate. We fi nd many clients who prefer to live off the income from their savings and are uncomfortable drawing down the capital – this would of course require a substantially greater savings balance to see you through retirement. • Second, that your investments generate a 5 per cent return after infl ation. Any change in this number has a very material impact on the savings required. For example, if you invested your savings in term deposits and only received a return around the infl ation rate, the lump sum you would require would be over 40 per cent higher. This refl ects the impact of compounded returns over the life of your retirement and the fact that you are using your investment returns to fund a larger part of your lifestyle. • Third, the rule is most relevant for middle income earners and assumes a zero pension. In New Zealand, the universal NZ Super pension provides for a substantial safety net for New Zealand households. We provide a revised estimate of the rule-of-thumb adjusting for the impact of NZ Super. For high income earners, who tend to save a high proportion of their income, the 75 per cent rule may be overly generous, but this will depend on their own lifestyle expectations.

What’s the current situation for New Zealand households? Households may have to increase savings rate to have a comfortable retirement New Zealand’s Savings Health Check The median New Zealand household currently has around $62,000 in fi nancial assets. Assuming retirement is 20 years away, at age 65 their Metro Choices lump sum target is $688,000 and their Choices Plus target is $955,000. 4 Below we have calculated the savings contribution rate to achieve these targets assuming you consume all your savings in retirement (i.e. there is no buffer for longevity). This shows that relative to the current average KiwiSaver contribution rate of 6 per cent, the actual target contribution rate would have to be 11 per cent for a Choices lifestyle and 17 per cent for a Choices Plus lifestyle assuming you invest in a growth oriented fund with target returns of 8 per cent per annum before fees and tax. However, if you adopt a far more conservative strategy with a target return of 6 per cent per annum before fees and tax, then the annual contribution rate would need to increase to circa 17 per cent for the Choices Lifestyle and 26 per cent for the Choices Plus lifestyle. It’s important to note that we are not advocating all additional savings are invested into a person’s KiwiSaver account. Because there are currently no tax benefi ts for additional KiwiSaver contributions above $1,042.86 and the fact that your money is locked up until age 65, it may make more sense for a person to invest their additional savings into a professionally managed diversifi ed PIE Investment Fund or other investment vehicle.

This is a major annual outlay for many New Zealanders. Statistics New Zealand’s 2015 data tells us that the average household with a mortgage, is paying a little over $400 per week in mortgage repayments. 7 Assuming an outstanding loan term of 20 years, this would imply total repayments of $415,000 or principal outstanding of $262,500. Conservative Asset Allocation 7 Stats NZ Household Economic Survey June 2015. Households may have to increase savings rate to have a comfortable retirement So how do we fi x this problem? New Zealand’s Savings Health Check At a national level At an individual level people need to be looking at how to increase their savings and ensure those savings are effectively invested. 1. Increase our savings rate Although KiwiSaver has been a fantastic success, there is still room for improvement. Before he was Finance Minister, Grant Robertson said he’d like to see KiwiSaver contribution rates lifted from 3 per cent to 4.5 per cent (story here). The problem with this is a certain part of the population cannot afford to contribute more and hence such a policy can be a pretty blunt instrument. The above table shows the median New Zealand household will have to save at least 11 per cent of its income to achieve a comfortable retirement. However, the average person contributing to KiwiSaver is currently only saving around 6 per cent of their salary (including employer contributions). This means they would need to roughly double their annual savings. A more effective way to encourage people to save more to KiwiSaver than the minimum 3 per cent would be to incentivise them to do it. For example, allowing people to make tax-deductible contributions (or contributions out of pre-taxed income), capped at a certain amount each year, to their KiwiSaver account. Currently, the median New Zealander is earning about $49,000 per year, 8 yet anyone earning over $35,000 has no tax incentive to contribute more than the minimum 3 per cent to KiwiSaver. Australia, the US, the UK and Canada all have stronger forms of tax incentives to encourage extra retirement savings – and all these countries have higher savings rates than New Zealand (see table on page 2). 8 Stats NZ median weekly earnings from paid employment, June quarter 2017 New Zealand’s Savings Health Check 2. Get asset allocation right Making matters worse, the small amount we are saving is being invested too conservatively. 81 per cent of KiwiSaver members have 10-plus years until retirement, yet only 32 per cent of KiwiSaver money is invested in growth oriented funds. 9 This is a huge misalignment because growth funds will almost certainly outperform conservative funds over long time periods. For example, the average KiwiSaver default fund (which is about 80 per cent invested in bonds and cash) delivered a return of 5.4 per cent per annum over the fi rst 10 years of KiwiSaver compared to the average KiwiSaver growth fund which delivered 6.7 per cent per annum. 10 And this period includes a major market downturn which typically favours conservative funds. If you extrapolate these returns forward, a 25-year- old investor would be over $200,000 better off at retirement simply by choosing a growth fund instead of a default fund (see graph on following page). That’s roughly $10,000 more of annual retirement income each year. The better performing KiwiSaver growth funds have done even better, with the top quartile of managers delivering 8.5 per cent per annum over the fi rst ten years of KiwiSaver. 11 This illustrates how getting asset allocation right will have a very signifi cant impact on the quality of New Zealanders’ retirement lifestyles. 9 Morningstar KiwiSaver Survey September Quarter 2017 & IRD Monthly KiwiSaver Stats. 10 Morningstar KiwiSaver Survey September Quarter 2017.

Comparing to Australia again, in total, their superannuation money is heavily weighted to higher returning growth assets with roughly 65 per cent invested in equities. 12 This compares to Default KiwiSaver funds which tend to allocate 15 to 25 per cent in equities. New Zealanders also tend to hold a substantially higher proportion of their non-KiwiSaver assets in cash and term deposits, thereby weighing down aggregate investment returns. 12 ASFA Superannuation Statistics December 2017.

Therefore, not only are Australians getting wealthier through higher savings, they are investing in a much smarter way for retirement – creating a double whammy to increase wealth creation. At a national level We believe the government should do a detailed study of individual savings patterns and retirement requirements. Their report should include a clear statement on the sustainability of NZ Super and the sorts of pensions that can be provided by the government over a long period of time. It is important that the public know how much Super they can rely on so they can plan accordingly. We also believe there is a strong case for savings-based tax incentives as in other higher-saving developed economies. This would encourage additional retirement savings and help reduce our negative national savings rate. Lastly, the government should consider the adoption of an aged-based approach to Default KiwiSaver fund enrolment. This would help ensure younger investors with long investment time horizons are being allocated to more growth oriented investment strategies. So how do we fi x this problem?

Tax and the Environment Submission: Ministry for the Environment Key points • Environmental and resources taxes and other pricing tools can play an increasing role in making Aotearoa New Zealand the most liveable place in the world • Environmental and resource taxes and other pricing tools can be used as effective policy instruments, in concert with other tools, to change behaviour to achieve environmental outcomes and improve economic efficiency • Environmental and resource taxes may not meet all traditional tax criteria but should be considered on a case-by-case basis • We would appreciate the Tax Working Group’s views on the framework (or frameworks) for designing environmental and resource taxes and prerequisites for successfully implementing them • We strongly promote the continued development of the New Zealand emissions trading scheme (NZ ETS) as the principal tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support our transition to a low emissions economy • Where taxes are designed to change behaviour (e.g. to reduce pollution), we consider the outcomes sought can be further incentivised to reach efficient levels by hypothecating the revenue back to projects that aim to achieve the same outcomes • We welcome the Group investigating the nature of the entire tax system to support a transition to a more circular economy. Terms of Reference The Group’s terms of reference asks, amongst other things, “what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term.” In 2017, the OECD 1 reviewed Aotearoa New Zealand’s environmental performance and recommended the Government expand the use of environmental and resource taxes, potentially within an overall reform of the taxation system. As such, the decision to investigate the role of taxes to deliver environmental benefits is timely. The Ministry considers this term of reference opens multiple issues for investigation by the Group, including: • environmental taxes that aim to change and correct behaviour that result in negative environmental externalities (e.g. nutrient runoff resulting in water pollution) • resource taxes (or resource rentals) that aim to provide a fair return from a public or community asset that is used for private benefit (e.g. mineral royalties) • tax concessions that aim to reinforce and support positive environmental externalities (e.g. conservation of native habitat on private land) • uses of tax revenue received from environmental and resource taxes, and the potential to recycle or earmark tax revenues for specific purposes (e.g. environmentally-related research and development, remediation projects, or addressing iwi and hapū rights and interests). • wider tax system impacts on environmental and ecological outcomes (e.g. the incentives or disincentives on consumption provided by GST and income taxes, and improving 1 OECD, 2017. OECD Environmental Performance Review: New Zealand 2017. OECD Publishing: Paris. income/wealth equality, which correlates with positive environmental outcomes, through changes to income and other taxes). The Ministry encourages the Group to consider the environmental, social, cultural and economic impacts of each of these issues. Iwi and hapū rights and interests need to be appropriately considered as part of any analysis of environmental and resource taxes. The Ministry also notes that there are environmental trends, such as climate change, which will place increasing burden on the Government’s finances. For example, managed retreat from natural hazards and the maintenance of critical infrastructure. View of the Ministry Aotearoa New Zealand faces considerable environmental challenges and the Ministry believes taxes and other pricing tools should be part of the Government’s response to these challenges. Environmental and resource taxes should be seen as complementary to a suite of other potential tools including regulation, trading schemes, direct investment and education. Advantages of environmental and resource taxes The Ministry views environmental and resources taxes as powerful tools as they can potentially: • improve the efficiency of natural resource use between competing users and across generations • ensure environmental damages and pollution are included in the cost of goods and services, which encourages changes in behaviour as people respond to prices • provide a fair return of a public asset that is used for private benefit • provide flexibility and clarity to allow people to choose the lowest-cost combination of methods of reducing their environmental footprint • provide an ongoing incentive for polluters to reduce pollution (rather than just reducing to an allocated discharge level) • incentivise innovation to increase resource efficiency, and reduce environmental and ecological impacts • raise revenue that can be used for environmental projects or reduce more-distorting taxes. Overall, the Ministry believes that environmental and resources taxes and other pricing tools can play an increasing role in addressing some of Aotearoa New Zealand’s environmental challenges and to make this country the most liveable place in the world. We see environmental and resource taxes and other pricing tools, when appropriately complemented with other tools, as particularly useful to support meaningful transitions in our economy. For example, the Ministry considers a meaningful emissions price through the NZ ETS as critical to transitioning Aotearoa New Zealand to a low emissions economy and achieving our 2050 emissions target. Environmental and resource taxes may not meet all traditional tax criteria but should be considered on a case-by-case basis Critics of environmental and resource taxes have raised a number of issues associated with their implementation, such as instability of revenue, regressivity, inaccuracy of tools to measure environmental units, difficulty in determining an efficient price (that represents the cost of the externality), public acceptance, reducing industry competitiveness, and administrative complexity. We agree that some or all of these can be issues for certain environmental and resource taxes, however these criticisms do not apply to all of them. Some critics have suggested that environmental taxes should be nationally uniform. However, we do not consider this is necessary and if the tax is attempting to correct for externalities, differentiated taxes might be more appropriate. For example, charging a higher rate for nutrients to reduce the impacts on an iconic lake. The Ministry considers that environmental and resource taxes should be analysed on a case-by-case basis, and considered against the alternative tool or tools available. For instance a tax could reduce industry competitiveness by applying additional costs to an industry; however the alternative may be a regulation which imposes even higher costs on the industry. We note that with improvements in technology and increased focus and investment, the measurability of pollution levels or environmental harm has improved significantly. For example, improvements in telemetering of water abstractions provide a much more accurate picture of how much water is being taken out of our rivers, lakes and groundwater sources. Similarly, there has also been improvements to the OVERSEER model, which is being used to allocate nutrient discharge allowances to individual properties and used to estimate greenhouse gas emissions. But there is room to do more and this will require investment from both the private and public sectors. The Ministry considers hypothecation of environmental tax revenues back to environmental projects is appropriate, especially where such taxes are set well below their efficient rate. In these cases, hypothecation can improve environmental and economic outcomes through both the incentive effects of the tax and the earmarked funding supporting further mitigation including fostering research and development in new low pollution technologies. We also see hypothecation as useful to improve the public acceptability of introducing such taxes. Where environmental and resource taxes are not hypothecated, they can reduce more distorting taxes in the economy. We would welcome the Group’s views on the prerequisites to successfully implement environmental taxes. The Ministry welcomes input on environmental and resources taxes and other pricing tools, especially for climate and fresh water Currently, the Ministry administers a number of tax and similar pricing tools, including the Waste Disposal Levy and the NZ ETS. The ongoing water allocation (including allocation of discharges to water) work programme will also consider tax and other pricing tools within the scope of its work. We strongly promote the continued development of the NZ ETS as the principal tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support our transition to a low emissions economy. The NZ ETS will soon be analysed by the Interim Climate Change Committee, as part of its deliberations on the role of agriculture in climate change policy, and the transition to 100 per cent renewable electricity. We believe it is unnecessary for the Group to consider these issues given that a separate expert body has been developed specifically to do so. However, other aspects regarding the ongoing development of NZ ETS are welcomed including the use of auction revenue and the use of price controls, amongst other things. How to allocate uses of, and discharges to, fresh water is a complex policy question. If tax and other pricing tools were used, they would likely be just one of many tools that would be woven together to address the issues of freshwater allocation. The Ministry would welcome the Group’s analysis on how taxes could improve freshwater environments and ecosystems, as well as increase the social and economic benefits from the use of fresh water. The Ministry welcomes input on how the entire tax system can support environmental and economic outcomes and make Aotearoa New Zealand the most liveable place in the world The Ministry considers that environmental and resource taxes can support a transition towards a more circular economy. For example, we consider that using environmental taxes (including improvements to the waste disposal levy) and resource taxes can reduce waste, pollution, environmental degradation and resource depletion to a more efficient level and create more sustainable, resilient, long-lasting value in the economy. We note that the OECD 2 has recently found that “... a transition to a circular economy – with the associated reductions in resource extraction and waste generation – could take place with potentially significant positive (or at least without negative) consequences for economic growth or overall employment.” We see changes to the tax system through an increase in environmental and resource taxes and a reduction in more economically distorting taxes as important, as it could provide significant environmental and economic benefits to Aotearoa New Zealand. We welcome the Group investigating the nature of the entire tax system to support such a transition to a more circular economy. The Ministry recognises that the Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991 is a critical piece of legislation and it enables development to reflect and adhere to the values of the community. As such, we consider the RMA does not unnecessarily restrict the development of land. The Ministry welcomes the Group investigating the potential impacts on development and resource use that capital gains and land taxes could have. For example, we see land taxes could provide incentives to increase the efficiency of land use and disincentivise land banking. Role of Tax Working Group We look forward to the Tax Working Group raising public awareness of how taxes and other pricing tools can be used to deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes. We hope that this will encourage further public discussion and highlight the priorities and concerns the public has about environmental and resource taxes. Given the scope and timeframes for the Group we do not anticipate that it will be able to address such matters as detailed design of environmental or resource taxes, or how to address iwi and hapū rights and interest in relation to these taxes and pricing tools. We would appreciate the Group’s views on the framework (or frameworks) for designing environmental and resource taxes and prerequisites for implementing them. We expect that this framework will need to be developed further to design taxes, and woven together with a wider package of tools. 2 OECD, 2017. The macroeconomics of the circular economy transition.

TEAM-38-266 TAX WORKING GROUP: SUBMISSION FROM THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND TRADE Introduction This submission responds to the request to the Chief Executive from the Chair of the Tax Working Group (TWG) on 21 March seeking the Ministry’s direct input in the form of a submission to the TWG. This submission has been informed by the Ministry’s role, among other things, to act in the world to make New Zealanders more prosperous; the Ministry’s experience in engaging with other countries and international institutions; our expertise regarding New Zealand’s international obligations; and the TWG Submissions Background Paper. Trade, investment and the wider New Zealand economy In addition to the challenges of productivity, sustainability and inclusiveness, New Zealand faces enduring challenges of scale, distance from markets and an export mix that is vulnerable to global protectionism. Compounding this situation New Zealand’s productivity performance has been poor relative to a number of other OECD countries in recent decades. Weak international connections – including through trade and investment links – may be one factor contributing to New Zealand’s relatively low productivity. 1 International connections help lift productivity through a number of channels, including increased competition, by providing New Zealand businesses access to more customers, to frontier technologies and ideas, and to broader sources of capital. These connections are particularly important given New Zealand’s small domestic markets which limit the scope for relatively productive firms to expand and benefit from scale effects. There are many external barriers (tariffs, non-tariff barriers and so on) to firms engaging internationally. Domestic policies and domestic economic conditions have an important bearing, however, on the extent to which New Zealand firms can effectively engage internationally, and on the level of participation by foreign firms and investors in New Zealand. This has broader economic and fiscal implications. Globally, New Zealand is well-regarded in terms of the ease of doing business, ranking first in the World Bank’s 2017 Doing Business Survey. The relative simplicity of New Zealand’s tax regime is one factor underlying New Zealand’s ranking. This is 1 Conway, P. (2016), “Achieving New Zealand’s productivity potential”, Productivity Commission Research Paper, 2016/1. TEAM-38-266 Page 2 of 6 an important consideration for New Zealand, given our small scale and distance from concentrations of global economic activity relative to other more attractive, much larger and better located, economies. MBIE’s briefing for the incoming Minister 2 observes that the performance of the housing market is one factor weighing on the tradeables sector, and consequently affects productivity in the economy more broadly. High and consistent appreciation in house prices hinders the efficiency of capital allocation in the economy by skewing investment away from more productive, tradable sectors. High house prices in some areas may also hinder labour mobility, and impede the process of matching jobs (including those related to trade) and workers. This can make it more difficult for productive firms to attract the staff they need to expand. New Zealand has had a persistent shortfall of national saving relative to investment (reflected in a persistent current account deficit). A range of New Zealand publications 3 suggest that this shortfall contributes to New Zealand’s relatively high real long-term interest rates, which in turn puts upward pressure on the real exchange rate. New Zealand’s real exchange rate has an important bearing on the competiveness of New Zealand’s firms internationally. For example, research on New Zealand firms found that a 10% increase in the bilateral exchange rate reduces exports to that destination market by about 3% among firms that are already exporting. 4 A persistently high real exchange rate relative to fundamentals will weaken New Zealand’s trade performance and encourage resources into the lower- productivity non-tradable part of the economy and away from higher productivity activity, much of it in the tradable sectors. A number of factors are likely to contribute to the functioning of New Zealand’s housing market and therefore, by extension to New Zealand’s real exchange rate. Given the role that stronger international connections can play in lifting living standards for New Zealanders, it is important to consider the implications of tax policy settings for New Zealand’s trade exposed sectors in particular and New Zealand’s global connectedness. These include the role that tax settings play in influencing (and potentially distorting) saving and investment decisions in New Zealand, the effect these have on New Zealand’s global connectedness, and the simplicity or complexity of New Zealand’s tax regime relative to other economies. The TWG may wish to further investigate these factors. 2 MBIE (2017), Briefing for the incoming Minister of Housing and Urban Development. 3 A. M.

Sanderson (2015), Exchange rate fluctuations and the margins of exports, New Zealand Treasury Working Paper 15/08 TEAM-38-266 Page 3 of 6 Australia: the Single Economic Market and considerations for our tax regime The economic integration agenda or Single Economic Market (SEM) seeks to develop a seamless trans-Tasman business environment – where a New Zealand enterprise finds it as easy to do business in Sydney as in Auckland, and vice-versa for an Australian firm. The SEM agenda has successfully advanced a range of taxation cooperation and alignment measures, with the capacity to achieve much more. A long-standing objective for New Zealand in the SEM is trans-Tasman mutual recognition of imputation credits (MRIC). Australia and New Zealand are the only two OECD countries to apply imputation credits (called franking credits in Australia). New Zealand has long promoted MRIC as a logical next step for the SEM, as have business leaders. However, the Australian Government has been reluctant to engage due to the associated fiscal cost. The TWG could usefully reinforce the argument for MRIC, particularly in light of the deliberate move by both Australia and New Zealand away from consideration purely of national benefits in policy development, to consideration of the net trans-Tasman benefit. This is now a key SEM principle formally adopted by the two Prime Ministers in 2009 5 . Applying a new trans-Tasman benefit lens to MRIC should in theory underline the need for change. The narrow application of imputation and franking credits to domestically earned dividends results in the inefficient allocation of capital within the SEM. Economic modelling shows MRIC would increase trans-Tasman welfare, with a $7.0 billion gain by 2030 (2012 estimate 6 ). Currently some NZ$7.4 billion of trans-Tasman equity investment dividends could potentially be taxed twice through company tax and later personal tax regimes. Australian equity investors in New Zealand face an effective tax rate of some 60%, and New Zealand investors in Australia face an effective tax rate of 53% 7 . The significance of these issues is underlined by the importance of investment in each other’s economies. Currently, Australia has portfolio investment stock of NZ$27.0 billion in New Zealand, and New Zealand has NZ$34 billion stock of 5 The Single Economic Market Principles and Outcomes Framework was announced by Prime Ministers Key and Rudd in their joint statement of 20 August 2009. https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/joint-statement-prime-ministers-rudd-and-key 6 NZIER and CIE final report, August 2012 https://nzier.org.nz/static/media/filer\_public/ca/8c/ca8ca43d-703e- 4f6a-b12a- 59e17a8808e9/120831\_report\_on\_costs\_and\_benefits\_of\_mutual\_recognition\_of\_imputation\_and\_franking\_credi ts.pdf 7 “Strengthening Trans-Tasman Economic Relations: A Joint Study” undertaken by the Australian Government and NZ Government Productivity Commissions in November 2012. : https://www.productivity.govt.nz/inquiry- content/1774?stage=4 TEAM-38-266 Page 4 of 6 portfolio investment in Australia (March 2017 figures). Total trans-Tasman portfolio investment flows reached $2.2 billion in the year to March 2017. Ministers on both sides of the Tasman have also shown interest in working together on a “one-stop shop” registration for the application of goods and services tax on goods purchased online. The initiative is on hold after the mandate to consider any new policy in relation to GST levied on offshore suppliers was shifted to the TWG. This has important linkages with trade and investment. The initiative should be advanced, including by consideration of the likely positive effect on competitiveness both across the SEM, but also more generally. The digital economy As outlined in the TWG background paper, there is growing international concern and interest in relation to the current ability of taxation structures and systems to deal with the increasing digitalisation of economies. Considerable work has occurred to date in forums such as the OECD’s ‘Taskforce on the Digital Economy’ to try to achieve a multilateral consensus on the appropriate definitions for the “digital economy” for taxation purposes, and an appropriate suite of international measures and disciplines to govern the application of taxation rules by 2020. As a small, open, and export-led economy that relies heavily on the international rules-based system, we recommend that work towards a broad consensus and multilateral solutions continues to be New Zealand’s overarching priority in relation to possible responses to the effect of the digital economy. New Zealand should continue to support and participate fully in this international policy dialogue regarding a possible multilateral agreement on appropriate definitions, measures and potential disciplines. This agreement needs to be an ‘open-plurilateral’ – open to all economies and apply ‘best practice’ for both tax and trade agreements. Work towards similar (open plurilateral) arrangements on investment and e-commerce is under way in the WTO context, though these are less ambitious and less likely to have an impact on fiscal matters. Pending accepted multilateral rules in this area, some countries have been examining the possibility of interim measures such as equalisation taxes. MFAT recommends that if it is decided to examine further the potential of temporary, interim measures in the New Zealand context, thorough consideration should be given to TEAM-38-266 Page 5 of 6 New Zealand’s existing international legal and trade obligations and policy objectives. It would also be desirable to consider international best practice by other countries. In addition, any potential impact or influence on New Zealand’s ability to attract and retain cross-border investment as well as maintaining (and enhancing) a transparent, attractive and stable business environment should also be considered. New Zealand’s international obligations: Trade Agreements New Zealand has a network of high quality and comprehensive trade agreements in place. This architecture includes the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreements and a range of bilateral, regional and plurilateral Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). We are continuing to negotiate further such agreements (including to update these). The need for this architecture which provides enforceable rules and disciplines has been reinforced by increasing turbulence in the global economy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade leads the negotiation and implementation of the international agreements. New Zealand’s trade agreements, however, have only a limited impact on domestic tax policy. This is partly because New Zealand’s free trade agreements generally include broadly drafted exceptions which preserve the government’s right to regulate in the area of domestic tax policy. This reflects a reluctance to allow the disciplines particularly in a FTA to impact on domestic tax measures except where there is a clear need to do so. Other countries generally adopt a similar view. Taxation-related exceptions preserve the carefully negotiated rights and obligations with respect to taxation that exist in the WTO agreements. Those provisions that do apply to taxation measures limit countries’ ability to discriminate against or unfairly disadvantage foreign goods, services and investment. These includes obligations that limit governments’ ability to condition tax advantages on specified ‘performance requirements’ for foreign investments, among other things. As an export-dependent country New Zealand has important interests in seeking to ensure an appropriate balance between protecting the government’s right to regulate particularly for domestic tax policy while limiting the scope for other countries to disadvantage our exporters, for example through use of the tax regime to deliver trade and investment distorting subsidies. International tax policy, including measures to address multinational tax avoidance, is largely dealt with in bilateral and multilateral tax agreements negotiated by the Inland Revenue Department. New Zealand’s trade agreements typically give primacy to these agreements. TEAM-38-266 Page 6 of 6 There is a potential question worth considering around investment incentives some of which relate to fiscal policy. This is an area where disciplines could be applied internationally, although there is at present no ready basis for agreement to discipline tax incentives. The competitiveness of New Zealand as an investment destination is influenced by New Zealand’s own tax settings but also the tax settings of other countries, particularly where other countries provide investment or related tax incentives in the form of exemptions, tax holidays and rebates or other potentially distorting measures. The impact of tax competition is potentially inflated where other factors such as political and regulatory stability are not at play. Aside from the WTO Agreement on Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) which is relatively narrow in scope, there are no meaningful multilateral disciplines on investment incentives designed to affect FDI to a particular location. The need for transparent and non-discriminatory rules and disciplines in this area is clear, but countries – particularly those with ‘deep pockets’ - continue to be reluctant to work multilaterally to address this significant gap in the international trade and investment rules-based system. This may be something for the TWG to consider further in terms of the intended issues before it, including to encourage an intensification of focus on these issues in New Zealand’s international trade policy agenda.

In particular, we commend the TWG for its interest in organisations operating in the Māori economy and for its openness to consider the relevance of tikanga Māori to the design of New Zealand’s tax regime. In our submission we focus on areas which Moana New Zealand considers to be particularly relevant to us and our stakeholders. These are: 1. The relevance of tikanga Māori to the design of the tax regime 2. The Māori Authority tax regime 3. The Charities tax regime 4. Capital gains tax and settlement assets 5. Environmental taxes. About Moana New Zealand Moana New Zealand is the largest Māori-owned seafood company and the second largest seafood company in terms of quota volume and value in New Zealand. We are unique in that we are the only organisation that is owned by all Māori (58 Iwi across New Zealand). Established in 2004 through the Māori Fisheries Act, Moana New Zealand is an important part of the inter-generational Māori Fisheries Settlement with the Crown. The nature of that settlement means that Māori will always be involved in fisheries and our activities and investments have a long-term perspective that is respectful of fisheries and the ecosystems we are part of. Moana New Zealand must pay dividends to its shareholders of at least 40% of our annual profit, with the balance retained to invest in growth opportunities for future generations. Our ability to pay dividends and to manage assets in a commercial manner is directly linked to the successful management of New Zealand’s fisheries. We are governed by Te Ohu Kai Moana Trustee Ltd (also established by the Māori Fisheries Act) which holds 100% of the voting interests and 20% of the income interests in Moana New Zealand. Our Iwi shareholders hold the remaining 80% income interests in Moana New Zealand. Moana New Zealand is a proud supporter and economic contributor to regional New Zealand with operations throughout the North Island, top of the South Island and the Chatham Islands. The relevance of Tikanga Māori to the design of the tax regime We commend the TWG for recognising the relevance of te ao Māori and the role that the Māori economy has in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards. Moreover, we are also pleased to see the interest of the TWG in incorporating concepts of tikanga Māori in the design of New Zealand’s future tax system. Moana New Zealand’s tikanga are:  Kaitiakitanga – custodians for our future generations  Manākitanga – looking after people our way  Whakapapa – our genealogy  Whakatipuranga – prosperity for future generations. These values inform our purpose and vision. They also guide our decision-making and actions. In short, our tikanga underpins every aspect of our operations. Our assets can never be sold, therefore decisions must be in-line with our values and have a long term view that is respectful of our future generations. In our view, the adoption of such concepts, which support a forward-looking, sustainable approach for future generations, will supplement the more traditional frameworks used in the design of tax systems (for example, efficiency, equity and fairness, revenue integrity, fiscal adequacy, compliance and administrative costs and coherence) in a positive way. The interaction of both tikanga and the traditional frameworks will ensure the design of New Zealand’s tax system continues to evolve in a way that remains best for New Zealand as New Zealand continues to change in the future. The Māori authority tax regime Moana New Zealand is a Māori authority (being specifically included as Aotearoa Fisheries Limited in the relevant definition in the Income Tax Act 2007). We strongly support the maintenance of the current Māori authority tax regime. Specifically, Māori authorities generally have unique structures and constraints which are applicable to Māori organisations and businesses only, including restrictions on the ability of members of a Māori authority to sell their interests in the assets of the authority. Furthermore, Māori authorities are not homogenous and they can differ in a number of ways including their legal structure, size, types of activities undertaken, the range of benefits they provide, membership of the group and the mix of objectives. These special characteristics mean that it would be inappropriate to require Māori authorities to be taxed in the same manner as other companies or trusts. For example, while we have an accurate record of our shareholders, we are aware that for a number of our shareholders (many of whom are themselves Māori authorities), maintaining accurate share registers is challenging due to that ownership being held directly or indirectly by Iwi or hapū. This makes compliance with the technical requirements of shareholder continuity (in the case of company taxation) or to attribute income to individual members (as the case under trust rules) impractical. Therefore, we consider that there continues to be sound policy justification for the maintenance of a specific tax regime that applies to Māori authorities. In our view, the current regime is appropriate on the basis that it achieves the following:  Members who receive distributions are generally taxed on that income at their respective marginal rates.  Costs for Māori authorities in complying with their tax requirements are minimised.  Compliance costs for members who receive financial benefits from Māori authorities are reduced by reducing the need for them to file an income tax return as a result of overpayment or underpayment of tax.  The unique characteristics, structures and conditions of Māori authorities and the activities they undertake are recognised. However, we consider a number of refinements can be made to the current regime to ensure that the regime better achieves its intended tax policy outcomes. Specifically, we consider the following changes should be made: 1. Expanding the definition of Māori authority to include wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities 2. Allowing Māori authorities to get a refund of imputation credits that are in excess of 17.5% rather than having them convert to Māori authority tax credits 3. Removing the restrictions on the ability for Māori authorities to interact with other non-Māori authority entities in the tax regime 4. The requirement to withhold resident withholding tax at 33% is reduced to 17.5% even where the Māori authority does not know the IRD number of the recipient 5. Development of a Māori authority tax credit refund form that is similar to the resident withholding tax deducted in error form. We discuss the above in more detail below. Over-taxation of Māori authorities One of the main categories of entities included in the definition of ‘Māori authority’ are entities that have received settlement assets directly from the Crown (although the definition is not limited to such entities, for example Te Ture Whenua entities are also eligible to elect). This means any subsidiary that is subsequently set up to hold or manage the assets by the initial entity which received the asset directly from the Crown (the Māori authority) will not be able to elect into the Māori authority tax regime. The inability to elect into the Māori authority tax regime means that the subsidiary will be subject to the company tax rate of 28% and not 17.5%. This mismatch in tax rates means that the Māori authority accumulates excess imputation credits as a result of the subsidiary being taxed at 28% but the Māori authority is only able to effectively pass on 17.5% the benefit of those credits to its members (in the form of Māori authority tax credits). We note that although the excess imputation credits will convert to Māori authority tax credits, those tax credits are often unable to be attached to a distribution by the Māori authority as the amount of Māori authority tax credits that can be attached is capped at 17.5%. This issue is exacerbated by the fact that Māori authorities are prevented from interacting with other non-Māori authority entities in the tax regime. For example, Māori authorities are unable to offset losses with other companies, amalgamate with other companies or be members of a tax consolidated group with non-Māori authorities. For example, Moana New Zealand has experienced instances where losses exist within our group (in wholly-owned subsidiaries) yet Moana New Zealand is required to pay tax as it is in profit. In our view, the issues outlined above mean that there is over-taxation of income of the Māori authority. As a Māori authority and its subsidiary are a single economic unit, there is no reason to have a different tax rate applying between the two if the policy rationale is to ensure any income derived through a Māori authority is to be effectively taxed at the members’ marginal tax rate. Furthermore, the subsidiary will effectively be subject to the same restrictions as its parent in relation to its assets. We therefore consider the following changes should be made to ensure the income of Māori authorities are not over-taxed:  Expanding the definition of Māori authority to include wholly-owned subsidiaries of Māori authorities – this will ensure there is no over-taxation of the Māori authority’s income.  Allowing Māori authorities to get a refund of imputation credits that are in excess of 17.5% rather than having them convert to Māori authority tax credits – this will eliminate the issue of the economic unit of the Māori authority bearing a 28% tax rate on its income due to it being unable to distribute excess Māori authority tax credits to its members.  Removing the restrictions on the ability for Māori authorities to interact with other non-Māori authority entities in the tax regime. Improving the administration of the regime From what we have seen and heard from our Iwi stakeholders the Māori authority regime is often not well understood. The lack of understanding, in our view, undermines the effectiveness of the regime and is also preventing it from fully achieving its intended purposes. We would recommend Inland Revenue provide further guidance to ensure those affected by the regime understand how the regime operates in a practical sense. An administrative issue that often arises for Māori authorities is the requirement that a Māori authority must deduct resident withholding tax up to a rate of 33% if it does not know the IRD number of the recipient (an additional 15.5% if the Māori authority distribution has Māori authority tax credits attached at 17.5%). It is not uncommon that Māori authorities are unable to identify every one of its members. This results in over-taxation of the income if there is an acceptance that recipients of Māori authority distributions are generally taxed at 17.5%. We therefore submit that the requirement to withhold resident withholding tax at 33% is reduced to 17.5% even where the Māori authority does not know the IRD number of the recipient. The current refund process for obtaining refunds of Māori authority tax credits is cumbersome. We consider further work needs to be done to smooth out the refund process. We recommend that a Māori authority tax credit refund form (similar to the resident withholding tax deducted in error form) is developed so that non-taxable recipients of Māori authority distributions are able to quickly and efficiently obtain a refund of any Māori authority tax credits received. The charities tax regime Moana New Zealand supports the policy rationale that the tax system should support organisations that have a charitable purpose. We are also supportive of the business activity exemption for charities as it supports the underlying policy of providing tax relief to charitable organisations, especially in the context of Iwi. We also support the maintenance of a deduction for Māori authorities for donations made to donee organisations or to Māori associations. If changes are to be made to the charities tax regime, we strongly recommend that specific consideration be given to Māori organisations as most Iwi groups have charitable organisations that are members or are associated with them. Care should be taken to ensure any changes to the charities tax regime do not result in any adverse or unintended consequences for Iwi, including any additional compliance costs that could result from such change. Finally, we also continue to support the recognition of the uniqueness of Māori organisations and Iwi in the definition of ‘charitable purpose’ for income tax purposes, namely the relaxation of the ‘blood ties’ restriction, which was made in 2004, in parallel with a review of the Māori authorities tax regime. Capital gains tax and settlement assets Moana New Zealand supports a tax system that is fair, balanced and equitable. We also recognise that fairness is a key focus for the TWG. We submit that if a capital gains tax is to be introduced, concessions should be made for ‘settlement assets’ to recognise their unique characteristics as, in our view, it would be inequitable for such assets to be subject to a capital gains tax. Our view is consistent with the sentiment conveyed in the Future of Tax paper which recognises the unique nature of settlement assets. Specifically, we note that settlement assets represent compensation from the Crown to Iwi to settle historic wrongs. It would be contrary to the sentiment of compensation if Māori authorities are required to pay tax on any future transfer of these special assets. Furthermore, settlement assets are subject to significant legislative restrictions on how they may be transferred. Such assets are only able to be transferred between Mandated Iwi Organisations. Settlement assets are therefore not subject to normal ‘market’ conditions which generally results in a negative impact on the value of those assets. Imposing a capital gain tax on those transfers will further dilute the value of those assets to Iwi. Finally, practical issues can also arise if a capital gains tax is introduced and applied to settlement assets. For example, it would be difficult to ascertain the market value of such assets, especially taking into account the restrictions referred to above. It will also be difficult to determine the cost of such assets given they are a form of compensation to Iwi and not purchased. We therefore strongly submit that settlement assets should be outside the scope of any capital gains tax and ‘settlement assets’ should be given a commercially relevant definition which for Moana New Zealand should include both settlement quota and shares in its subsidiaries. Environmental taxes The sustainable management of marine resources and the well-being of our environment is critical to Moana New Zealand’s ongoing success. Moana New Zealand holds a deep sense of responsibility to Iwi to respect and protect kaimoana and kai ora. We understand that the application of environmental taxes is a specific area that is being contemplated by the TWG. However, we note that New Zealand’s current tax system has generally adopted the approach of having minimum incentives or distortions and therefore the introduction of taxes to discourage certain behaviours would be relatively novel in the context of the current tax policy settings. Given the novelty of such taxes, we urge the TWG to fully examine the policy rationale and potential impact of any environmental taxes. Issues that should be addressed by the TWG include:  Whether there is sufficient evidence to support that the environmental tax will affect behaviours in a way that will result in better outcomes for the environment on a holistic basis.  Challenge whether using tax is the most effective and cost efficient way to achieve the desired environmental outcome – for example, regulation such as New Zealand’s fisheries quota management regime has been effective in helping manage New Zealand’s fisheries stocks in a sustainable manner for future generations.  Clarity as to the purpose and outcome of any resulting environmental taxes. Specifically, we do not consider environmental taxes should be used as a mechanism to raise additional revenue for general government spending. Rather, any revenue raised should be directed to achieving better environmental outcomes for New Zealand. General We appreciate the opportunity for Moana New Zealand to be able to contribute our views and comments to the TWG on the future of New Zealand’s tax system. Please feel free to contact us should you wish to discuss our comments further. Nāku noa, na Simon Jones Chief Financial Officer MOANA NEW ZEALAND \[1\] \[1\]

Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 30 April 2018 Submission to the Tax Working Group Executive Summary The Ministry of Social Development’s (MSD) submission covers a small set of issues focused on the impact of the tax system on our clients, raised in response to the Tax Working Group’s (TWG) Submissions Background Paper. While MSD’s clients are many and varied, one of the key differences in the current welfare system is between the targeted working-age benefit system and the universal New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) system. While NZS is available to almost all New Zealanders who are over 65, the working-age benefit system is subject to income tests to limit its availability to those without any other means of support (and maintain incentives to work). This means that the working-age benefits are generally only accessed by people on relatively low incomes. The welfare system also includes a significant amount of other ‘supplementary’ assistance to help meet costs such as housing, disability and/or childcare. This supplementary assistance is available to people of all ages, but it is subject to income and asset tests, in order to target it those with few other resources. Supplementary assistance is available to people also receiving a main benefit or NZS, and people who are working on relatively low incomes 1 . There are also important ‘life-course’ differences between people of working age and those in retirement. Working-age people are generally trying to accumulate savings and assets, while those in retirement may be decumulating previous savings or selling assets to support their retirement. For these reasons, MSD’s submission is split into two parts to illustrate the particular opportunities to improve wellbeing through taxation for lower-income working-age people (Part One) and retired people (Part Two). Part One concerns working-age people on lower incomes and suggests that the Tax Working Group considers: • The overall balance of the tax system in relation to redistribution, including considering increasing the reduction in income (and wealth) inequality caused by the tax system; and 1 While MSD pays students loans and allowances, policy responsibility for student financial support sits with the Ministry of Education. • The impact on those on the lowest incomes of any changes to tax, particularly any impacts on effective marginal tax rates and key costs for low-income households such as rent, power and food. Part Two concerns people in retirement and suggests that the Tax Working Group considers: • Better aligning the tax rules that apply across different types of investments to support households to increase long-term savings; and • Improving the tax rules for annuities to improve options for the decumulation of retirement savings. We note that the Group’s Terms of Reference exclude consideration of “the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system”. In our view, this is a missed opportunity to consider the significant interactions between the systems, particularly as these disproportionately impact people on the lowest incomes. It is also a missed opportunity to consider the trade-offs across the tax and transfer system. Our current system has created a relatively simple and broad-based tax system with limited redistributive powers. This has been paired with a targeted welfare system which ‘takes the weight’ of redistribution, requiring high effective marginal tax rates and considerable complexity for clients and MSD to manage. In MSD’s view, even fiscally-neutral changes to the composition of the tax system should consider any key impacts on the transfer system in order to be able to assess the ‘fairness’ of the changes, particularly for lower-income people who are likely to be affected. MSD officials would be happy to meet with the Tax Working Group if desired. Part One: Taxation and Improving Wellbeing for Lower- Income People of Working Age Who are MSD’s working-age clients? Financial support Numbers 2 Main benefit 273,000 Around 10% of the NZ labour force (16-64 years) 168,000 (or around 15%) of children in NZ No main benefit (only supplementary payments) 58,000 • Using a low-income measure that identifies 15% of the overall population as below the threshold or ‘poor’ 3 , around 80% of those who live in households whose main source of income is a main benefit are below this threshold (‘poor’) and they make up around 40% of all such individuals 4 . • Just over 40% of those who live in households whose main source of income is from a main benefit experience material hardship, compared to around 13% of the overall population 5 . Consider of the overall balance of the tax system in relation to redistribution Current tax settings, particularly the reliance on GST and income taxes (and relatively low top income tax rates) mean that low-income people are likely to pay a higher share of tax than in other countries, and contribute to “the inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax-benefit system (being) currently relatively low compared with that for other OECD countries” 6 . The current tax system’s structure means that the transfer system bears a greater weight to decrease inequality. While the targeted approach to welfare is significantly determined by affordability (linked to the overall level of taxation and out of scope), there is scope for the tax system to increase its redistributive power within the current fiscal envelope. Given the Government’s child poverty reduction targets and the comparatively lower level of redistribution of NZ’s tax and transfer system, consideration could be given to reducing the relative tax burden on those on lower incomes, particularly if this is achieved through more comprehensively taxing sources of income from assets that are currently untaxed. 2 Benefit fact sheet, numbers as at 31 March 2018, http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our- work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html#Latestbenefitfactsheetsrelease1 3 Income below 60% of the median, after housing costs, constant value (2007 reference year) 4 Perry, Bryan “Household Incomes in NZ: Trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982- 2016”, July 2017 5 Ibid 6 “Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper”, Tax Working Group, March 2018, p. 36 Taxes on assets and wealth A way to increase the overall redistributive power of the tax system could be to reduce the reliance on income tax and/or GST, and shift to taxes that target currently untaxed income from assets or wealth, such as a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax (excluding the family home) or a Land Tax. These taxes are much less likely to impact on lower-income people who tend to have fewer (or no) assets. Applying taxes more comprehensively across different sources of income and wealth can reduce distortions in the incentives people have to invest and structure their affairs in particular ways, and also have strong equity arguments. Consider the impact on low-income people of any changes to the tax system Effective marginal tax rates for those on lower incomes While interactions with the transfer system are outside the scope of the TWG’s consideration, MSD’s view is that it is difficult to assess the ‘fairness’ of the tax system without considering the impacts of any changes on lower-(and middle) income people who are navigating across both the tax and welfare systems. The provision of targeted income support necessarily requires the creation of higher Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs), where the combination of tax and the withdrawal of transfer payments as income rise means that people retain less from an increase in income. High EMTRs can create ‘poverty traps’ whereby the gap between benefit and work is insufficient to meet the additional costs of working, and entering employment is discouraged. High EMTRs can also discourage increasing incomes when in work. It is worth noting that the impact of the tax system on EMTRs is modest compared to the impact of welfare settings, given the relatively low tax rates on incomes below $48,000. However, it is worth briefly summarising the key settings in the welfare system, so that any changes to tax are mindful of this context. For all main benefits, there is a modest amount of income that can be earned before the benefit payment begins to reduce – this is known as the ‘abatement-free threshold’ and varies from between $80 and $100 a week for different benefit types. Above this abatement-free threshold, main benefit payments reduce sharply and people face abatement rates of either 30 percent or 70 percent for each dollar earned, resulting in EMTRs of between around 40 percent to 90 percent (once tax and ACC levies are included). It is important to note that a small number of people will be directly experiencing these EMTRs. However, while only a relatively small number of people will be directly experiencing these EMTRs, any beneficiary who moves into work (whether or not they are still entitled to any main benefit payments) will experience these EMTRs over their additional income. This means the gap between their benefit income and their income from work will be relatively small, particularly if their wages are low. High EMTRs also impact on working people receiving supplementary payments. Working for Families payments are reduced by 25 percent for each dollar earned over $42,700 of family income, and Accommodation Supplement reduces by a further 25 percent for each dollar earned above the relevant benefit cut-out point. This means some lower-income families, while significantly benefitting from this supplementary assistance, face EMTRs that are 25-50 percent above their marginal tax rate. For example, a family with two children and a single earner on $50,000 a year, receiving Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement, would retain around 20 percent of a modest pay rise. This compares to a similar family earning $150,000 who would retain around two-thirds of such an increase. Secondary tax – out of scope The current approach to secondary tax results in many beneficiaries who earn additional income being over-taxed on their employment income, as only their benefit income is able to be taxed on the lowest income tax threshold. We understand that improving/abolishing secondary tax is not included in the work of the TWG. Costs for lower-income households Some of the other taxes discussed in the Submissions Background Paper could have significant impacts on low-income people and the costs they face. MSD provides considerable financial support to low-income people, and any significant changes in cost will impact on both the wellbeing of these people and the demand for this support. Note that while this section is inside the ‘working-age’ part of the submission, many of the recommendations will be relevant for low-income superannuitants as well. Housing Affordability Housing costs, and particularly rents, are a key cost for many low-income people. Housing costs have grown considerably faster than incomes for those on lower incomes for a significant period of time, and this has resulted in a large group of low-income households with low residual (after housing costs) incomes. For households in the bottom income quintile, average housing costs have increased from 29% to 51% of their average income between 1988 and 2016 7 . These increased housing costs have put increased pressure on MSD’s provision of social housing, and on the costs of the Accommodation Supplement and hardship assistance such as Temporary Additional Support. MSD’s view is that changes to tax should support an increase in housing affordability, particularly for renters, and should seek to minimise any potentially negative impacts on housing supply. GST and a Sugar Tax Exemptions to GST are also raised in the Background Paper. While recognising the complexity that these exemptions create and their relatively high cost, MSD has seen significant pressure on hardship assistance, particularly grants for food, over the last few years, as shown in the figure on the next page. 7 Perry, Bryan “The material wellbeing of NZ households: Overview and Key Findings”, July 2017 Figure 1: Selected quarterly hardship assistance reasons, March 2013 to March 2018 Any exemptions that would support low-income people to better afford food may reduce pressure on hardship assistance, and improve the health and wellbeing of low-income people who are struggling to get sufficient (and high-quality) food on the table. However, there are potentially most cost-effective solutions within the welfare system to address pressure on hardship assistance. Solutions within the welfare system would be unlikely to be able to provide a targeted incentive to increase consumption of particular products. Conversely, taxes that may increase costs for low-income families, such as a tax on sugar, may flow through to higher demand for MSD support, depending on the extent to which higher costs encourage substitution for other (non-taxed) products. Part Two: Taxation and Improving Wellbeing in Retirement The Submissions Background Paper highlights changing demographics, particularly the ageing population and the fiscal pressures it will bring. The use of dependency ratios, however, over-emphasises the impact of population ageing for two reasons: • More people are remaining in paid work beyond pension age. At around 24 percent, New Zealand currently has one of the highest labour force participation rates in the OECD for people aged 65 years or over. By 2038, it is projected that people aged 65 or over will make up 10 percent of New Zealand’s total workforce. Older people also make an additional economic contribution through unpaid work, volunteering and caregiving. • Older people pay tax – the combination of tax on earnings from paid work, New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), consumption (GST) and investments is significant and growing. The Ministry of Social Development projects that by 2061 people aged 65 or over will pay $25.1 billion in tax, up from around $5.5 billion today (real 2016 dollars) 8 . In terms of future government expenditure associated with the ageing population it is important to remember that while expenditure on public pensions is increasing, New Zealand spends less on public pensions as a percentage of GDP than the average across OECD countries and this is expected to remain the case. It is also important to remember that NZS is taxable and taxed at a recipient’s marginal tax rate – as a result around 14.8 percent of expenditure on NZS is retained by the Crown as income tax. While health expenditure increases with the ageing population, Treasury estimates that from 2025, around 25 percent of the future increase in health spending will be directly attributable to the ageing population 9 . Compared to other age groups, New Zealanders aged 65 years or over are currently less likely to experience material hardship, have low incomes (after deducting housing costs) and live in houses that are hard to heat, damp or mouldy. This is attributable to universal NZS and a high level of mortgage-free home ownership. However, this may not continue for future generations of older people. We anticipate that more people will be reaching the age of 65 with debt and many will still be paying mortgages or living in rental accommodation. For many retirees, NZS will be insufficient to meet their weekly costs and these people will need to rely on accumulated savings or additional financial support from the Government (e.g. Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support or state housing). Therefore, encouraging savings and the tax rules applicable to household savings is of growing importance as we face an ageing population and the growing diversity amongst our older population. We need to lift the level of retirement savings, particularly by people who have a modest income over their working life and who are unlikely to own their home in retirement, and ensure that these retirees have a range of appropriate options for decumulating their savings. 8 http://www.superseniors.msd.govt.nz/documents/publications/business-of-ageing- factsheet-update-osc116.pdf 9 2016 Statement on the Long-term Fiscal Position, Treasury, Wellington, p 61. In the context of improving wellbeing in retirement, we suggest that the Tax Working Group consider: • Better aligning the tax rules that apply across different types of investments; and • The tax rules for annuities. When improving the alignment of the tax treatment of different investments, tax changes that would support wellbeing in retirement should be considered It is important that both retirement income policy and tax policy support long-term saving, particularly for those who during their working life have a modest income. In general, New Zealand’s current tax rules discourage saving. The biggest issue is that current tax rules encourage the diversion of savings into residential property, away from long-term savings vehicles that increase the level of national savings. While not advocating for ‘concessions’ for retirement savings, the tax treatment of locked-in superannuation funds, including KiwiSaver could be considered in the context of ‘levelling the playing field’ across different types of investments. These types of investments are particularly important for people who have a modest income and can therefore save only a modest amount over their working life. In addition, the issue regarding taxation of interest income from bank deposits is of particular relevance to the many retirees who hold their retirement savings in bank accounts. It makes sense for older people who have reached the decumulation stage to look for a conservative/low-risk investment vehicle for their retirement savings and as a result, holding savings in savings accounts with major banks is common practice. While low interest rates becoming embedded is positive for younger people taking on a mortgage, it is not good news for retirees who rely on low-risk investments to generate a portion of their retirement income. In the context of the different tax treatment of different investments, it has been suggested that gains that are solely due to inflation should not be taxed and in particular this should apply to household savings held in bank accounts. This is discussed on pages 39 to 41 of the Tax Working Group’s Submissions Background Paper – Future of Tax – the graph on page 40 highlighting the high effective marginal tax rate of bank account savings compared to other types of savings, particularly housing. Current tax policy in New Zealand significantly advantages investment in owner-occupied housing and rental property and has contributed to house price increases. While the Tax Working Group may consider changes to the tax rules for housing, we suggest that part of ‘levelling the playing field’ for savings should include considering the tax rules applicable to: • Locked-in retirement funds (e.g. KiwiSaver); and • Household savings in bank accounts. Benefits associated with reducing the tax liability of these investments could include reducing the relative attractiveness of investment in residential housing, increasing the level of national savings, and improving the wellbeing in retirement of people who are able to save only a modest amount over their working life. Consider options that would tax annuities in a similar manner to other substitutable investments, to remove a tax distortion that may be discouraging the development of the New Zealand annuities market and contributing to the growing ‘decumulation problem’ KiwiSaver balances are continuing to grow (with around $40 billion of funds currently invested) and so is the number of KiwiSavers eligible to withdraw them. Limited decumulation options mean that financial wellbeing in retirement is potentially less than it could be. For example, lack of options for decumulation could contribute to poor decision-making at age 65 (including using KiwiSaver funds for immediate consumption) which could undermine the purpose of the KiwiSaver scheme – to increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement. The Government has a vested interest in this, given the level of subsidies provided to KiwiSavers – over $8 billion since the scheme commenced in 2007 and forecast expenditure of over $900 million in the current financial year (including the housing deposit subsidy). Annuities are an obvious and potentially efficient way to convert a lump sum of savings into an income stream in retirement. Annuities are popular in overseas jurisdictions for this reason. While the relatively small size of the New Zealand market and uncertainty around longevity risk may be barriers to the provision of annuity products, the New Zealand tax system also treats annuities adversely relative to other forms of investment. The result is that there is only one annuity product on the market at present 10 . The tax issue regarding annuities has three aspects. First, the concessionary PIE investment tax treatment applicable to many other financial investments is not available to annuities. Second, the whole nominal interest component of annuity payments is taxed even though part of it represents inflation and not a real return. Third, other competing investment options can generate tax-free capital gains that make fully-taxed annuities unattractive. The 2009 Capital Market Development Taskforce 11 and the 2010/2011 Savings Working Group 12 , among others, have criticised the tax treatment of annuities as adverse and non-neutral and have advocated reform. We suggest that the Tax Working Group consider the tax rules applicable to annuities to support an environment where people reaching retirement have access to greater range of options for decumulating their savings. 10 Lifetime Income was launched in 2015 and claims to be managing around $100 million of retirement assets. https://www.lifetimeincome.co.nz/ 11 See ‘Capital Markets Matter’ (2009):http://www.med.govt.nz/business/economic- development/pdf-docs-library/cmd-capital-markets-matter-full-report.pdf p 107. 12 See ‘Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity’ (2011):http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/20116/swg-report- jan11.pdf p 102.

While MSD’s clients are many and varied, one of the key differences in the current welfare system is between the targeted working-age benefit system and the universal New Zealand Superannuation (NZS) system. While NZS is available to almost all New Zealanders who are over 65, the working-age benefit system is subject to income tests to limit its availability to those without any other means of support (and maintain incentives to work). This means that the working-age benefits are generally only accessed by people on relatively low incomes. The welfare system also includes a significant amount of other ‘supplementary’ assistance to help meet costs such as housing, disability and/or childcare. This supplementary assistance is available to people of all ages, but it is subject to income and asset tests, in order to target it those with few other resources. Supplementary assistance is available to people also receiving a main benefit or NZS, and people who are working on relatively low incomes 1 . There are also important ‘life-course’ differences between people of working age and those in retirement. Working-age people are generally trying to accumulate savings and assets, while those in retirement may be decumulating previous savings or selling assets to support their retirement. For these reasons, MSD’s submission is split into two parts to illustrate the particular opportunities to improve wellbeing through taxation for lower-income working-age people (Part One) and retired people (Part Two). Part One concerns working-age people on lower incomes and suggests that the Tax Working Group considers:  The overall balance of the tax system in relation to redistribution, including considering increasing the reduction in income (and wealth) inequality caused by the tax system; and 1 While MSD pays students loans and allowances, policy responsibility for student financial support sits with the Ministry of Education.  The impact on those on the lowest incomes of any changes to tax, particularly any impacts on effective marginal tax rates and key costs for low-income households such as rent, power and food. Part Two concerns people in retirement and suggests that the Tax Working Group considers:  Better aligning the tax rules that apply across different types of investments to support households to increase long-term savings; and  Improving the tax rules for annuities to improve options for the decumulation of retirement savings. We note that the Group’s Terms of Reference exclude consideration of “the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system”. In our view, this is a missed opportunity to consider the significant interactions between the systems, particularly as these disproportionately impact people on the lowest incomes. It is also a missed opportunity to consider the trade-offs across the tax and transfer system. Our current system has created a relatively simple and broad-based tax system with limited redistributive powers. This has been paired with a targeted welfare system which ‘takes the weight’ of redistribution, requiring high effective marginal tax rates and considerable complexity for clients and MSD to manage. In MSD’s view, even fiscally-neutral changes to the composition of the tax system should consider any key impacts on the transfer system in order to be able to assess the ‘fairness’ of the changes, particularly for lower-income people who are likely to be affected. MSD officials would be happy to meet with the Tax Working Group if desired. Part One: Taxation and Improving Wellbeing for Lower- Income People of Working Age Who are MSD’s working-age clients? Financial support Numbers 2 Main benefit 273,000 Around 10% of the NZ labour force (16-64 years) 168,000 (or around 15%) of children in NZ No main benefit (only supplementary payments) 58,000  Using a low-income measure that identifies 15% of the overall population as below the threshold or ‘poor’ 3 , around 80% of those who live in households whose main source of income is a main benefit are below this threshold (‘poor’) and they make up around 40% of all such individuals 4 .  Just over 40% of those who live in households whose main source of income is from a main benefit experience material hardship, compared to around 13% of the overall population 5 . Consider of the overall balance of the tax system in relation to redistribution Current tax settings, particularly the reliance on GST and income taxes (and relatively low top income tax rates) mean that low-income people are likely to pay a higher share of tax than in other countries, and contribute to “the inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax-benefit system (being) currently relatively low compared with that for other OECD countries” 6 . The current tax system’s structure means that the transfer system bears a greater weight to decrease inequality. While the targeted approach to welfare is significantly determined by affordability (linked to the overall level of taxation and out of scope), there is scope for the tax system to increase its redistributive power within the current fiscal envelope. Given the Government’s child poverty reduction targets and the comparatively lower level of redistribution of NZ’s tax and transfer system, consideration could be given to reducing the relative tax burden on those on lower incomes, particularly if this is achieved through more comprehensively taxing sources of income from assets that are currently untaxed. 2 Benefit fact sheet, numbers as at 31 March 2018, http://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our- work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html#Latestbenefitfactsheetsrelease1 3 Income below 60% of the median, after housing costs, constant value (2007 reference year) 4 Perry, Bryan “Household Incomes in NZ: Trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982- 2016”, July 2017 5 Ibid 6 “Future of Tax: Submissions Background Paper”, Tax Working Group, March 2018, p. 36 Taxes on assets and wealth A way to increase the overall redistributive power of the tax system could be to reduce the reliance on income tax and/or GST, and shift to taxes that target currently untaxed income from assets or wealth, such as a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax (excluding the family home) or a Land Tax. These taxes are much less likely to impact on lower-income people who tend to have fewer (or no) assets. Applying taxes more comprehensively across different sources of income and wealth can reduce distortions in the incentives people have to invest and structure their affairs in particular ways, and also have strong equity arguments. Consider the impact on low-income people of any changes to the tax system Effective marginal tax rates for those on lower incomes While interactions with the transfer system are outside the scope of the TWG’s consideration, MSD’s view is that it is difficult to assess the ‘fairness’ of the tax system without considering the impacts of any changes on lower-(and middle) income people who are navigating across both the tax and welfare systems. The provision of targeted income support necessarily requires the creation of higher Effective Marginal Tax Rates (EMTRs), where the combination of tax and the withdrawal of transfer payments as income rise means that people retain less from an increase in income. High EMTRs can create ‘poverty traps’ whereby the gap between benefit and work is insufficient to meet the additional costs of working, and entering employment is discouraged. High EMTRs can also discourage increasing incomes when in work. It is worth noting that the impact of the tax system on EMTRs is modest compared to the impact of welfare settings, given the relatively low tax rates on incomes below $48,000. However, it is worth briefly summarising the key settings in the welfare system, so that any changes to tax are mindful of this context. For all main benefits, there is a modest amount of income that can be earned before the benefit payment begins to reduce – this is known as the ‘abatement-free threshold’ and varies from between $80 and $100 a week for different benefit types. Above this abatement-free threshold, main benefit payments reduce sharply and people face abatement rates of either 30 percent or 70 percent for each dollar earned, resulting in EMTRs of between around 40 percent to 90 percent (once tax and ACC levies are included). It is important to note that a small number of people will be directly experiencing these EMTRs. However, while only a relatively small number of people will be directly experiencing these EMTRs, any beneficiary who moves into work (whether or not they are still entitled to any main benefit payments) will experience these EMTRs over their additional income. This means the gap between their benefit income and their income from work will be relatively small, particularly if their wages are low. High EMTRs also impact on working people receiving supplementary payments. Working for Families payments are reduced by 25 percent for each dollar earned over $42,700 of family income, and Accommodation Supplement reduces by a further 25 percent for each dollar earned above the relevant benefit cut-out point. This means some lower-income families, while significantly benefitting from this supplementary assistance, face EMTRs that are 25-50 percent above their marginal tax rate. For example, a family with two children and a single earner on $50,000 a year, receiving Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement, would retain around 20 percent of a modest pay rise. This compares to a similar family earning $150,000 who would retain around two-thirds of such an increase. Secondary tax – out of scope The current approach to secondary tax results in many beneficiaries who earn additional income being over-taxed on their employment income, as only their benefit income is able to be taxed on the lowest income tax threshold. We understand that improving/abolishing secondary tax is not included in the work of the TWG. Costs for lower-income households Some of the other taxes discussed in the Submissions Background Paper could have significant impacts on low-income people and the costs they face. MSD provides considerable financial support to low-income people, and any significant changes in cost will impact on both the wellbeing of these people and the demand for this support. Note that while this section is inside the ‘working-age’ part of the submission, many of the recommendations will be relevant for low-income superannuitants as well. Housing Affordability Housing costs, and particularly rents, are a key cost for many low-income people. Housing costs have grown considerably faster than incomes for those on lower incomes for a significant period of time, and this has resulted in a large group of low-income households with low residual (after housing costs) incomes. For households in the bottom income quintile, average housing costs have increased from 29% to 51% of their average income between 1988 and 2016 7 . These increased housing costs have put increased pressure on MSD’s provision of social housing, and on the costs of the Accommodation Supplement and hardship assistance such as Temporary Additional Support. MSD’s view is that changes to tax should support an increase in housing affordability, particularly for renters, and should seek to minimise any potentially negative impacts on housing supply. GST and a Sugar Tax Exemptions to GST are also raised in the Background Paper. While recognising the complexity that these exemptions create and their relatively high cost, MSD has seen significant pressure on hardship assistance, particularly grants for food, over the last few years, as shown in the figure on the next page. 7 Perry, Bryan “The material wellbeing of NZ households: Overview and Key Findings”, July 2017 Figure 1: Selected quarterly hardship assistance reasons, March 2013 to March 2018 Any exemptions that would support low-income people to better afford food may reduce pressure on hardship assistance, and improve the health and wellbeing of low-income people who are struggling to get sufficient (and high-quality) food on the table. However, there are potentially most cost-effective solutions within the welfare system to address pressure on hardship assistance. Solutions within the welfare system would be unlikely to be able to provide a targeted incentive to increase consumption of particular products. Conversely, taxes that may increase costs for low-income families, such as a tax on sugar, may flow through to higher demand for MSD support, depending on the extent to which higher costs encourage substitution for other (non-taxed) products. Part Two: Taxation and Improving Wellbeing in Retirement The Submissions Background Paper highlights changing demographics, particularly the ageing population and the fiscal pressures it will bring. The use of dependency ratios, however, over-emphasises the impact of population ageing for two reasons:  More people are remaining in paid work beyond pension age. At around 24 percent, New Zealand currently has one of the highest labour force participation rates in the OECD for people aged 65 years or over. By 2038, it is projected that people aged 65 or over will make up 10 percent of New Zealand’s total workforce. Older people also make an additional economic contribution through unpaid work, volunteering and caregiving.  Older people pay tax – the combination of tax on earnings from paid work, New Zealand Superannuation (NZS), consumption (GST) and investments is significant and growing. The Ministry of Social Development projects that by 2061 people aged 65 or over will pay $25.1 billion in tax, up from around $5.5 billion today (real 2016 dollars) 8 . In terms of future government expenditure associated with the ageing population it is important to remember that while expenditure on public pensions is increasing, New Zealand spends less on public pensions as a percentage of GDP than the average across OECD countries and this is expected to remain the case. It is also important to remember that NZS is taxable and taxed at a recipient’s marginal tax rate – as a result around 14.8 percent of expenditure on NZS is retained by the Crown as income tax. While health expenditure increases with the ageing population, Treasury estimates that from 2025, around 25 percent of the future increase in health spending will be directly attributable to the ageing population 9 . Compared to other age groups, New Zealanders aged 65 years or over are currently less likely to experience material hardship, have low incomes (after deducting housing costs) and live in houses that are hard to heat, damp or mouldy. This is attributable to universal NZS and a high level of mortgage-free home ownership. However, this may not continue for future generations of older people. We anticipate that more people will be reaching the age of 65 with debt and many will still be paying mortgages or living in rental accommodation. For many retirees, NZS will be insufficient to meet their weekly costs and these people will need to rely on accumulated savings or additional financial support from the Government (e.g. Accommodation Supplement, Temporary Additional Support or state housing). Therefore, encouraging savings and the tax rules applicable to household savings is of growing importance as we face an ageing population and the growing diversity amongst our older population. We need to lift the level of retirement savings, particularly by people who have a modest income over their working life and who are unlikely to own their home in retirement, and ensure that these retirees have a range of appropriate options for decumulating their savings. 8 http://www.superseniors.msd.govt.nz/documents/publications/business-of-ageing- factsheet-update-osc116.pdf 9 2016 Statement on the Long-term Fiscal Position, Treasury, Wellington, p 61. In the context of improving wellbeing in retirement, we suggest that the Tax Working Group consider:  Better aligning the tax rules that apply across different types of investments; and  The tax rules for annuities. When improving the alignment of the tax treatment of different investments, tax changes that would support wellbeing in retirement should be considered It is important that both retirement income policy and tax policy support long-term saving, particularly for those who during their working life have a modest income. In general, New Zealand’s current tax rules discourage saving. The biggest issue is that current tax rules encourage the diversion of savings into residential property, away from long-term savings vehicles that increase the level of national savings. While not advocating for ‘concessions’ for retirement savings, the tax treatment of locked-in superannuation funds, including KiwiSaver could be considered in the context of ‘levelling the playing field’ across different types of investments. These types of investments are particularly important for people who have a modest income and can therefore save only a modest amount over their working life. In addition, the issue regarding taxation of interest income from bank deposits is of particular relevance to the many retirees who hold their retirement savings in bank accounts. It makes sense for older people who have reached the decumulation stage to look for a conservative/low-risk investment vehicle for their retirement savings and as a result, holding savings in savings accounts with major banks is common practice. While low interest rates becoming embedded is positive for younger people taking on a mortgage, it is not good news for retirees who rely on low-risk investments to generate a portion of their retirement income. In the context of the different tax treatment of different investments, it has been suggested that gains that are solely due to inflation should not be taxed and in particular this should apply to household savings held in bank accounts. This is discussed on pages 39 to 41 of the Tax Working Group’s Submissions Background Paper – Future of Tax – the graph on page 40 highlighting the high effective marginal tax rate of bank account savings compared to other types of savings, particularly housing. Current tax policy in New Zealand significantly advantages investment in owner-occupied housing and rental property and has contributed to house price increases. While the Tax Working Group may consider changes to the tax rules for housing, we suggest that part of ‘levelling the playing field’ for savings should include considering the tax rules applicable to:  Locked-in retirement funds (e.g. KiwiSaver); and  Household savings in bank accounts. Benefits associated with reducing the tax liability of these investments could include reducing the relative attractiveness of investment in residential housing, increasing the level of national savings, and improving the wellbeing in retirement of people who are able to save only a modest amount over their working life. Consider options that would tax annuities in a similar manner to other substitutable investments, to remove a tax distortion that may be discouraging the development of the New Zealand annuities market and contributing to the growing ‘decumulation problem’ KiwiSaver balances are continuing to grow (with around $40 billion of funds currently invested) and so is the number of KiwiSavers eligible to withdraw them. Limited decumulation options mean that financial wellbeing in retirement is potentially less than it could be. For example, lack of options for decumulation could contribute to poor decision-making at age 65 (including using KiwiSaver funds for immediate consumption) which could undermine the purpose of the KiwiSaver scheme – to increase individuals’ well-being and financial independence, particularly in retirement. The Government has a vested interest in this, given the level of subsidies provided to KiwiSavers – over $8 billion since the scheme commenced in 2007 and forecast expenditure of over $900 million in the current financial year (including the housing deposit subsidy). Annuities are an obvious and potentially efficient way to convert a lump sum of savings into an income stream in retirement. Annuities are popular in overseas jurisdictions for this reason. While the relatively small size of the New Zealand market and uncertainty around longevity risk may be barriers to the provision of annuity products, the New Zealand tax system also treats annuities adversely relative to other forms of investment. The result is that there is only one annuity product on the market at present 10 . The tax issue regarding annuities has three aspects. First, the concessionary PIE investment tax treatment applicable to many other financial investments is not available to annuities. Second, the whole nominal interest component of annuity payments is taxed even though part of it represents inflation and not a real return. Third, other competing investment options can generate tax-free capital gains that make fully-taxed annuities unattractive. The 2009 Capital Market Development Taskforce 11 and the 2010/2011 Savings Working Group 12 , among others, have criticised the tax treatment of annuities as adverse and non-neutral and have advocated reform. We suggest that the Tax Working Group consider the tax rules applicable to annuities to support an environment where people reaching retirement have access to greater range of options for decumulating their savings. 10 Lifetime Income was launched in 2015 and claims to be managing around $100 million of retirement assets. https://www.lifetimeincome.co.nz/ 11 See ‘Capital Markets Matter’ (2009):http://www.med.govt.nz/business/economic- development/pdf-docs-library/cmd-capital-markets-matter-full-report.pdf p 107. 12 See ‘Saving New Zealand: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Barriers to Growth and Prosperity’ (2011):http://media.nzherald.co.nz/webcontent/document/pdf/20116/swg-report- jan11.pdf p 102.

National Office Level 4 Central House 26 Brandon Street PO Box 25-498 Wellington 6146 04 473 7623 office@ncwnz.org.nz www.ncwnz.org.nz 30 April 2018 S18.17 Submission to the Tax Working Group 0. Introduction 0.1. The National Council of Women of New Zealand, Te Kaunihera Wahine o Aotearoa (NCWNZ) is an umbrella group representing 245 organisations affiliated at either national level or to one of our 19 branches. In addition, about 350 people are individual members. Collectively our reach is over 350,000 with many of our membership organisations representing all genders. NCWNZ’s vision is a gender equal New Zealand and research shows we will be better off socially and economically if we are gender equal. Through research, discussion and action, NCWNZ in partnership with others, seeks to realise its vision of gender equality because it is a basic human right. This submission has been prepared by the NCWNZ Consumer Affairs and Economics Standing Committee based on the terms of reference for the Tax Working Group. It builds on resolutions and comments from members recorded in previous submissions. 0.2. NCWNZ has previously made a number of submissions relating to taxation and passed a resolution in 1983 asking the government to ensure social policy and legislation does not disadvantage married couples in terms of housing and taxation 1 . 0.3. NCWNZ is encouraged by the aims of improving the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system and is pleased to note the membership of the Working Group is to include individuals with expertise on Maori community and business environments. NCWNZ strongly urges the Working Group to reflect a gender balance, consult widely with a gender lens and perspective in mind, bearing in mind a future ageing population with increased percentages of women 2 . 1. Working Group Objectives 1.1. NCWNZ wishes to make the following comments in regards to the objectives for the tax system. 1 NCWNZ. 2012. 115 years of resolution. 1.10.4. http://www.ncwnz.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/115-years- Register-everything-2.pdf 2 Statistics NZ. 2013 Census Quick States about national highlights, pg 12. http://archive.stats.govt.nz/Census/2013- census/profile-and-summary-reports/quickstats-about-national-highlights/cultural-diversity.aspx 2 A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected. 1.2. Complexity of taxation, Inland Revenue and other documents has been noted as a concern from NCWNZ and the objective of ensuring simplicity is supported. 1.3. In previous submissions NCWNZ has stated that any move to simplify the taxation system is welcomed as long as fairness is preserved and enhanced 3 . NCWNZ has also called for clear guidelines that make it fairer and easier to use 4 . 1.4. A collected approach is encouraged by NCWNZ as was evidenced in submitting on the need for a clear and consistent threshold across policies for matters such as minimum balance confirmation where missed or overpayments occur 5 . A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy 1.5. NCWNZ has noted that domestic investment is healthy and continues to recommend that those investing domestically should be rewarded 6 . 1.6. Similarly investments and practices that follow sound ecological concepts should benefit over those that are likely to impact negatively on the environment 7 . 1.7. NCWNZ encourages thorough scenario-analysis be done on draft legislation to assess the long term environmental, social, and economic impacts 8 . In preparing budgets and taxation systems NZWNZ also urges Government to implement Gender Sensitive Budgeting (GSB) or Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRB). A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of GDP 1.8. Concerns on the over-reliance on volunteers and the community sector to carry out what ought to be government roles has been raised by NCWNZ previously 9 hence it is now argued that a sustainable revenue base for government operating expenditure needs to account for the costs of such community work. Much charity work and many volunteer roles tend to be carried out by women, and NCWNZ members are particularly committed in these areas. 3 NCWNZ. 2006.

NCWNZ has noted the vulnerability of over-reliance on PAYE as a means to support government revenue as was evidenced during the 2008 Global Market Crash 10 . In addition with the changing nature of work, increased mechanisation and vulnerable employment circumstances of many women, this income stream is very likely to change significantly in the future. 1.10. NCWNZ believes the Government needs to balance the money spent on items of public good versus the 'nice to have because it will bring in revenue'. Where a particular sector of the economy is to be the biggest beneficiary, then that sector should be the prime sponsor of the event A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability 1.11. NCWNZ has advocated that asset testing of in-kind distributions and gifts should be treated at market value at the date of the distribution as the timing of these is a matter of choice, whereas timing of transfer of assets to an executor on the death of a taxpayer is not under individual control 11 . NCWNZ continues to support this fairness of treatment. 1.12. NCWNZ notes the importance of access to housing for families and has passed a relevant resolution that requests couples not be disadvantaged by any legislation or taxation when it comes to housing 12 . As such NCWNZ has noted it does not support a capital gains tax on owner-occupied houses which could act as a deterrent to home ownership 13 . A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families 1.13. NCWNZ has consistently advocated that all legislation support the best interests of children, and requests existing legislation be updated where necessary to ensure this occurs 14 15 . 1.14. NCWNZ also supports a Universal Benefit for Children, to replace the Child Tax Credit scheme 16 17 . 1.15. NCWNZ has sought clarity on tax treatment for dependent children who are in full-time employment 18 as Inland Revenue guidelines are currently silent around this. 10 NCWNZ. 2010.

Whilst a system that allows for progressive tax and transfer provides for fairness and equity across families and individuals in differing circumstances, NCWNZ continues to advocate on the importance of certainty, timeliness and consistency of payments to enable appropriate budgeting 19 . 1.17. NCWNZ notes family arrangements and circumstances vary considerably and continues to advocate that unpaid child care should be rewarded through the taxation system. Much of this volunteer work is carried out by women and increasingly so by grandparents when parents cannot do so 20 . 1.18. In a similar manner NCWNZ advocates for taxation and rebate systems to reward and incentivise volunteer work, which is often carried out by women 21 . 1.19. NCWNZ acknowledges the right for couples to register their partnership with Inland Revenue so that income earned by either partner may be declared as partnership income 22 . An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner 1.20. In previous submissions regarding making tax easier NCWNZ has urged government to ensure greater simplicity and efficiency of the tax system 23 . 2. Reporting to Government 2.1. NCWNZ wishes to make the following comments regards the Working Group's reporting to Government. Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth 2.2. Whilst fairness is to be upheld, NCWNZ notes there are always special circumstances for some individuals and as such treatment of their assets, wealth, income and tax should be able to be considered appropriately if serious hardship has been identified. 2.3. NCWNZ would support thresholds be established where individuals earning below a set level be exempt from taxation. 18 NCWNZ. 2016, Submission to the Inland Review Department on ED0183 Child Support and Domestic Maintenance – Amendments to Assessments.

Specific incentives in productive economic sectors such as horticulture have been supported by NCWNZ 24 and these should be further considered to direct investments into sectors that benefit New Zealand longer term. 2.5. Concerns regarding returns to the wider community from taxation such as road and motor spirit tax revenues have been raised by NCWNZ, and it is recommended that a review of such systems be undertaken as a means to encourage consumers to consider alternative forms of transport 25 . Whether there are changes to the tax system which would support the integrity of the income tax system having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts and individuals 2.6. As NCWNZ has previously advocated, the integrity of the tax system 26 must preserve individual privacy and assurance that correct information is being stored, and urges the Working Group to include this in their terms of reference 2.7. NCWNZ has noted increased reliance on businesses and companies to administer additional tax transfers such as PAYE, Child Support, Student Loan repayments etc. This outsourcing is of particular concern as many such businesses are small and struggle to meet these requirements 27 . 2.8. To encourage integrity for wage earners when a business or company is sold, NCWNZ has supported changes allowing vendors to deduct wage-related provisions transferred to the purchase and continues to support this facility 28 . 2.9. To increase transparency NCWNZ continues to advocate that banks be required to communicate Withholding Tax liability and information, regardless of the amounts involved 29 . 24 NCWNZ. 2004.

The concept of a company or business taking into account the growing number of home-based and women-run businesses was highlighted by NCWNZ in 2003 30 . Therefore appropriate and specified compliance considerations that allow for lower and less predictable revenue should be considered. 2.11. Lack of clarity and poor documentation concerns around Trusts have been raised by NCWNZ 31 . Greater guidance around Trusts, reasonable thresholds for auditing purposes and other matters should be considered to enable these entities to carry out their purposes effectively. One such suggestion NCWNZ has previously proposed 32 relates to charitable trusts earning income from trading not to be disadvantaged by tax implications. 3. Working Group's Particular Considerations 3.1. NCWNZ wishes to comment on particular Working Group considerations as outlined below. The economic environment that will apply over the next 5-10 years, taking into account demographic change, and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices, and how these changes are driving different business models 3.2. NCWNZ has noted that technology has brought changes in how tax can be administered and encourages government to consider longer usage time frames when investing in new developments to ensure they remain fit for purpose in the long term 33 . 3.3. Furthermore NCWNZ reminds government to be mindful that not all consumers can access, use, or understand new IT systems. 3.4. As noted the nature of business entities (home-based, women-run, etc) and varying types of employment will increasingly need to be accounted for. As more people work part time, hold a number of roles, contract and engage in seasonal work, appropriate tax thresholds and administration needs to be established that enables flexible compliance arrangements and does not disadvantage those with more than one or changes of jobs and earnings. 30 NCWNZ. 2003.

NCWNZ has noted increasing complexity for businesses and employers regarding taxation administration such as Fringe Benefit Taxes (FBT). It has been noted that FBT should only apply where benefits are easily substituted for cash 34 . What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term 3.6. As noted above NCWNZ supports a review of the FBT system and encourages consideration of vehicle, car park and other transport related FBT criteria to be implemented in ways that encourage consumers to consider transport forms that have less environmental harm 35 . 4. Summary 4.1. NCWNZ is supportive of the establishment of the Tax Working Group and the proposed objectives as outlined in the Terms of Reference. NCWNZ looks forward to commenting on draft findings and recommendations which the Working Group will develop. 4.2. A number of recommendations and suggestions are outlined in this submission, particularly in regards to implementing Gender Sensitive Budgeting (GSB) or Gender Responsive Budgeting (GRP). 4.3. NCWNZ urges the Working Group to consult widely, especially with the community and women's groups to ensure a balanced, diverse and forward thinking tax system is established that will provide a sustainable revenue base for government, whilst enabling women, men, industry, and the community to participate in and benefit from their enterprises.

In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 Name of Organisation: National Public Health Alcohol Working Group Contact: Sally Liggins, SHORE, Massey University Email National Public Health Alcohol Working Group Submission to the Tax Working Group Our organisation The National Public Health Alcohol Working Group (N-PHAWG) was established in 2009 to support nationally consistent, effective public health action to reduce alcohol related harm. Our objective is to provide strategic leadership and workforce development input and support to the alcohol public health sector funded by the Ministry. Key roles of the NPHAWG are to: 1. Provide a forum to strengthen and promote strategic collaboration and national consistency 2. Identify workforce development needs and how these might best be met 3. Provide the Ministry of Health with recommendations for the future development and delivery of alcohol public health services 4. Encourage and support national alignment of evidence based alcohol public health services 5. Make timely submissions, recommendations or promote priority alcohol public health issues as appropriate NPHAWG is a group of alcohol regulatory officers and health promoters which is co-ordinated and supported through a Ministry of Health contract with SHORE, Massey University. Economic impact of alcohol The estimated cost of alcohol-related harm to New Zealand society was $5.3 billion in 2005/6. 1 Alcohol use is a major contributor to health costs, lost productivity for businesses and to financial costs to society with crime, police and court time and incarceration. All these problems help justify higher alcohol taxes. People who don’t drink alcohol (20% of New Zealanders) and low risk drinkers are unfairly burdened with these costs. We believe that the rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol- related harm to society. Health impacts New Zealanders experience extensive harm from alcohol consumption. A sometimes overlooked fact is this harm is experienced by those around the drinker, as well as the drinker themselves. Alcohol use is associated with innumerable diseases and harms including NCDs/ cancer, a range of mental and behavioural disorders, violence, injuries, abuse and neglect 2 . Many of these harms leave a lifelong impact. Hazardous drinking increases the risk of adverse health and social outcomes for the drinker as well as others. The 2011/12 New Zealand Health Survey estimated that 530,000 New Zealanders aged 15 years and over (15 percent of the adult population) are hazardous drinkers. 3 In 2016, there were 179,000 more hazardous drinkers in New Zealand than in 2012. 4 Nearly every group defined by age, ethnicity and sex has increased their drinking since 2011. Women have increased their alcohol consumption the most. There continues to be significant inequities in alcohol-related harm between Māori and non-Māori. Raising the tax on alcohol will provide an incentive to reduce consumption and reduce the growing number of hazardous drinkers 5 . \[1\] 2 The importance of excise tax increases The National Public Health Alcohol Working Group members are people who work with communities and agencies to monitor alcohol regulations and promote effective harm preventions strategies. Many of them see first-hand the impact of alcohol in communities and the inadequacy of the current alcohol excise tax rates to maximise the reduction of alcohol related harm. NPHAWG believes It is essential to prevent alcohol related harm and its social, physical and economic costs. Raising the excise tax on alcohol is a proven and effective way to reduce the affordability and consumption of alcohol, especially by heavier drinkers. Reducing alcohol consumption is an important and under- emphasised strategy that can help to reduce alcohol-related harm and other health and social costs. Furthermore, substantial increases in excise tax are fair and will reduce inequities as low income heavy drinkers are benefit the most when prices of alcohol are increased. Today, alcohol is more affordable than it has ever been. Increasing the tax on alcohol has been widely recommended by health experts and through the comprehensive Law Commission Report. 6 Currently the rates of excise tax are grossly inadequate in relation to the cost of alcohol related harm. NPHAWG believes that rates of alcohol excise tax should reflect the cost of alcohol-related harm to society. Every year, the Government receives money from alcohol excise tax ($1 billion in 2017) but this is well below the annual cost of alcohol-related harm to individuals and society, estimated in 2009 to be over five billion dollars. Tax alcohol content The New Zealand is missing out on millions of dollars of alcohol excise tax revenue each year because wine is taxed at a level equivalent to 10% alcohol, yet levels of alcohol in a bottle of wine are typically much higher than this (e.g. 12-14%). Taxpayers are losing out on this revenue which could be used to fund essential health and prevention services. There is an opportunity to align the level of tax to the alcohol content of beverages rather than the type of drink (e.g. for wine). This would be fairer as currently some beverages are taxed by volume and others by alcohol content. It is the alcohol that causes the harm, not the type of beverage. Minimum Unit Pricing We also recommend a Minimum Unit Pricing Policy to prevent the availability of very cheap alcohol. This policy is fair as it targets heavy drinkers and significantly reduces inequities in alcohol-related harms between income groups. This combined with excise tax rates can work very effectively to reduce the affordability of alcohol and hazardous and heavy drinking Role of the Health Promotion Agency The Health Promotion Agency (HPA) is funded from Vote Health including through a levy derived from alcohol excise tax 7 . The HPA has alcohol-specific functions to give advice and make recommendations to government, government agencies, industry, non-government bodies, communities, health professionals and others on the sale, supply, consumption, misuse and harm of alcohol as those matters relate to HPA’s general functions’. 3 Over the years since the establishment of the Health Promotion Agency, National Public Health Alcohol Working Group has noted the much diminished role of the Agency in giving evidence based policy advice to Government and the public health sector. This is in contrast to the advice regularly given by ALAC (prior to the establishment of the HPA), for example ALAC provided advice to the Law Commission in the reform of New Zealand’s alcohol laws. Given HPA is the only prevention organisation funded through Government excise tax, it surely has a responsibility to promote and support science based approaches to reducing alcohol related harm. Effective evidence based policies and environments are required to reduce harm, therefore it is important HPA’s work includes provision of alcohol policy advice to the Government, health and other sectors, for example on alcohol excise tax, etc. Recommendations 1. Increase alcohol excise rates by at least 50% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol by at least 10% 2. Annually adjust the excise rates to take into account changes in income (and to offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers) 3. Address rates of excise tax on wine – all wine should be taxed by alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14% 4. Tax all alcohol products (beer, wine, cider, spirits, etc.) by the exact amount of alcohol they contain 5. Increase allocation of alcohol excise tax to prevention and treatment services 6. Highlight to Government the effectiveness of establishing a minimum price for alcohol products, to work in tandem with excise tax to reduce alcohol related harm 7. Highlight the diminished role HPA has played in providing science based alcohol policy advice to Government and to the public health sector and beyond, and that this is inconsistent with their mandate to provide such advice.

The group comprises 5 CAYAD coordinators drawn from the programme’s 21 sites around Aotearoa, and two national coordinators from Massey University. Together we provide national leadership and development for the CAYAD programme. This submission provides comments and recommendations that broadly agree with the experience and views of the CAYAD workforce, however it does not necessarily reflect the views of every individual or organisation delivering the CAYAD programme. Introduction The CAYAD programme is positively focused on increasing community wellbeing and preventing harm from alcohol and other drugs, and operates in 21 communities around New Zealand, including several locations with predominantly Māori populations (www.cayad.org.nz). CAYAD is a public health programme, funded by the Ministry of Health. We welcome this opportunity to make a submission to the tax working group (TWG). As an evidence-based programme, CAYAD recognises that major determinants of alcohol and drug problems are socio-economic disadvantage and inequality, alongside excess availability of very cheap alcohol and illicit drug supply. Therefore CAYAD aims to enhance education and employment opportunities for young people, and to help communities develop policies and practices that reduce the availability and harmful use of substances. We recognise the pivotal role taxation plays in addressing the determinants of good physical and mental health, such as funding universal education, critical income and housing support, and social services. Excise taxes also have unrivalled impact on preventing population level harm from alcohol and tobacco. Therefore our submission focuses on both excise tax and a \[1\] stronger and more progressive tax system that will minimise socio-economic inequities. We strongly advocate using these taxes to create healthy whanau/family and community environments as the foundation to healthy and well youth/rangatahi. Our submission covers the following areas: 1. Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the consultation process 2. Improving the taxation system to reduce inequalities and child poverty 3. Support for specific taxes on alcohol and other substances 4. Summary of recommendations Te Tiriti o Waitangi Te Tiriti o Waitangi guarantees Māori protection over all their lands and treasures, and rights for equal treatment as citizens of Aotearoa. However, the reality of colonisation was so destructive (to what was an economically strong and healthy population) that the Māori population today continues to experience gross inequality in most social and health indicators, including alcohol-related harm. We believe the tax system plays a very important role funding economic development and redress to help move forward from the many injustices perpetuated against Māori by the government. CAYAD communities also use their local environment as a highly valued resource for providing recreation, learning and employment opportunities for young people, while strengthening identity and confidence as Māori. The land, rivers, waterways, climate and seas are inextricably linked to Māori wellbeing, physically and spiritually. These resources have all declined significantly in quality, and require greater protection in our growing global marketplace. We therefore support the proposed use of taxes to more strongly protect our natural resources and climate. We cannot speak for all our communities to make specific recommendations on these issues. However, all sites repeatedly tell us that strong and culturally appropriate consultation processes, conducted kanohi ki te kanohi (face to face) are critical to policy development. Instead, most policy development processes are conducted in Wellington, online or in writing, and are typically too distant or inaccessible from people’s everyday lives in rural communities. This disenfranchises Māori from conversations central to their future wellbeing. Therefore in accordance with the guarantees of Te Tiriti for equal citizenship and protection, and the principle of partnership, we recommend: 1. That the TWG conducts consultation hui or a roadshow visiting main cities and regional towns of New Zealand, 2. That the consultation considers: a) using tax to encourage greater protection of the environment and land b) the impact of the present tax base and its distribution on inequality c) providing economic redress for Māori, including how the tax system might better support Māori economic ventures d) How tax could be used to achieve more equitable employment rates for Māori Tax system and inequalities In recent years, inequalities in health and many social indicators have increased. In particular, homelessness, poverty and child poverty have grown. As noted in the background paper, rising housing costs have contributed significantly to widening income inequality. This poverty and disadvantage places children at greater risk of adverse outcomes in nearly every area of health and wellbeing. This is in fundamental conflict with New Zealand’s social values – as seen in the broad political support for reducing child poverty in the recent election debates. It also contradicts our responsibilities under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In this context we strongly recommend: 3. Placing social wellbeing as the guiding outcome for the tax system and social policy in Aotearoa New Zealand. 4. Achieving a higher overall tax take in order to invest more heavily in actions to reduce inequalities, including essential income supports, social and health services, education, work readiness programmes and economic development. 5. To reduce inequalities, maintain and enhance the progressive tax system, while investigating other tax sources that do not burden the least well off. 6. Consider reducing GST (which contributes to inequalities) while offsetting the lost revenue using other sources of tax. 7. Taking steps to tax the housing market efficiently and to constrain ballooning housing costs, such as a capital gains tax. We also suggest assessing ways to use tax incentives to improve the quality of rental housing. Taxing addictive substances We view excise taxes as an essential tool for increasing wellbeing by reducing harm from addictive legal substances, most notably alcohol and tobacco, and in the future potentially cannabis and synthetic psychoactive substances. Some 50,000 people receive treatment for substance use each year, yet the Mental Health Commission of 2011 noted a further 50,000 who wanted treatment did not receive it. In the case of alcohol, hazardous drinking in New Zealand has been increasing since 2011. Further, it was recently found that nearly 40% of all alcohol sold in New Zealand is consumed in heavier drinking sessions (occasions of 8 or more standard drinks for men, and 6 or more standard drinks for women). 1 We believe specific taxes to discourage problematic use of drugs are strongly warranted for several reasons: • The addictive nature and intoxicating effects of drugs take choice away from a significant proportion of their consumers • Alcohol and other drug use imposes significant harms on others 1 Casswell, S., Callinan, S., Chaiyasong, S., Pham V, C., Kazantseva, E., Bayandorj, T., Huckle, T., Parker, K., Railton, R., Wall, M. (2016). How the alcohol industry relies on harmful use of alcohol and works to protect its profits. Drug and Alcohol Review, 35(6), 661-664. doi: 10.1111/dar.12460 • The cost of managing preventable alcohol related harm reaches billions of dollars, paid for by drinkers and non-drinkers alike. This is both a direct cost and diverts funding away from education and other public good investments. Alcohol and tobacco taxes are known to provide particularly effective protection for young people and heavier users; the many benefits of raising prices via tax include: • Demonstrated reductions in consumption and related harm at a population level. • High efficiency– it targets those most at risk of harm (and of harming others) while generating revenue. • Stronger effects on young people as they are more price sensitive and are frequent consumers of alcohol and other drugs. Young people have the greatest potential health and productivity gains from delaying or reducing alcohol and other drug use due to their stage of physical and mental development, and stage of education. • Stronger effects on frequent and heavier users, who are at greater risk of harming themselves and others. • Excise revenues can offset some of the high cost of harm to the individual and others they directly impact, particularly the high social costs of managing and responding to such harm. Therefore we recommend: 8. The TWG support the consensus among public health experts that excise taxes should be maintained and promoted as a crucial tool to prevent and minimise harm from alcohol, tobacco and other substances of dependence. Using excise taxes to reduce harm from alcohol Increasing excise tax (and consequently the price for alcohol) is the most effective known measure for reducing hazardous drinking; a meta-analysis by Wagenaar et al. concludes there is “statistically overwhelming evidence of effects of alcohol prices on drinking... We know of no other preventive intervention to reduce drinking that has the numbers of studies and consistency of effects seen in the literature on alcohol taxes and prices.” 2 Hypothecating tax on alcohol for prevention and treatment services helps to justify the tax to the public, and has considerable support; Alcohol Healthwatch, in a recent UMR poll, found almost two-thirds of people polled supported increasing the price of alcohol to fund mental health and addiction services. However, instead of using this popular and important tool to good effect, New Zealand collects nowhere near enough alcohol excise tax to offset the costs of alcohol related harm. Further, 2 Wagenaar, A., Salois, M. & Komro, K. (2008) Effects of beverage alcohol price and tax levels on drinking: a meta-analysis of 1003 estimates from 112 studies. Addiction. 104, 179–190. since 1988, alcohol has become more affordable in New Zealand relative to income 3,4 , and the real price of wine has in fact dropped: “The real price of wine is 30 percent lower today than it was in 1988. This is reflected in supermarket prices where bottles of wine can now be purchased for $5.99.” – Nicki Jackson, Alcohol Healthwatch: http://www.ahw.org.nz/News-Events/Media- Releases/Media-Release-Heaviest-drinking-quarter-since-new-liquor-laws-came-into-effect Thus New Zealand’s alcohol tax policy has allowed alcohol prices to drop, which will most likely have added to alcohol-related harm in New Zealand over recent decades. To reverse this trend, we strongly urge uptake of the following recommendations, similar to more detailed work the TWG will receive from the SHORE & Whariki Research Centre; the University of Otago public health department and Alcohol Healthwatch: 9. Raise alcohol excise rates by 100% across all alcohol products to raise the price of alcohol. 10. Ensure the present regular adjustments to excise rates also offset any changes in income (not only the consumer price), and offset any strategies used by retailers to not pass on increased rates to consumers. 11. Calculate rates of excise tax on alcohol content, not volume of beverage. If a producer is unable to determine the exact alcohol content in their product, then the level of excise tax should be raised from being based on 10% alcohol strength to 14%. 12. The existing level of tax hypothecation should be increased. We suggest additional funding is established to support: a. Increasing funding for mental health services generally, and for on-site mental health services in all high schools b. Development of evidence based prevention programmes that are delivered on a national basis c. Community based prevention efforts that will support mental health through better connected communities and meaningful local enterprise d. Long term funding for community action programmes, including ongoing evaluation support and professional development for practitioners. Year to year funding cycles make continuity of staff and programmes more difficult to maintain. 3 Wall, M., & Casswell, S. (2013).

The group comprises 5 CAYAD coordinators drawn from the programme’s 21 sites around Aotearoa, and two national coordinators from Massey University. Together we provide national leadership and development for the CAYAD programme. This submission provides comments and recommendations that broadly agree with the experience and views of the CAYAD workforce, however it does not necessarily reflect the views of every individual or organisation delivering the CAYAD programme. Introduction The CAYAD programme is positively focused on increasing community wellbeing and preventing harm from alcohol and other drugs, and operates in 21 communities around New Zealand, including several locations with predominantly Māori populations (www.cayad.org.nz). CAYAD is a public health programme, funded by the Ministry of Health. We welcome this opportunity to make a submission to the tax working group (TWG). As an evidence-based programme, CAYAD recognises that major determinants of alcohol and drug problems are socio-economic disadvantage and inequality, alongside excess availability of very cheap alcohol and illicit drug supply. Therefore CAYAD aims to enhance education and employment opportunities for young people, and to help communities develop policies and practices that reduce the availability and harmful use of substances. We recognise the pivotal role taxation plays in addressing the determinants of good physical and mental health, such as funding universal education, critical income and housing support, and social services. Excise taxes also have unrivalled impact on preventing population level harm from alcohol and tobacco.

Many thousands of New Zealanders, who follow our work, share our concerns about the prospect of New Zealand’s tax burden being increased through a raft of new forms of taxation. The NZCPR strongly believes that the future of tax reform should be towards lower and flatter taxes for New Zealand and submit that a maximum level of 20 percent for personal, trust, and company tax should be the goal. This lower tax goal should be accompanied by a reduction in government spending towards a target of 25 percent of GDP, which has been identified as the optimum level of government spending for a high performing economy. As the American Economist and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Thomas Sowell, said, “The real goal should be reduced government spending, rather than balanced budgets achieved by ever rising tax rates to cover ever rising spending.” If new taxes are recommended by the Working Group, we submit that there should be a commensurate reduction in existing forms and levels of taxation. Further, since under the present tax system, inflation continually pushes taxpayers into higher income tax brackets, we also submit that annual income tax threshold adjustments indexed to inflation should be introduced. In particular, the NZCPR opposes all new taxes including environmental taxes, lifestyle taxes, and land taxes. We oppose the introduction of all new GST exemptions, and the NZCPR strongly opposes all tax concessions based on ancestry. Error! Unknown document property name. Error!

Company Tax: The NZCPR submit’s that New Zealand’s company tax rate should be reduced to 20 percent to incentivise jobs and growth by ensuring an internationally competitive rate. While New Zealand’s company tax rate was, at one time, one of the lowest in the OECD, at 28 percent it is now one of the highest. That makes it extremely difficult for Kiwi exporters to compete in global markets – especially once the cost of transport and the other disadvantages of being a small isolated country are factored in. All around the world, company tax rates are falling, as countries compete against each other for business in the global marketplace. In Europe, corporate tax rates have declined from an average of 40 percent in 1980 to 18 percent in 2017, with Switzerland the lowest on 8.5 percent, followed by Hungary on 9 percent. Some countries introduced significant cuts to company tax years ago to position themselves as a magnet for international business. Ireland reduced the tax on business profits to 12.5 percent in 2003. In 2015, it further reduced the corporate tax rate to 6.5 percent for business activities arising from research and development in Ireland. Their objective is to attract high value jobs to the country. In 2010, Singapore followed Ireland’s lead and introduced an exemption, reducing their corporate tax rate of 17 percent to 8.5 percent for business income up to S$300,000. In fact, since the global financial crisis, the downward trend for company tax has been accelerating around the world as governments have lowered their rates to chase GDP growth. In the UK, corporate tax will be reduced from 19 percent to 17 percent by 2020. Sweden is cutting corporate tax from 22 percent to 20 percent. Corporate taxes have recently been reduced in Japan, Spain, Israel, Norway, and Italy. At the present time, only five countries – France, Belgium, Mexico, Australia and Greece – now have corporate tax rates that are higher than New Zealand’s, and almost all of these are in the process of reducing their rates. In Belgium their 34 percent tax rate will be lowered to 25 percent by 2020, with a 20 percent rate already in place for Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 3 smaller companies. In Greece, the 29 percent corporate tax rate will be lowered to 26 percent by 2020. In France, President Emmanuel Macron has promised to reduce corporate income tax from 33.3 percent down to 25 percent over the next five years, and in Australia, company tax is set to reduce from 30 percent to 25 percent over a ten year period. Contrary to what the critics say, over the long term, reducing company tax does not result in a loss of revenue, since the incentive effects of lower taxes broaden the tax base, boosting economic growth and job creation. In Canada, when the federal company tax rate was reduced from a high of 38 percent in the mid-1980s to 15 percent in 2012, tax revenues increased to greater levels than when the rate was more than double. It was the same story in Britain – in the 1980s when corporate taxes were 52 percent, revenue was equivalent to 2 percent of GDP, while in 2015, when the rate was lowered to 19 percent, tax revenue was higher at 2.4 percent of GDP. To remain internationally competitive, it is crucial for an export based economy like New Zealand, to have lower business taxes – especially now that the US has slashed their corporate tax from 35 percent to 20 percent. New Zealand should follow suit. The NZCPR submits that the Tax Working Group should recommend a company tax reduction to 20 percent – along with the top rate of personal tax, and the trust tax rate – to boost economic growth and business expansion. We further submit that any move to introduce a progressive company tax system should be abandoned, since a two-tier system would create the unintended consequence of incentivising small businesses to stay small to retain a lower tax rates instead of seeking to expand to create further jobs and growth. Without a doubt the best way to encourage small businesses to grow into large ones is to keep taxes low for all sizes of business. Further, since many small business owners pay tax at the personal rate, aligning income tax to business tax and cutting both the 20 percent, would provide the best incentive to growth. Taxation of Charities: Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 4 We submit that the Tax Working Group should recommend the removal of the tax ‘loophole’ that is being used by some of the country’s biggest commercial operators, including iwi business corporations, to avoid paying tax. This would mean changing the law so that any profits generated by commercial charities, that was being used for their charitable purpose would be tax free, while all other income would be taxed at their normal business rate. The charity loophole involves ‘for-profit’ commercial businesses that register as charities, yet use only a fraction of their ‘tax free’ income on their ‘charitable purpose’. These commercial charities include Sanitarium, and iwi corporations – including the Ngai Tahu Charitable Group, which operates the bus company, Go Bus, the tourist attraction Shotover Jet, and more than 30 other commercial businesses. Charities play an important role in society. But they are also very big business. Figures from 2017 show there are over 27,000 registered charities in New Zealand, managing an asset base of over $40 billion. Their annual income is estimated to be over $15 billion, including $6 billion of government grants, and almost $3 billion of public donations. Tax rebates on those donations cost the Government around $260 million a year, while the tax revenue that the Government is missing out on is estimated to be in the region of $1.5 billion. Local councils miss out too, as many charities are exempt from rates, despite using local services. At the present time there is no cap on charitable giving – people and companies can claim rebates and deductions for charitable donations up to the level of their annual net income. When it comes to charities that operate businesses, the Income Tax Act states, “Income derived directly or indirectly from a business carried on by, or for the benefit of a trust, society, or institution is exempt income if it carries out its charitable purposes in New Zealand, is registered as a charitable entity, and no person with some control over the business is able to direct or divert, to their own benefit or advantage, an amount derived from the business.” Essentially this means that for-profit businesses that register as charities are tax free, Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 5 with little oversight as to whether their profits are used for charitable purposes. Over the years, successive governments have recommended tightening up these laws. Back in 1966, the Holyoake Government carried out a review and recommended that “Profits from trading derived directly or indirectly by charitable organisations and dividends derived from any company substantially owned by such organisations are assessable for income tax at normal rates.” In 1987, then Minister of Finance Roger Douglas proposed a number of law changes to prevent tax avoidance by charities: “No charity receiving donations would have to pay tax on any aspect of that operation, but a charity that was involved in commercial business to raise money would be treated like any other business. It would pay tax on its profits, but its legitimate expenses would be deductible”. The Minister explained that “the reason for including income from charitable activities – but not from donations – in the tax base was to limit the scope for charities to be used for tax avoidance.” In 2001, then Minister of Finance Dr Michael Cullen recommended taxing the trading operations of charities: “Make trading operations owned by charities subject to income tax in the same way as other businesses, but with an unlimited deduction for distributions made for the relevant charitable purposes”. None of these recommendations were implemented. As a result of the 2005 reforms, the Charities Act established the Charities Commission, as an autonomous Crown entity to take over the regulation of the sector from the IRD, which, until that time, had administered charitable income tax exemptions. These reforms also allowed Maori tribal groups to register as charities for the first time. Until then, any group wanting to register as a charity not only had to have a legitimate charitable purpose – involving the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community – but they also had to meet a public benefit test, to ensure charitable benefits flow into the wider community and not to private individuals and their relatives. Since Maori tribal organisations are based on the blood ties of relatives, they failed the public benefit test and could not gain charitable status. However, section 5 (2) of the Charities Act introduced an exemption from the blood tie disqualification for those Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 6 involved in the administration and management of a marae. This law change paved the way for some of the country’s biggest and richest business corporations, to register as charities and avoid paying tax. In essence, this means that many of the contributors to the $40 billion combined wealth of the Maori economy, such as Ngai Tahu, are essentially tax free. In other words they have organised their affairs to avoid paying their fair share of tax. During National’s first term in Government, the Charities Commission was disestablished and the functions were transferred to the Department of Internal Affairs. While there have been a number of other law changes over the years to tighten up the reporting standards for charities, none have addressed the fact that for-profit commercial charities are avoiding paying tax. While New Zealand has failed to resolve this issue, other countries, including the UK, have confronted it. There, charities are classified as ‘trading’ if they sell goods or services to customers. But if that trading is part of the charity’s primary purpose, such as an independent school charging students tuition fees – or if it helps the charity’s primary purpose, such as a museum running a cafe for visitors – no tax needs to be paid on the profits. However, if the trading is unrelated to the primary purpose, its profits are taxed. What’s worse is that according to their website, the IRD no longer even keeps a ‘watching brief’ on charities: “If your charitable organisation is assessed as being fully exempt from income tax, you don’t need to file an income tax return unless we ask for one.” That means there is no adequate monitoring as to whether the billions of dollars of business income generated by commercial charities is genuinely being used for their specified charitable purpose. We submit that the most sensible way forward would be for the Tax Working Group to recommend enacting Dr Cullen’s 2001 suggestion, to tax for-profit businesses owned by charities in the same way that private firms are taxed, while allowing unlimited deductions on distributions made to their relevant charities. This policy change would provide significant tax revenue for the Government by removing the unfair tax advantage that charity-owned businesses have over private firms, and, Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 7 through taxing retained earnings, there would be an increased incentive for businesses to make a greater investment into their charitable purpose. In essence, under this proposed law change, any profits generated by commercial charities that were used for their charitable purpose would be tax free, while all other income would be taxed at their normal business rate. Capital Gains Tax: Finally, we strongly submit that the Tax Working Group should reject all forms of capital gains tax. A partial capital gains tax that excludes the family home would raise very little revenue, but would add huge complications and compliance costs to the tax system. This is one of the main reasons that none of the five government tax reviews over the years have recommended a partial capital gains tax with a multitude of exemptions. The 1967 review of the tax system by the Ross Committee examined the feasibility of a capital gains tax but rejected it on the basis of the low revenue yield, the huge complexities, and the disincentive effect that such a tax would have on risk taking and growth investment. The 1982 Task Force on Tax Reform conducted by the McCaw Committee also examined a capital gains tax, finally recommending against such a tax on the basis that it would not produce significant revenue but would create substantial complexity within the tax system. The 1989 review by the Valabh Committee recommended that a comprehensive capital gains tax with no exemptions should be introduced – in conjunction with a reduction in income and other taxes. In other words, the Committee saw the introduction of a comprehensive capital gains tax that included private housing and all other assets, as a legitimate mechanism to broaden New Zealand’s tax base and lower tax rates across the board. The McLeod Committee’s 2001 Tax Review opposed the introduction of a capital gains tax on the basis that it would not make the tax system fairer or more efficient, and that it would not raise substantial revenue but would instead increase the complexity and costs of the tax system. The 2010 Tax Working Group on the other hand came out in favour of a capital gains Error! Unknown document property name. Error! Unknown document property name.Error! Unknown document property name. 8 tax, but only if it was comprehensive, and accompanied by a general reduction in income tax and company tax across the board. They also strongly recommended that company tax, Trust tax and the top income tax rates be aligned to reduce distortions within the tax system. In other words, none of the expert working groups have recommended a partial capital gains tax with exemptions for the family home, Maori land, gambling winnings and so on - of the sort that the Labour Party has promoted in the past. Thank you for providing the opportunity for the NZCPR to present our recommendations for New Zealand’s taxation system. We do hope the Tax Working Group will take them on board.

Submission on the future of tax April 2018 1 23 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz SUBMISSION ON THE FUTURE OF TAX Submitter: New Zealand Farm Forestry Association incorporated \[NZFFA\] Address: New Zealand Farm Forestry Association 9th Floor, 93 The Terrace, Wellington PO Box 10 349, The Terrace Wellington 6143 Submitted by: Neil Cullen President About this organization. The NZFFA represents people who own small-scale (generally less than 1000 hectares of) private forests and/or are interested in the many values of trees. Currently there are about 2000 members in the NZFFA but de facto the NZFFA can be said to represent the views of about 13,000 others who own such private forests. Contact: To discuss this submission you are welcome to contact: Neil Cullen NZFFA President Summary The NZ Farm Forestry Association, the NZ Forest Owners’ Association, and the NZ Institute of Forestry have argued for an amendment to the Income Tax Act to remove an anomaly that discourages the sale of immature forests. Specifically the ‘cost of standing timber’ provision of the Act treats the sale of standing trees as immediate income to the seller; while the buyer must wait perhaps years to claim his deduction against the forest’s eventual revenue. By penalising the buyer, IRD pushes investment away from forests into more liquid areas with tax- free capital gains like shares, farmland and housing. These areas do nothing for \[1\] Submission on the future of tax April 2018 2 the environment. The Act effectively discourages investment into the very sectors where it is needed. 1. The ‘cost of standing timber’ provision is defended by the IRD with three arguments: (i) that it would face a fiscal risk if it allowed forest buyers a matching tax deduction at the time of sale, (ii) that forestry enjoys “tax advantages” anyway, and (iii) that the Act would be abused if it was changed. On close scrutiny none of these arguments has merit. 2. In fact in order to allow for normal commercial behaviour, the IRD has approved five separate exemptions to the provision and is currently considering a sixth. The Association has suggested, and IRD has agreed, that where a group of forest owners decide to aggregate their forests for economies of scale but individually retain liability for tax, there is no effective change of ownership and the ‘cost of standing timber’ should not apply. Staff changes at IRD make it hard to see if progress is being made on this. 3. The Association asks that you consider changing the Act to remove the ‘cost of standing timber’ provision. If that is not possible we ask that you expedite the exemption for forest aggregation to encourage economies of scale. Background 4. Forest owners are subject to a peculiar tax disadvantage. While the seller of standing trees must declare the revenue as income when it occurs, the buyer must park the expense in a ‘cost of timber’ account until he ‘disposes of the timber’ through sale or harvest. He cannot deduct the expense against other income at the time of purchase (Sections CB 25 and EA 2 of the Act respectively). When immature standing trees are sold several years before harvest, inflation and the time cost of money combine to erode the benefit of the buyer’s tax deduction. 5. The erosion of value creates a different expectation between the buyer and the seller. Calculations suggest that depending on the age of the forest, the buyer’s offer might be 20-30% lower than the seller’s expected price meaning there is little likelihood of agreement. While immature forests do sell, the market is thin, illiquid and not necessarily rational. Investors are hesitant to buy into small forests, preferring markets that are more liquid with the chance of tax-free capital gains like shares, farmland and housing. These to do nothing for the environment. The tax distortion effectively discourages investment in the very sector it is needed. The ‘cost of standing timber’ 6. The ‘cost of standing timber’ was introduced with forestry tax reform in the mid 1980s. When other taxes were revised in 1991 the provision was kept because Submission on the future of tax April 2018 3 the Crown was still in the process of selling State Forests. Allowing immediate deductibility would have had a severe fiscal impact, as $3 billion in sales income would have been cut by a third. The provision deferred that impact, as the Government was able to spread the buyers’ $1 billion tax benefit forward for up to 30 years until all the trees had been harvested, age class by age class. 7. The sale of State Forests ceased 20 years ago and the circumstances no longer apply. However IRD still argues that it would face a fiscal risk if it allowed forest buyers a matching tax deduction at the time of sale. This has become an ideological assertion without evidence, as a request under the Official Information Act shows that IRD gathers no information on the sale of standing trees, cannot quantify either the income or the deferred tax deduction, and has no plans to. 8. IRD’s second argument is that forestry enjoys tax advantages over other industries, being allowed to deduct the cost of planting and growing trees well in advance of harvest. Under a strict Revenue Account Property approach, such costs must be deferred until the ‘property’ is sold. This argument is specious because of the timeframe. An RAP approach was never designed for – and should not be applied to – assets that must be held for 30 years before generating income. We believe RAP has been ideologically imposed in a totally unsuited area, and for IRD to assert it has “advantaged” forestry by mitigating the worst effects of its actions is both self-serving and grossly misleading. 9. The RAP argument also ignores reality. Section DO 2 of the Income Tax Act makes it quite clear that famers are allowed full tax deductibility of costs for trees planted for shelter, erosion control or water quality. When trees are planted for these purposes and farms are sold, the seller does not pay tax on their sale. Rather, he reaps a tax-free capital gain from his ‘improvements to the land’. 10. Because tax deducted for these trees is not recovered, it effectively becomes an agricultural subsidy. There are more than twice as many farmers as forest owners in New Zealand and they are used to getting this favoured treatment. Forest trees also provide shelter, erosion control and water quality but when they are sold, their sale is immediately taxable. The so-called ‘tax advantages’ do not rest with forestry. 11. IRD’s third and final argument against removing the ‘cost of standing timber’ is that it would open the door to abuse. Not being tax experts we are unable to see how that might occur. However it is logical to ask IRD what form this abuse might take, and whether they could design controls that were fine tuned to preventing it rather than applying across the board. 12. Of the several alternatives to the ‘cost of standing timber’ the one favoured by the Association is to tax the asset rather than the ownership, i.e. focus on the trees. The party planting and managing the trees would claim the cost against other Submission on the future of tax April 2018 4 income as farmers do; while the party harvesting the trees would be assessed for tax. Changes of ownership during the life of the trees would be irrelevant. If the trees were never harvested they would be recognised for their environmental benefits as improvements to the land, as they are on farms. Buyers and sellers could negotiate forest transfers in the knowledge of their tax obligations without triggering tax payments. 13. This approach would align with Section DO 2, improve liquidity in the sale and purchase of immature forests, and not disturb tax cash flows from harvesting. 14. In passing we note Section DO 3 of the Act limits the deductibility of costs for farmers planting trees other than for shelter, erosion control or water quality. While they get a non-refundable tax benefit for one, they get a minimal tax deduction for the other even if it’s in the same paddock. A smart farmer would carefully describe his trees in terms of Section DO 2 rather than DO 3 to capture the tax break. The Act appears to encourage this misbehaviour, which is unfair on other taxpayers and contrary to the established criteria for tax reviews. The aggregation problem 15. In New Zealand there are about 14,500 different entities who own forests over 5 ha. Around 90% of these have forests of less than 100 ha. Because forestry is not really the owners’ focus or main source of income, their blocks are scattered, of mixed quality, and often planted on poor country. Despite this, their trees will be worth around $15 billion if they can be harvested. 16. At present small scale owners have a choice; either employ a consultant to manage the harvest which may cost over 5% of gross income, or take on the environmental and safety requirements themselves, engage the contractors and cope with the stress of learning about and actually doing all this. At the end of the harvest the nett returns will depend on factors outside their control such as distance from ports or mills, cost of internal roading, and log prices. 17. Poor returns from small forests have been widely experienced and documented. Private investment in new forest establishment has almost ceased. Equally importantly, unless grower returns improve a proportion of small forests may not be harvested, and New Zealand would not realize the full $15 billion of value and potential cash flow that is now growing on marginal land. Small owners have a problem: • To improve returns forest owners have to reduce costs, because log prices are outside their control. • The only way they can reduce costs is through economies of scale. Submission on the future of tax April 2018 5 • Scale can be obtained by aggregating small forests to operate them as a single estate. • The Income Tax Act discourages this. 18. MPI, IRD and forest owners have recognised this argument and discussed it. Consequently IRD is considering an exemption for small forest owners who want to aggregate their forests for economies of scale. Its preference is for owners to use a ‘look-through enterprise,’ i.e. a legal entity into which the forests could be transferred, but in which the tax liabilities and benefits would fall on the individual owners just as before. This seems entirely logical, relatively simple and with no fiscal risk. However there have been staff changes at IRD and they seem to be making no progress. Conclusion 19. We welcome the Government’s goal to encourage the planting of new forests. Much of that planting will necessarily be on farmland. Before investing, landowners will be looking at the experience of today’s small forest growers. Right now the ‘cost of standing timber’ provisions make it harder for small growers to sell or amalgamate their forests. Removing or easing the provisions will help remove tax distortion, add liquidity to the market and give the right signal to these landowners. If submissions are being heard we ask for the opportunity for a representative of the NZ Farm Forestry Association to present this in person. Sincerely, N Cullen President NZFFA

The New Zealand Institute of Valuers (NZIV) is a professional body providing training and education through professional standards and a code of ethics for Registered Valuers. The function of a Registered Valuer is to provide independent advice to the property sector and property financing sectors with a level of trust, integrity and transparency for confidence in the New Zealand property markets and for the protection of the public. The Valuation profession controlling document is the “Valuers Act 1948”. What does the future of tax look like. The NZIV Council does not have a position on “tax systems”. NZIV has an interest in respect of the technical elements of “property valuation” of which the Tax Working Group is investigating how changes in property values should be treated within the taxation system which could include: : capital gains tax : land tax : estate duty : stamp duty : wealth tax Many are likely to focus on the positive market trends in recent times, however the process needs to be tested under a number of situations and asset types. Appendix 2 of the Tax Working Group paper refers to the design issues with a capital gains tax.  Any implementation of a “value” assessment from a start date to end date (typically a sale/annually pending policy decision) that calculates any gain or loss needs to be consistent and robust under the various market situations, to list a few:  Market with growth  Market with negative value trend  Redevelopment of properties, removal of improvements  Destruction caused by natural events, earthquake, fire, damage, with and without insurance, relocation of buildings, redeployment of value/funds (Christchurch property situation, red zone issues)  Leaky homes, offsetting repair costs  Short term disturbance that may impact value over a short period  Public Works Act, partial take, full acquisition  Resource consents and planning effect on value  Leasehold – terminating, perpetual leases  Maori Land  Relationship property and its potential partial transfers and equalisation of other assets  Tangible and non-tangible values associated with property  Going Concern properties, goodwill and business values  Air rights, water rights effect on value (Agri and water allocations)  Boundary realignments, transfer of smaller portions of land between neighbours  Addition or removal of easements/interest to a property/title may cause a value change  Company ownership of land with ownership via share transfer  Sale and purchase agreements with deferred settlement, or nominee or contemporaneous settlements  Local body land assets, reserves  Sale or purchase by Crown, Regional Council, Councils, Iwi, Assets of “not for profit” entities The market will react and use the most tax effective form of property ownership. International Valuation Standard and New Zealand Valuation Standards provide a proven structure for the assessment of value of all properties types. The Institute of Valuers is ideally placed to provide further comment on the application of valuation principles. Valuation Date It is proposed that there will be a set date to start the calculation of any potential capital gain tax. These assessments could be completed from the defined date forward. These assessments are more likely to be completed at the time of sale or transfer and if calculated at the date of sale this would allow a longer period to process the initial assessments. The defined date will become the most analysed and reported on. The average home owner buys and sells over every 7-17 years pending the statistical source, these are owner-occupied transactions and are to be excluded, leaving valuation resources available for the Taxation calculations of properties that are captured by the Tax policy. Reference https://www.nzfunds.co.nz/Assets/Documents/investment-bulletin/issue-8-how- property-stacks-up.pdf The Councils engage in a rating valuation function often referred to as the “Rating Value”, “Capital Value”, or historically the “GV”. Under the Rating Act these are typically assessed every 3 years. These assessments follow a defined process under the Rating Act and include the assumption of all property being Freehold (special values can be completed), the property is “occupied” and allowance for any vacancies of commercial property are not included. Over time mass appraisal techniques may not reflect market value in many cases. There will be a strong focus on residential property and as our housing stock ages, older homes will be refurbished with new kitchens, bathrooms and décor which can be completed without a building consent. We consider there will be a difference of value prior to refurbishment and the completed value and in many cases may be substantial. The tax payer is highly likely to insist that if the sale price or market value is used as the value at the time of sale then the same market value process should be used to set the initial value and be reflected in any taxation calculations. Our observation is that many property owners may have not informed Council, at revaluation time of any improvements as a lower Council assessment implies a lower rating liability. Some owners have had these values increased due to potential future sale or personal agenda. The majority of properties within a mass appraisal process have not been inspected or the physical changes that do not require building consents and new features would be taken into consideration. The concept of “flipping”, upgrading our older housing stock has gained attraction through the number of TV shows currently being screened. The use of such mass data to set a benchmark or the initial value and then to be tested against “the market” at time of sale may not be seen as “Fair” for calculation of a taxation liability. Therefore, a fair and transparent process of the assessment value needs to be adopted. Capital Gain Market movement is the primary driver of Capital gain or losses from market changes. The property market does have a cycle linked to local and international events which will bring change. Examples include:  The early 1970’s property boom  The 1980’s share market and property boom  The 2003-2007 property boom  The 2012-2017 GFC recovery. During these periods, property transactions included units to be built and transactions future settlement dates. Transaction dates and settlement dates can be months or years apart which will need to be considered. Conversely, the period outside of these dates the markets were going through the change or correction stages of the property cycle. Transparency of Market Activity. Sale and purchase agreements can include “or nominee” and any gain could be achieved by transfer of the contract or settlements contemporaneously. The current system of recording only transaction on the property Title (Computer Registers) is unlikely to capture all market activity. A fair and transparent market is required. The recording of transactions and the detail of the inclusion of finance, swaps, trades, chattels content, plant and machinery, goodwill, stock, Dairy company shares, and other part of any consideration (price) will need to be accounted for. We are concerned that increase in values may also come from additions, alterations, development and subdivision that have associated costs and items such as owners’ personal efforts to improve the property, these may not have easily identifiable costs. This may be as substantial as adding an additional dwelling or the owner painting their investment property. Commercial and rural properties will also have a large number of considerations that make up a property’s value. These properties also under go alterations and additions, lease changes, have liabilities under earthquake rules, costs asbestos of compliance and any operational consents will impact upon values on commercial, rural and other specialised properties. We are confident that final proposal will provide clarity around the treatment of these costs associated with the calculation of “Value” and the gain/loss. A dispute resolution process will need to be addressed. Land Tax Our observation is that most Councils have moved from Land Value based rating system to Capital Value based as a fairer system. Under a land value-based system highly developed properties on land that is undeveloped would appear to be seen as having an advantage. Land Value based systems tend to be easier to administer but are not seen as a true reflection of a natural balance between properties and ownership benefits. Conclusion The New Zealand Institute of Valuers has a strong interest in the process of property valuation. The International Valuation Standards and precedent from well-established New Zealand valuation standards should be referenced of the treatment of property valuation within any taxation process. The Institute of Valuers would welcome the opportunity to work with the Tax Working Group for a fair and transparent process of property valuation within the taxation system. The New Zealand Institute of Valuers will be available to answer any questions from the Tax Working Group and /or appear during any hearing process.

Ngai Tuahuriri: Submission on Taxation Introduction My name is Rawiri Te Maire Tau. I am the Upoko of the Ngai Tuahuriri hapu which was the first Runanga established in New Zealand. Our hapu is located on the Tuahiwi Marae on Kaiapoi Maori Reserve 873. The Ngai Tuahuriri Runanga has led the Ngai Tahu Claim since 1848 and my father H.R. Tau was the claimant to the Ngai Tahu Claim filed to the Waitangi Tribunal in 1986. I am also the Director of the Ngai Tahu Research Centre, University of Canterbury. Our focus in this Centre is on tribal economics and environmental law. I hold a PhD is History from the University of Canterbury. This submission is on behalf of the Ngai Tuahuriri Runanga. Kaupapa This submission is divided into three sections. (i) Historical Outline of our Runanga Position: 19 th Century Imperial Economic Policy The first section of this submission will be a historical outline of the principles for taxation which we believe stem from the Treaty of Waitangi, early Crown legislation and the promises made by the Crown that were assumed into legislation. To be clear we believe that, • The Crown’s right to revenue by way of taxation was assumed by way of article (i) of the Treaty of Waitangi where the Crown holds the right to govern (kawanatanga) and sovereignty. • Article ii of the Treaty also allowed Maori the right to raise taxation upon their lands and villages and this is evident in early legislation such as the 1858 Native District Regulations Act and the original policies of early Governors, Browne and Grey. (ii) Post War II Economic Policy: Part II explains how the Crown passed legislation that effectively reduced Maori land to ‘Dead Capital’. The legislation that created this was also the reason for today’s present housing crisis, the urban migration of the post war generation and the Dead Capital crises that we have within Maori communities which has been driven by the Maori Land Court and the western ideology that underpins it. (iii) Proposals to Convert Dead Maori Capital to an Economic Asset through Tax Policy This section will provide possible solutions to resolve the problems of Maori land as ‘Dead Capital’. These solutions have arisen after extensive consultation undertaken by Ngai Tahu with the First Nations peoples of British Colombia and our relationship with Chief C.T. (Manny) Jules, Chief Commissioner, First Nations Tax Commission. SECTION I: HISTORICAL OUTLINE OF OUR RUNANGA, TAXATION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT The Crown assumed ownership of the lands within Canterbury in 1848 following the Canterbury Deed of Purchase that year. Following the signing of the Deed in June, the Crown surveyed the Kaiapoi Maori Reservation as Maori Reserve 873 – and set it aside in August of the following month. The transfer of Ngai Tahu ownership to Crown Title was therefore complete. However, the actual process of assigning title to individual members did not occur until 1862 under a special Act of Parliament called the 1862 Crown Grants Act (no. 2). This Act was unique to the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu as Governor Grey had wanted the land to fall under the 1858 Native Districts Regulations Act which essentially confirmed Kaiapoi land owners as the first Runanga in New Zealand. The 1862 Crown Grants Act (No. 2) confirmed the agreements reached between the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu and the Crown Agents who negotiated the sub-division of the land and the individual property rights that had been established by the Runanga when it first met in 1859. These negotiations occurred within the gambit of the 1858 Native District Regulations Act and the promises made within the 1848 Canterbury Deed of Purchase. The 1858 Native District Regulations Act was important because it gave the Runanga the right to regulate their lands with the same powers as the Provincial Council. Regulation V declared that regulations from the Runanga: . . . shall control and supersede, or preclude, the operation of all Laws or Ordinances in anywise repugnant thereto, or inconsistent therewith, which, before or after the date thereof, may have been or may be made or ordained by any Legislative Body within the Colony, other than the General Assembly, or by any Superintendent and Provincial Council. 1 The extent of these regulations are impressive enough, but perhaps the most important was regulation II (7) which allowed the Runanga, the right: For ascertaining, prescribing, and providing for the observance and enforcement of the rights, duties, and liabilities, amongst themselves, of Tribes, Communities, or Individuals of the Native Race, in relation to the use, occupation, and receipt of the Profits of Lands and Hereditaments. 2 1 Native Districts Regulations Act 1858, section V. 2 Native Districts Regulations Act 1858, regulation II (7). In short, this clause gave the Runanga the capacity to regulate, manage and administer the lands within its district through taxation, duties and other activities on their lands. The idea of Maori regulating their financial activity through land taxation or rates needs to be understood within the context of the time. In short, this clause gave the Runanga the capacity to regulate, manage and administer the lands within its District through taxation, duties and other activities on their lands. Governor Gore-Browne estimated that in 1856 Maori brought in £51,000 in customs revenue as opposed to the settler economy which contributed £36,000.3 On Grey’s return in 1861, the overall valuation in land for the Canterbury Purchase had also raised the value of Maori land. Grey showed that the 3 Alan Ward, “A Report on the Historial Evidence: The Ngai Tahu Claim Wai 27”, Commissioned by the Waitangi Tribunal (1989): T1, 404. Hazel Petrie also refers this calculation, but also outlined the Colonial Treasurer, C. W. Richmond’s view that this ratio was over-estimated. Nonetheless, the Native Secretary, Donald Mclean, supported Gore-Browne’s estimate. (Hazel Petrie “Colonisation and the Involution of the Maori Economy”, A paper for Session 24, XIII World Congress of Economic History, Buenos Aires (2002): 17. Canterbury Reserves were valued at £67,000 while the Kaiapoi Reserve itself was valued at £45,500.4 When George Grey returned as Governor in 1860 he made an interesting observation on the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu: The Natives are not really a poor people. They can only be said to be so whilst their lands are of no value. If, under the proposed regulations, law and order are introduced throughout the whole country, Europeans flock into the Native districts, and a considerable value is given to the lands of the Natives, they will soon be a people quite able to bear local taxation, and willing to impose it, to give a still increased value to their property. 5 Today we may look upon Grey’s statement that Maori were not ‘really poor’ with a degree of horror. Nevertheless, he had a point. Grey was quite aware of how much Maori contributed to the colony’s economy. In 1860, poverty for Maori was 4 Alexander Mackay, “Supplementary report from W. Buller, Esq., to the Native Secretary Christchurch 17th, October 1861”, in A Compendium of Official Documents Relative to Native Affairs in the South Island, Volume Two (Nelson: Luckie and Collins, 1872), 113. 5 “Minute by His Excellency, Governor, Sir George Grey”, AJHR (1862), E-2, p18. not upon the immediate horizon and in fact nationally, trade was strongly weighted towards Maori. the Natives, they will soon be a people quite able to bear local taxation, and willing to impose it, to give a still increased value to their property. 6 Grey had imagined that if the runanga or tribal councils were empowered as civil institutions to regulate and enforce the law, tax and determine property rights, Maori could become active participants in the New Zealand economy. Grey challenges our more usual explanation for Maori poverty that followed which blamed the lack of land allocated to Maori as the reason for the poverty that followed among Maori after the 1860s. This reasoning fails to take into account that no matter how much land Maori would have retained, it would eventually 6 “Minute by His Excellency, Governor, Sir George Grey”, AJHR (1862), E-2, p18. have counted for little if they did not have an equal measure of local governance over their land. 7 However, because of the New Zealand civil wars that followed, the Runanga system fell apart and as we know, the economic spiral of Maori communities commenced. The principal factor in the cause of Maori economic downturn was that the Native Land Court was given jurisdiction over Maori land. This really was a great shame because the Ngai Tahu economy was in a boom cycle. However, the Native Land Court ignored the 1862 Crown Grants Act (No. 2) which allowed individual Maori ownership of land as long as it remained in tribal title. The Maori Land Court essentially imposed communal title which was not a Ngai Tahu custom. Communal title has never worked as an economic asset and Elinor Ostrom has argued, it has only ever led to a tragedy. There is also very good evidence that shows private property rights was in fact a norm in tribal societies and that communal title is a relatively new phenomenon. 7 Stuart Banner, "Conquest by Contract: Wealth Transfer and Land Market Structure in Colonial New Zealand," Law & Society Review, Vol. 34, No. 1 (2000), pp.47-96. The economic spiral that Maori suffered from the late 1860s onwards was caused by: • The removal of Runanga as an institutional authority on our Reserve • The removal of individual tribal title which was replaced by a Crown communal title governed by the Native Land Court • No legislative authority upon Maori Reserved lands – to regulate land use and occupation • An absence of fiscal authority amongst our Runanga – is no capacity to levy taxes or duties. Christchurch members of Parliament had always been worried with the consequences of the Native Land Court. In 1862 James Fitzgerald, the Member of Parliament for Ellesmere, made the following observation when speaking to support the Runanga over the proposed Native Land Court: He hoped that the Government would have extended their runanga system. The Native Lands might then bear the same relation to the runangas as the waste lands of the Crown did to the Provincial Government – that was, if they wanted to sell or lease the land, it would be for the runanga of the district to make regulations for it. The district runanga had been told that it should have the disposal of the lands; what, then, was the use of bringing down a Bill saying that this Court should have the power? 8 Fitzgerald was essentially saying that a Native land Court was not needed in the South Island because it had been agreed by way of the 1858 Native District Regulations Act that Runanga would manage and regulate their lands with the same powers of the Provincial Government. Nonetheless, the wider political issue of land ownership was raging in the North Island and Ngai Tahu was to pay for this matter. Part I: Section Summary This section of the submission suggests the Ngai Tahu economy performed strongly during the 1840s-early 1860s because: • Ngai Tahu property was held in a tribal title that recognized individual ownership. • Ngai Tahu were able to regulate economic activity on their lands through their political institution, the Runanga. • The Runanga held the same powers as the Provincial Government. 8 James Edward Fitzgerald, “Native Lands Bill”, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (1862): 628. • The Runanga could levy a tax T HE CONCLUSIONS WE DRAW FROM THIS ARE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE BY TAX DEPENDS UPON : • TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWERS TO REGULATE TRIBAL LANDS AND RESOURCES . • TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH THE POWERS TO HOLD FISCAL AUTHORITY WHICH INCLUDES RAISING REVENUE THROUGH TAXATION . • TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH THE POWERS TO HOLD LAND WITHIN AN IWI TITLE (RATHER THAN CROWN TITLE) TO DEFINE LAND TENURE, HOLDINGS AND POSSESSION AND OWNERSHIP . Section II: Post War Economic Policy: Between the 1870s-1945 Ngai Tahu lived in relative poverty upon their reserves. The economic plight our people suffered has been well documents in Royal Commissions throughout the 1870s and 1880s. The Waitangi Tribunal was to report on this in its 1991 Ngai Tahu Report. However, in our recent history the poverty that affects Maori today has stemmed from three Acts of Parliament that were passed between the 1950s-60s. Those Acts were: • 1953 Town and Country Planning Act • 1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act • 1967 Ratings Act These three Acts had a devastating impact upon Maori land and Maori communities. The Acts directly relate to the legacy of Maori land which essentially exists as ‘Dead Capital’. 9 These Acts are also the reason for the Maori housing crises and the urban poverty that we now have. 9 . The idea of ‘Dead Capital’ is explained by the Peruviuan economist Hernando de Soto in his publication, ‘The Mystery of Capital’ (2003). The three Acts essentially acted in a coordinated way wherein the 1953 Town and Country Planning Act brought all Maori Land under local government. Local Councils right throughout New Zealand such as the Rangiora County Council in our hapu region, immediately rezoned all Maori land as rural allowing only one house per ten acres. The problem is that most Maori land allocations were 14 acres, which essentially meant no other houses could be built. This meant that tribal members raised on marae and in Maori Pa and Reserves which were set aside in the 19 th century for Maori to reside, were made landless overnight. The reason for this was that the new zoning regulations did not recognize Maori Pah as residential areas which the original survey maps and Deeds meant them to be. Overnight Maori land had been re-designated and also devalued. Maori parents could no longer sub-divide their land for family members to build upon. In the Tuahiwi Pah that I was raised, out of the 12 brothers and sisters in my fathers family, none were allowed to build on their parents land. In a series of unethical arrangements between the Rangiora County Council Clerk and others, my father was given the option of purchasing neighboring family land that had been sold by another family that were prohibited from building. My mother, also from the same village, and from a family of 10 was among the sole two members allowed to build in Tuahiwi. The point here is that of the 22 uncles and aunts only 3 were able to build – despite the fact that they were all able to build as their parents actually owned enough land to allocate to them on quarter acre blocks that all other Kiwi’s celebrated. I make this point because once the land was rezoned, it lost its economic value. The outcome was that in my childhood, Tuahiwi was mostly a village of elders whose children were forced to rent houses in Christchurch or the smaller townships of Kaiapoi and Rangiora. Those who remained in the traditional Pah now had to deal with small land holdings ranging from 1 -14 acres but of no real value because housing was not permitted and the land itself was too small for farming purposes. Many elders were forced to sell their lands in the late 1980-90s because they needed to live with their families in urbans settings in their old age. The final indignity was that the sole persons able to purchase land were rural farmers – who were the established power structure that occupied the local County Councils. The simple truth was that post war local governments in New Zealand rezoned Maori land to ensure its devaluation so as to see its transfer to rural Pakeha New Zealand. There was only one group in New Zealand who would purchase uneconomic rural land during the 1960s-70s and that group sat on the local County Councils. By the 1970s, Maori land was of no value because the zoning regulations had ensured no economic activity could occur upon it other than small rural farming. The land had no residential value and to make the humiliation complete, land with unpaid rates passed to the local council to be sold under the 1967 Ratings Act . There are a number of lessons to be leant from this situation. What is important though is that it is simply unreasonable to apply a property tax to Maori land owners whose title exists in Maori Freehold Title and Crown Title. What tends to be forgotten is that the 1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act ensured that Maori land with less than 3 owners had their title passed into Crown title so that it could be easily on-sold to local farmers. However, the same zoning restrictions applied because Maori land was allocated in Reserves or reservations such as Tuahiwi whose legal designation is the Kaiapoi Maori Reserve 873. This submission asks that any Maori land (Freehold Maori or General Crown Title) that sits within Maori reservations or Maori reserved lands needs to be exempted from any capital gains tax. Part II: Section Summary This section of the submission makes the point that since the WWII Maori land was regulated by local councils and as a consequence rezoned to a situation where: • The state of Maori Land as Dead Capital was created by legislation post WWII – specifically the 1953 Town and Country Planning Act, the 1967 Ratings Act and the 1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act. • Maori land lost its value because of local government regulations which prohibited residential occupation and any commercial activity other than rural farming. T HE CONCLUSIONS WE DRAW FROM THIS ARE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE TO TAX DEPENDS UPON : • THE CAPACITY OF TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS POSSESSING LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWERS TO ZONE THEIR LAND IN A MANNER THAT STIMULATES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND REVENUE . • T HAT MAORI LAND NEEDS TO BE EXEMPT FROM ANY NOTIONS OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND, • AN ECONOMIC PACKAGE IS REQUIRED TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT UPON TRIBAL LANDS WHICH IN TURN GENERATES REVENUE FOR TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS TO ALLOW DEVELOP BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE ON MAORI LANDS AND RESERVES . Section III: Proposals to Convert Dead Maori Capital to an Economic Asset through Tax Policy Despite the problems with Maori land and Maori Reserves and Pah, the settlements that are occurring allows some discussion to occur on how to resolve the basic problem of Maori land as an economic asset. The Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act occurred in 1998. Today the Ngai Tahu Holdings Shareholder equity is $1.27b with a $49.6m distribution to tribal members. The challenge is to align the economic strength of our corporations with the reserved lands we have. Tribal corporation essentially generates wealth which flows into the regional and national economy. Nonetheless, as we shall show, that wealth does not flow into a Ngai Tahu economy. In a recent study conducted by the Ngai Tahu Research Centre, we undertook an examination of the multiplying role of the Ngai Tahu dollar within the local Christchurch economy. This report is attached as an appendix and remains in draft form until it is published. Our study was focused on the Wigram Residential Development. Our study was concerned with where the Ngai Tahu investment goes when it leaks out. In this report we compare the Wigram Residential development with a First Nation example on the Muskeg Lake Cree Lake Urban Reserve. We found that while the Wigram Skies development generated a significant economic income to Ng i ā Tahu it did not gain as much economic benefit as the Cree approach both because it only focused on one element of the development value chain and because of the institutional restrictions only generated a limited duration income. Our research shows that Ng i ā Tahu obtained roughly 20% of the total economic benefits from the Wigram Skies residential development but did not see the same ‘wraparound’ income that the MLCN development has been able to realize. The diagram below shows where the Ngai Tahu dollar went once it leaked out to the wider conomy. Most of the expenditure is on Building Materials ($288m), manufactures and Retailers with Construction firms taking $169m in Labour costs. However it is the issue of the land tax or the ratings base that gains our interest. As the illustration below indicates $186m was taken by Local and Central Government Rates and Taxes between 2010-2016. The Christchurch City Council took in $22m in rates. While this is a relatively small rates base this report does not look at the other commercial properties and ventures within Christchurch whether it be our commercial, industrial or residential properties and the revenue generated therein. What is important to note is that none of these rates or land taxes are directed to our reserved lands. Our reserved lands where our people live still lack basic infrastructure such as water and sanitation. How is it that we contribute so much in local taxation yet receive so little in return. Our people are now prohibited from building on our land because we do not have water /sewerage in our reserves. Yet these lands are the primary places where tribal members actually own land. This brings us back to the basic points of what build an economy. This submission argues that an economy depends on a ‘Virtuous Cycle’ wherein businesses and communities flourish. Much of this exists in New Zealand except for Maori land. Economic development occurs when investors and tribal members are secure in property rights so that they can build and create businesses. Businesses need to be located where communities exist and where basic infrastructure is present whether it be roads, water, sewerage, lights and community facilities. The diagram below is a virtuous cycle. Maori lands and communities have none of these facilities experts for perhaps a marae, church and urupa. Housing no longer exists, which leads to a lack of investment and revenue and a state of infra-structural neglect. However, tribal corporations do in fact generate revenue for local government. This submission suggests that local rates gained by local government from tribal corporations needs to be directed to Maori reserved land and communities so that basic infra-structure is provided. Rates should be directed to local Runanga and tribal institutions to manage. There are basic infra-structural needs that Maori communities are aware of. Water is a need for many communities, followed by sewerage and roading. However to receive a rating base, Runanga need to be empowered to hold local authority powers over their lands wherein they area accountable to tribal land- owners. Local Runanga need to have regulatory power and jurisdiction over their lands. What we know from section II of this report is that when the local county councils gained regulatory powers, the land quickly transferred to local rural farmers who controlled the county council. We also note that the Crown gained $133m in GST. It is not unreasonable to ask the question of whether Maori Reserved lands and the businesses we might potentially generate should operate with a tax inventive and also receive the GST? Finally, Maori land title needs to be amended wherein a new tribal title is created wherein tribal members can opt for a new customary title that exists outside of the Maori Land Court which is regulated by Runanga or tribal institutions. Part III: Section Summary THIS SECTION OF THE SUBMISSION MAKES THE POINT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM MAORI RESERVED LAND IF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM NEW TRIBAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE RE -DIRECTED TO TRIBAL PROJECTS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT: • LOCAL RUNANGA SHOULD RECEIVE THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM LAND TAXES THAT TRIBAL CORPORATIONS CREATE FROM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR AT THE MINIMUM LOCAL COUNCILS AND RUNANGA SHOULD NEGOTIATE ON WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FROM THE TAX REVENUE GENERATED FROM LAND . • LOCAL RUNANGA SHOULD REPLACE THE MAORI LAND COURT AS THE CONTROLLING AUTHORITY FOR MAORI LAND OWNERS • CAPITAL GAINS TAX PROVIDES NO INCENTIVE FOR MAORI HOUSING AND LAND- OWNERS BECAUSE THEIR LAND HAS BEEN ‘DEAD CAPITAL’ DUE TO PAST LEGISLATION . • TAX INCENTIVES NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO ENCOURAGE MAORI HOUSING ON MAORI RESERVED LANDS • T AX INCENTIVES NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO STIMULATE MAORI BUSINESSES ON MAORI LANDS.

Following the signing of the Deed in June, the Crown surveyed the Kaiapoi Maori Reservation as Maori Reserve 873 – and set it aside in August of the following month. The transfer of Ngai Tahu ownership to Crown Title was therefore complete. However, the actual process of assigning title to individual members did not occur until 1862 under a special Act of Parliament called the 1862 Crown Grants Act (no. 2). This Act was unique to the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu as Governor Grey had wanted the land to fall under the 1858 Native Districts Regulations Act which essentially confirmed Kaiapoi land owners as the first Runanga in New Zealand. The 1862 Crown Grants Act (No. 2) confirmed the agreements reached between the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu and the Crown Agents who negotiated the sub-division of the land and the individual property rights that had been established by the Runanga when it first met in 1859. These negotiations occurred within the gambit of the 1858 Native District Regulations Act and the promises made within the 1848 Canterbury Deed of Purchase. The 1858 Native District Regulations Act was important because it gave the Runanga the right to regulate their lands with the same powers as the Provincial Council. Regulation V declared that regulations from the Runanga: . . . shall control and supersede, or preclude, the operation of all Laws or Ordinances in anywise repugnant thereto, or inconsistent therewith, which, before or after the date thereof, may have been or may be made or ordained by any Legislative Body within the Colony, other than the General Assembly, or by any Superintendent and Provincial Council. 1 The extent of these regulations are impressive enough, but perhaps the most important was regulation II (7) which allowed the Runanga, the right: For ascertaining, prescribing, and providing for the observance and enforcement of the rights, duties, and liabilities, amongst themselves, of Tribes, Communities, or Individuals of the Native Race, in relation to the use, occupation, and receipt of the Profits of Lands and Hereditaments. 2 1 Native Districts Regulations Act 1858, section V. 2 Native Districts Regulations Act 1858, regulation II (7). In short, this clause gave the Runanga the capacity to regulate, manage and administer the lands within its district through taxation, duties and other activities on their lands. The idea of Maori regulating their financial activity through land taxation or rates needs to be understood within the context of the time. In short, this clause gave the Runanga the capacity to regulate, manage and administer the lands within its District through taxation, duties and other activities on their lands. Governor Gore-Browne estimated that in 1856 Maori brought in £51,000 in customs revenue as opposed to the settler economy which contributed £36,000.3 On Grey’s return in 1861, the overall valuation in land for the Canterbury Purchase had also raised the value of Maori land. Grey showed that the 3 Alan Ward, “A Report on the Historial Evidence: The Ngai Tahu Claim Wai 27”, Commissioned by the Waitangi Tribunal (1989): T1, 404. Hazel Petrie also refers this calculation, but also outlined the Colonial Treasurer, C. W. Richmond’s view that this ratio was over-estimated. Nonetheless, the Native Secretary, Donald Mclean, supported Gore-Browne’s estimate. (Hazel Petrie “Colonisation and the Involution of the Maori Economy”, A paper for Session 24, XIII World Congress of Economic History, Buenos Aires (2002): 17. Canterbury Reserves were valued at £67,000 while the Kaiapoi Reserve itself was valued at £45,500.4 When George Grey returned as Governor in 1860 he made an interesting observation on the Kaiapoi Ngai Tahu: The Natives are not really a poor people. They can only be said to be so whilst their lands are of no value. If, under the proposed regulations, law and order are introduced throughout the whole country, Europeans flock into the Native districts, and a considerable value is given to the lands of the Natives, they will soon be a people quite able to bear local taxation, and willing to impose it, to give a still increased value to their property. 5 Today we may look upon Grey’s statement that Maori were not ‘really poor’ with a degree of horror. Nevertheless, he had a point. Grey was quite aware of how much Maori contributed to the colony’s economy. In 1860, poverty for Maori was 4 Alexander Mackay, “Supplementary report from W. Buller, Esq., to the Native Secretary Christchurch 17th, October 1861”, in A Compendium of Official Documents Relative to Native Affairs in the South Island, Volume Two (Nelson: Luckie and Collins, 1872), 113. 5 “Minute by His Excellency, Governor, Sir George Grey”, AJHR (1862), E-2, p18. not upon the immediate horizon and in fact nationally, trade was strongly weighted towards Maori. the Natives, they will soon be a people quite able to bear local taxation, and willing to impose it, to give a still increased value to their property. 6 Grey had imagined that if the runanga or tribal councils were empowered as civil institutions to regulate and enforce the law, tax and determine property rights, Maori could become active participants in the New Zealand economy. Grey challenges our more usual explanation for Maori poverty that followed which blamed the lack of land allocated to Maori as the reason for the poverty that followed among Maori after the 1860s. This reasoning fails to take into account that no matter how much land Maori would have retained, it would eventually 6 “Minute by His Excellency, Governor, Sir George Grey”, AJHR (1862), E-2, p18. have counted for little if they did not have an equal measure of local governance over their land. 7 However, because of the New Zealand civil wars that followed, the Runanga system fell apart and as we know, the economic spiral of Maori communities commenced. The principal factor in the cause of Maori economic downturn was that the Native Land Court was given jurisdiction over Maori land. This really was a great shame because the Ngai Tahu economy was in a boom cycle. However, the Native Land Court ignored the 1862 Crown Grants Act (No. 2) which allowed individual Maori ownership of land as long as it remained in tribal title. The Maori Land Court essentially imposed communal title which was not a Ngai Tahu custom. Communal title has never worked as an economic asset and Elinor Ostrom has argued, it has only ever led to a tragedy. There is also very good evidence that shows private property rights was in fact a norm in tribal societies and that communal title is a relatively new phenomenon. 7 Stuart Banner, "Conquest by Contract: Wealth Transfer and Land Market Structure in Colonial New Zealand," Law & Society Review, Vol. 34, No. 1 (2000), pp.47-96. The economic spiral that Maori suffered from the late 1860s onwards was caused by:  The removal of Runanga as an institutional authority on our Reserve  The removal of individual tribal title which was replaced by a Crown communal title governed by the Native Land Court  No legislative authority upon Maori Reserved lands – to regulate land use and occupation  An absence of fiscal authority amongst our Runanga – is no capacity to levy taxes or duties. Christchurch members of Parliament had always been worried with the consequences of the Native Land Court. In 1862 James Fitzgerald, the Member of Parliament for Ellesmere, made the following observation when speaking to support the Runanga over the proposed Native Land Court: He hoped that the Government would have extended their runanga system. The Native Lands might then bear the same relation to the runangas as the waste lands of the Crown did to the Provincial Government – that was, if they wanted to sell or lease the land, it would be for the runanga of the district to make regulations for it. The district runanga had been told that it should have the disposal of the lands; what, then, was the use of bringing down a Bill saying that this Court should have the power? 8 Fitzgerald was essentially saying that a Native land Court was not needed in the South Island because it had been agreed by way of the 1858 Native District Regulations Act that Runanga would manage and regulate their lands with the same powers of the Provincial Government. Nonetheless, the wider political issue of land ownership was raging in the North Island and Ngai Tahu was to pay for this matter. Part I: Section Summary This section of the submission suggests the Ngai Tahu economy performed strongly during the 1840s-early 1860s because:  Ngai Tahu property was held in a tribal title that recognized individual ownership.  Ngai Tahu were able to regulate economic activity on their lands through their political institution, the Runanga.  The Runanga held the same powers as the Provincial Government. 8 James Edward Fitzgerald, “Native Lands Bill”, New Zealand Parliamentary Debates (1862): 628.  The Runanga could levy a tax THE CONCLUSIONS WE DRAW FROM THIS ARE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE BY TAX DEPENDS UPON:  TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWERS TO REGULATE TRIBAL LANDS AND RESOURCES.  TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH THE POWERS TO HOLD FISCAL AUTHORITY WHICH INCLUDES RAISING REVENUE THROUGH TAXATION.  TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS VESTED WITH THE POWERS TO HOLD LAND WITHIN AN IWI TITLE (RATHER THAN CROWN TITLE) TO DEFINE LAND TENURE, HOLDINGS AND POSSESSION AND OWNERSHIP. Section II: Post War Economic Policy: Between the 1870s-1945 Ngai Tahu lived in relative poverty upon their reserves. The economic plight our people suffered has been well documents in Royal Commissions throughout the 1870s and 1880s. The Waitangi Tribunal was to report on this in its 1991 Ngai Tahu Report. However, in our recent history the poverty that affects Maori today has stemmed from three Acts of Parliament that were passed between the 1950s-60s. Those Acts were:  1953 Town and Country Planning Act  1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act  1967 Ratings Act These three Acts had a devastating impact upon Maori land and Maori communities. The Acts directly relate to the legacy of Maori land which essentially exists as ‘Dead Capital’. 9 These Acts are also the reason for the Maori housing crises and the urban poverty that we now have. 9 . The idea of ‘Dead Capital’ is explained by the Peruviuan economist Hernando de Soto in his publication, ‘The Mystery of Capital’ (2003). The three Acts essentially acted in a coordinated way wherein the 1953 Town and Country Planning Act brought all Maori Land under local government. Local Councils right throughout New Zealand such as the Rangiora County Council in our hapu region, immediately rezoned all Maori land as rural allowing only one house per ten acres. The problem is that most Maori land allocations were 14 acres, which essentially meant no other houses could be built. This meant that tribal members raised on marae and in Maori Pa and Reserves which were set aside in the 19 th century for Maori to reside, were made landless overnight. The reason for this was that the new zoning regulations did not recognize Maori Pah as residential areas which the original survey maps and Deeds meant them to be. Overnight Maori land had been re-designated and also devalued. Maori parents could no longer sub-divide their land for family members to build upon. In the Tuahiwi Pah that I was raised, out of the 12 brothers and sisters in my fathers family, none were allowed to build on their parents land. In a series of unethical arrangements between the Rangiora County Council Clerk and others, my father was given the option of purchasing neighboring family land that had been sold by another family that were prohibited from building. My mother, also from the same village, and from a family of 10 was among the sole two members allowed to build in Tuahiwi. The point here is that of the 22 uncles and aunts only 3 were able to build – despite the fact that they were all able to build as their parents actually owned enough land to allocate to them on quarter acre blocks that all other Kiwi’s celebrated. I make this point because once the land was rezoned, it lost its economic value. The outcome was that in my childhood, Tuahiwi was mostly a village of elders whose children were forced to rent houses in Christchurch or the smaller townships of Kaiapoi and Rangiora. Those who remained in the traditional Pah now had to deal with small land holdings ranging from 1 -14 acres but of no real value because housing was not permitted and the land itself was too small for farming purposes. Many elders were forced to sell their lands in the late 1980-90s because they needed to live with their families in urbans settings in their old age. The final indignity was that the sole persons able to purchase land were rural farmers – who were the established power structure that occupied the local County Councils. The simple truth was that post war local governments in New Zealand rezoned Maori land to ensure its devaluation so as to see its transfer to rural Pakeha New Zealand. There was only one group in New Zealand who would purchase uneconomic rural land during the 1960s-70s and that group sat on the local County Councils. By the 1970s, Maori land was of no value because the zoning regulations had ensured no economic activity could occur upon it other than small rural farming. The land had no residential value and to make the humiliation complete, land with unpaid rates passed to the local council to be sold under the 1967 Ratings Act. There are a number of lessons to be leant from this situation. What is important though is that it is simply unreasonable to apply a property tax to Maori land owners whose title exists in Maori Freehold Title and Crown Title. What tends to be forgotten is that the 1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act ensured that Maori land with less than 3 owners had their title passed into Crown title so that it could be easily on-sold to local farmers. However, the same zoning restrictions applied because Maori land was allocated in Reserves or reservations such as Tuahiwi whose legal designation is the Kaiapoi Maori Reserve 873. This submission asks that any Maori land (Freehold Maori or General Crown Title) that sits within Maori reservations or Maori reserved lands needs to be exempted from any capital gains tax. Part II: Section Summary This section of the submission makes the point that since the WWII Maori land was regulated by local councils and as a consequence rezoned to a situation where:  The state of Maori Land as Dead Capital was created by legislation post WWII – specifically the 1953 Town and Country Planning Act, the 1967 Ratings Act and the 1967 Maori Affairs Amendment Act.  Maori land lost its value because of local government regulations which prohibited residential occupation and any commercial activity other than rural farming. THE CONCLUSIONS WE DRAW FROM THIS ARE THAT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE TO TAX DEPENDS UPON:  THE CAPACITY OF TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS POSSESSING LOCAL GOVERNMENT POWERS TO ZONE THEIR LAND IN A MANNER THAT STIMULATES ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND REVENUE.  THAT MAORI LAND NEEDS TO BE EXEMPT FROM ANY NOTIONS OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND,  AN ECONOMIC PACKAGE IS REQUIRED TO STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT UPON TRIBAL LANDS WHICH IN TURN GENERATES REVENUE FOR TRIBAL INSTITUTIONS TO ALLOW DEVELOP BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE ON MAORI LANDS AND RESERVES. Section III: Proposals to Convert Dead Maori Capital to an Economic Asset through Tax Policy Despite the problems with Maori land and Maori Reserves and Pah, the settlements that are occurring allows some discussion to occur on how to resolve the basic problem of Maori land as an economic asset. The Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act occurred in 1998. Today the Ngai Tahu Holdings Shareholder equity is $1.27b with a $49.6m distribution to tribal members. The challenge is to align the economic strength of our corporations with the reserved lands we have. Tribal corporation essentially generates wealth which flows into the regional and national economy. Nonetheless, as we shall show, that wealth does not flow into a Ngai Tahu economy. In a recent study conducted by the Ngai Tahu Research Centre, we undertook an examination of the multiplying role of the Ngai Tahu dollar within the local Christchurch economy. This report is attached as an appendix and remains in draft form until it is published. Our study was focused on the Wigram Residential Development. Our study was concerned with where the Ngai Tahu investment goes when it leaks out. In this report we compare the Wigram Residential development with a First Nation example on the Muskeg Lake Cree Lake Urban Reserve. We found that while the Wigram Skies development generated a significant economic income to Ngāi Tahu it did not gain as much economic benefit as the Cree approach both because it only focused on one element of the development value chain and because of the institutional restrictions only generated a limited duration income. Our research shows that Ngāi Tahu obtained roughly 20% of the total economic benefits from the Wigram Skies residential development but did not see the same ‘wraparound’ income that the MLCN development has been able to realize. The diagram below shows where the Ngai Tahu dollar went once it leaked out to the wider conomy. Most of the expenditure is on Building Materials ($288m), manufactures and Retailers with Construction firms taking $169m in Labour costs. However it is the issue of the land tax or the ratings base that gains our interest. As the illustration below indicates $186m was taken by Local and Central Government Rates and Taxes between 2010-2016. The Christchurch City Council took in $22m in rates. While this is a relatively small rates base this report does not look at the other commercial properties and ventures within Christchurch whether it be our commercial, industrial or residential properties and the revenue generated therein. What is important to note is that none of these rates or land taxes are directed to our reserved lands. Our reserved lands where our people live still lack basic infrastructure such as water and sanitation. How is it that we contribute so much in local taxation yet receive so little in return. Our people are now prohibited from building on our land because we do not have water /sewerage in our reserves. Yet these lands are the primary places where tribal members actually own land. This brings us back to the basic points of what build an economy. This submission argues that an economy depends on a ‘Virtuous Cycle’ wherein businesses and communities flourish. Much of this exists in New Zealand except for Maori land. Economic development occurs when investors and tribal members are secure in property rights so that they can build and create businesses. Businesses need to be located where communities exist and where basic infrastructure is present whether it be roads, water, sewerage, lights and community facilities. The diagram below is a virtuous cycle. Maori lands and communities have none of these facilities experts for perhaps a marae, church and urupa. Housing no longer exists, which leads to a lack of investment and revenue and a state of infra-structural neglect. However, tribal corporations do in fact generate revenue for local government. This submission suggests that local rates gained by local government from tribal corporations needs to be directed to Maori reserved land and communities so that basic infra-structure is provided. Rates should be directed to local Runanga and tribal institutions to manage. There are basic infra-structural needs that Maori communities are aware of. Water is a need for many communities, followed by sewerage and roading. However to receive a rating base, Runanga need to be empowered to hold local authority powers over their lands wherein they area accountable to tribal land- owners. Local Runanga need to have regulatory power and jurisdiction over their lands. What we know from section II of this report is that when the local county councils gained regulatory powers, the land quickly transferred to local rural farmers who controlled the county council. We also note that the Crown gained $133m in GST. It is not unreasonable to ask the question of whether Maori Reserved lands and the businesses we might potentially generate should operate with a tax inventive and also receive the GST? Finally, Maori land title needs to be amended wherein a new tribal title is created wherein tribal members can opt for a new customary title that exists outside of the Maori Land Court which is regulated by Runanga or tribal institutions. Part III: Section Summary THIS SECTION OF THE SUBMISSION MAKES THE POINT THAT IT IS POSSIBLE TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM MAORI RESERVED LAND IF THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM NEW TRIBAL DEVELOPMENTS ARE RE-DIRECTED TO TRIBAL PROJECTS. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT:  LOCAL RUNANGA SHOULD RECEIVE THE REVENUE GENERATED FROM LAND TAXES THAT TRIBAL CORPORATIONS CREATE FROM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS OR AT THE MINIMUM LOCAL COUNCILS AND RUNANGA SHOULD NEGOTIATE ON WHAT SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FROM THE TAX REVENUE GENERATED FROM LAND.  LOCAL RUNANGA SHOULD REPLACE THE MAORI LAND COURT AS THE CONTROLLING AUTHORITY FOR MAORI LAND OWNERS  CAPITAL GAINS TAX PROVIDES NO INCENTIVE FOR MAORI HOUSING AND LAND- OWNERS BECAUSE THEIR LAND HAS BEEN ‘DEAD CAPITAL’ DUE TO PAST LEGISLATION.  TAX INCENTIVES NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO ENCOURAGE MAORI HOUSING ON MAORI RESERVED LANDS  TAX INCENTIVES NEED TO BE PROVIDED TO STIMULATE MAORI BUSINESSES ON MAORI LANDS.

Submission – Future of Tax To: Tax Working Group – Te Awheawhe Take From: NKMoA (Ngā Kaitatau Māori o Aotearoa) Māori CFO Fourm Date: 30 April 2018 Mihi E ngā mana E ngā reo E ngā hau e wha Tēnei mātou Ngā Kaitatau Māori o Aotearoa e mihi ana ki te kaupapa o te wā Opening Observations and Thoughts Firstly, we thank the Tax Working Group, in particular Hinerangi Raumati-Tu’ua for the opportunity to engage in korero on the 23 rd March 2018 in Wellington, regarding this kaupapa Our submission reflects the discussion we had at that hui along with further ideas post that hui In summary our forum agrees with the tikanga of creating a tax system which encourages and ensures fairness and equality over the long term. We also agree with the tikanga of encouraging and recognising the effort and mahi businesses, organisations and individuals undertake to improve the long-term sustainability of Aotearoa which considers multiple outcomes, including environmental, social, cultural and not just economic. We believe that the balance of incentivisation ‘to do the right thing’ long term must be carefully balanced with the consequences (possible taxation) as a result of focusing on the short term economic outcomes which continue to create harm to people and place (he tangata, he whenua). Maori are collective, long term, intergenerational investors which hold assets that in some cases will never be sold (value realised), and based on this view we will over time, become a constant and significant contributor to the Aotearoa tax base. However, what we know now is that our contribution does not reflect our percentage of population and therefore we would encourage any changes to the tax system to support the growth of the Maori economy so that gap can be closed vs creating another barrier for us to achieve exponential growth and the ability to achieve and support positive outcomes for our people. For us to live Tino Rangatiratanga long term, we must have the ability to re-establish our economic base and therefore a tax system that understands and supports our asset base, the people we serve, our collective structures and long-term outcomes is essential. We must achieve parity and be on a level playing field to be successful long term. 2 Specific Reflections Tikanga Perspectives • Māori economic growth is less mature than wider economic growth in NZ (e.g. 5% of the economy, 15% of the population). How will Māori economic growth (in particular the pace of growth) be impacted by changes in the tax system? We need to achieve growth at an exponential rate as our people cannot afford continued poverty for another 1, 2 or 3 generations. • Due to the composition of the Māori asset base (environment and land), Māori are automatically impacted and disadvantaged by a land tax or capital gains tax. In turn, this will impact our ability to address and support the needs of our people (social, cultural, environmental and economic). • Will the TWG consider how not to penalise longer-term investors (e.g. Māori and iwi groups) when it considers a land tax or other changes? If groups are investing with a 500 year horizon, how can the TWG ensure that they’re not penalised in the short-term? These groups will always be tax payers, unlike international companies that can leave at any time. • Could there be a tikanga rebate for certain behaviours (e.g. doing the right thing for the whenua, or for providing education and other services the government is not providing to Māori communities). See section ‘fairness and equality’ for more information. • Could regional variation in income tax rates help people move to and stay in the provinces? Low incomes and other factors mean it can be hard to deliver core services in the regions. We know that iwi, Maori organisations are investing in the regions, we are predominately located in the regions, but attracting capacity and capability is challenging for our businesses as they become more complex and diverse. Whenua • Need to recognise important choice for Māori around buying or trading land to release capital for growth and diversification, therefore supporting long term sustainability and risk management. • But ultimately, why should Māori be taxed on our whenua? When in a number of cases, it has only just been returned to our active management. • In a collective ownership situation, it can be hard enough to identify owners, and then harder again to get the owners to pay. Unless the systems can be updated, Māori land and land owned by Māori authorities should not be taxed. Māori authority tax regime • Should we do away with the Māori authority regime and make them all charities (because commercial arms are providing for and giving back to their community vs individual wealth creation), and entities under this umbrella are, in many ways, acting as pseudo Government entities (i.e. delivering core social, cultural, environmental services). • Also the Māori authority tax regime assumes that commercial arms will make a profit, when in fact some commercial arms are highly invested in low cash return investments (especially those within the forestry sector); noting that land revaluation movements are only ‘book entries’ because they will never be realised. Therefore, you have a commercial arm struggling to pay a dividend to the charitable iwi entity; with losses building up in the 3 charitable iwi entity whereby these losses remain stagnant and unable to be offset against any dividend distribution. • Charities regime does not make it simple to choose to invest in whānau commercial balance sheets. • At an operational level, Inland Revenue doesn’t always have the right capability and skills to deal with Post Settlement Entities or the Māori Authority regime. This can mean these groups have to jump through unnecessary hoops when they just need information. Fairness and Equality • Māori entities have a significant role to play in the fairness and inequality debate in Aotearoa. • Māori businesses and entities have as their purpose collective benefit, by providing opportunities to disadvantaged members of our community. Would giving credit for certain actions these groups/entities do encourage further investment in these areas? Introducing a credit could encourage even more support for disadvantaged whanau. • Māori entities pay tax, but it’s not always obvious that that revenue is flowing to the Māori communities that need it. Would people pay more tax if they could see it being more directly reinvested in their people? • If you take the longer-term view, Māori will pay more tax over time – an argument for spending more on Māori economic and social development in the short-term. • The balance of the Government’s efforts on tax collection should move to the global businesses who pay no or minimal taxes – important if the TWG and the Government are serious about fairness. Specific taxes • Can the work of TWG address the divide between rich and poor in Aotearoa? Could the tax system provide some relief for lower income families (e.g. GST reductions for lower income people, zero-rating of GST on healthy food). • Introducing a CGT would address some of the injustices around wealth accumulation in Aotearoa, however careful consideration to those new in business (should CGT apply to the sale of a business) should be applied. Environment • Can the tax system incentivise/reward positive behaviour? How can tax be part of longer- term behavioural change, and how can it encourage doing the right thing • What can the TWG recommend around ways to be more clean and green? NZ has high per capita car usage. It is however important to note that those with lower incomes may not necessarily have the ability to make a choice compared to those on higher incomes • When the TWG considers environmental taxes, will it also consider a tourism levy, and shorter-term options to change behaviours around plastic bags and straws? • Those producing environmentally harmful products are taxed at a higher rate or an “environmental levy” be applied • What are the mechanisms to drive greater R&D in new sustainable products and services. What needs to occur to both develop these ideas but also achieve end user (consumer) acceptance both here and abroad? 4 • Overall, we must do what is right and in the best interests of the future generations, may this be to tax the bad behaviours and reward the good behaviours. Being sustainable in our view is just ‘good business’ and therefore we must adopt a systemic change programme to design, develop, inform and utilise sustainable products and services into the future. We know Maori will do this, because it is part of our business ethos, but it may come at a cost or impact our growth due to the nature of our collective asset bases Other Reflections • Aotearoa’s tax system is simple, and that’s one of the best things about it. Maintaining that simplicity is appealing. However, as an alternative example, a simpler method could be to introduce a flat tax rate, irrespective of your income. This may influence higher income earners, who typically structure their affairs to mitigate tax. There is a perception that higher income earners pay minimal tax. The tax system must be structured so that these loop holes are avoided. • The TWG will need to take care not to scare businesses with any recommended changes. We must be an attractive country to invest in, and this can be manipulated by the company tax rate and GST. • TWG should explore the relationship between GST and losses.

Hui Notes Tax Working Group consultation hui Tax workshop organised by Te Au Rangahau and Te Au Pakihi on 12 April 2018 Wharerata, Massey University, Palmerston North Contact: Dr Jason Paul Mika Co-director Te Au Rangahau Massey Business School Attendees Amos Ponga, Aroha Paranihi, Charles Ngaki, Charmaine Ratima, Daphne Luke, Farah Palmer, Hinerangi Raumati-Tu’ua, Jack Morris, Jason Kim, Jason Mika, Lisa Warbrick, and Turoa Karatea Presentation Hinerangi Raumati-Tu’ua, a member of the Tax Working Group (TWG), gave a presentation providing context around the issues that the TWG is considering. The Māori economy is a growing force worth over $50 billion in commercial assets. 1 However, there are still many disparities that persist. New Zealand’s demographics are changing – the Pākehā population is aging, and as they retire will be increasingly supported by the Māori, Pasifika, and Asian population. These and other challenges (globalisation, the changing nature of work, technology changes, and environmental challenges) are being considered by the TWG’s review. The TWG is interested to hear Māori perspectives on how best to address these challenges. The presentation concluded with several questions to consider: • Are there parts of the current tax system that warrant review from the point of view of te ao Māori? • What are the biggest challenges you’re facing when you think about tax right now? What changes are needed to make the system fairer and more balanced for our mokopuna? • How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focused tax system? What does the group need to keep in mind when exploring the impacts of new taxes on Māori, Māori land (e.g., capital gains tax, wealth tax, land tax)? How should we deal with taonga assets (e.g., heritage assets and settlement redress) under these sorts of taxes? • Does the Māori authority tax regime support or hinder Māori economic and social development? If it hinders it, why and what would make it better? Are there changes to the Māori authority tax rules that you would like the TWG to consider further? • What should the TWG keep in mind from a Māori perspective as it explores environmental taxes? 1 See Chapman Tripp. (2018). Te ao Māori: Trends and insights March 2018. Retrieved from https://www.chapmantripp.com/Publication%20PDFs/2018%20CT%20Te%20Ao%20Maori%20-%20English.pdf \[1\] 2 Discussion The attendees considered that the TWG should consider the following matters: • New taxes, such as a capital gains tax or a land tax, will impact on Māori and it is important to ensure that these impacts are assessed appropriately. • There was some support for a capital gains tax, as long as it was at a relatively low rate and there were appropriate exclusions– for example exempting the whānau home. • “Anything that happens on our land is cultural”. The group considered that tax revenue generated from any land tax associated with a particular region should go back to that region by way of the marae or the Māori councils under the Māori Community Development Act 1962. • Revenue generated from any environmental tax should be redistributed to/by Māori for Māori. • There was support in principle for taxes on the commercial use of water. Any water tax should also only be imposed on the biggest water users, by having a tax-free threshold of water use below which no tax would be imposed. • Resource consents for the commercial use of water (for example, irrigation) can be worth a lot of money, so there is a need to consider the tax treatment of those consents. • GST should be removed from bottled water so that it is a more attractive option for consumers in relation to unhealthy drinks. • A sugar tax was not supported. Other (i.e., non-tax) regulation would be more effective as sugar could simply be replaced with other harmful ingredients. • The cost of fruit and vegetables was raised as an issue, and there was support for removing GST from fruit and vegetables to make them comparatively cheaper. • An outright ban on plastic bags may be a more effective option than taxing them. In terms of the use of plastic packaging more widely (e.g., plastic bottles and containers), a tax could encourage producers to use alternative (less environmentally harmful) materials as packaging. • Tikanga Māori has a place in designing tax policy and administrative solutions fit for Māori, and potentially other taxpayer groups. The group suggested that Māori frameworks such as the Te Whare Tapa Whā could be considered in assessing the merits of policy proposals that impact Māori. How does this model relate to the Living Standards Framework? 3 • There are difficulties for Māori in valuing taonga assets such as land. Strong objection to any tax on settlement redress was expressed. • The definition of “koha” should be determined by tikanga Māori, rather than loose, equivalent Western concepts. In some circumstances, koha is subject to tax but these circumstances are not widely understood or known. • Māori voluntary contribution or volunteerism should be encouraged, and tax barriers should be minimised. For example, how should we treat koha (money or in-kind gifts) that are provided to kaumatua who help groups to understand or carry out Māori customary practices such as pohiri? The group suggested a form of “charitable status” or “exemption” attached to those who undertake voluntary work of this nature. • The casualisation of the labour market is a particularly vexing issue for Māori, as it can create instances of over-taxation at source especially if a person has a number of part- time jobs – these problems relate to secondary tax such as caregivers. • Tax is complex for startup firms and education and mentoring should be offered to these groups so that they get it right from the start. In addition, it is not just about tax, financial literacy is an important issue for Māori startup firms. • A small and medium enterprise (SME) tax regime with a lower tax rate was supported. It was also pointed out, however, that greater awareness of the existing range of business structures would help SMEs and startup companies – for example look-through companies. • Charitable status of marae is an important issue for Māori in the regions. There are barriers for marae to deregister from the Charities Register because of tax rules that require their physical assets to be valued when they deregister. More clarity is required for marae in this area. • Charities law is too restrictive in terms of the kinds of activities a charity can carry out. For example, rules prohibiting making grants to whanau businesses, which have a focus on improving whānau wellbeing, is an issue. Some transfers of this kind should be allowed without affecting the entity’s charitable status. Alternatively, iwi and hapū could be considered to be within one circle of membership. • The requirement to file tax returns even if you only receive a small Māori authority distribution was raised as an issue. An exemption from filing a return was proposed if the total amount of Māori authority distributions received in a year falls below a certain threshold. • Intangible cultural assets (for example, haka and compositions) should be protected. The use of intangible cultural assets by non-Māori should be taxed on the value created for the business and/or their brand as a result of the use of such assets. Currently cultural assets are used to derive profits, and no value is returned to the owner(s) of those cultural assets. 4 • Tax concessions should be offered to social enterprises to reflect the social good they provide. Summary of main themes • Revenue generated from any environmental tax should be redistributed to/by Māori for Māori. • There was some support for a capital gains tax (provided that appropriate exclusions were in place – for example exempting the whanau home); and taxes on the commercial use of water for large users of water. • There was no support for a tax on plastic bags. • Settlement redress should not be caught by any changes to income tax or by the introduction of a capital gains tax, wealth tax, land tax, or any other tax. • Support for removing GST from certain items such as bottled water, fruit, and vegetables, in order to promote positive health outcomes. • In general, there was support for using the tax system to encourage certain behaviours or outcomes (for example providing tax concessions to social enterprises; and making water, fruit and vegetables comparatively cheaper by removing GST). • Tax laws should recognise different cultural concepts such as the difference between koha and equivalent Western concepts; valuation of taonga assets; recognising the value created by intangible cultural assets; and recognising the contribution made by volunteers promoting Māori cultural practices.

We undertake a range of research, published as journal articles, policy papers working papers, and blogs, as well as making submissions from time to time to central government and councils on a range of issues relevant to cities, from climate change policy to compact development. See http://sustainablecities.org.nz/ and http://resilienturbanfutures.org.nz/ Introduction 2 This submission is largely focused on environmentally related taxes and taxes which are likely to affect housing and urban development. The Working group report is an important opportunity to promote the idea of ‘ecological tax reform’ (or a ‘ green tax switch’), not because New Zealand is a (natural) ‘resource based economy’ (p. 40) 6 but because our natural capital base needs protection for our wellbeing and for its own sake. Moreover, taxes on extractive or polluting activities can contribute to this protection goal 1 Associate Professor, School of Geography, Environment and Earth Sciences, Victoria University of Wellington 2 Professor, Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington; Director of the NZ Centre for Sustainable Cities. 3 Professor, School of Population Health, University of Auckland 4 Professor, SHORE, Massey University, Auckland 5 Research Fellow, Department of Public Health, University of Otago, Wellington 6 E.g. agriculture, forestry and fisheries together constituted only around 6% of GDP in 2005 (Statistics NZ). \[1\] | www.sustainablecities.org.nz Page 2 while either reducing distortions in other parts of the tax system, or raising much needed additional revenue. Main points 3 These points are arranged more or less in (descending) order of importance to environmental protection and urban sustainability. i. Carbon pricing. Given the critical urgency of climate change mitigation, no tax working group can afford to ignore the present and future issue of carbon pricing, even if hints from the Government suggest substantive policy change in this area will be for the yet-to-be- appointed Climate Change Commission. ii. There is a huge economic and social distortion caused by not sufficiently pricing carbon (or other GHGs 7 ), together with the demonstrated inadequacy of the ETS as presently configured. In terms of its contribution to pricing GHG externalities, the most important element in ecological tax reform is a floor on the carbon price, attained either with a minimum tax on carbon alongside the ETS, or a minimum floor price on carbon inside the ETS. Our view is that emissions trading is ‘riddled with daunting problems’ in practice, to quote economist Robert Shapiro ( Shapiro, 2009) and to echo many others. In any case, a consistent price signal is critical for incentivising investment and behaviour change. For revenue reasons, the notion of a minimum tax on carbon has strong attractions. iii. Nitrogen tax. For both water quality and climate change mitigation reasons, there is a strong case for a tax on use of nitrogenous fertilisers, a type of pollution tax. New Zealand has a very high level of application of such fertiliser, by global standards. The OECD (2017) noted that between 1998 and 2009, the ‘nitrogen balance has worsened in New Zealand more than in any other OECD member country, primarily due to expansion and intensification of farming.’(pp. 159-160); this has led to growth of nitrogen pollution in soils and rivers, especially in key farming regions, and especially where dairying has been intensifying. The OECD also notes that ‘the polluter pays principle should be the first line of defence in securing water quality (e.g. water pollution charges).’(p.179). iv. Air pollution tax. On air quality (as well as carbon) grounds, there is a case for a (revenue neutral) feebate vehicle tax system, in which the tax paid increases steeply from low levels for clean (e.g. electric) vehicles with small engine size to high levels for large engine vehicles (Barton & Schutte, 2015, pp., p.31). A feebate would apply the first time a vehicle was registered in New Zealand; and would send a useful signal to importers. It is particularly important in the absence of NZ fuel efficiency standards. The newly released Draft Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2018 (MoT, 2018 ) mentions feebates as a policy option at paragraph 122. 8 7 The major omission is the lack of price on the major long-lived GHGs, carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. However, short lived climate pollutants such as methane must also be reduced. 8 ‘122. Initial actions outside of the GPS for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in transport could include regulatory initiatives such as exploring vehicle fuel efficiency standards and the potential for a vehicle purchase feebate scheme. \[1\] | www.sustainablecities.org.nz Page 3 v. Diesel excise. There is a good case for reform of the fuel excise to introduce a diesel tax, so as not to create an artificial incentive favouring use of diesel vehicles, the operation of which creates emissions, which lower air quality and cause environmental health problems. The recent OECD (2017) report on NZ’s environmental performance pointed out that NZ is alone in the OECD in its approach, which looks increasingly outdated as the dangerously negative effects of diesel fuel use become more evident. The current tax arrangement, ‘does not encourage behaviours that would reduce fuel use (e.g. avoiding high-speed driving that uses up more fuel). The tax and charge rates are set based on investment needs, with no consideration for environmental externalities.’(p.31). vi. RUC exemption. While electric vehicles have environmental advantages, there is no good case for exempting them from the RUC. This is designed (to date) to run until 30 June 2020. Electric vehicles, like other vehicles, cause congestion and contribute to negative effects in the urban environment, such as road wear and urban sprawl. A charge on them should reflect these impacts and externalities to the maximum feasible extent. To the extent that there are carbon (climate change) advantages to EVs, these will be recognised and rewarded through the lower impost they would pay relative to internal combustion engine vehicles running on fossil fuels, assuming there is an adequately stringent carbon tax/price. vii. Company cars. Tax treatment of company cars also has deleterious environmental effects. The OECD noted in its 2017 report that ‘New Zealand applies a favourable tax treatment to company cars and parking lots, which is a cost for the public budget and tends to encourage private car use, long-distance commuting and urban sprawl.’(OECD, 2017, p.31). viii. Land tax. One key resource is land, and there is a case for a land tax. A land tax on unimproved value of land would create desirable incentives for land to be more efficiently utilised (e.g. a given parcel with two dwellings on it would pay no more land tax than the parcel with one dwelling on it), thus leaning against urban sprawl. There is some evidence it might reduce wealth inequality slightly, which seems desirable (Franks, Klenert, Schultes, Lessmann, & Edenhofer, 2018). Current urban rating systems, where based on unimproved value, do already provide similar incentives, but patchily. A nationally consistent land tax would provide uniformly beneficial incentives. ix. Taxing housing value gains. Two major distortions in the NZ economy are the lack of tax on imputed rental income of owner-occupied dwellings, and the absence of a capital gains tax (CGT) on residential property. These distortions have led to significant overinvestment in property and the bidding up of house prices, the unnecessary expansion of urban areas and adverse environmental consequences arising from this – from carbon emissions, to adverse impacts on air and water quality, to loss of habitat. x. A tax on imputed rental income. Such a change could be progressive, depending on whether it is accompanied by a tax rate reduction for all taxpayers or a tax exemption ’123. GPS 2018 will support this result through encouraging: - a whole-of-system approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transport, including considering the cumulative effects over time;- investment in lower emission modes of transport or transport systems...’ \[1\] www.sustainablecities.org.nz Page 4 increase. Figari et al. found that a tax exemption increase reduces inequality, with gainers mostly situated in the middle of the income distribution (Figari et al., 2017). It may be impracticable currently to introduce a tax on imputed rental income, but such a tax is not unheard of in developed economies – one did exist in the UK until 1963 – and this option should be kept on the table for the medium term. xi. Capital gains tax (CGT). In our view, it is desirable that a CGT be introduced, even if the family home remains exempt, and even if the administration and compliance costs of a CGT are substantial. Other developed countries have successfully managed these transaction costs, in the pursuit of a fairer and more comprehensive tax system. The signal a CGT’s introduction would send, in terms of both efficiency and equity, and both domestically and internationally, are important. Not to introduce one would be to countenance a continuation of the distortions identified. xii. Water rents. Given the comparatively large resource rents currently being extracted in parts of the economy, the application of a resource rent tax e.g. on water rents, would be highly desirable. Tax expenditures xiii. Tax subsidies. For consistency in terms of enhancing its tax base and making the tax system more efficient, equitable and environmentally sustainable, New Zealand should be minimising undesirable tax expenditures. A valuable step would be to eliminate tax subsidies for fossil fuel exploration, particularly as there is an overwhelming case against further fossil fuel prospecting for extraction. In its 2017 report, the OECD noted that ‘the OECD (2016b) estimates... that some of these \[fossil fuel subsidy\] measures cost the New Zealand government about NZD 60 million in tax breaks and budgetary transfers in 2014.’ ( OECD, 2017, p.32). However, it is acknowledged that with recent policy changes in regard to oil and gas block offers, this matter is not paramount. References Barton, B., & Schutte, P. (2015).

The New Zealand Beverage Council (NZBC) proudly represents the manufacturers, suppliers and distributors of New Zealand’s juice, carbonated drink, bottled water and flavoured dairy brands. Our members represent over 75 percent of the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages sold at retail level in New Zealand. 2. As an industry association, the NZBC represents and advocates for its members, and aims to work constructively with partners, regulators and decision-makers to ensure the right settings are in place to allow the beverage industry to succeed. 3. The NZBC believes the non-alcoholic beverage industry has the potential to play an increasingly important role in New Zealand’s economic future – creating jobs, strengthening the country’s manufacturing base, supporting the regions and growing the country’s export earnings. 4. We make this submission following reported comments by Tax Working Group Chairperson Sir Michael Cullen that it is possible “to use of the \[tax\] system to change people’s behaviour in ways which increase the wellbeing of all of us is very much on the agenda at the present point in time” and reports that the Chairperson “appeared warm to the idea of taxes on environmental and social issues such as greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and the causes of obesity”. 1 5. The New Zealand Beverage Council interprets these as indications that the Tax Working Group is actively considering taxes relating to obesity and water usage. In particular, we note a number of international jurisdictions have introduced a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in recent years and increased commentary by some lobby groups about the introduction of such a tax as a policy option to address obesity in this country. 1 See https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101970814/new-taxes-could-change-bad-behaviours-suggests- sir-michael-cullen 6. We also note a proposal to introduce a royalty on bottled water, as outlined in 2017 Labour Party Manifesto, which was refined to a royalty on exported bottled water in the Labour-New Zealand First Coalition agreement. We believe the introduction of such a royalty should be considered as a new tax and is therefore worthy of consideration and comment by the Tax Working Group. 7. The New Zealand Beverage Council does not support the introduction of a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or a royalty on the export of bottled water for the reasons outlined in this submission. We are strongly of the view that taxes designed to change the behaviour of consumers or manufacturers should have a clear policy intent, be comprehensive (as opposed to singling out certain industries or sectors of the economy) and supported by international scientific evidence on what works. We do not believe a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, or a royalty on bottled water, meet these criteria. 8. The New Zealand Beverage Council, however, understands that our members have important social and environmental responsibilities. Our members are absolutely committed to working to minimise their impact and making sure consumers have both choice and access to the right information at the right time, so they can make the best decisions for themselves and their families. Taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages 9. In recent years there has been increased worldwide discussion regarding the effectiveness of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages, as well as other foods that are deemed unhealthy, as a policy intervention to reduce obesity. This discussion has been driven against a backdrop of increasing obesity rates in the developed world and the success of tobacco taxes in driving down smoking rates in a number of countries, including New Zealand. 10. There are marked differences, however, between tobacco and sugar sweetened beverages. Most importantly, no level of tobacco consumption is safe. Moderate consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, on the other hand, causes no harm to human health and can form part of a healthy, balanced diet. In fact, the adverse effects that can be caused from the overconsumption of sugar are no different to health effects caused by the overconsumption of any other food product. 11. Like many developed and middle-income countries, New Zealand does have a growing obesity issue. The causes of this are numerous and complex, and the scientific evidence indicates there is no single simple solution. At its core, however, obesity is the result of an imbalance in excess energy consumption and too little energy expenditure over time. Factors contributing to obesity include environmental factors, increased availability of high-energy processed food, reduced opportunities for physical activity, parental health and genetic predisposition 2 . Sugar-Sweetened Beverages and obesity 12. There is no doubt that the over-consumption of any energy source, including sugar-sweetened beverages, can lead to weight gain and obesity in individuals. However, the overall consensus of scientific evidence on sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages shows they do not have a unique effect on body weight beyond their contribution to total kilojoule intake. 2 See http://www.superu.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Economic%20and%20social%20cost%20of%20obesity.pdf 13. For example, a scientific paper released in 2016 reviewed high quality recently published evidence on the effects of added sugars on obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The authors concluded that “the normal added sugars in the human diet (for example, sucrose, high-fructose corn syrup and isoglucose) when consumed within the normal range of normal human consumption or substituted isoenergetically for other carbohydrates do not appear to cause a unique risk of obesity, diabetes or cardiovascular disease.” 3 14. Likewise, a 2015 scientific review on fructose-containing sugars concluded that “like with the earlier fat story, it is difficult to separate the contribution of fructose-containing sugars from that of other sources of excess calories in the epidemic of obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Attention needs to remain focussed on reducing the overconsumption of all caloric foods ... and promoting greater physical activity.” 4 15. A further review of the highest-level evidence noted that “sugar-sweetened beverages are a marker of an unhealthy lifestyle and their drinkers consume more calories, exercise less, smoke more and have a poor dietary pattern.” The authors noted that many factors in the diet provide excess calories and for real health benefits, it is important to focus on the whole diet. 5 16. Raising obesity rates also cannot be solely attributable to increasing sugar intake. In fact, the intake of sugar and sugar-sweetened beverages has been decreasing in both New Zealand and Australia, while at the same time as obesity rates have been increasing 6 . 17. Between 1997 and 2009, median daily added sugar (as sucrose) intake for New Zealand males fell from 62 to 55 grams while median female added sugar (as sucrose) intake decreased from 45 to 42 grams. This occurred at the same time obesity rates increased from 17 percent of the population to 27.7 percent for males and from 20.6 percent to 27.8 percent for females 7 . Similar trends have been seen in Australia and the United Kingdom. 18. New Zealand adults get, on average, 21.5% of their daily energy intake from total sugars, or which 11.1% is free sugars 8 . This is close to the World Health Organisation’s recommendation, which suggests less than 10% of daily energy should come from free sugars. 19. The largest source of added sugar (sucrose) in New Zealand diets is sugar and sweets (23%), with non-alcoholic beverages contributing 16% 9 . In fact, soft drink consumption in New Zealand is actually falling – down 4.2 percent since 2010 10 , while sales for low and no-sugar non-alcohol beverages have grown by 66.7 percent over the past decade 11 . 20. In saying this, the New Zealand Beverage Council does recognise that the over-consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages does play a role in contributing to excess energy intake. That is why 3 J.

This includes new and reformulated products, offering low and no-sugar varieties and the voluntary displaying of kilojoule information on front labels. 21. In addition, in 2017 NZBC Members pledged to only sell bottled water to primary and intermediate schools in New Zealand. This is a significant commitment by the industry to help address childhood obesity and deliver sugar-free schools in New Zealand. NZBC Members also do not advertise any beverage in media that directly targets children under-14, or where 25% or more of the expected audience will be under-14. The argument for a sugar tax 22. Advocates for a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages argue that the tax will result in an increase in the price of these sugar-sweetened beverages relative to other items, therefore reducing the demand for sugar-sweetened beverages as “rational consumers” respond to these higher prices by changing their purchasing behaviour and switch to “healthier” alternatives. It is further argued that the reduction in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages should correspond with a reduction in obesity rates. 23. This argument relies on a number of assumptions, including (1) taxes will raise the price of sugar- sweetened beverages by an amount similar to the tax; (2) consumers will respond to higher prices by buying proportionately less sugar-sweetened beverages; (3) consumers will not substitute other equally-caloric products to replace any decrease in consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; and (4) any reduction in overall calories consumed as a result of the tax will lead to a noticeable decline on obesity. 24. Some jurisdictions have introduced a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in recent years as a policy intervention to combat obesity, including Mexico, the city of Berkley in California, and more recently the United Kingdom and South Africa. As a result, there is a significant body of research and evidence on whether these assumptions hold true in a real-world environment. The Mexican Experience 25. In 2014, Mexico enacted a tax of approximately 10% (one peso) per litre on all sugar-sweetened beverages, excluding dairy or alcoholic beverages, as well as an 8% tax on “junk food” such as chips and candy. The Mexican experience is often cited by both proponents and opponents to taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. 26. The tax did increase the retail price of sugar-sweetened beverages between nine and 19 percent and academic research by Popkin showed the 10% tax resulted in a six percent drop in the sale of soft drinks over its first full year. 12 A follow-up article by the same research group calculated the overall reduction in demand for sugar-sweetened beverages at 7.6%. 13 The fact that the consumption fell by less than the amount of tax suggests demand for sugar-sweetened beverages tends toward inelasticity. 12 Colchero, Arantxa et al. “Beverage purchases from stores in Mexico under the excise tax on sugar sweetened beverages: observational study.” In British Medical Journal 352, h6704 January 2016. 13 Colchero, Arantxa et al. “In Mexico, Evidence of Sustained Consumer Response Two Years After Implementing a Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax” in Health Affairs Vol. 36 No. 3 March 2017 27. However, the impact of the tax was short-lived. Euromonitor sales figures for Mexico reveal that while sales of carbonated beverages declined from 16,375 million litres in 2013 to 15,915 million litres in 2014, consumption rebounded to 16,156 million litres in 2016 and appears to be continuing to grow. 28. The tax also does not appear to have any meaningful impact on the caloric intake of the Mexican population. The caloric consumption from beverages has declined only slightly – between two and six calories per day – in a diet of roughly 3000 calories per day in Mexico. This represents less than a half-of-one percent decrease. 14 29. More importantly, the tax has had no impact on obesity rates in Mexico. In fact, Mexico’s 2016 national health and nutrition survey has shown that obesity rates in the country have increased from 2012-2016, especially among adult woman (a rise from 73% of the adult female population to 75.6% of that population). 15 30. The Mexican experience also highlights the regressive nature of these types of taxes, with the burden of taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages being carried by those who can least afford it. This is because individuals on lower incomes spend proportionately more of their incomes on foods. Over 63% of the tax was collected from the lowest socio-economic group 16 . 31. The tax also resulted in a significant economic impact in Mexico. The National Household Income and Expenditure Survey (ENIGH) and the Monthly Survey of the Manufacturing Industry (EMIM), suggested the tax was responsible for the loss of 10,815 jobs both in the non-alcoholic beverage industry directly and in agriculture companies that are major suppliers to the industry. 17 The Berkley Experience 32. In 2015, Berkley, California became the first city in the United States to enact a penny per ounce excise tax on sugar-sweetened soft drinks, energy drinks and iced teas with the goal of reducing local obesity rates. Alcohol, 100% fruit juices and milk products were exempt, regardless of sugar content. 33. A study on the effect of the tax in Berkley found the tax has actually resulted in an increase in the overall calorie intake because of changing consumer behaviour. The study found that while caloric consumption of taxed beverages dropped marginally by an average of six calories per day – the equivalent to a bite of an apple, caloric consumption of untaxed beverages rose by an average of 32 calories per day, resulting in an increase of 26 calories per person per day resulting from the tax. 18 34. It appears that because of the tax, consumers in Berkley switched their purchasing behaviour from soft drinks to other calorie dense non-taxed products such as milkshakes, fruit juices and 14 J Cantu, D.

This finding is not surprising and is backed up by research by Yale University, which found that when confronted with a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages, consumers tend to switch to milk and juice beverages, which may contain as much, or more, sugar as soft drinks. The result is no change in total calories consumed. 19 Another study in the United States involving the actual purchases of 100 households found that a ten percent increase in soft drink prices led to growth in beer consumption. 20 Real-world experience is supported by the research 35. The outcomes in Mexico and Berkley are supported by a recently released report by the New Zealand Institute of Economic Research (NZIER) titled Sugar Taxes: A Review of the Evidence, which concluded that the evidence that sugar taxes improve health care is weak. 21 36. As part of their research, the NZIER authors reviewed 47 peer-reviewed studies and working papers relating to sugar taxes, and found that: (i) Estimates of reduced intake are often overstated due to methodological flaws and incomplete measurements. (ii) There is insufficient evidence to judge whether consumers are substituting other sources of sugar or calories in the face of taxes on sugar in drinks. (iii) Studies using sound methods report reductions in intake that are likely too small to generate health benefits and could easily be cancelled out by substitution of other sources of sugar or calories; and (iv) No study based on actual experience with sugar taxes has identified an impact on health outcomes. 22 37. Likewise, McKinsey Global Institute’s 2014 report Overcoming Obesity: An Initial Economic Analysis found that taxing sugar is one of the least effective interventions in combatting obesity. The study found that of 40 model interventions, taxation was not in the top ten interventions and that the science supporting taxation as an effective policy intervention was deemed as weak. 23 38. According to the McKinsey Global Institute, the most effective ways to combat obesity include reformulating drinks, offering smaller portion sizes and providing better education. The New Zealand Beverage Council supports these as effective measures to combat obesity. Water royalties 39. As part of its 2017 Manifesto, the New Zealand Labour Party undertook to “introduce a freshwater royalty on water bottlers and other large commercial water users and set the royalty at a fair and affordable level” and “return the majority of royalty revenue to regional councils to fund rate reductions and the likes of better water management, restoration of waterways and wetlands and 19 Fletcher el al. 2010 20 Wanskick, Brian et al., From Coke to Coors: A Field Study of a Fat Tax and Unintended Consequences” Available at SSRN 2079840 (2012) July 29, 2014 21 NZIER, “Sugar Taxes: A Review of the Evidence” at ii (2017) 22 Id.

We also note comments from the Tax Working Group Chairperson Sir Michael Cullen at the International Fiscal Association Conference, where he is reported as saying “We face many environmental challenges such as water pollution, possible over-allocation of water, plastic pollution of the oceans, and congestion, in Auckland especially. All this means that it is possible use of the system to change people’s behaviours in ways which increase the wellbeing of all of us is very much on the agenda at the present time. 26 ” 41. The New Zealand Beverage Council would consider the introduction of water royalties targeting the water bottling industry as the imposition of a new tax on the industry and is it therefore worthy of consideration by the Tax Working Group. The Water Bottling Industry in New Zealand 42. The water bottling industry is a very small user of New Zealand’s freshwater resource. The Ministry for the Environment estimates that 0.02% of the daily amount of consented consumptive, non- hydroelectric water is allocated for water bottling. 27 There are approximately 52 local entities currently consented to produce bottled water for the domestic market. 43. The size of the domestic market is estimated to be about $140 million and the industry uses approximately 135 million litres of water annually 28 . Current exports of bottled water are also very small, at an estimated $23.7 million annually or 27.9 million litres. 29 The majority of New Zealand’s bottled water is exported to the United States (46%), and China and Hong Kong (43%). 44. The total market for bottled water is therefore estimated to be $163.7 million or 162.9 million litres. By comparison, it is estimated 5 trillion litres of water is used every year for irrigation in New Zealand, representing over 65.9 percent of New Zealand’s freshwater take. 30 The Economic Benefits of the Bottled Water Industry 45. The economic benefits of water bottling to local communities is estimated at around $60.7 million per annum based on return on capital and labour 31 . The sector is estimated to employ 916 full time equivalents in New Zealand and pays an average wage of $62,874. This means that the water bottling sector is delivering $57.6 million in salaries and wages to local communities. 24 Labour Party Manifest 2017 https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/nzlabour/pages/8414/attachments/original/1504825077/Water\_Policy.pdf? 1504825077 25 Coalition Agreement between the New Zealand Labour Party and the New Zealand First Party http://img.scoop.co.nz/media/pdfs/1710/362429780LabourandNewZealandFirstCoalitionAgreement.pdf 26 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101970814/new-taxes-could-change-bad-behaviours-suggests-sir- michael-cullen 27 Information provided to the NZBC by the Ministry for the Environment 28 Water Bottling in New Zealand: Industry overview and initial analysis of potential charge. Ministry for the Environment and Deloitte, January 2018 29 Ibid 30 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/97796506/The-biggest-users-of-New-Zealand-water 31 Water Bottling in New Zealand: Industry overview and initial analysis of potential charge. Ministry for the Environment and Deloitte, January 2018 46. In addition, it is estimated that the water bottling operations of New Zealand companies generated around $28 million in profits in 2016-17. It is assumed that 10 percent of this profit (or $3.1 million) is accrued by privately owned New Zealand companies, which is assumed to be spent in the local community. 32 47. Importantly, the bottled water industry tends to be located in some of New Zealand’s economically struggling regions – such as Northland, South Waikato and the Eastern Bay of Plenty. These communities tend to have high unemployment rates, a low manufacturing base and few large employers. The water bottling industry, therefore, makes an important contribution to these regions. A royalty scheme for bottled water 48. Under the Crown Minerals Act 1991, royalties are paid to the New Zealand Government by companies extracting New Zealand’s oil, gas and mineral resources. This is reflection that under legislation, the Government owns New Zealand’s petroleum and mineral resources, and the payment of a royalty ensures the country receives a fair return from the extraction of these non- renewable resources. 49. Water is fundamentally different. It has long been government policy that no one owns freshwater, including the government. And unlike petroleum and mineral resources, water is renewable. In fact, it is estimated 500 trillion litres of freshwater flows through New Zealand lakes, rivers and aquifers, of which only 10 trillion litres (2%) is extracted for human use 33 . Of that 10 trillion litres, only 163 million litres is used for water bottling. 50. Given the comparatively tiny amount of New Zealand’s freshwater used by the water bottling industry, it would be manifestly unfair to target a royalty solely at the industry. Contrary to public opinion, profitability of bottled water is not particularly high, and the imposition of a royalty is likely to have a devastating impact on the sector, particularly among smaller boutique operators. 51. Establishing a water bottling operation requires significant investment. While the cost of developing the infrastructure depends on factors such as the nature of the water source, location, type and capacity of the plant, a complete large-scale bottling operation costs between $10 million to $40 million to prepare the site, construct the building and install the plant and equipment. 52. Analysis undertaken by Deloitte indicates a range of earnings before tax of 5% to 30% 34 . This low level of profitability limits the ability of water bottlers to absorb any royalty without passing the cost onto consumers. Economic analysis indicates that bottled water is elastic, and demand is highly responsive to changes in prices. It is estimated that a one percent increase in the price of water would lead to a 1.17 percent reduction in the demand for water. 35 53. This means that a water royalty could have a significant impact on demand. For example, if a water royalty of 10 cents per litre was placed on bottled water, and a water bottler passed this on to the consumer, demand could drop 20%, significantly impacting the profitability of the operation. 32 Ibid 33 http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA1604/S00367/bottled-water-concerns-misplaced.htm 34 Water Bottling in New Zealand: Industry overview and initial analysis of potential charge. Ministry for the Environment and Deloitte, January 2018 35 Ibid Alternatively, if the royalty is absorbed by the company it could also adversely impact on profitability and impact their ongoing viability. This is particularly the case for smaller operators. 54. The imposition of a water royalty on exported bottled water would make New Zealand bottled water significantly less competitive on international markets. Given the low level of profitability in bottled water, exporters would have little choice but to pass on at least some of the royalty to consumers. This would increase the cost of New Zealand water relative to other brands, who do not have to pay a royalty. As previously noted, water is elastic, and consumers are sensitive to price. This is likely to result in a significant drop in sales and market share. 55. It is also unlikely that the imposition of a royalty will raise significant funds for the government given the relatively low level of water used by the industry. If a levy of 10c per cubic metre (1,000 litres) of water was imposed on exported bottled water, the Government could expect to receive $2,370 per year. If the same rate was applied to all bottled water, the royalty received would increase to $16,400. This would be significantly less than the cost of setting and administering a royalty scheme. Alternatively, a 10 cent per litre royalty on exported bottled water would raise $2.79 million. However, given the likely reduction in the export of bottled water following the imposition of a royalty, funds raised are likely to be significantly less. 56. The imposition of a royalty will also likely see smaller boutique operators ending their business and some larger multinational operators shifting their operations elsewhere to maintain operations. This will mean that the economic benefits enjoyed by the community will significantly diminish. It has already been noted that the industry is located in some of New Zealand’s more economically depressed regions, meaning that any reduction in industry activity is likely to have a magnified impact. Water pricing 57. The New Zealand Beverage Council understands that there are increasing demands on New Zealand’s freshwater resources, particularly in some drier areas, and that a mechanism for water pricing may have some merit in ensuring a fair, efficient and optimal use of water. 58. Any water pricing system, however, must be equitable and apply to all commercial users of water. It is unfair and discriminatory to only target water royalties at water bottlers when they use 0.02% of New Zealand’s consented freshwater. There is also no rational reason to charge a royalty on exported bottled water, but not charge it on other products that require significant water such as beer, wine and milk. 59. It is also unjust to expect the water bottling industry to fund the clean-up of New Zealand’s waterways through a royalty. It is acknowledged that the sector benefits from access to clean water, and that New Zealand bottled water’s brand is enhanced by the country’s clean and green reputation, the water bottling industry, however, does not contribute to the pollution of New Zealand waterways. In fact, it is in the industry’s interest to protect the sources of drinking water from pollution and not interfere with the environment unnecessarily. 60. It is the New Zealand Beverage Council’s position that if government is looking to fund the clean- up of New Zealand’s waterways though some form of industry levy, this levy should be sourced from those industries that contribute to the pollution of New Zealand’s waterways. Conclusion 61. The New Zealand Beverage Council supports the Government’s desire to improve the structure, fairness and balance of the New Zealand tax system. The Council also supports the Government’s objective of a tax system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy. 62. Taxes designed to change the behaviour of consumers to the betterment of both themselves and to wider society can have their place in the tax system. There is no doubt that significant taxation of tobacco has, in part, resulted in marked reductions in smoking rates. There is, however, a marked difference between tobacco and sugar. No level of consumption of tobacco is safe. Even very small amounts of tobacco smoking can cause adverse health outcomes. On the other hand, sugar-sweetened beverages are safe to consume in moderation and sugars form part of a balanced and healthy diet. 63. International experience has also shown that a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages will not have the same results as tobacco taxes. There are several reasons for this, including the willingness of consumers to pay higher prices, switch to budget brands or purchase equally high calorific but non-taxed items. 64. The New Zealand Beverage Council is open to working with government to look at an improved mechanism to allocate New Zealand’s freshwater resources. This might include introducing some form of pricing mechanism. 65. Any pricing must apply equally to all commercial users of water to achieve the desired outcome. The New Zealand Beverage Council is opposed in the strongest possible terms to any form of tax, royalty or levy that targets just one user of water, which is viewed as discriminatory and a threat to New Zealand’s fledging water bottling industry. 66. The New Zealand Beverage Council very much looks forward to the recommendations of the Tax Working Group.

We see this as a continuation of the mission of Jesus Christ. In seeking to fulfil this mission, we are committed to: (a) giving priority to the poor and vulnerable members of our; society and (b) Te Tiriti O Waitangi. The New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services (NZCCSS) has six foundation members; the Anglican Care Network, Baptist Churches of New Zealand, Catholic Social Services, Presbyterian Support and the Methodist and Salvation Army Churches. Nationally the range and scope of our six member networks is extensive and comprises 213 separate provider sites, delivering a range of 37 types of services via 1024 specific programmes, located in 55 towns and cities throughout New Zealand. Further details on NZCCSS can be found on our website www.nzccss.org.nz We would welcome the opportunity to discuss any of the issues raised in this submission with the Working Group. Contact person for these comments is: Paul Barber, Policy Advisor, Summary of Submission and Key Points A fairer tax system is urgently needed: NZCCSS supports the vision of a fairer tax system and the vision of a tax system that promotes wellbeing for all. Tax is one way the people of this country relate to each other and recognise that the wellbeing of us all is bound up with the wellbeing of each person. Tax has a vital role to reduce inequality: The people and communities our agencies work with are struggling with low incomes and the unfairness and inequality of the current system. The tax system must aim to do a better at sharing income more fairly. Tax on wealth is needed: Well-designed forms of wealth tax should be considered that ensure the largest wealth holders make a fairer contribution to wellbeing of all. There are already examples of net wealth taxes operating in other countries that could also work well in this country. Higher Tax rate on the highest income earners: It is unfair that high income earners (e.g. over $150,000) pay the same top tax rate as middle income earners ($70,000). Those high income earners are also likely among the high wealth holders who benefit from little or no tax on their wealth. \[1\] \[1\] Tax Working Group NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 2 - Better interaction between the tax and benefit systems: The tax and transfer systems play a vital role to improve the wellbeing of those facing disadvantage. Current abatement rates and thresholds impose very high effective marginal tax rates on low income earners. Rules for combining welfare benefits and earnings need to be simple and streamlined to respond to the rise of casualised work. Child-focused tax policy: The tax system affects the wellbeing of children in a number of ways. Taxes focused on determinants of health like taxes on sugary drinks would benefit children proportionately more. The design of tax assistance like Working for Families needs to put children in the centre. Gender impacts of tax: Tax policy should address the impacts on women who on average earn less, spend more time out of the paid workforce and accumulate less wealth. Reduce GST: If the reduction in revenue is replaced by well-designed alternative taxes such as wealth taxes. Government expenditure level that fosters wellbeing: The focus on tax policy should be meeting needs and fostering wellbeing rather than focusing on an arbitrary objective such as 30% of GDP. A Fairer Tax System is Urgently Needed A vision for a culture change in our approach to taxation, helping to foster a future of wellbeing for all – this is the foundation for these comments on the Tax Working Group (TWG) Background Paper (BP) and Summary for Submitters. These comments are informed by the experience of the community-based social services in our networks and the people and communities they work with. Tax is one of the ways that we as citizens of this country relate to each other. We seek to bring more justice and fairness to our communities, because we are all connected and interdependent. The wellbeing of all of us is bound up with the wellbeing of each person. Distortions and imbalances of income and wealth damage our ability to live well together as a nation. The TWG review is an opportunity to re-set our tax relationships towards a future where all can live well. The TWG’s clear focus on the four areas of wellbeing identified through the Treasury Living Standards approach is a welcome recognition by Government of the wider role taxation plays in enhancing wellbeing. The TWP Terms of Reference identify the broad areas for the TWG to focus on as well as identifying several areas as outside the scope of the Working Group’s review, including: • Increasing any income tax rate or GST • Inheritance tax or any other changes that would involve taxing the family home or the land under it • The interaction between the tax and transfer system (e.g. Working for Families, Accommodation Supplement or other welfare benefits) NZCCSS shares the view of many other groups we work who believe these out of scope issues to be central to future tax policy. We note that the Working Group has asked for thinking “outside the current system” and for consideration of the “main risks, challenges and opportunities” for the tax Tax Working Group NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 3 - system over the medium to long-term. In this spirit, we hope that all the ideas raised in this and other submissions will be addressed in the TWG work and analysis. Our member agencies report on the communities they work with and the challenges people face dealing with the complexities and unfairness of our current tax system. Their stories also show the importance of income transfers through the tax and transfer system for lifting incomes for the very poorest in our communities. We have monitored for many years the way inequality and poverty has impacted the life of communities 1 and it is time for a re-set of our tax system to focus on delivering wellbeing for all. Tax and Inequality In 2017 NZCCSS along with the more than 30 other groups of the Equality Network, released an Election Statement that called for “a tax on very high levels of wealth and higher top tax rates on the highest incomes to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share and enable our families and whānau to thrive” The Election Statement also called for “fairer income support” and it is a fact that the interaction between the tax and welfare/income support systems has a large impact on poverty and inequality in this country. NZCCSS comments are be based on those Election Statement messages: • Tax on wealth • Higher tax rate on the highest incomes • Fairer interaction between the tax and welfare systems The most recent public opinion poll released by Roy Morgan in February 2018 2 shows that poverty and the gap between rich and poor is still named most often as the biggest problem facing New Zealand. The tax system plays an important role in reducing inequality by redistributing income from those who earn more to support those on lower incomes. Income inequality is much higher now than 30 years ago and one important reason for this is changes made by various governments such as reducing tax rates for the highest income earners and reducing income support for people not in paid work. The New Zealand tax system does not reduce inequality as much it used to and it also does not rate well in comparison to other OECD countries in redistributing income (TWG BP p.33- 34). Tax on wealth Current tax settings to do not fairly or adequately tax high levels of wealth and options for introducing wealth taxes need to be carefully explored. The absence of capital gains tax or other wealth taxes is the most obvious gap that undermines the overall fairness and consistency of our tax 1 NZCCSS Vulnerability Report series http://nzccss.org.nz/publications/vulnerability-report/ 2 Roy Morgan, Finding no. 7534, 18 March 2018 http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/7534-roy-morgan- problems-facing%20new-zealand-february-2018-201803152343 Tax Working Group NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 4 - system 3 . There is a range of taxes on wealth, including Capital Gains Tax, inheritance taxes, gift and stamp duties that are used in other countries and have been used in this country in the past. While it is not easy to tax wealth effectively, it is important to try to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. Wealth is much more unequally distributed than income and there are few policy measures in place that would change this. In 2017, the wealthiest 1% of our population gained 28% of all wealth created in this country while the poorest third barely gained barely gained at all (1% increase) 4 . The aim of taxing wealth is to collect revenue, redistribute wealth more fairly, treat income earned through rises in capital value consistently across different types of assets (e.g. housing or investments) and to design a system that is not easily avoided. The TWG asks about forms of such taxes that would specifically exclude taxing the family home or the land under it. The OECD has just released a study on wealth taxes in the OECD including recommendations for designing such taxes 5 . Those recommendations advise that the fewer exemptions the better for a tax to be effective. The OECD concludes that countries like New Zealand that do not have significant taxes on personal capital income or inheritance taxes could benefit from a form of net wealth tax, which is an annual tax on individual wealth stocks net of debt. One approach that has been debated in various forms is a tax on the “deemed rate of return” on assets, that would encourage assets to be used for productive purposes instead of seeking passive returns by simply holding assets for capital gain 6 . A small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth could generate significant revenue but its annual cost to individual asset holders would not necessarily be great enough to encourage tax minimisation strategies. There are around 34,000 wealth owners who make up the 1% of our population that own 20% of all wealth in this country, with an average wealth of $4.4million (based on 2010 data 7 ). If they were to pay an annual tax of just 1% of that wealth (or $44,000 per year), it could generate tax revenue of $1.5 billion per year. Ten European countries have been working to design and introduce a Financial Transactions Tax 8 that could generate significant revenue. While they have not yet been able to reach final agreement on how to implement it, our Government should investigate how to implement such a tax here. Higher tax rate on the highest income earners It is not fair that those on the very highest incomes (e.g. over around $150,000) pay the same top tax rate as middle income earners (over $70,000). The tax system is much less progressive than it has 3 Lisa Marriott, “History of Tax Policy in New Zealand”, in Progressive Thinking: ten perspectives on tax (PSA, 2017) 4 Reward Work, Not Wealth (Oxfam 2018) https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/richest-1-kiwis-bagged-28-all- wealth-created-last-year 5 The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD, OECD Tax Policy Studies, OECD 2018) http://www.oecd.org/tax/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm 6 Bill Rosenberg, “Taxing Wealth”, in Progressive Thinking: ten perspectives on tax (PSA, 2017) 7 Max Rashbrooke, Wealth and New Zealand, (BWB Texts, 2015) 8 https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-07-05/top-financiers-call-europe-agree-robin- hood-tax. Tax Working Group NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 5 - been in the past, which has benefited the highest income earners the most. Other countries like the UK have higher top tax rates such as 45% for income above £150,000 (~$290,000 NZD). A recent study has rated New Zealand poorly on the progressivity of our tax system, with New Zealand ranked 30 out of 35 OECD countries and 115 out of 152 countries when looking at the tax structure, impact of tax in inequality and potential tax revenue available 9 . It is only fair that those earning the highest incomes contribute more to funding essential public services like schools and hospitals. While it is true that high income earners already contribute the largest share of the total income tax collected, those high income earners are also most likely among the larger wealth holders that benefit from little or no tax on their wealth. Fairer Income support through better interaction between the tax and welfare systems The tax and transfer systems play a vital in ensuring the wellbeing of those facing disadvantage and vulnerability and/or living on low incomes. Child wellbeing is particularly affected by the level of tax- funded assistance that is provided. The TWG Background Paper acknowledges this: “Therefore, when thinking about the distribution of taxes, equity and fairness, it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes in isolation” (Background Paper, p.20). The amount that can be earned before welfare assistance is reduced and the rate at which welfare benefits are reduced when people manage to find additional paid employment mean that people on very low incomes often see very little net gain. This is also a problem for people in employment if their increasing their incomes that take them above thresholds for income support payments such as Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement. Some calculations suggest effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) of up to 80% or more for low to middle income households 10 . Rules for combining welfare benefits and earnings need to be simple and streamlined to respond to the rise of casualised work. The complexities for people who combine irregular work with needing to access welfare benefits mean they can miss out on much needed support. Secondary tax does not seem to work well for many people on low incomes. The combination of several low-paid jobs, often with irregular hours, effectively penalises people who are already earning very little in total. Having to wait for end of year tax returns or organising a special tax rate disadvantages people who are often already struggling. Child-focused tax policy Developing a more child-centred approach to tax policy will help make a better future for our tax system. Examples of the way the tax system can be more child-focused include specific taxes that are aimed to address social determinants of health, such as tax on sugary drinks to help reduce childhood obesity. The tax system also raises funds for government to use to provide more public services such as health and education that benefit children more than others. Tax revenue is the 9 Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index, (Oxfam, 2017) https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/335299/nz-shamefully-poor-on-tax-policies-oxfam 10 “Taking a child-focused lens to tax”, (CPAG 2018) http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/180425%20CPAG%20TWG%20Submission%20FINAL\_2.pdf Tax Working Group NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 6 - best and most effective way to fund income transfers to families with children to reduce child poverty. Women disadvantaged by tax system The gender impacts of our current tax system need also to be recognised. Women in general spend a longer time out of the paid workforce. In paid employment, women also tend to be paid less for the same levels of productivity and contribution to economic growth. As a recent report 11 recommends “Governments should maximise space for women’s economic empowerment through progressive and gender sensitive tax policies”. Reduce GST GST is a highly regressive tax that means lower income earners pay higher a proportion of their income as GST. While there are various proposals to reduce GST on some basic food items, an overall decrease in the GST rate (e.g. to 10%) would be simpler to implement and would benefit lower income earners proportionately more. Because the current tax system relies so heavily on GST for revenue, a reduction in GST would have to be combined with introducing other taxes such as a well-designed wealth tax sufficient to compensate for lost revenue from reducing GST. Government Expenditure level that meets needs and fosters wellbeing The Government’s objective of maintaining government expenditure at around 30% of GDP as set out in the Terms of Reference, appears to be an arbitrary number that assumes “historical” levels of government spending will be sufficient to maintain essential health, education, and social services that will be needed in the future. Other wealthy countries are able to sustain higher proportions of government spending (up to 40%) that also enable them to deliver much more effective public services and greater wellbeing for their citizens. As our population demographics change, it is likely that government will have to play a greater role in fostering wellbeing for all. Significant additional expenditure will be needed in the future to meet goals to reduce child poverty, reduce the imbalance in incomes and wealth, increase the supply of affordable housing, respond to growing needs in the health and education systems. A fairer tax system can meet these needs if it is well-designed and draws revenue from currently untaxed areas through wealth taxes and a more progressive income tax system. 11 An Economy that Works for Women, (Oxfam, March 2017)

Nationally the range and scope of our six member networks is extensive and comprises 213 separate provider sites, delivering a range of 37 types of services via 1024 specific programmes, located in 55 towns and cities throughout New Zealand. Further details on NZCCSS can be found on our website www.nzccss.org.nz We would welcome the opportunity to discuss any of the issues raised in this submission with the Working Group. Contact person for these comments is: Paul Barber, Policy Advisor, Summary of Submission and Key Points A fairer tax system is urgently needed: NZCCSS supports the vision of a fairer tax system and the vision of a tax system that promotes wellbeing for all. Tax is one way the people of this country relate to each other and recognise that the wellbeing of us all is bound up with the wellbeing of each person. Tax has a vital role to reduce inequality: The people and communities our agencies work with are struggling with low incomes and the unfairness and inequality of the current system. The tax system must aim to do a better at sharing income more fairly. Tax on wealth is needed: Well-designed forms of wealth tax should be considered that ensure the largest wealth holders make a fairer contribution to wellbeing of all. There are already examples of net wealth taxes operating in other countries that could also work well in this country. Higher Tax rate on the highest income earners: It is unfair that high income earners (e.g. over $150,000) pay the same top tax rate as middle income earners ($70,000). Those high income earners are also likely among the high wealth holders who benefit from little or no tax on their wealth. \[1\] \[1\] NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 2 - Better interaction between the tax and benefit systems: The tax and transfer systems play a vital role to improve the wellbeing of those facing disadvantage. Current abatement rates and thresholds impose very high effective marginal tax rates on low income earners. Rules for combining welfare benefits and earnings need to be simple and streamlined to respond to the rise of casualised work. Child-focused tax policy: The tax system affects the wellbeing of children in a number of ways. Taxes focused on determinants of health like taxes on sugary drinks would benefit children proportionately more. The design of tax assistance like Working for Families needs to put children in the centre. Gender impacts of tax: Tax policy should address the impacts on women who on average earn less, spend more time out of the paid workforce and accumulate less wealth. Reduce GST: If the reduction in revenue is replaced by well-designed alternative taxes such as wealth taxes. Government expenditure level that fosters wellbeing: The focus on tax policy should be meeting needs and fostering wellbeing rather than focusing on an arbitrary objective such as 30% of GDP. A Fairer Tax System is Urgently Needed A vision for a culture change in our approach to taxation, helping to foster a future of wellbeing for all – this is the foundation for these comments on the Tax Working Group (TWG) Background Paper (BP) and Summary for Submitters. These comments are informed by the experience of the community-based social services in our networks and the people and communities they work with. Tax is one of the ways that we as citizens of this country relate to each other. We seek to bring more justice and fairness to our communities, because we are all connected and interdependent. The wellbeing of all of us is bound up with the wellbeing of each person. Distortions and imbalances of income and wealth damage our ability to live well together as a nation. The TWG review is an opportunity to re-set our tax relationships towards a future where all can live well. The TWG’s clear focus on the four areas of wellbeing identified through the Treasury Living Standards approach is a welcome recognition by Government of the wider role taxation plays in enhancing wellbeing. The TWP Terms of Reference identify the broad areas for the TWG to focus on as well as identifying several areas as outside the scope of the Working Group’s review, including:  Increasing any income tax rate or GST  Inheritance tax or any other changes that would involve taxing the family home or the land under it  The interaction between the tax and transfer system (e.g. Working for Families, Accommodation Supplement or other welfare benefits) NZCCSS shares the view of many other groups we work who believe these out of scope issues to be central to future tax policy. We note that the Working Group has asked for thinking “outside the current system” and for consideration of the “main risks, challenges and opportunities” for the tax NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 3 - system over the medium to long-term. In this spirit, we hope that all the ideas raised in this and other submissions will be addressed in the TWG work and analysis. Our member agencies report on the communities they work with and the challenges people face dealing with the complexities and unfairness of our current tax system. Their stories also show the importance of income transfers through the tax and transfer system for lifting incomes for the very poorest in our communities. We have monitored for many years the way inequality and poverty has impacted the life of communities 1 and it is time for a re-set of our tax system to focus on delivering wellbeing for all. Tax and Inequality In 2017 NZCCSS along with the more than 30 other groups of the Equality Network, released an Election Statement that called for “a tax on very high levels of wealth and higher top tax rates on the highest incomes to ensure that everyone contributes their fair share and enable our families and whānau to thrive” The Election Statement also called for “fairer income support” and it is a fact that the interaction between the tax and welfare/income support systems has a large impact on poverty and inequality in this country. NZCCSS comments are be based on those Election Statement messages:  Tax on wealth  Higher tax rate on the highest incomes  Fairer interaction between the tax and welfare systems The most recent public opinion poll released by Roy Morgan in February 2018 2 shows that poverty and the gap between rich and poor is still named most often as the biggest problem facing New Zealand. The tax system plays an important role in reducing inequality by redistributing income from those who earn more to support those on lower incomes. Income inequality is much higher now than 30 years ago and one important reason for this is changes made by various governments such as reducing tax rates for the highest income earners and reducing income support for people not in paid work. The New Zealand tax system does not reduce inequality as much it used to and it also does not rate well in comparison to other OECD countries in redistributing income (TWG BP p.33- 34). Tax on wealth Current tax settings to do not fairly or adequately tax high levels of wealth and options for introducing wealth taxes need to be carefully explored. The absence of capital gains tax or other wealth taxes is the most obvious gap that undermines the overall fairness and consistency of our tax 1 NZCCSS Vulnerability Report series http://nzccss.org.nz/publications/vulnerability-report/ 2 Roy Morgan, Finding no. 7534, 18 March 2018 http://www.roymorgan.com/findings/7534-roy-morgan- problems-facing%20new-zealand-february-2018-201803152343 NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 4 - system 3 . There is a range of taxes on wealth, including Capital Gains Tax, inheritance taxes, gift and stamp duties that are used in other countries and have been used in this country in the past. While it is not easy to tax wealth effectively, it is important to try to ensure that high wealth holders contribute to the wellbeing of all through the tax system. Wealth is much more unequally distributed than income and there are few policy measures in place that would change this. In 2017, the wealthiest 1% of our population gained 28% of all wealth created in this country while the poorest third barely gained barely gained at all (1% increase) 4 . The aim of taxing wealth is to collect revenue, redistribute wealth more fairly, treat income earned through rises in capital value consistently across different types of assets (e.g. housing or investments) and to design a system that is not easily avoided. The TWG asks about forms of such taxes that would specifically exclude taxing the family home or the land under it. The OECD has just released a study on wealth taxes in the OECD including recommendations for designing such taxes 5 . Those recommendations advise that the fewer exemptions the better for a tax to be effective. The OECD concludes that countries like New Zealand that do not have significant taxes on personal capital income or inheritance taxes could benefit from a form of net wealth tax, which is an annual tax on individual wealth stocks net of debt. One approach that has been debated in various forms is a tax on the “deemed rate of return” on assets, that would encourage assets to be used for productive purposes instead of seeking passive returns by simply holding assets for capital gain 6 . A small annual percentage tax paid on high wealth could generate significant revenue but its annual cost to individual asset holders would not necessarily be great enough to encourage tax minimisation strategies. There are around 34,000 wealth owners who make up the 1% of our population that own 20% of all wealth in this country, with an average wealth of $4.4million (based on 2010 data 7 ). If they were to pay an annual tax of just 1% of that wealth (or $44,000 per year), it could generate tax revenue of $1.5 billion per year. Ten European countries have been working to design and introduce a Financial Transactions Tax 8 that could generate significant revenue. While they have not yet been able to reach final agreement on how to implement it, our Government should investigate how to implement such a tax here. Higher tax rate on the highest income earners It is not fair that those on the very highest incomes (e.g. over around $150,000) pay the same top tax rate as middle income earners (over $70,000). The tax system is much less progressive than it has 3 Lisa Marriott, “History of Tax Policy in New Zealand”, in Progressive Thinking: ten perspectives on tax (PSA, 2017) 4 Reward Work, Not Wealth (Oxfam 2018) https://www.oxfam.org.nz/news/richest-1-kiwis-bagged-28-all- wealth-created-last-year 5 The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD, OECD Tax Policy Studies, OECD 2018) http://www.oecd.org/tax/the-role-and-design-of-net-wealth-taxes-in-the-oecd-9789264290303-en.htm 6 Bill Rosenberg, “Taxing Wealth”, in Progressive Thinking: ten perspectives on tax (PSA, 2017) 7 Max Rashbrooke, Wealth and New Zealand, (BWB Texts, 2015) 8 https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/pressreleases/2017-07-05/top-financiers-call-europe-agree-robin- hood-tax. NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 5 - been in the past, which has benefited the highest income earners the most. Other countries like the UK have higher top tax rates such as 45% for income above £150,000 (~$290,000 NZD). A recent study has rated New Zealand poorly on the progressivity of our tax system, with New Zealand ranked 30 out of 35 OECD countries and 115 out of 152 countries when looking at the tax structure, impact of tax in inequality and potential tax revenue available 9 . It is only fair that those earning the highest incomes contribute more to funding essential public services like schools and hospitals. While it is true that high income earners already contribute the largest share of the total income tax collected, those high income earners are also most likely among the larger wealth holders that benefit from little or no tax on their wealth. Fairer Income support through better interaction between the tax and welfare systems The tax and transfer systems play a vital in ensuring the wellbeing of those facing disadvantage and vulnerability and/or living on low incomes. Child wellbeing is particularly affected by the level of tax- funded assistance that is provided. The TWG Background Paper acknowledges this: “Therefore, when thinking about the distribution of taxes, equity and fairness, it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes in isolation” (Background Paper, p.20). The amount that can be earned before welfare assistance is reduced and the rate at which welfare benefits are reduced when people manage to find additional paid employment mean that people on very low incomes often see very little net gain. This is also a problem for people in employment if their increasing their incomes that take them above thresholds for income support payments such as Working for Families and the Accommodation Supplement. Some calculations suggest effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) of up to 80% or more for low to middle income households 10 . Rules for combining welfare benefits and earnings need to be simple and streamlined to respond to the rise of casualised work. The complexities for people who combine irregular work with needing to access welfare benefits mean they can miss out on much needed support. Secondary tax does not seem to work well for many people on low incomes. The combination of several low-paid jobs, often with irregular hours, effectively penalises people who are already earning very little in total. Having to wait for end of year tax returns or organising a special tax rate disadvantages people who are often already struggling. Child-focused tax policy Developing a more child-centred approach to tax policy will help make a better future for our tax system. Examples of the way the tax system can be more child-focused include specific taxes that are aimed to address social determinants of health, such as tax on sugary drinks to help reduce childhood obesity. The tax system also raises funds for government to use to provide more public services such as health and education that benefit children more than others. Tax revenue is the 9 Commitment to Reducing Inequality Index, (Oxfam, 2017) https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/335299/nz-shamefully-poor-on-tax-policies-oxfam 10 “Taking a child-focused lens to tax”, (CPAG 2018) http://www.cpag.org.nz/assets/180425%20CPAG%20TWG%20Submission%20FINAL\_2.pdf NZCCSS comments Apr2018.docx - 6 - best and most effective way to fund income transfers to families with children to reduce child poverty. Women disadvantaged by tax system The gender impacts of our current tax system need also to be recognised. Women in general spend a longer time out of the paid workforce. In paid employment, women also tend to be paid less for the same levels of productivity and contribution to economic growth. As a recent report 11 recommends “Governments should maximise space for women’s economic empowerment through progressive and gender sensitive tax policies”. Reduce GST GST is a highly regressive tax that means lower income earners pay higher a proportion of their income as GST. While there are various proposals to reduce GST on some basic food items, an overall decrease in the GST rate (e.g. to 10%) would be simpler to implement and would benefit lower income earners proportionately more. Because the current tax system relies so heavily on GST for revenue, a reduction in GST would have to be combined with introducing other taxes such as a well-designed wealth tax sufficient to compensate for lost revenue from reducing GST. Government Expenditure level that meets needs and fosters wellbeing The Government’s objective of maintaining government expenditure at around 30% of GDP as set out in the Terms of Reference, appears to be an arbitrary number that assumes “historical” levels of government spending will be sufficient to maintain essential health, education, and social services that will be needed in the future. Other wealthy countries are able to sustain higher proportions of government spending (up to 40%) that also enable them to deliver much more effective public services and greater wellbeing for their citizens. As our population demographics change, it is likely that government will have to play a greater role in fostering wellbeing for all. Significant additional expenditure will be needed in the future to meet goals to reduce child poverty, reduce the imbalance in incomes and wealth, increase the supply of affordable housing, respond to growing needs in the health and education systems. A fairer tax system can meet these needs if it is well-designed and draws revenue from currently untaxed areas through wealth taxes and a more progressive income tax system. 11 An Economy that Works for Women, (Oxfam, March 2017)

Members are employed and self-employed and collectively represent 90% of the practising midwives in this country. There are around 2,900 midwives who hold an Annual Practising Certificate (APC). These midwives provide maternity care to, on average, 60,000 women and babies each year. New Zealand has a unique and efficient maternity service model which centres care around the needs of the woman and her baby. Midwives undertake a four year equivalent undergraduate degree to become registered. The undergraduate curriculum meets all international regulatory and education standards. Midwives are authorised prescribers in relation to their Scope of Practice as determined by the Midwifery Council. Midwives provide an accessible and primary health care service for women in the community within a continuity of carer model as Lead Maternity Carers. Midwives can also choose to work within secondary and tertiary maternity facilities, providing essential care to women with complex maternity needs. The College offers information, education and advice to women, midwives, district health boards, health and social service agencies and the Ministry of Health regarding midwifery and maternity issues. Midwives interface with a multitude of other health professionals and agencies to support women to achieve the optimum outcome for their pregnancies, health and wellbeing. 376 Manchester Street / PO Box 21106 Edgeware Christchurch / Telephone (03) 377 2732 / Facsimile (03) 377 5662 / Email nzcom@nzcom.org.nz 30 th April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 The Future of Tax The New Zealand College of Midwives (the College) welcomes the opportunity to provide feedback about the future of the tax system. The College recognises that the tax system in New Zealand is in need of urgent reform as the current situation has created a seriously inequitable society, and this has contributed to a society where deteriorating health and reduced wellbeing is widespread. The work by Wilkinson and Pickett (The Spirit Level) 1 demonstrates clearly that health and social problems are much worse in countries such as New Zealand, where we are observing the damaging effects of large inequalities of income and wealth. Midwifery care takes place in partnership with women, and underpinning this practice philosophy is a concern for women’s health, infant and young child health, and the health of the woman’s family. The midwifery model of care ensures that primary maternity services are accessible for the majority of women, and the vast majority of women register with a midwife LMC during their pregnancy. This situation puts midwives in a position where they regularly interact with population groups who experience disparities or inequities in health (for example Māori and Pacific populations). Health, including mental health, and social problems, are related to inequity and income differences within rich societies. 2 Boston and Chapple have drawn attention to the combination of policy changes and societal trends, which have led to dramatic increases in child poverty. 3 A key aspect to resolving the growing 1 Wilkinson, R. & Pickett, K.

The College considers that the role of government is to increase the wellbeing of its citizens and with this in mind the prospect of tax reform is both welcome, if overdue. Further feedback is below: Key recommendations 1. Reducing wealth inequity by introducing a wealth tax, changing the bands of income tax payments and taxing homes that are not occupied, represents a positive step towards a more equitable model. Wealth tax could be assessed annually on the amount of net wealth. Vertical equity is necessary to move towards an ethically sound system. 2. The College considers that to improve our health system, including maternity care and well child health services, both of which are investments for our future, New Zealand requires stable and sustainable financing which could be achieved by a strong tax system including wealth taxes, and corporate tax. Progressive enforcement will result in an important redistributive effect leading to a more equal and healthy society. Progressive tax revenues from profits, capital, and income have been found to be much more effective in generating public funds for health. 4 In the study by Reeves et al, consumption taxes were associated with significant higher infant and young child mortality. 3. We are seeing an increase in the burden of non-communicable diseases with spiralling costs to society. It is therefore critical to acknowledge the poor socioeconomic environments and circumstances that many New Zealand families are living in currently, which present major barriers to wellness, and which are leading factors in non-communicable diseases. Health promotion, even underpinned by research, is unlikely to be effective where there are conditions of serious inequity, health disparities, hardship, and poverty. Tax review could contribute positively to this situation. To meaningfully contribute to the health of New Zealanders, a review of taxes on unhealthy food, such as those containing a high sugar amounts, and alcohol products, needs to be addressed. 4. Further to point 4 and the implication of inequity to society and health, Eckenrode et al, examined the relationship between country level income equality and rates of child maltreatment, and found that higher income inequality was significantly associated with higher 4 Reeves, A., Gourtsoyannis, Y., Basu, S., McCoy, D., McKee, M., & Stuckler, D. (2015). Financing universal health coverage—effects of alternative tax structures on public health systems: cross-national modelling in 89 low-income and middle-income countries. Lancet, 386(9990):274-280. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60574-8 376 Manchester Street / PO Box 21106 Edgeware Christchurch / Telephone (03) 377 2732 / Facsimile (03) 377 5662 / Email nzcom@nzcom.org.nz rates of maltreatment. 5 Lopez et al, also found that income inequality was independently associated with higher health care expenditures and more health care use. 6 The evidence implicating the detrimental effects of inequity, which does affect all of society, is growing. 5. To meaningfully contribute to environmental protection (and subsequent improvements in health) a climate change levy could be introduced to link tax payments to emissions, carbon taxes, landfill and waste, and nitrate fertiliser levies (with rebates available for such significant activities as tree planting, water-care, regenerative and organic agriculture). 6. Women are disadvantaged economically relative to men, and they also do the vast majority of unpaid care work – such as caring for children, caring for elderly relatives and caring for the home. Providing more and better quality public services can contribute to ending gender inequality, as women tend to step ‘into the gaps’ to provide a range of care needs that the state is not adequately addressing. Gender-responsive budgeting to ensure revenue from taxes is spent in a way which promotes gender equality is significantly important. 7. Measures to tackle corporate tax evasion are urgently needed and as described by Fisher, “For today’s multinational corporations, tax avoidance and the use of tax havens have become commonplace and even an integral part of modern business practice.” 7 Fisher also states, “For these corporate leaders, if national governments have not (yet) made it illegal, it is not wrong; in fact, in the view of some, fiduciary responsibilities toward shareholders may even require their corporations to engage in such activities. If this attitude prevailed in all areas of business, however, corporations would still engage in environmentally harmful activities, human rights abuses, and other forms of socially irresponsible activity for the sake of maximizing shareholder value.” In 2017 an investigation exposed twenty multinational companies who paid virtually no income tax, despite recording almost $10 billion in annual sales to New Zealand consumers. The report stated that an “analysis of financial information of more than 100 multinational corporations and their New Zealand subsidiaries showed that, had the New Zealand branches of these 20 firms reported profits at the same healthy rate as their parents, their combined income tax bill would have been nearly $490 million.” 8 Closing tax avoidance loopholes and implementing progressive taxes support better quality health and social services, which in turn can contribute to a system that addresses issues of gender discrimination and equity. 5 Eckenrode, J., Smith, E.

Gender responsiveness needs addressing urgently as part of any tax reform policy changes. New Zealand College of Midwives

This submission is made on behalf of the 30 unions affiliated to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU). With 320,000 members, the CTU is the largest democratic organisation in New Zealand 1.2. The CTU acknowledges Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the founding document of Aotearoa New Zealand and formally acknowledges this through Te Rūnanga o Ngā Kaimahi Māori o Aotearoa (Te Rūnanga) the Māori arm of Te Kauae Kaimahi (CTU) which represents approximately 60,000 Māori workers. 1.3. The NZCTU welcomes the opportunity to make this submission in response to the background paper circulated by the Tax Working Group. Our submission does not cover all questions asked in the report, but focuses on those aspects we consider particularly require comment 1.4. We request the opportunity to meet with the Tax Working Group to discuss this submission. In addition to this submission on the Background Paper, the NZCTU will in due course make a submission on the Tax Working Group’s draft recommendations, and will encourage its affiliates to do so also. 1.5. We have commissioned UMR Research to find out more about the public’s attitudes and preferences on tax. We will make the key findings from the research that relate to the Tax Working Group’s inquiry available to the Group to help inform findings once the research is processed and available, which should be within a week. 1.6. Within the Tax Working Group’s Terms of Reference the NZCTU would support • A reduced rate of GST; • A Capital Gains Tax exempting the family home, but treating all other capital gains as taxable income, both for fairness and to dampen speculation in assets including housing, while encouraging investment in productive assets; • Consideration of a tax on wealth, including property but exempting the family home (one possible method would be a tax on a deemed “risk free rate of return” on assets); • Investigating other ways of removing the tax advantages that investment or speculation in property enjoys relative to productive investment; • Taxation of international companies like Facebook and Google which avoid tax in various ways including shifting profits overseas, not having a local presence, and other tactics not being actioned under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda; 2 • Taxes on excess profits resulting from windfalls or market dominance; • A Financial Activities Tax (FAT) on financial institutions as proposed by the IMF; • Taxes on cross-border financial transactions, both as a revenue source and to stabilise international financial flows and the exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar; • A review of the company tax structure and its interaction with dividend imputation to ensure investment income is taxed sufficiently; • Consideration of ending tax deductibility of interest on related party borrowing; • A review of the taxation of closely held companies to make it difficult to use them for tax avoidance, and to provide tax relief for local owners of small firms; • Ensuring that Trusts other than Charitable Trusts cannot be used for tax avoidance; • Broadening of the tax base by recognising wealth transfers such as gifts and inheritances as forms of income; • Pollution taxes to force polluters to bear the costs of all significant externalities they cause; • Ensuring New Zealand’s resource use taxes and royalties provide a fair return to New Zealanders and incentivise efficient use of those resources; • Ensuring IRD has enough resources to track down tax evasion and abusive tax practices; 1.7. Specific recommendations made in this submission are as follows. The Tax Working Group should - • Set aside in its deliberations the arbitrary 30%-of-GDP ceiling on tax revenue (paragraph 2.8); • Take explicit account of differential impacts on men and women when considering changes (paragraph 4.2); • Recommend further reviews to consider restoration of progressivity to income tax rates by means of for a tax-free income band up to $35,000, a 38% rate on income between two and three times the average wage, and a 45% rate on income above that (paragraphs 5.6– 5.8); 3 • Look at full or partial replacement of Working for Families with a tax-free threshold on personal income (paragraph 6.3); • Recommend that the GST rate should be reduced immediately to 12.5 percent and GST should be progressively replaced with other forms of taxation (paragraph 7.1); • Address directly the issues raised by tax avoidance on the part of multinational companies not being actioned under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda; provide clear advice on addressing these and future challenges to the tax system in international double taxation agreements and trade and investment agreements (section 8). • Recommend introduction of a Financial Activities Tax on the financial services sector (paragraph 9.13); • Give consideration to a Financial Transactions Tax on cross-border financial flows (paragraph 10.2); • Adopt the Hicks definition of income, thus bringing capital gains, gifts, and inheritance within the ambit of the income tax system (section 11); • Urge development of a wealth-holdings register (paragraph 12.8); • Review options for a wealth tax targeted at the top of the distribution (paragraph 12.9); • Recommend adoption of a broad-based land tax with exemption for land under the family home, and a value-per-hectare lower threshold (paragraph 13.4); • Recommend returning the company tax rate to 30% (nothwithstanding the Terms of Reference limitation)(paragraph 14.1); • Investigate an excess profits tax (paragraphs 14.6 and 15.9); • Strongly recommend an increase in resources available to IRD to track down tax evasion and abusive tax practices, to ensure that everyone in the community pays their fair share of tax (paragraph 16.1); • Review the level of existing resource levies, taxes and royalties (paragraph 18.3). • Recommend major improvements in the quality and accessibility of tax statistics (paragraphs 19.5–19.6). 4 2. Funding an adequate level of Government spending 2.1. It is essential that the state is sufficiently resourced to carry out its functions and to perform its important redistributive role. Taxation is the means to achieve a better society and needs to be promoted as such. 2.2. The Government will need significantly more revenue in the coming decade to address New Zealand’s social deficits, inequality including gender pay gaps, and environmental degradation, and to rebuild and sustain quality public services such as health, housing and education. 2.3. Currently the New Zealand public sector is in the midst of a wide-ranging underfunding crisis. In general, the infrastructure of the New Zealand nation has been severely run down, reducing the effectiveness of the public sector across a wide range of activities, from border control to conservation, from public transport to broadcasting, and from labour inspection to policing the tax system. 2.4. ‘Wagner’s Law’ argues that as a nation’s economy grows, the share of the public sector in the national economy tends to grow. US economist Larry Summers has recently supported this prediction for the US economy 1 , and it seems likely that the same arguments apply to New Zealand in coming decades. In the long run the Government will be a larger, not smaller, part of the economy. 2.5. The redistribution required by the tax and transfer system is increased by poor ‘pre-distribution’ – the high inequality in gross or ‘market’ incomes such as wages, salaries and income from ownership of capital. 2.6. The NZCTU welcomes the clear statement by the TWG that (p.3) “Taxes allow the Government to fund the vital public services ... that underpin our living standards”. However, the question of what level of Government expenditure will be required in coming decades – and consequently the volume of resources that will have to be captured by the tax system – requires far more explicit attention than the document provides. 2.7. Following a long period of underfunding of basic services such as health and education, and of holding benefit levels below the levels required to support an acceptable standard of living, it has to be anticipated that making up for the accumulated deficits in physical infrastructure, social, human and natural capital will be likely to push Government expenditure beyond the “historical level of 30% of GDP” mentioned in the Terms of Reference. 2.8. While those Terms of Reference explicitly speak of a “sustainable revenue base” to fund operating expenditure at that 30% figure, they do not rule out the usefulness of a revenue base adequate to support a higher level of government spending, or to sustain an increased operating surplus. The TWG should therefore not artificially constrain its analysis to incorporate any arbitrary cap on tax revenue, whether at 30% of GDP or any other level. 1 David Leonhardt, ‘Your coming tax increase’, New York Times 7 September 2017, https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/opinion/trump-tax-increase.html . 5 2.9. While the Labour Party’s 2017 election manifesto and accompanying documentation referred to a target of holding Core Crown expenses around the 30% of GDP level, they contained no matching target for tax revenue. Whether or not Core Crown expenses are successfully held down to 30% of GDP, there will remain a strong case for raising a higher level of tax revenue to assist in funding capital investments and the non-Core component of expenditure. 2.10. The Terms of Reference explicitly require the Working Group to “consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade”. Insofar as there are foreseeable justifiable calls for increased Government spending in the coming decade, any past relationship between tax revenues and GDP should be set aside in a forward-looking analysis. 3. Limitations of the Terms of Reference 3.1. The Tax Working Group has been instructed to work within Terms of Reference that contradict the ostensible purpose of the exercise – namely to “improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system”. Of the four areas that have been ruled outside the scope of the Working Party’s review, three (rates of income tax and GST, the tax treatment of inheritance, and the interface between the personal tax system with the benefit system) are inescapably central issues for fairness, structure and balance. 3.2. We submit that it will not be possible in practice for the Working Party to turn its back on those three areas that have been excluded from the Terms of Reference. The Working Party should exercise to the full the latitude granted in the terms of Reference to recommend further reviews. In doing so, the Working Party should carry its analysis far enough to make clear the ways in which all three would “benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations”, given that those recommendations themselves will be constrained from addressing these central issues. 3.3. We are aware that prior to the General Election of 2017 the Labour Party undertook to introduce no new taxes, and specifically no capital gains tax nor increases in personal income tax, during the current term. 2 The ten-year horizon specified for the Tax Working Party’s analysis, however, runs well beyond the current electoral cycle, and the Group’s recommendations, including recommendations for further reviews, should accordingly look beyond any short-run constraints the current Government may have imposed on itself. 3.4. The 2017 Labour Manifesto 3 stated that “the tax system should be progressive, with those who are more able to pay tax contributing a greater share, and it should be fair and balanced across income, consumption and wealth to pay for the needs of our society.” The NZCTU is in agreement with these principles, but notes that trends in the New Zealand tax system over recent decades have been in the opposite direction. 2 Labour’s 2017 Election Platform: Labour’s tax plan at http://www.labour.org.nz/tax accessed 7 April 2018. 3 “Labour’s tax plan” at http://www.labour.org.nz/tax accessed 7 April 2018. 6 3.5. It is therefore to be regretted that the Terms of Reference for the current review have downgraded the principle of progressivity while emphasising the narrow allocative-efficiency considerations that have dominated tax policy since the 1980s. The functions to be performed by the tax system go far beyond merely collecting revenue in the most “efficient” fashion, and there is a need to give much greater weight to fairness. 4. Gender and iwi issues 4.1. A disappointing feature of the Background Paper is the absence of any reference to women or gender. Women make heavy use of government services, and have earnings and savings profiles over their lifetimes that differ significantly from those of men. Consequently, policies such as tax incentives for savings will disproportionately favour men. At the same time, because of lower incomes and savings during their working years, women are more reliant than men on National Superannuation in retirement. They are also heavier users of public services and of the transfer system generally. Therefore tax cuts doubly disfavour women: they have lower incomes and so in general receive smaller tax reductions, and they suffer when public services deteriorate as the result of insufficient revenue. Tax policy is not necessarily gender neutral in its incidence. 4.2. In making recommendations on changes to the tax system, therefore, the Working Group should take explicit account of differential impacts on men and women. 4.3. Gender budgeting provides a way of analysing government expenditure and fiscal policy to promote gender equality and to provide a gender perspective on fiscal policy and fiscal decisions. The concept and practice of gender budgeting is now gaining the support of the OECD, the United Nations, the ILO, and the IMF as a way to promote and address gender equality issues. It is also gaining attention in New Zealand. In 2017 the National Council of Women (NCW) identified the lack of any national plan with targets for the advancement of women, including gender budgeting. 4.4. A recently published Treasury paper by Suzy Morissey 4 examined the 2016 Tax Expenditure statement and found a number of specific initiatives that could have a negative impact on gender equality. It concluded that gender budgeting had the potential to provide greater transparency and analysis of expenditure on tax concessions. 4.5. Possible government actions identified in paper include: • Mainstream gender analysis of proposed expenditure to determine its gender impact. • Include gender responsive documentation in the Budget documents, such has recently been introduced in Canada. 4 Suzy Morissey (2018). Gender Budgeting: A Useful Approach for Aotearoa New Zealand, New Zealand Treasury Working Paper 18/02. Available at https://treasury.govt.nz/publications/wp/wp-18-02 7 4.6. The section in the Background Paper on ‘Te Ao Māori’ is welcome, but devotes only two short paragraphs to inequality issues affecting Māori. This is an improvement on the Terms of Reference, which make no mention of Māori, and we hope that Māori issues will receive careful attention. 4.7. An important point to bear in mind is that a more progressive tax system will inherently tend to improve the position of women and Māori. 5. Progressivity and top income tax rates 5.1. Tax rates on high incomes have been reduced in New Zealand to levels that virtually eliminate the principle of progressivity. As noted above, while the Terms of Reference for the TWG review prevent the making of firm recommendations on income tax rates, those same Terms of Reference allow the Group to recommend further reviews, and we urge that this opportunity be fully utilised. 5.2. The loss of progressivity in the tax system and the increasing role of the inherently regressive GST have contributed powerfully to the rise in inequality of income and wealth that now presents a key policy challenge. Changes to the tax system – possibly radical ones – will be required in the coming decade to reverse disequalising trends across the economy. 5.3. Important first steps to restore progressivity would be to lower the rate of GST and bring in taxes on wealth. 5.4. The balance between income and wealth in the tax base has shifted massively in favour of wealth as very large personal fortunes have accumulated in a low-tax environment. There is an urgent need to bring tax mechanisms to bear on the holding and transferring of large personal wealth, and on the accrual of unearned capital gains. 5.5. More should be done to raise the progressivity of personal income taxes by increasing rates on the top portions of high incomes and lowering those for low incomes 5.6. The NZCTU’s Alternative Economic Strategy 5 has suggested that there should be a tax-free income band at the bottom of the scale for those on incomes under $35,000 p.a. Besides the fairness arguments for this, it would provide an important step toward reducing the high marginal tax rates currently faced by people moving off benefits into work. 5.7. A 38 percent tax rate could then apply on income between two and three times the average wage. (Average weekly earnings (ordinary plus overtime) were $1,027 in the December quarter 2017 6 , roughly $53,000 per year. The 38% rate would therefore apply on incomes over $106,000 and would be adjustable as the average wage rose.) . 5 https://www.union.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/NZCTU-Alternative-Economic- Strategy.pdf 6 Statistics New Zealand, Infoshare table QEX008AA. 8 5.8. On incomes more than three times the average wage (that is, over $160,000 p.a.) a 45 percent tax rate could apply 5.9. The frequently-heard claim that high top tax rates are a check on economic growth, and that therefore tax cuts for high income earners are a way to trigger higher economic growth, is not supported by solid evidence. Piketty, Saez and Stantcheva 7 used cross-country data to compare changes in the top marginal tax rate with growth of per capita GDP over the period from 1975-9 to 2006-10. They found that “the correlation is virtually zero and insignificant suggesting that cuts in top tax rates do not lead to higher economic growth”. 8 Their scatter plot for GDP growth adjusted for initial income levels is reproduced below. 5.10. The same study gathered cross-country evidence to show how low tax rates on top incomes contribute powerfully to income inequality of both post-tax and pre-tax income. 9 Post-tax income inequality obviously is reduced by high top rates and worsened by low ones. But in addition, there is a clear empirical link between top tax rates and inequality of pre-tax income. Two mechanisms explain this. First, low top tax rates increase the incentive for CEOs and other top management to bargain hard for the pay increases that have driven CEO 7 Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva, “Optimal Taxation of Top Labor Incomes: A Tale of Three Elasticities” American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 6(1): 230-271, February 2014. 8 Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefan Stantcheva, Taxing the 1%: why the top tax rate could be over 80%, 8 December 2011, https://voxeu.org/article/taxing-1-why-top-tax-rate- could-be-over-80 page 4. 9 These results are summarised in Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel. Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, World inequality report 2018, World Inequality Lab 2017, http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-summary-english.pdf , pages 257-260. 9 compensation to absurd heights, unrelated to their productivity, in recent decades. Second, high top tax rates limit the amount of money received by top income earners and thereby slow down their rate of wealth accumulation, reducing inequality of pre-tax income in subsequent years. 10 5.11. Two observations in the Piketty-Saez-Stantcheva study are especially striking. First, they point out that in their data set, “no country experiences a significant increase in top income shares without large top rate tax cuts” (page 254). Their chart showing this, using data from 1960-64 to 2005-09, is reproduced below : 5.12. Secondly, “a striking feature of the evidence is that, in all countries that experience both a large top tax rate cut and a large increase in top income shares, the surge in top incomes tends to follow the top tax rate cuts” (page 256). In other words, the tax cuts led to the rise in inequality, not vice versa. 5.13. The growth effects of cuts in personal taxes have been overstated in much recent policy discourse in New Zealand as elsewhere. As Gale and Samwick warn 11 , While there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices, it is by no means obvious, on an ex ante basis, that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run. ... 10 For discussion of these effects see Thomas Piketty, Emmanuel Saez and Stefanie Stantcheva, “Optimal Taxation of Top Labor Incomes: A Tale of Three Elasticities” American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 6(1): 230-271, February 2014. 11 William G. Gale and Andrew A. Samwick, Effects of income tax changes on economic growth, Brookings Institution, February 2016 p.2 and p.27. 10 The argument that income tax cuts raise growth is repeated so often that it is sometimes taken as gospel. However, theory, evidence, and simulation studies tell a different and more complicated story. Tax cuts offer the potential to raise economic growth by improving incentives to work, save, and invest. But they also create income effects that reduce the need to engage in productive economic activity, and they may subsidize old capital, which provides windfall gains to asset holders that undermine incentives for new activity. In addition, tax cuts as a stand-alone policy (that is, not accompanied by spending cuts) will typically raise the \[government\] budget deficit. The increase in the deficit will reduce national saving -- and with it, the capital stock ... and future national income -- and raise interest rates, which will negatively affect investment. The net effect of the tax cuts on growth is thus theoretically uncertain and depends on both the structure of the tax cut itself and the timing and structure of its financing. 5.14. Recent micro-level research in Australia has thrown up the intriguing finding that firms with lower effective tax rates create fewer jobs than those facing higher rates. 12 This again cautions against accepting facile a priori arguments about the relationship of tax rates to economic growth. 5.15. Progressive taxes are not the sole instrument for reducing inequality, and should be promoted together with other policies that could reduce the inequality of pre-tax income and thereby lessen the pressure on Government spending when tackling child poverty and low wages. While arguing strongly the case for a more progressive tax system, the NZCTU gives equal emphasis to policies that improve the bargaining power of labour, raise the minimum wage, and force the passing-through of productivity gains to wages and salaries. 6. Interface with the benefit system 6.1. The NZCTU strongly agrees with the comment in the Background Paper (page 20) that “it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes in isolation”. It is therefore unfortunate that income support through transfers lies outside the Tax Working Group’s terms of reference. 6.2. Taxes impact on benefits and tax credits (and vice-versa). The highest effective marginal tax rates are currently on middle income families receiving Working for Families tax credits. 6.3. The Tax Working Group should investigate improvements to the welfare system that can be achieved through the tax system, including at least partially replacing Working for Families with a tax free threshold on personal income, as in Australia. 6.4. The tax/benefit system is not a substitute for the wage system and should not be used as a means of sustaining a low-wage economy. 12 Andrew Leigh, “Do firms that pay less company tax create more jobs?”, Economic Anaysis and Policy 59 (2018):25-28. 11 7. Reducing the rate of GST 7.1. While undeniably efficient as a revenue-raising instrument, GST is strongly regressive in its impact on lower-income groups in the community. The NZCTU considers that the GST rate should be reduced immediately to 12.5 percent and GST should be progressively replaced with other forms of taxation including income taxes on high incomes, asset taxes, an international Financial Transaction Tax, the FAT tax explained below, and taxes or increased royalties on commercial use of resources. 7.2. Regarding the suggestion on page 50 of the Background Paper that GST might be removed from some goods and services, this is superficially attractive but would raise difficult administrative issues at the boundaries of the exemptions, and would probably be less effective in providing relief to low- income households than a reduction in the general GST rate. 8. Tax avoidance by multinationals 8.1. The loss of revenue from tax avoidance and evasion has a direct impact on our members by reducing the revenue available to fund public services which we value, and by loading higher taxes than otherwise necessary on working people. 8.2. Preventing corporate tax evasion or avoidance encourages business responsibility. It ensures that responsible companies and investors are not undercut by the irresponsible behaviour of others. 8.3. Aggressive tax avoidance and evasion by international investors and multinational corporations is best combatted by international cooperation, and so we welcome the work being done in the OECD on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting.. It is important that New Zealand acts promptly to take advantage of any agreements emerging from that work programme, both to protect our own revenue and to support other countries that are acting or considering acting to do the same. We would not like to see New Zealand lagging in these important matters. 8.4. That does not mean that New Zealand should not act unilaterally (or in concert with Australia or a small number of like-minded countries) when it is able to do so. We recognise that some matters will not find international agreement or will take many years to find agreement. That should not stop New Zealand from taking what action it can. 8.5. New Zealand should not be swayed by threats of disinvestment by multinational companies. If investors’ presence in New Zealand depends on tax avoidance then it is questionable what value they add to New Zealand and whether their character should be welcomed, let alone encouraged by weak tax laws. 8.6. Diverted Profits Tax should be on the agenda. They are a penal rate of tax aimed to provide an incentive on multinationals to pay the right tax under the standard rules, and have been implemented in Australia and the U.K. 12 8.7. The avoidance of tax by multinational internet-based corporations such as Google and Facebook puts local carriers of advertising such as newspapers and broadcast television and radio at a competitive disadvantage. The business model of conventional news media is already severely weakened by changes in technology working through the internet and other forms of digital media and communications. The advertising revenue on which the conventional media depend is undermined by these new technologies and forms of business, which they are struggling to respond to. It makes it even more difficult if their competition can lower their costs by avoiding paying tax on their activities. 8.8. This is a matter of public interest: the conventional media are still the principal originators of the content on which we largely depend for reliable news, and particularly for news about New Zealand. The steady loss of capacity through lay-offs of journalists and other media staff is creating a major failure in the news media market. 8.9. There is therefore a strong public interest case to ensure that provision of advertising services and platforms is tax neutral. Tax avoidance by Google, Facebook and others which have significant activity in New Zealand but do not have a tax presence in New Zealand is a growing issue that will affect more than just the media industry. We urge action to address this. 8.10. We are aware that some other countries including France, Hungary, India, Israel and Italy are taking various types of action. 13 We also understand that the field of possible options is limited on the one hand by double taxation treaties and on the other by rules in the WTO and other trade and investment treaties such as the ‘Comprehensive and Progressive Transpacific Partnership’ (CPTPP) 14 . 8.11. We submit that the Tax Working Group should provide clear advice on these limitations and on the position New Zealand should take in negotiations of international treaties and agreements to protect New Zealand’s options in taxing activities such as those above. While it is difficult to anticipate what other organisational and technological forms will present challenges to the taxation system in the future, it is important that New Zealand maintain as wide as possible options to address them, unilaterally if necessary. 8.12. In particular we note that Article 10.6 of the CPTPP states that in relation to local presence, “No Party shall require a service supplier of another Party to establish or maintain a representative office or any form of enterprise, or to be resident, in its territory as a condition for the cross-border supply of a service.” The Tax Working Group should seek reassurance that this and other provisions of the CPTPP will not create any difficulties in deeming or requiring tax presence or permanent establishment by multinationals. 8.13. Inland Revenue have informed us that “the CPTPP should not limit New Zealand’s taxation options for these entities \[without physical presence\], 13 See Chapter 4 of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. (2018). Tax Challenges Arising from Digitalisation – Interim Report 2018 Inclusive Framework on BEPS. Paris: OECD Publishing. Retrieved from http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264293083-en. 14 See section 6.3.1 ibid. 13 except to the extent we wanted to tax them more harshly than New Zealand residents”. Given that the form of tax used may have to be different from a conventional income tax (e.g. a revenue tax), it will be difficult to be sure that in some circumstances the tax will not be more harsh – despite being more lenient in other circumstances – than the tax on New Zealand residents. New Zealand could therefore be accused of actions contrary to the provisions of the CPTPP despite there being no intention to be more harsh overall. 9. Broadening the GST tax base: financial services 9.1. The NZCTU submits that financial services ought not to be exempted from tax on their value-added. If they continue to be excluded from the GST system, a Financial Activity Tax (FAT) ought to apply as an alternative means of taxing value added in this sector. 9.2. A FAT levied on the sum of the profits and remuneration of financial institutions would effectively be a tax on the sector’s value added, and thus could fill the gap in the GST tax base. 9.3. We note the comment on page 6 of the Background Paper that the exemption from GST of financial services “reflect\[s\] past administrative judgments that it would be too administratively complex to include financial services”. 9.4. In the course of the debates that led to the 1985 decision to exempt financial services from New Zealand’s GST, a crucial problem was perceived to be that the credit-invoice arrangement through which GST was implemented was unsuited to financial services because of the difficulty of excluding pure interest (the time value of money) 15 . Consequently, a different approach would have to be used for financial services. After considering various options the Government of the day concluded that “no ideal solution existed because of the compliance and measurement difficulties associated with each of the options proposed” 16 . 9.5. Among the options considered but rejected in 1985 was one that would have taxed financial services on “the sum of salary and wages, other labour expenses, rates, levies (and other indirect taxes) and the net operating surplus, less depreciation incurred. This method correctly measures the tax base, but does not directly identify the tax charged on supplies.” 17 9.6. There thus exists a way to target the GST tax base – value added – for financial services by taxing the sector’s profits and remuneration, but that approach would have to be implemented by a separate tax rather than 15 White Paper on Goods and Services Tax: Proposals for the Administration of the Goods and Services Tax; New Zealand government, March 1985. For a summary of the debate and its outcome see GST and Financial Services: a Government Discussion Document Inland Revenue Department, October 2002, https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/2002-dd- gst-financial-services.doc, Chapters 2 and 3. The point is repeated on page 30 of the TWG Background Paper. 16 GST and Financial Services Page 10. 17 GST and Financial Services page 9. 14 through GST’s credit-invoice method. Such a tax on financial sector value added is now referred to internationally as a Financial Activities Tax (FAT). 9.7. A detailed 2010 IMF report on financial sector taxation noted that 18 For technical reasons, financial services are commonly VAT-exempt—which means that, purely for tax reasons, the financial sector may be under-taxed and hence perhaps ‘too big’. Taxing value-added in the financial sector directly would mitigate this . 9.8. The IMF staff considered two possible means of taxing the financial sector: a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT, often called ‘Tobin tax’) and a Financial Activities Tax (FAT). They identified a number of reasons why a FAT would be a better instrument than a FTT insofar as the objective is to tax value added. 9.9. The IMF study then outlined two possible forms of FAT 19 . If the tax were to be levied on all remuneration and profits, it would approximate a value-added tax. Alternatively, if levied only on the rent component of profits and remuneration (that is, on all returns above a normal return to capital and the reservation price of labour) it would be akin to a direct tax targeting excess returns. 9.10. In the present context of widening the GST net, the relevant option is the first of these. However, before recommending a FAT on finance, the Working Group should revisit the question of whether the existing GST system can be at least partially extended to financial services. 9.11. Several other countries have now applied GST to various financial services in relation to activities where invoiced services are supplied. India, for example, in 2017 imposed its new GST regime on banks, insurance and other financial institutions, replacing an earlier financial transactions tax. 20 Malaysia brought in GST on some financial services (not including loan interest) in 2015. 21 The argument that taxing financial services is “too hard” has worn thin. 9.12. If indeed it is possible to extend the GST credit-invoice arrangement to some financial services, then if a FAT is applied in New Zealand to the sector’s value added as measured by each firm’s wages and profits, any GST paid could be made deductible against the FAT. 18 IMF Staff, “A fair and substantial contribution by the financial sector”, Chapter 1 in Stijn Claessens, Michael Keen, and Ceyla Pazarbasic (eds), Financial Sector Taxation: the IMF’s Report to the G-20 and Background Material, September 2010, https://www.imf.org/external/np/seminars/eng/2010/paris/pdf/090110.pdf , page 20 19 For detail see pages 20-21, and Appendix 6 “The Financial Activities Tax: design issues and revenue potential”, in Ibid.

We submit that the Tax Working Group should recommend the adoption of a Financial Activities Tax to correct for the current under-taxation of financial services due to their exclusion from GST. 10. Financial Transactions Tax 10.1. While the FAT is preferable to the FTT for the purpose of domestic revenue raising and to correct for the distortions arising from the GST-exempt status of financial services, a strong case remains for imposing a Financial Transactions Tax (Tobin tax) on international financial flows, for the purpose of restraining toxic hot money movements and stabilising the exchange rate. 22 10.2. An FTT ought to be on the Working Party’s agenda as an important tool of macroeconomic policy, whether implemented as a permanent levy on cross- border flows or held in reserve to be used at times of international financial turmoil. 10.3. The most common argument made against an FTT is that it is indiscriminate and so penalises “good” as well as “bad” transactions 23 . Examples of “good” cross-border transactions are offshore purchases by New Zealand households, payment for overseas travel, and Government debt transactions. However, the appropriate rate for an FTT on cross-border flows would be very low and would make only a relatively minor difference in the cost of many of these items. 10.4. The thorough review of FTT by Burman et al notes that while an FTT is a second-best response to financial-market imperfections, “it would deter some forms of inefficient rent seeking by making many high-frequency trading strategies unprofitable”. 24 10.5. The rate for an FTT on cross-border flows in and out of New Zealand would be a fraction of one percent of the value of each transaction, and the motivation would be not revenue but economic stabilisation, by deterring speculative hot-money transactions 10.6. Simplicity dictates that an FTT be levied on all transactions, rather than attempting to ring-fence out “good” transactions such as those involving Government debt. Exempting any class of transactions provides an incentive for avoidance activity that attempts to reclassify other transactions into the exempt category. 22 Tobin, James, 1978. “A Proposal for International Monetary Reform.” Eastern Economic Journal 4 (3–4), 153–159. 23 See e.g. Geoff Simmons, “Is a Financial Transactions Tax a silver bullet?”, National Business Review 12 August 2016. 24 Leonard E.

Broadening the income tax base: capital gains and wealth transfers 11.1. As the Background Paper notes (page 5) the current review is “an opportunity to explore whether there is a case to broaden the \[tax\] base further”. One obvious gap in the income tax base at present is that capital gains and wealth transfers (such as gifts and inheritances) are not treated as income. 11.2. The economic definition of income was laid out as follows by J.R. Hicks in his Value and Capital (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1939, Chapter 14 pages 172 and 179): The purpose of income calculations in practical affairs is to give people an indication of the amount which they can consume without impoverishing themselves. Following out this idea, it would seem that we ought to define a man’s income as the maximum value which he can consume during a week, and still expect to be as well off at the end of the week as he was at the beginning. ... The capital value of the individual’s property at the beginning of the week is an assessable figure; so is the capital value of his property at the end of the week; thus, if we assume that we can measure his consumption, his income ex post can be directly calculated. 11.3. Income therefore includes windfall gains in the value of assets held by the individual. It is a striking anomaly in New Zealand’s system of taxes and transfers that whereas this principle is vigorously pursued in relation to (relatively poor) beneficiaries, it is set aside in the tax treatment of capital gains and wealth transfers accruing to the rich. Capital gains 11.4. Introduction of a capital gains tax is well overdue in New Zealand. As the Background Paper notes on page 48, the absence of a capital gains tax favours investment by the rich in assets such as shares, land, and rental properties. The NZCTU supports removal of this anomaly, provided that the family home remains exempt. 11.5. Applying the Hicksian definition of income set out above, the best way to bring it in is to treat capital gains as income and tax them accordingly, rather than to introduce an entirely separate tax. 11.6. This raises a tricky transition issue in relation to allowing deductibility of capital losses. At the date when a capital gains tax is introduced, firms and individuals will have on their books a wide array of assets whose current valuations are far in excess of their historic cost, representing capital gains which have not been taxed. Downward revaluation of those assets subsequent to the start of CGT ought not to be deductible. 17 11.7. Comment on a range of issues has been invited in Appendix 2 of the Working Paper. Responses to some of these are as follows: • Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? In line with the income definition above, the income tax base would be broadened to include capital gains, so that no separate CGT would be necessary. • Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised? In the long run, as discussed below in relation to wealth taxation, New Zealand will ideally have created a comprehensive register of wealth holdings valued at current market values. This would make possible the imposition of CGT on accrued capital gains, but would leave several problems with the accrual approach. For one thing, accrued capital gains do not translate to cash in the hand with which to pay tax obligations. For another, the accrual approach would make more difficult the issue of taking account of short-run gains and losses of value over the period an asset is held. The realisation approach is therefore a better way to bring in taxation of capital gains. • What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Assets such as rental properties, shares, collectibles, and cars all fall within the ambit of a CGT in principle, but avoidance of undue complexity in the tax affairs of ordinary households points to a de minimis rule. • Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? Consistency with the inclusion of capital gains along with other forms of income seems to require that capital gains on pension-fund assets should be taxed, as is currently the case with the capital income received by those funds. • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? In principle, the realisation approach ought to apply to assets held offshore. In practice there are obvious difficulties, given that the funds from realisation will not always be returned to New Zealand and will be extremely hard to trace in the face of foreseeable avoidance behaviour. If however they are not taxed, there is an incentive to “hide” wealth and capital gains offshore. We therefore support the inclusion of offshore assets. • When should non-residents be subject to tax? Whenever they realise a capital gain on assets held in New Zealand. • Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? We agree with the Background Paper that “if capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced”, notwithstanding that on the face of it this is a departure from the Hicksian income definition discussed above. Wealth transfers: gifts and inheritance 11.8. In the past, wealth transfers used to be taxed by specific taxes such as estate duty and gift duty which were charged to the donor (or the donor’s estate), giving rise to perceptions of unfairness. These taxes have been abolished in 18 New Zealand and there is no intention of reviving them (as witnessed by the explicit exclusion of “inheritance tax” from the TWG’s Terms of Reference). 11.9. However, the fact remains that wealth transfers are clearly income in the hands of the recipient and ought to be included in any proper accounting of the recipient’s income for tax purposes 25 . 11.10. Clearly there would need to be carefully-designed limits to the levels at which gifts are taxed. If a tax-free threshold on the value of gifts is established, then this would remove the problem of small gifts being liable for tax, while at the same time removing a major inequity and inconsistency of treatment in the current benefit system (which abates benefits when gifts are received). 12. Wealth taxes 12.1. A common argument against wealth taxes is that taxing “capital” deters savings and hence capital accumulation. However, in their work for the Mirrlees tax review in the UK, Banks and Diamond 26 critically dissected the conventional argument and concluded that capital income should be taxed, opening the way to taxes on wealth. 12.2. The publication in 2014 of Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the twenty-first century, which recommended a wealth tax as a means of checking the concentration of income and wealth at the top of the distribution, has resulted in a revival of debate about the practicalities of wealth taxes, after a period in which many OECD countries phased them out. 12.3. A wealth tax designed primarily to put a brake on extreme inequality would apply to the top few percentiles of the population and so would not affect the vast bulk of the population. It would include property wealth, but should exclude the family home. 12.4. Denmark until 1997 imposed a flat-rate wealth tax on portfolios above an exemption threshold set above the 97 th percentile 27 . The rate was 2.2% until 1989, then 1% until the tax was abolished in 1999. The evidence suggests that this tax was effective in limiting the top-1% wealth share in Denmark. 25 See Jennifer Bird-Pollan, “Unseating privilege: Rawls, equality of opportunity and wealth transfer taxation” 59 Wayne Law Review 713 (2013); Henry J Aaron and Aliocia H. Munnell “Reassessing the role for wealth transfer taxes National Tax Journal 45(2): 119-143, June 1992; Dean Machin If you ewant a fair inheritance tax, make it a tax on income, https://theconversation.com/if-you-want-a-fair-inheritance-tax-make-it -a-tax-on-income-33654 . 26 James Banks and Peter Diamond, The Base for Direct Taxation, London: Institute for Fiscal Studies, 2008, 27 Katrine Jakobsen, Kristian Jakobsen, Henrik Kleven and Gabriel Zucman, Wealth taxation and wealth accumulation: theory and evidence from Denmark, NBER Working Paper 24371, March 2018, p.10. 19 12.5. To administer the tax, the Danish authorities built, and still maintain, a register of individual wealth holdings, described as follows by Jakobsen et al 28 : The wealth registry includes detailed information on end-of-year financial assets, non-financial assets, and debts. As a rule, these assets are recorded in the registry at their prevailing market prices. Most of these assets and liabilities are reported by third-parties to the Danish government, which makes the data very reliable. For instance, the value of bank deposits is reported by banks; the value of listed stocks and bonds is reported by the financial institutions (banks, mutual funds, and insurance companies) who hold these securities on behalf of their clients; and the value of mortgages is reported by mortgage lenders (banks or specialized mortgage institutions). Non-financial assets are recorded using land and real estate registries. Moreover, before the wealth tax was abolished in 1997, all assets other than those reported by third parties had to be self- reported by households. This included cash, large durables (such as cars, boats, and private planes), non-corporate business assets, unlisted securities (i.e., bearer bonds, unlisted equities, and shares of housing cooperatives), assets held abroad (foreign real estate and foreign bank accounts), and inter- personal debts. The Danish wealth data are considered of a very high quality, 12.6. In Sweden, from 1910 until 2007 a wealth tax at the rate of 1.5% applied to a broader segment of the population than was the case in Denmark: eight percent in 2000, falling to three percent in 2007. 29 The Swedish register seems to have been more open to manipulation than the Danish one; Seim finds evidence of widespread avoidance and evasion. He nevertheless concludes from his analysis of behavioural effects that 30 The small behavioral effects and lack of real responses to the wealth tax that I find imply that wealth taxation may be an efficient redistributional tool. A comparison to income taxation ... suggests that wealth taxation can be a more efficient way to redistribute resources compared to income taxation if the behavioural responses to wealth taxes are smaller than those of income taxes. This is true in the paper at hand because wealth taxpayers tend to locate in the upper end of the income distribution, where taxable income elasticities are largest. Such a suggestive normative exercise, comparing the welfare effects of wealth taxes to those of progressive income taxes, suggests that the social surplus is 24 percent higher when redistribution is accomplished by wealth taxation. 12.7. Switzerland has the most wide-ranging wealth tax which is targeted at revenue-raising, though Brülhart et al 31 find that the tax rate is well below the revenue-maximising level. 12.8. Clearly in order to implement a wealth tax, an important pre-requisite is adequate information in the form of a register of wealth holdings of individuals such as the Danish one 32 . Development of a similar wealth register in New 28 Jakobsen et al p.6. 29 David Seim, “ Behavioral Responses to Wealth Taxes: Evidence from Sweden”, American Economic Journal: Economic Policy 2017, 9(4): 395–421. 30 Seim 2017 p.419. 31 Marius Brülhart, Jonathan Gruber, Matthias Krapf and Kurt Schmidheiny, Taxing Wealth: Evidence From Switzerland NBER Working Paper 22376, June 2016. 32 Ellen R. McGrattani Taxing Wealth, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Economic Policy Paper 15-4, March 2015, argues strongly that it would be premature to introduce wealth tax in the USA given the lack of the necessary consistent database. 20 Zealand should be a priority, not merely to enable introduction of a wealth tax if this option were to be pursued, but also to provide valuable information on key variables such as savings rates across the wealth distribution. We submit that the Working Group should recommend a study of the Danish register with a view to adoption of a matching system in New Zealand. 12.9. A New Zealand tax targeted at the goal of curbing inequality could appropriately be targeted at the top percentile (or possibly top 5%) of the wealth distribution, should include property wealth, but should exempt the family home (which in any case is usually only a small fraction of top- percentile wealth). 12.10. The issue of whether a wealth tax applying to the top percentiles would have significant effects on aggregate economy-wide saving and investment behaviour clearly requires consideration. Behavioural response to wealth taxation is currently the subject of a rapidly-growing international literature. For the most part this literature has addressed the question of the tax elasticity of wealth holdings within a target group. The issue of how changes in top-percentile savings behaviour and wealth holdings affects the economy- wide savings rate remains open and is probably best tackled by looking at cross-country empirical evidence of the relationship between taxes and long- run growth performance. There appears to be no compelling evidence that either wealth taxes or high top marginal rates have held back economic growth over the past century, but the Working Group will no doubt wish to review the literature for itself. 13. Land tax 13.1. A land tax was canvassed by the 2010 Tax Working Group 33 and is among the options mentioned in the TWG Background Paper. 13.2. In the event of a comprehensive wealth tax being introduced, land would be included as one form of wealth – probably the easiest to tax, given its inelastic supply and the existence of a set of valuations. 13.3. However, if a wealth tax is confined to the top percentiles of the distribution, there is a case for implementing a land tax more broadly, for revenue purposes. 13.4. If such a land tax is contemplated, it should exclude land under the family home and should have a value-per-hectare threshold below which no land tax is payable, to shield low-income groups, iwi and other parties holding extensive areas of low-productivity land. 33 A Tax System for New Zealand’s Future: Report of the Victoria University of Wellington Tax Working Group, January 2010, pp.50-51. Also Andrew Coleman and Arthur Grimes, Fiscal, Distributional and Efficiency Impacts of Land and Property Taxes, http://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/cagtr/twg/Publications/3-impacts-land-property-taxes- coleman\_grimes.pdf. 21 14. Company tax 14.1. The company tax rate should be returned to 30%. Comparisons with rates in other countries that do not take account of imputation (as in the left-hand column of page 28, and Figure 8 on page 29 in the Background Paper) give a false impression. As the Background Paper goes on to state, “when factoring in imputation, New Zealand’s tax rate on domestic shareholders is the sixth lowest in the OECD”. Loose comparisons with other countries, and the restriction imposed by the Terms of Reference, should not deter the Working Group from at least recommending further review aimed at an increase in the New Zealand rate. 14.2. We note that the Terms of Reference direct the TWG to consider “whether a progressive company tax rate (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment”. Faced with the Terms of Reference prohibition on increasing any income tax rate, the Background Paper on page 49 has looked only at the option of a lower rate for small companies. 14.3. Applying different tax rates to companies in the basis simply of size or ownership opens up difficult avoidance issues, as the Background Paper notes on page 49. 14.4. There is an argument for making the company tax system progressive in a different sense: by taxing profits up to the risk-free rate of return (or some similar measure of the user cost of capital) and applying a higher rate to profits over this threshold. Insofar as it is possible to identify “rents” (pure profit) these should be targeted for higher tax rates (see discussion of excess profits in section 13). 14.5. Tax deductibility of interest on related party borrowing opens the way to avoidance of tax and should be ended. 14.6. The taxation of excess profits resulting from market dominance deserves the Working Party’s attention and is discussed in section 13. 15. Tax on excess profits 15.1. While the case outlined in section 7 above for the introduction of a Financial Activities Tax to fix the gap in GST resulting from the exemption of financial services was specific to that sector, it is of interest that the IMF’s 2010 report included a more generally applicable model for taxing excess profits. The IMF’s “FAT2” model, under the heading “taxing rents on capital and labour”, noted the wide discrepancy between remuneration and profits in the financial 22 sector on the one hand relative to those paid in other sectors of the economy, and suggested that the gap could be treated as excess returns 34 . 15.2. Keen et al pointed out that 35 Taxing rents is an economically efficient way to collect revenue. In a closed economy, a tax on pure rents (i.e. income in excess of normal returns) is non-distortionary because economic agents have no incentive to change their behavior in response to the tax: to maximize their aftertax earnings they will take the same decisions as needed to maximize their before tax earnings. The same would apply in an open economy when the source of rents is specific to a particular location. When rents are not tied to particular locations, a similar result will still broadly apply if there is some degree of international coordination (e.g. on tax bases and minimum tax rates), and/or the tax is levied at sufficiently low rates so as not to significantly alter incentives for location. 15.3. Those comments apply not simply to the financial sector, but across the economy as a whole. Comparing financial-sector earnings and profits to those in the rest of the economy, as the IMF authors did, will provide an underestimate of financial-sector rents insofar as excess profits are prevalent in other sectors as well. 15.4. There has been growing international concern over the rapid increase in inequality of incomes and wealth in the advanced economies, mirrored in the falling labour share of national income and rising profit share. Recent analyses have focussed on the evidence that these trends are the product of an underlying rise in the exercise of market power by the owners of capital. 15.5. Simcha Barkhai found that in the USA, the shares of both labour and capital have been falling (if the latter is defined as the value of the capital stock multiplied by its required rate of return) while pure profits have been rising 36 due to a rise in markups (proxied by industry concentration). 15.6. De Loecker and Eeckhout 37 measured markups directly for all publicly traded firms across all sectors of the US economy over the period 1950-2014, using a well established methodology 38 . They found average markups to have risen from 18% in 1980 to 67% in 2014, and demonstrated that the increase was closely reflected in the trend of dividends (a measure of profit). They show that the rise in markups has given rise to a decrease of both the labour share, and the capital share (when this is understood as the normal rate of return applied to the capital stock). 34 Keen et al 2010 pages 131-134. 35 Keen et al 2010 page 133. 36 Simcha Barkhai, Declining labor and capital shares, University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New Working Papers Series No 2, November 2016. 37 Jan De Loecker and Jan Eeckhout, The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications, CEPR Discussion paper 12221, 2017. 38 R. Hall, “The Relation between Price and Marginal Cost in U.S. Industry”, Journal of Political Economy, 96(5), 921–947, 1988. 23 15.7. Eggertson et al 39 have recently argued that in the USA, “an increase in the financial wealth to output ratio,... an increase in measured Tobin’s Q, and a divergence between the marginal and the average return on capital ... can be explained by an increase in market power and pure profits in the US economy, i.e. the emergence of a non-zero-rent economy”. The combination of increasing market power and falling interest rates has shifted a rising share of the economy’s total output into the hands of a rentier class. 15.8. The same trends as those discussed in the overseas literature have been evident in New Zealand 40 , which means that the option of introducing a tax on excess profits (rents) is due for consideration. While a wealth tax and/or land tax, as discussed elsewhere in this submission, would make some inroads into profits and rent in general, neither of these would be targeted at particular companies’ excess profits. 15.9. We recommend that the Tax Working Group initiate a programme of research into the design of an excess profits tax in the New Zealand setting. 16. Tax avoidance 16.1. The first essential requirement in addressing avoidance is to ensure that IRD is adequately resourced to police the tax system effectively, track down evasion, and ensure that everyone pays their fair share. 16.2. There is a need to ensure that Trusts other than registered Charitable Trusts cannot be used for tax avoidance. 16.3. Income taxation of closely held companies needs review to make it difficult to use them for tax avoidance. A capital gains tax would assist in this by removing the ability to avoid tax on company income by leaving it within the company and realising it by sale of the company (perhaps to a related entity) at a raised value. 16.4. Victoria University academic, Lisa Marriott has pointed out starkly different approaches to tax and benefit “cheats” with the latter being treated much more harshly for much smaller sums. 41 Processes should be reviewed to ensure this apparent double standard does not continue. 39 Gauti Eggertsson, Jacob A. Robbins and Ella Getz Wold, Kaldor and Piketty’s facts:The rise of monopoly power in the United States Washington Center for Equitable Growth Working Paper Series February 2018 http://equitablegrowth.org/working-papers/kaldor-piketty- monopoly-power/ . 40 Max Rashbrooke (ed) Inequality: a New Zealand Crisis Wellington, Bridget Williams Books, 2013; The Piketty phenomenon: New Zealand perspectives Wellington, Bridget Williams Books 2014; 41 See for example Marriott, L, ‘Unpaid Tax and Overpaid Welfare: A comparison of debt recovery approaches in New Zealand’, New Zealand Journal of Taxation, Law and Policy, (2014), 20(1), pp.46-70. 24 16.5. Tax avoidance in New Zealand is most conspicuous at the top of the income and wealth distribution and in certain sectors whose characteristics favour the maximisation of deductible expenses. 16.6. However there is also the suspicion of widespread evasion by the self- employed through cash jobs and treating the stock and assets of closely held companies as personal property. This reduces respect for the fairness of the tax system and its enforcement. 16.7. Below, we recommend that consideration should be given to publishing tax statistics on all companies in the interests of transparency. This would increase public confidence in the tax system, and better inform debate on tax avoidance and evasion. 17. Pollution taxes 17.1. Polluters should face taxes on their emissions, including greenhouse gas emissions, with the aim of incentivising them to reduce emissions or obliging them to pay the costs of all significant “externalities” (side effects such as pollution and global warming). However this should be done in a way that ensures people on lower incomes do not end up paying an unfair share of the burden. 17.2. We support a price on greenhouse gas emissions so that a clear signal is sent to emitters. However this needs to be strengthened with a major programme to transform the economy. It should include allocation of credits or other forms of protection for firms that are “competitiveness at risk” and facing a price for emissions. This should be monitored to ensure this assistance is not misallocated or too generous, or there is insufficient change of behaviour. 17.3. While pollution taxes are desirable in their own right, they can be regressive, creating a disproportionate burden for lower income people. In those cases, the Tax Working Group should make those effects clear and recommend explicit counteracting measures to ensure that their recommendations do not increase real disposable income or wealth inequality, nor have disproportionate effects on already disadvantaged New Zealanders. That could be achieved by for example reduced taxes of other kinds, or increased income support. 17.4. It is important not to treat pollution taxes in isolation from other policy elements required in order to address externalities effectively without creating unwanted collateral effects. We recognise that a more comprehensive approach than taxes alone is required, including policies that assist people through change to ensure a just transition to a more sustainable society. 25 18. Resource taxes and royalties 18.1. Taxes and royalties are the means to provide a fair return to New Zealanders from the exploitation of natural resources by private enterprise, and to incentivise efficient use of those resources. 18.2. The Background Paper discusses these taxes only in passing on page 41, and they are not mentioned in the Terms of Reference. Nevertheless, the issue of a possible tax on fresh water bottled for export has been prominent in public debate recently, and the wider issue of water taxation is clearly on the policy agenda. 18.3. The level of existing resource levies, taxes and royalties should be reviewed to ensure that they are at similar levels to other countries to ensure New Zealand is not unnecessarily missing out on revenue from the consumption of our (often unrenewable) resources. 19. Need for better tax statistics 19.1. The statistics currently available on tax are not sufficiently detailed or well presented to give members of the public access to high-quality information on the tax system. 19.2. Reflecting this, the Background Paper produced by the Tax Working Group conveys a false impression of progressivity by presenting (in Figure 10) data for tax by decile in terms of the percentage of total tax received, rather than as percentages of the relevant decile’s income. While it is true that the top decile pays 35% of total tax, this outcome is due to its much greater income – not to dramatically greater tax effort. The public consultation process would have been assisted by inclusion of estimates of average tax rates at various income levels. 19.3. The absence from the Background Paper of any calculation of effective ex post average tax rates by decile is a major shortcoming that reflects the inadequacy of publicly-available statistics. 19.4. Reliance on a chart reproduced from Bryan Perry’s 2017 report on household income inequality is an unsatisfactory substitute for genuine research by the TWG staff. What is needed is the total figure for income tax paid by decile, divided by total income for that decile, and hence showing the average tax rate at each income level with and without netting off benefits received. It would be useful also to have estimates of the average incidence of all taxes including GST by decile. The TWG staff should be asked to carry out the necessary research to produce these estimates, or Statistics New Zealand should be asked to produce them. 19.5. Looking ahead it should be the task of some designated Government agency – whether IRD, Treasury, or Statistics New Zealand – to publish timely and 26 detailed tax statistics on all forms of tax, including for example effective rates of company tax collected by industry. 19.6. Consideration should be given to publishing tax statistics on all companies in the interests of transparency.

Sugary drinks health levy – a briefing for the Tax Working Group The New Zealand Dental Association supports an excise tax, or health levy, on sugary drinks. Introduction of this measure is consistent with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines 1 . ‘Pigovian tax’ As English economist Arthur Pigou suggested 2 , there are market activities that generate negative externalities, in this case health costs not included in the market price of sugary drinks. As with tobacco, excise taxes are used to combat increased public healthcare costs associated with tobacco use, sugary drink consumption leads to increased public health costs, which need to be considered. New Zealanders spend an estimated $257 million on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) each year. A reduction in consumption of SSBs via a tax will be greatest among households with the lowest disposable income, often households that face highest disease rates. Dental costs on taxpayers In the 2015/16 year, the number of children aged 0-12 years admitted to hospital for treatment due to tooth decay was 6,610 children, at a total cost of $14.77 million 3 (excluding GST). DHB expenditure 2016/17 4 (excluding GST): $101.08 million for dental services to pre-school and primary school children. $38.04 million for adolescents. This was for universal comprehensive preventive and treatment services delivered in community settings, including pre-school and primary school children receiving services, mostly from dental therapists in Community Oral Health Service facilities and adolescents receiving dental care from dentists in private practice settings. Damage caused by sugary drinks in New Zealand There is a clear and alarming causal relationship between the consumption of sugary drinks and dental caries (tooth decay), weight gain, obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty- liver, kidney disease and diet-related cancer 5 . Children are particularly vulnerable to increased levels of free sugars in their diets from these drinks. The WHO recommends that intake of free sugars ideally be reduced to less than 5% of total daily energy intake 6 . The number one source of sugar in the diet for those aged 0-30 years comes from sugary drinks 7 . 1 ‘Fiscal policies for diet and the prevention of noncommunicable diseases’ ISBN: 978 92 4 15112 http://www.who.int/dietphysicalactivity/publications/fiscal-policies-diet-prevention/en/ 2 The Concise Encyclopaedia of Economics http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Pigou.html 3 Source: Ministry of Health, Oral Health Team, Sector Capability and Implementation, 15 March 2018. 4 Source: Ministry of Health, Oral Health Team, Sector Capability and Implementation, 15 March 2018. 5 Source: On Taxing Sugar Sweetened Beverages as a Public health Measure, John D Potter MBBS PhD Centre for Public Health Research, Massey University (2018) 6 WHO Guideline: sugars intake for adults and children (2015) 7 Source: University of Otago and Ministry of Health. 2011. A Focus on Nutrition: Key findings of the 2008/ 09 New Zealand Adult Nutrition Survey. The has been an increase in hospital admissions due to dental decay in children and adolescents aged 0- 19 years in recent years 8 . Impact of tax on sugary drink producers In the case of the UK, The UK government introduced an industry tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, from April 2018. There are two bands - one for soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml, and a higher one for drinks with more than 8g per 100ml. Sugary drink producers in the UK acted ahead of the tax introduction by reducing the amount of sugar in their products, as there was a future financial incentive to do so 9 . Impact of tax on consumers In 2013, Mexico approved a 1 peso excise tax, (approximately 10% price increase), to non-dairy and non- alcoholic drinks with added sugar. A study published in journal Health Affairs shows purchases of taxed beverages decreased 5.5% in 2014 and 9.7% in 2015 10 . The benefits of reduced sugary drink consumption due to a sugary drink tax There is insufficient focus in reducing the dietary causes of dental caries in New Zealand, of which sugary drinks are a major contributor. Sugary drinks have no nutritional value, contribute empty calories, and have no place in a healthy diet. A reduction in the consumption of sugary drinks in New Zealand could have the following benefits for New Zealand and New Zealanders:  Improved oral health through the reduction of the incidence of dental caries (a chronic and completely preventable disease).  A healthier population – reduction in rates of obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, kidney and liver disease, cardiovascular disease and diet related cancer.  Increased revenue generation.  Decreased burden on our health sector.  More attentive children who can focus on learning in the education sector. Conclusion There is unequivocal evidence that a diet high in sugar causes tooth decay, type 2 diabetes and contributes to weight gain. For the sake of our children, and the taxpayers of New Zealand, the NZDA urges the Tax Working Group to recommend a health levy on all sugary drinks sold in New Zealand. For specific options on the details of such a health levy please see the Policy Brief: A Sugary Drink Tax for New Zealand.

Areas in which the Bill is weak 08 Alcohol marketing the bill should adopt a phased approach that would eliminate all forms of alcohol marketing and sponsorship over time. 18 Alcohol pricing the alcohol excise tax should be increased immediately. a greater proportion of excise revenue should be invested in harm prevention and addiction treatment. a minimum pricing scheme should be considered. 24 Adult drink-drive limit reduce the adult drink-drive limit to bring us in line with australia and other oecd countries. Areas in which the Bill is strong 30 social supply existing controls on the private supply of alcohol to minors are weak. the bill contains some very welcome provisions to change this. 40 Licensing and availability require the development of local alcohol policies to ensure communities are empowered to make decisions about the sale of alcohol in their neighbourhoods. other matters 36 Purchase age evidence and experience support the minimum purchase age for alcohol to be 20 years. 45 Bill of Rights inconsistencies we share concerns of the attorney-general about inconsistencies between the alcohol reform bill and the bill of rights act. 45 Restricting certain alcohol products emerging international evidence raises concerns about new alcohol products, especially those mixed with energy additives. the bill contains useful provisions to manage these products. 47 Addiction treatment law reform will only be fully effective when it’s supported by strong addiction treatment and harm prevention services. greater investment is needed in these areas.

W e would value the opportunity to appear before the Committee to make an oral submission on this Bill. There is significant community concern about the harms caused by alcohol, and a very high level of interest in this Bill. We would therefore urge the Committee to hold your hearings across New Zealand to allow those many individuals and groups making written submissions to also appear before the Committee. W e congratulate the Law Commission for their comprehensive review of our liquor laws and commend the Government for incorporating the majority of the Law Commission’s 153 recommendations to reduce alcohol-related harms and create a healthier drinking environment. The Alcohol Reform Bill is a good start towards reducing some of the harms from binge drinking and the excessive consumption of alcohol but we are deeply concerned that it omits three of the most effective recommendations by the Law Commission, namely, increasing alcohol excise tax, restricting alcohol marketing and lowering blood alcohol concentration limits for driving. It is essential to include these substantive measures in the Bill in order to achieve its stated objectives. Much of our submission details compelling grounds for including these particular measures in the Bill. Information about the New Zealand Drug Foundation is included with this submission, including details about the work we are doing to contribute to reducing alcohol harm (page 48). Please contact us if you require additional information or clarification on points raised in our submission. We wish you well for your consultation and deliberations on this Bill.

We draw particular attention to the rigorous process this review entailed. Over a two-year period, the Commission engaged in extensive public consultation across New Zealand, took advice from leading national and international experts, considered nearly 3,000 written public submissions, and produced two noteworthy reports. 1 Their final report – Alcohol in our lives: curbing the harm – contained 153 recommendations to Government on how to mitigate the harms that excessive consumption of alcohol is causing to individuals, families, communities and our society. The Law Commission’s 153 recommendations were designed to be a mutually supportive package. We strongly believe that they should form the basis for any proposed legislative changes. We also wish to commend Minister of Justice Hon Simon Power for drafting a Bill that incorporates the majority of the Law Commission’s 153 recommendations. However, we are deeply disappointed that the Bill omits the most important measures recommended by the Law Commission. We remind the Select Committee that Sir Geoffrey Palmer specifically cautioned the Government against “cherry picking the more politically palatable elements”. 2 While we acknowledge that the Alcohol Reform Bill represents a significant advance over the existing Sale and Supply of Liquor Act 1989, it is our view that the proposed Bill has substantive deficiencies in three major areas. The first deficiency relates to its failure to include the Law Commission’s recommendations on raising excise tax; the second deficiency relates to weak provisions on restricting alcohol marketing; the third deficiency is the Bill’s failure to reduce the adult drink- drive (BAC) limit. Alcohol pricing, alcohol marketing and BAC levels are three critical policy areas which have strong evidence for effectiveness, and which are the most cost-effective in reducing harmful drinking and minimising harms from excessive alcohol use. The Law Commission cautioned that “unless a comprehensive approach is taken to addressing the problems that alcohol poses for New Zealand society, those problems will not be solved”. 3 There is authoritative evidence to substantiate the need for a comprehensive approach to change a society’s attitude and culture around drinking, 4 particularly binge drinking, which causes the most harm and has The New Zealand Drug Foundation welcomes the Alcohol Reform Bill and the opportunity to submit on this important legislation. The Drug Foundation has a long interest in how laws governing the sale and supply of alcohol could be strengthened to reduce alcohol-related harms and create a healthier drinking environment in New Zealand. Alcohol in our lives 02 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill unfortunately become normalised in contemporary New Zealand culture. Price, marketing and availability of alcohol were three policy areas that the UK evidence review by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE, an independent organisation for providing guidance on health issues) recommended as critical areas to focus on in order to reduce harmful drinking and minimise harm to others. 5 These three must be included in legislation if the Bill is to have any chance of having a significant positive effect and reducing the binge drinking culture in New Zealand. The blood alcohol driving limit should also be reduced to be in line with almost all other OECD countries, including Australia. The current BAC level effectively permits legalised drunk driving, a situation described as “ridiculous” by the Minister of Transport, Hon Steven Joyce, back in September 2009. 6 We would also wish to see the Bill’s object be strengthened, as recommended by the Law Commission. The Law Commission expressed the view that the object should set out the purposes of the legislation in greater detail than in the current Sale and Supply of Liquor Act 1989. Setting out the object with greater precision will give the statute a better prospect of achieving its purpose and will also ensure the central principles underpinning the scheme are clear. While the Law Commission proposed new objectives, these are not reflected in the Bill. We recommend that the Object of “delaying the onset of young people drinking alcohol” be included in the Bill. Early initiation of drinking can have adverse effects on physical and cognitive development and increases the risk of later alcohol-use disorders and other mental health problems. 7 At the core of the debate over reducing alcohol-related harms is the issue of individual responsibility versus population-based measures. The Drug Foundation believes that while it is important to address both approaches, interventions that focus solely on notions of individual responsibility without addressing the broader social and environmental context will generally not be effective. Our key recommendations 10 % Incorporate the 50% increase in alcohol excise tax recommended by the Law Commission to achieve a 10% average increase in retail prices. $ Begin an immediate investigation into minimum pricing schemes. $ Ring-fence a proportion of the revenue derived from alcohol excise for use towards treatment, harm prevention and education programmes. $$ Establish an alternative source of funding to current alcohol sponsorships using alcohol excise. $ Implement in full the Law Commission’s three- phase alcohol marketing control system, leading to an eventual end to all forms of alcohol marketing and sponsorship. conTinues oveR www.drugfoundation.org.nz 03 nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill While we acknowledge that legislation on its own won’t solve our harmful drinking culture, the law has an integral part to play in shaping the environment in which alcohol is supplied and consumed. In doing so, it can help modify our binge drinking culture. (We also draw the Committee’s attention to the non-legislative/ regulatory work that the Drug Foundation contributes to alcohol harm reduction – page 49.) New Zealand currently has an ‘alcogenic’ environment – a situation which the Law Commission has characterised as the “unbridled commercialisation of alcohol”. 8 Witness the 24/7 availability of extremely cheap alcohol, sophisticated multimillion dollar marketing that portrays alcohol as the gateway to social, sexual and sporting success, and drink-drive limits that essentially allow legalised drunk driving. The Alcohol Reform Bill marks the next stage of a process that represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create better alcohol laws that take into account the knowledge we have gained over the last two decades and reflect the needs and aspirations of 21st-century New Zealand. We urge the Committee to be guided by the best available evidence on how to reduce alcohol-related harms and effect change to our binge drinking culture, and not waver in the face of myths and misinformation spread by groups opposed to any law changes that would undermine their commercial interests. In this regard, we can expect industry to argue against any measures that would reduce the consumption of alcohol and thereby undermine their profits. Industry will argue against measures to reduce harm such as increased tax, reduction in the blood alcohol limit for driving and restrictions on alcohol advertising and sponsorship. 9 While we acknowledge that legislation on its own won’t solve our harmful drinking culture, the law has an integral part to play in shaping the environment in which alcohol is supplied and consumed. In doing so, it can help modify our binge drinking culture. Myth: Alcohol consumption has remained the same despite liberalisation of our liquor laws. FA ct: t otal alcohol consumption has increased over the past decade. total alcohol available for consumption (calculated from production, imports and exports) increased by 9.4% between 1998 and 2009 according to official data from statistics new Zealand. this increase coincided with some of the most significant changes relaxing our liquor laws (e.g. purchase age lowered to 18, supermarkets allowed to sell beer and wine, sunday trading allowed, starting time for alcohol advertisements on tv brought forward to 8:30pm from 9:00pm). regardless of per capita consumption, it is how we are drinking that is even more important. there is clear evidence over the last decade that binge drinking is increasing.

For example, Mäori are more likely to die of alcohol-related causes, more likely to be apprehended by police for an offence that involved alcohol, and more likely to experience harmful effects on areas such as financial position, work, study or employment, injuries and legal problems as a result of their drinking compared with other New Zealanders. 14 New evidence also suggests that alcohol harms may not simply be reflecting existing inequalities between ethnic groups but may actually be driving inequalities. For example, Mäori women suffer more adverse effects as a result of other people’s drinking than any other group. 15 A landmark report on the social determinants of health listed alcohol (and other drugs) as one of 10 major contributors to inequalities that can be influenced by public policy. 16 We urge the Committee to give particular consideration to reducing the harms that alcohol causes to Mäori, Pacific and lower socioe-conomic groups.

The Law Commission recommended a three-stage plan to control alcohol promotions, advertising and sponsorship. The process would take five years and phase out all forms of alcohol advertising. sTAge One makes it an offence for off-licences to promote any event or activity that encourages excessive alcohol consumption. Promotions that specifically target young drinkers will also become an offence. sTAge TWO creates a joint committee run by the Ministers of Health and Justice. This will oversee a programme to reduce exposure to alcohol advertising and increase control of advertising content. sTAge Three restricts the advertising and promotion of alcohol in all media. Eventually, no alcohol advertising will be allowed, except that which gives factual product information only. What was the Government’s response? The Bill falls far short of what needs to be done to effectively restrict what the Law Commission has described as the “unbridled commercialisation of alcohol”. The Government has accepted stage one of the Law Commission’s recommendations but rejected stages two and three. Instead, it is asking its officials to “continue to monitor the national and overseas research on the effects of exposure to advertising”. Nevertheless, the proposed Alcohol Reform Bill extends the current offence relating to the promotion of excessive consumption of alcohol to include off-licences in addition to on-licences. Importantly, clause 220 stipulates a list of what constitutes the irresponsible promotion of alcohol – a list that includes the promotion or advertisement of alcohol in a manner aimed at, or that has, or is likely to have, special appeal to minors. While this measure is certainly welcome, there is nothing in the Bill that will restrict exposure to advertising or increase control over its content. Alcohol marketing Key facts www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill10 200 K each day, $200,000 is spent proMoting alcohol in new zealand. 90% of our kids aged 5–17 are exposed to alcohol advertising on tv each week. 17 86% of subMissions to the law coMMission supported banning or restricting all advertising of all alcohol in all Media. 86 % 90 % a scene depicting alcohol occurs every 9 Minutes during priMe tiMe television. 9 minutes Research and experience show “The literature presents increasingly compelling evidence that alcohol marketing is directly impacting upon young people’s drinking behaviour.” 18 Alcohol advertising and promotion increase the likelihood that adolescents will start to use alcohol, and to drink more if they are already using alcohol. 19 In New Zealand, 90% of children aged between 5 and 17 years are exposed to alcohol advertising on TV each week. 20 A large amount of alcohol imagery is incidental to storylines in programming on New Zealand television. Alcohol is also used in many advertisements to market non-alcohol goods and services. A recent New Zealand study found an average of one scene depicting alcohol every nine minutes of television. 21 Scenes depicting uncritical imagery outnumbered scenes showing possible adverse health consequences of drinking by 12 to 1. exposure increases alcohol and brand awareness among children and young teenagers In a US study of television advertising penetration, almost 29% of nine year olds and 82% of 13 year olds could list three or more beer brands. 22 In New Zealand, young children as well as minors are exposed to alcohol advertising through television in their homes. The BSA reports that watching late evening television is relatively common for children even as young as 6-7 years. 23 In 2003 ALAC provided the 2003 ASA code review committee with 2002 data showing that 23.7% of 10-17 year olds were watching television at 9.00- 9.30pm. At 8.30pm – the new start time implemented by the ASA against advice by ALAC, the Ministry of Health and other public health organisations – 26% of 10-17 years olds were watching. 24 Penetration of alcohol advertising to minors was illustrated by research on the ‘chin heads’ ad campaign for Lion Red. The research showed that 97% of minors recalled seeing the chin heads, 71% knew the ad was for Lion Red, 92% had positive views about the ads and 64% thought the chin head humour would appeal to minors. 25 exposure to, and liking, the ads shapes beliefs and consequent drinking behaviour Following repeated exposure to beer advertising, US college students rated alcohol as more beneficial and less risky than before seeing the advertisements, 27 and reported more positive assessments of the benefits of beer. 28 Such positive beliefs were predictive of plans about future alcohol use. 29 New Zealand boys aged 10-13 said they knew more about drinking from watching ads (but no alcohol advertisement depict risks or harm). The 10-17 year olds who recalled most alcohol ads were more likely to think it was okay for kids their age to get drunk, to think their friends drank frequently and consequently to drink more themselves. 30 The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study found an impact of response to advertising on later consumption. Numbers of alcohol ads recalled at age 15 in response to a question about the portrayal of alcohol in the media significantly predicted heavier drinking among males at age 18. 31 Those who responded positively to alcohol advertising at age 18 were heavier drinkers and reported more alcohol-related aggression at age 21. 32 By age 26, amounts but not frequency of drinking had declined for most of these 700,000 neW ZealanDers have Been CateGoriseD as BinGe DrinKers (C onsuminG seven or more stanDarD DrinKs per session). 26 The literature presents increasingly compelling evidence that alcohol marketing is directly impacting upon young people’s drinking behaviour. www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill11 Binge drinKing AMOng teenAgers is increAsing.

Those who had responded most positively to alcohol advertising at age 18 were the most frequent drinkers at age 26. 34 Young people’s responses are linked to local advertising expenditure The beer companies that spent the most on advertising had the highest brand awareness, highest brand preference, highest brand use, and highest brand loyalty among the adolescents. Media and advertisements were a significant predictor of these four and also of intentions to drink at age 21. 35 Advertising had a positive effect on annual alcohol participation, monthly participation and binge participation, and higher prices had a negative effect. 36 A US study of drinking and alcohol advertising exposure among 15-26 year olds found that those who saw more alcohol advertisements on average drank more. The number of drinks increased by 1% for each additional ad reported. Those in markets with greater alcohol advertising expenditures drank more. Drinks increased by 3% for each additional dollar spent per capita. 37 Brand images and ‘lifestyle’ marketing are attractive to young In the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, those who had established a relationship with a beer brand by age 18 were heavier drinkers and reported more alcohol-related aggressive behaviour at 21. 38 Recent marketing has an active interaction with youth culture – internet, direct promotions at venues and events, sponsorship of concerts, DJs, musicians, free music. These target young drinkers in ways that are relatively invisible to older segments of the population. This includes sweet ‘starter’ drinks (alcopops) that are marketed in low profile ways to reduce policy attention as well as costs. 39 New Zealand research shows that alcohol brand images and lifestyle marketing are providing young people with commercialised identities to take up, along with the alcoholic products. 40 Alcohol brands in New Zealand are increasingly being marketed via sponsorships. Indeed, sponsorship of sporting or cultural events is widespread across New Zealand.

The Drug Foundation has consistently called for a complete tobacco-style ban of all alcohol advertising across all media and the discontinuation of all alcohol sponsorship of sporting or cultural events. At a very minimum, the new Bill should include the Law Commission’s three-stage plan to control alcohol promotions, advertising and sponsorship. The eventual goal should be an end to all forms of alcohol advertising. The Bill should also enable the Government to place external controls over the industry’s ability to advertise. The Bill should place special emphasis on how to restrict new forms of marketing that target young people using social media such as Facebook or viral text messaging. It is important to emphasise that introducing restrictions on marketing would have no bearing on the right of individuals who enjoy drinking to continue to do so. More attention needs to be paid to the extent of alcohol imagery on television. The Drug Foundation believes there should be an end to alcohol sponsorship of sporting or cultural events across New Zealand. This practice is currently ubiquitous around the country. There are important lessons to be learned from the removal of tobacco sponsorship of sporting and cultural events. Today, there is broad public support for the Smoke-free Environments legislation. The transition away from dependency on alcohol sponsorship could be a gradual one that is done in an incremental manner. Large sponsorships such as Steinlager’s sponsorship of the All Blacks could be taken over by the Health Sponsorship Council. We recommend that a proportion of tax from alcohol be used towards this until alternative sponsors can be found. Given the popularity of the All Blacks, it is likely that a new sponsor will quickly be found. Ending alcohol sponsorship of our sporting icons is extremely important if we are to see a shift in the culture of drinking in New Zealand. We can expect considerable opposition to such a move from the industry and from sporting and cultural groups, large and small, who will claim that their respective organisations will collapse without alcohol sponsorship. Yet this is not consistent with history. The Benson and Hedges Cricket series did not die nor did the Rothmans rally (it even became the Smokefree rally) or the Royal New Zealand Ballet. In the explanatory note to the Alcohol Reform Bill, the Government acknowledges that legislative settings can support a safe and responsible drinking environment through controls on the availability of alcohol for instance. We agree entirely and suggest that exactly the same rationale should apply when it comes to legislative controls restricting advertising. Myth: Alcohol advertising is only about increasing market share, not about recruiting non-drinkers or increasing consumption by existing drinkers. FAcT: there is clear and compelling evidence that alcohol advertising encourages people to start drinking at a younger age. it also leads young people who already drink to drink more. advertising also contributes to our drinking culture by so brazenly associating alcohol with social, sexual and sporting success. Alcohol marketing ContinueD If we really want to change our drinking culture, we need to address the environment in which our young people are continually bombarded by sophisticated marketing messages that blatantly associate alcohol with social, sporting and sexual success and encourage heavy consumption. 16 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Footnotes ContinueD 17 tim mcCreanor and others “Creating intoxigenic environments: marketing alcohol to Young people in aotearoa new Zealand” (2008) 67 social science and medicine 938 at 940. 18 Gordon, r., G. hastings, et al.

By this measure, the alcohol use survey 2007/08 found: 25% (23.6–25.8) of new Zealand drinkers aged 12 to 65 years consumed large amounts of alcohol on a typical drinking occasion. as did 54% (50.3–57.9) of our 18 to 24 year olds. there are also at least 700,000 new Zealanders who are heavy drinkers, based on the alcohol use Disorders identification test (auDit), the Who best-practice screening instrument. 27 snyder, l.B. and Blood, D.J.

The Law Commission recommended raising the excise tax on alcohol by 50% to achieve a 10% average increase in retail prices. They advised that this would be the most effective pricing policy to reduce harms. They also recommended that the Government fully investigates a minimum pricing scheme and makes it a legal requirement for retailers and producers to provide sales and price data. In a bid to encourage the production and availability of low- alcohol products (up to 2.5% alcohol by volume), the Law Commission also recommended reducing the excise tax on these products. What was the Government’s response? Extremely poor. The Government rejected all three of the Law Commission’s recommendations on pricing. It has ruled out raising excise tax and stalled for time on the idea of minimum pricing. Instead, it prefers to “monitor international developments” and “review the information available on alcohol sales and price after one year”. It has rejected the Law Commission’s recommendation to make it a legal requirement for retailers to provide price and sales data. It has also rejected the idea of reducing excise tax on low-alcohol products. In its official response to the Law Commission’s recommendations, the Government acknowledged that “there is increasing public concern about the accessibility of cheap alcohol encouraging people to drink more often or large amounts”. It also concedes that “increased affordability facilitates excessive and harmful consumption”. Research and experience show Cheap products are favoured by heavy, harmful and young drinkers. Widespread availability of cheap alcohol products encourages excessive and harmful consumption. Alcohol has become more affordable over the last decade in New Zealand and heavily discounted alcohol is cheaper than average priced bottled water. 46 Raising alcohol prices is internationally recognised as one of the best ways to reduce alcohol-related harms such as motor vehicle accidents, Alcohol pricing Making alcohol less affordable is the most effective way of reducing alcohol-related harm. uK national institute for health and clinical excellence Key statistics 75 % over 75% of subMissions to the law coMMission supported increases in price (via either excise tax or MiniMuM pricing). heavily discounted alcohol is cheaper than average priced bottled water. 44 a rise in excise tax of 50% will have net econoMic benefits to new z ealand to the order of $72 Million each year, via reductions in alcohol-related harMs. 45 $ 72 m $$$ 20 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill violence, sexually transmitted diseases, and cirrhosis. Raising prices reduces consumption in high-risk groups such as heavy drinkers – about 1% for each percentage rise in price – and the young. It also reduces the likelihood of young or moderate drinkers becoming heavy drinkers. The evidence for this is clear and unequivocal. 47 Comparisons of tax rates and prices across US states show that increases of as little as 10 cents a drink are reflected in reduced levels of domestic violence, sexual disease, and road crashes. 48 If alcohol taxes were used to raise the price of alcohol in the EU15 \[European Union 15 core countries\] by 10%, over 9,000 deaths would be prevented during the following year and an approximate estimate suggests that 13 billion Euros of additional excise duty would also be gained. 49 Cirrhosis of the liver is one of the diseases associated with long-term heavy drinking. US research estimates a 10% increase in the price of alcohol would reduce cirrhosis deaths by 8.3-12.8%. 50 Analysis by Marsden Jacob Associates, an independent Australian economics consultancy group, suggests that a rise in excise tax of 50% will have likely net economic benefits to New Zealand to the order of $72 million each year, via reductions in alcohol- related harms. Currently, all New Zealanders are paying for alcohol- related costs to our Police, health services and prisons via their income taxes. Two recently published meta- analyses provide strong further evidence that raising alcohol tax is an effective strategy for reducing excessive alcohol consumption and harms. 51 The analysis by Wagenaar et al 2010 suggests that doubling the alcohol tax would reduce: alcohol-related mortality by an ■ average of 35% traffic crash deaths by 11% ■ sexually transmitted disease by 6% ■ violence by 2% ■ crime by 1.4%. ■ What should the Bill include? We urge the Select Committee to amend the Bill to include the Law Commission’s main recommendations on pricing, including increasing excise tax by 50% to achieve a 10% average increase in retail prices. The Alcohol Reform Bill should also make it a legal requirement for retailers and producers to provide sales and price data with a view to the introduction of a minimum pricing scheme. Currently, these are not collected and analysed in a systematic fashion. The Drug Foundation believes there is a strong case for fully and immediately investigating a minimum pricing system, in addition to a raise in excise tax. In order to do this, it should be made a legal requirement for retailers to provide price and sales data. Fixing minimum drinks prices can achieve health goals that raising alcohol taxes alone cannot by preventing below-cost selling and the deep discounting of alcohol that some retailers engage in. The key benefit of a minimum price system would be to raise the retail price of the alcohol products that provide the cheapest forms of absolute alcohol. Unlike a raise in tax, there is no opportunity for its effect to be diluted as a consequence of being absorbed by producers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers. Recent modelling in the UK has shown that setting a minimum price of 50 pence per unit would likely increase the average weekly spend on alcohol of moderate drinkers by only 23 pence per week, but would decrease the consumption by underage and heavy drinkers by 7.3% and 10.3%, respectively. 52 The Bill should also include a clause reducing the excise tax on low-alcohol products to encourage the production and availability of these products. It is important for the Bill to stipulate that a greater proportion of revenue from excise tax on alcohol be used towards prevention, treatment, education and rehabilitation services, and to replace alcohol sponsorship of sport in the initial stages. 25 23 21 19 17 15 13 11 9 7 5 19992004200520062007200820092000200120022003 Minutes of work\* BeerWhiskyCask wine Time trends in alcohol affordability \*Minutes taken to earn enough (on the average wage) to pay for sufficient alcohol to reach the legal limit for intoxicated driving.

Currently, most alcohol tax goes into the government’s consolidated fund, from where it can be used for any government initiative. A small separate levy on alcohol goes to the Alcohol Advisory Council ($12.7 million in the 2008/09 year). The total cost of harmful alcohol use in New Zealand in 2005/06 has been estimated at $4.4 billion. 53 Estimates of direct costs to the government range from $500 million to $1.2 billion per year. 54 Ear-marking a greater proportion of excise tax towards mitigating alcohol-related harms will make the increase in price more acceptable to the public. This has been demonstrated for tobacco products and in the New Zealand setting. 55 The evidence on price and tax policy suggests that it is one of the most effective ways of reducing alcohol-related harm. We recognise that taking action on these is difficult and that the public, though supportive of measures to reduce the burden of alcohol use on society, may be resistant to increases in price. The alcohol industry is likely to strongly oppose increases in price. There are also legal, administrative and commercial constraints that may impact on policy action in this area. Nevertheless, action to increase prices is both necessary and possible. Myth: raising alcohol taxes will punish responsible drinkers FAcT: the modest price rises proposed by the law commission would not have a significant impact on low or moderate drinkers. for example, the average price of a 330 ml beer would rise by just 17 cents and an $11 bottle of wine would increase by just 96 cents. yet this modest rise would produce significant reductions in harm that would benefit all new zealanders, drinkers, non-drinkers and taxpayers alike. the government’s reluctance to raise excise tax on alcohol appears to stem from its fear of a voter backlash. this fear is unfounded. “Those who enjoy alcohol socially and drink in a low-risk manner will be little affected by the Law Commission’s recommendations.

Alcohol pricing ContinueD 22 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Is alcohol cheaper than bottled water? The research in question focused primarily on evaluating trends in alcohol affordability over time. Using price data collected by Statistics New Zealand for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and average hourly earnings from the New Zealand Income Survey, the authors demonstrated that alcohol has clearly become more affordable over the past decade. Next, they looked specifically at the price of discounted alcohol and compared this with the price of bottled water. Startlingly, some alcohol was found to be cheaper than bottled water. Those refuting the finding point out that the study did not compare equal volumes of alcohol and water. But attempting to draw meaningful comparisons on the basis of volume is problematic because alcohol comes in a great many types and strengths. While the alcohol strength of beer typically ranges between 3.5 and 5%, most wine ranges between 11 and 14%, while some spirits can exceed 45%. Alcohol can also be consumed in various ways: spirits are frequently diluted with non-alcoholic mixers while wine and beer are consumed straight. This is why best practice when quantifying alcohol is to use the concept of a standard drink. One standard drink contains 10g of alcohol and is the amount of alcohol found in an average 330ml can of beer, a 100ml glass of wine or 30ml of straight spirits. When measuring alcohol, it is the number of standard drinks, not the amount of liquid that matters. Using a website that documents discounts on alcohol at outlets throughout New Zealand (www.lips.co.nz), the researchers found that 3 litres of white cask wine at 11.5% alcohol could be bought for $16.99, which works out at 62 cents per standard drink. Likewise, 12 330ml bottles of beer at 5% was selling for $9.99, which works out at 64 cents per standard drink. A litre of spirits at 40% could be bought for $25.00, equivalent to 78 cents per standard drink. These prices were then compared with the price of 250ml of bottled water using the average 2010 CPI data – 67 cents. This volume was selected because it is a standard serving size for non-alcoholic beverages recognised by nutritionists and equivalent to a typical drinking glass. At 62 cents per standard drink (cask wine) and 64 cents per standard drink (beer), some discounted alcohol is indeed cheaper than bottled water. Mythbusters visited the website www.lips.co.nz on several occasions and was always able to find discounts equal to (or better) than those identified by the researchers. Whilst the media may have sensationalised their findings, the researchers themselves were explicit about their results. “Some alcohol is more affordable than bottled water.” This is undeniable and a conclusion reached on the basis of robust methodology and data. Importantly, the authors never claimed that all alcohol is cheaper than all bottled water. The notion that price comparisons between alcohol and water should have been done on a volumetric basis is fundamentally flawed. Nonetheless, some alcohol is cheaper than bottled water even on a ml for ml basis. As Sir Geoffrey Palmer noted, “A can of beer or an RTD can be bought for one or two dollars in many retail outlets. This is less than we pay for bottled water”. A quick browse at a nearby discount liquor store was all it took to prove that he, too, is absolutely correct.

In its original Issues Paper, the Law Commission recommended reducing BAC limits for driving from 80 to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood for adult drivers. It recommended a limit of zero for drivers under 20 years of age. The Law Commission also suggested that alcohol interlock devices be considered for all convicted drink drivers. These devices require the driver to provide an alcohol-free breath sample before the vehicle can be started. The Law Commission envisaged that the issue of BAC limits would be addressed as part of a review of the national road safety strategy. As such, while emphasising the importance of reducing BAC levels in its Issues Paper as part of alcohol law changes, it did not include specific recommendations about BAC in its 153 final recommendations to the Government. What was the Government’s response? Extremely weak. The Government has turned its back on hundreds of pages of official advice and international evidence urging a lower drink-driving limit. The Government recently opted not to change the adult BAC limit, leaving it at 80mg for adult drivers. Instead, it has requested two more years of New Zealand-specific research on crash-involved drivers with BAC levels between 50 and 80mg. The Government has adopted a zero BAC limit for drivers under 20 years of age and the recommendation for alcohol interlock devices. Adult drink-drive limit www.drugfoundation.org.nz 27nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Research and experience show There are nearly 300 international studies examining BAC levels and driving ability. They overwhelmingly show that the more alcohol a driver has consumed, the higher their crash risk. Our current BAC of 80mg allows people to become significantly impaired and still legally drive. It allows a man of average height and weight to consume six standard drinks within 90 minutes and still be under the limit. 56 Every 20mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood is associated with a near doubling of crash risk. 57 At the current rate of 80mg, a driver is twice as likely to crash as a driver at 50mg. 58 The following table is derived from New Zealand data and shows that at a BAC of 80mg adult drivers aged over 30 years are 16 times as likely to be involved in a fatal crash than if they were sober. Adults aged between 20 and 29 years are about 50 times as likely. 59 200 180 160 140 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 0506070809010010203040150110120130140 Increase in risk (%) 15–19 years20–29 years30+ years Risk of crashing by BAC level and age of driver BAC (mg/100ml) Current youth BAC limit Internationally recommended limit Current adult BAC limit We strongly recommend an amendment be added to the Bill that lowers the adult BAC limit to 50mg per 100ml. There is ample research evidence, applicable to New Zealand, to support this change. Failure to do so is going to result in lives lost and serious injuries sustained on our roads. 28 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill reLA tive risK OF FAtAL crAsh By BLOOd ALc OhOL LeveL bac (mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood) 30+ years 20–29 years 15–19 years 01.03.05.3 302.98.715.0 505.817.530.3 8016.550.286.6 The Government was advised by the Ministry of Transport that on the basis of the data in 300 international studies, lowering the adult BAC limit to 50mg would save between 15 and 33 lives and prevent between 320 and 686 injuries every year. It would also produce social cost savings of between $111 million and $238 million per year, and ACC would save between $44.9 million and $94.5 million in claims. The financial benefit of lowering the limit would be 173 times greater than the cost. 60 It is easier to keep track of how many drinks you’ve had when keeping below 50mg. This is about two cans of beer drunk by an average-sized adult male in one hour. People intending to keep below a limit of 80mg are more likely to lose count of their drinks. 61 Most New Zealanders support a legal BAC limit of 50mg. When asked how much alcohol should be safe to drink before driving, 85% of those surveyed answered two drinks or less. This is equivalent to a BAC limit of 50mg. A BAC limit of 50mg or less is standard for adult drivers in most other developed countries including Australia and 25 out of 29 European countries. Places that have lowered the BAC limit have experienced reductions in drinking and driving and alcohol-related deaths and injuries. In comparison with Australia, where an adult drink drive limit of 50mg has been in place for many years, New Zealand experiences a higher level of alcohol-related road crashes. Alcohol interlocks can be an effective tool for managing recidivist drink drivers, but they are only effective in the long term if the underlying alcohol problem is addressed. Otherwise, they only work for the duration they are installed in the offender’s vehicle. 62 Young people are more susceptible to the effects of alcohol and are less experienced drivers. They are at significantly increased risk of crashing even at very low BAC concentrations. What should the Bill include? We strongly recommend an amendment be added to the Bill that lowers the adult BAC limit to 50mg per 100ml. There is ample research evidence, applicable to New Zealand, to support this change. Failure to do so is going to result in lives lost and serious injuries sustained on our roads. The Drug Foundation fully supports the Government’s decision to reduce youth BAC limits to zero. This sends a clear message to young people that if you drink any alcohol you should not drive. We also support the Government on the introduction of alcohol interlocks for repeat drink drivers. However, repeat drink driving offences are often a sign of an underlying drinking problem. Ensuring that treatment is available to recidivist drink drivers should be a priority.

The Law Commission recognised the rights and responsibilities of parents with respect to the supply of alcohol to minors. The Law Commission recommended that it be an offence for any person who is not the parent or guardian to supply alcohol to someone under the age of 18, unless they have got consent (orally or in writing) from a parent or guardian, and the alcohol is supplied in a responsible manner. Supplying alcohol in a responsible manner means taking into account factors such as: adequacy of adult supervision; age of minors present; quantity and duration of alcohol supplied; presence of intoxication; availability of food. A parent or guardian would not be responsible if a minor had acted without their knowledge or against their instructions. The Law Commission acknowledges concerns about how consent and supervision will be enforced. If the purchase age is raised to 20, these recommendations will apply only to those under 18 because the legal responsibilities of parents and guardians end once children turn 18. What was the Government’s response? The Government’s response to this aspect of the Bill was very good. The Government accepted the Law Commission’s proposals for strengthening controls on supply of alcohol to minors. It noted that Police would have discretion not to prosecute and believes this will give protection to low-level, low-harm supply and avoid over-interference in people’s private lives. Proposed clauses relating to strengthening controls on the supply of alcohol to minors are to be commended. This is a complex area in which we should learn from successful similar initiatives in other jurisdictions. Social supply Proposed clauses relating to strengthening controls on the supply of alcohol to minors are to be commended. This is a complex area in which we should learn from successful similar initiatives in other jurisdictions. Key facts it is currently an offence to purchase alcohol with the ‘intent to supply’ it to a M inor, but not if the buyer is the parent or guardian or the alcohol is for a ‘private social gathering’. existing controls on the private supply of alcohol to Minors are li Mited. Many parents do not want to lose their right to introduce their child to alcohol in a responsible Manner but are frustrated at being unable to prevent others froM supplying alcohol to their children, often with no adult supervision. parents, older brothers and sisters, and friends are Major sources of alcohol supply for Minors. there are no legal restrictions on how alcohol is supplied to Minors at private functions such as after-ball parties. 32 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Research and experience show Parents, other family members and friends are the main sources of alcohol supply to minors. The risk of harm for minors is reduced when parents are involved and there is adult supervision. Young people drink more when alcohol is supplied by friends than by parents. For example, minors are more likely to consume larger amounts of alcohol at someone else’s home (61%) than in their own home (21%). 63 Furthermore, parents were the most common source of supply to minors who drank less than two standard drinks, while friends were the most common source of supply to minors who drank six or more drinks, on a single occasion. Parents have a great influence on young people’s drinking. This influence is more positive when communication channels are clear, there is positive role modelling in the home and alcohol- specific boundaries are put in place. Delaying the age of alcohol initiation helps reduce harmful drinking. Police often respond to out-of-control parties where alcohol has been supplied by adults to other people’s children, yet find it difficult to investigate or prosecute the supplier under existing law. Three states in Australia – New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania – have introduced legislation to control the social supply of alcohol to minors on private property. In each jurisdiction, the law states only a parent, or an adult acting in the place of the parent, or with the formal approval of the parent, can supply a minor with alcohol in a private residence. In Queensland and Tasmania, a second offence of ‘irresponsible supply’ occurs when a person provides an excessive amount of alcohol or does not supervise the minor’s consumption of that alcohol to ensure that it is consumed safely. The Victorian Government has committed to introducing legislation to prohibit the supply of alcohol to young people in private settings. We have consulted with our colleagues in the Australian Drug Foundation over social supply legislation in Australia. The ADF believes that compared with the legislation in New South Wales, Queensland and Tasmania, the proposed New Zealand model is by far the most comprehensive. A key issue is that of defining authorisation or consent. In the Australian legislation, no guidance is given in the legislation as to the manner in which authorisation can be given, or the extent of this authorisation. Tasmanian Police have issued guidance notes in relation to permission under their legislation, which states that “the way in which you obtain the permission is up to you: it can be written, verbal or electronic, just make sure that it is legitimate and reliable”. 64 Additionally, the courts would apply reasonable limitations, based on the facts of an individual case. We have been advised by our Australian colleagues that not specifically setting out what consent is in the existing Australian legislation has not proved to be problematic. Rather, it means that Parliament has conferred discretion on decision makers to take into account all the circumstances of a given case to decide whether, Minors are more likely to consume larger amounts of alcohol at someone else’s home (61%) than in their own home (21%). Parents have a great influence on young people’s drinking. This influence is more positive when communication channels are clear, there is positive role modelling in the home and alcohol-specific boundaries are put in place. www.drugfoundation.org.nz 33nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill objectively, one could conclude that permission has been given. Furthermore, given that permission is likely to come about in different ways, implied and explicit, it would be difficult to draft legislation covering all the ways in which consent may be granted. In the proposed New Zealand Bill, authorisation is framed differently. It is a defence to the charge of supplying alcohol to a minor if the supplier believes on reasonable grounds that he or she has the consent of the parent or guardian of the minor (and supplies alcohol in a responsible manner). ‘Reasonable grounds’ is a legal standard of proof, defined as “the basis for a state of mind (such as belief or suspicion) where, from an objective viewpoint, that basis was just and appropriate in all the circumstances”. 65 This means that there must be some basis for the belief that can be considered and evaluated by an objective third person. The belief must be one that a reasonable person would have in that particular situation, taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances. A belief can be on reasonable grounds even if it is wrong. The proposed New Zealand approach to social supply legislation is excellent. Our only concern is that Police discretion is not inappropriately used to target minority groups. The development of Police policy or guidelines would be a useful step to support this part of the Bill. What should the Bill include? It should retain the proposals for strengthening the controls on supply of alcohol to minors by including this in the new alcohol law. This will give parents and other adults more support and clarity about their rights and responsibilities around supplying alcohol to their own and other children. Enforcement of the legislation should be based on an educative approach, rather than criminal sanctions, with the focus on changing behaviour and creating societal change. The use of diversionary options and counselling of parents should be investigated. The introduction of such legislation would require a sustained social marketing campaign to increase awareness of the risks associated with excessive or unsupervised drinking by young people, The proposed New Zealand approach to social supply legislation is excellent. Our only concern is that police discretion is not inappropriately used to target minority groups. Enforcement of the legislation should be based on an educative approach, rather than criminal sanctions, with the focus on changing behaviour and creating societal change. 34 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Social supply ContinueD and to inform the community of the new laws. It will also be necessary to invest adequate resources to ensure parents understand the critical role they play in introducing their children to alcohol, including the importance of role modelling and responsible supply. We emphasise the importance of enforcing the new laws in such a way that Police discretion is not used to unfairly target particular socio-economic or ethnic groups. As delaying the age of alcohol initiation helps reduce harmful drinking, we urge the Committee to include “delaying the onset of young people drinking alcohol” as a specific objective of the Bill, as was recommended by the Law Commission.

The purchase age for alcohol should be raised to 20 years with no exceptions. What was the Government’s response? The Government recommends introducing a split purchase age of 18 years for on-licences and 20 years for off-licences. It considers this would reduce alcohol-related harms associated with drinking off-premises, especially the practice of ‘pre-loading’. It also points to the reduced opportunity for supply by 18 and 19 year olds to younger peers. Research and experience show Drinking at a young age is a risk factor for alcohol-related harms as a young adult and later in life. Since the purchase age was lowered from 20 to 18 in 1999, there has been a significant increase in intoxicated people under 20 presenting to hospital, there has been an increase in alcohol-related crashes among 15–19 year olds and young people are starting to drink at an even earlier age. In a recent survey, eight in 10 people aged 16–17 years had consumed alcohol in the past year, with 71% of these consuming a large amount at least once and 36% drinking at least weekly. 66 International evidence shows that raising the purchase age reduces adolescent access to alcohol, reduces harmful youth drinking and raises the age at which young people start drinking. 67 Purchase age Key facts The Law Commission considered the idea of a split purchase age but rejected it as there is no evidence that on- licences provide a lower-risk drinking environment. A significant proportion of serious assaults occur in and around on-licensed premises. 68 Furthermore, a split purchase age is difficult to enforce and sends out conflicting messages. Since 1999, new research has shown that the brain continues to develop until well into a person’s 20s. Drinking alcohol at a young age harms the developing brain. 69 What should the Bill include? We urge the Select Committee to be guided by the evidence and accept the Law Commission’s recommendation to return the purchase age back to 20, with no exceptions. We also recommend that purchase age be treated as a health and social policy issue rather than a conscience issue when voting in the House. We stress the importance of not allowing concern for the drinking and voting rights of young people to over- ride the real and significant harms that have occurred since the lowering of the purchase age.

The Law Commission recommended that communities should have more input into local licensing decisions. The primary mechanism to facilitate this is requiring every local authority to adopt a local alcohol policy. Local alcohol policies would be required to take into account factors including the number, type and hours of licensed premises, the social and economic make-up of the community, and the level of alcohol- related problems in the area. Local alcohol policies should also include a plan for reducing alcohol-related harm, local restrictions on opening hours and a list of areas where outlet density is high and no new licence applications should be accepted. The Law Commission recommended that communities be meaningfully involved in the development of local alcohol policies. To this end, they suggest that councils should involve local iwi and hapü, Police, licensing inspectors, medical officers of health and other appropriate people when developing local alcohol policies. The Law Commission also suggested that a wider range of factors be taken into consideration when determinations about liquor licensing are being made. At the moment, decisions about liquor licensing are largely based only on how suitable the applicant is. The Law Commission recommended that decision makers should also take other factors into account such as the local alcohol policy, the aim of the law to reduce alcohol harms, the impacts of an outlet on a neighbourhood, and whether an applicant can handle the responsibilities that come with running a licensed liquor outlet. The Law Commission also recommended reducing the hours that liquor can be sold across the country so that all off-licences have to close by 10pm and not reopen until 9am and all on-licences have to close by 4am and not reopen until 9am, with a compulsory one-way door policy from 2am. The Law Commission also recommended scrapping the exemptions for a range of premises that are currently not subject to liquor licensing requirements. These premises include: the House of Representatives; Police canteens; Prison Officers’ canteens; Fire Service canteens; Defence Force canteens. What was the Government’s response? The Government accepted most of the Law Commission’s recommendations around licensing, with some important exceptions. Firstly, local alcohol policies will remain voluntary, thus potentially diminishing the opportunity for all communities to have a say in how alcohol is sold and supplied in their Licensing and availability Key facts alcohol licences are easy to get and hard to lose. 42 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill liquor licensing contributes to disorder, violence, criMe and traffic accidents. 24 hour the nuMber of outlets licensed to sell alcohol has More than doubled froM 6,296 in 1990 to 14,424 in 2010. 1990 2010 the public has little or no input into where and how alcohol is sold. communities. Secondly, although the Government has agreed to remove the licensing exemptions for the House of Representatives and Prison Officers’ canteens, it has proposed continued exemptions for Police, Defence and Fire Service canteens. The Government also accepted the need to restrict trading hours but has suggested slightly different hours from what the Law Commission recommended. The Bill proposes maximum trading hours of 7am–11pm for off-licences and 8am–4am for on-licences, with a one-way door policy left up to decision makers rather than being compulsory. Research and experience show As the law currently stands, the public has little or no input into where and how alcohol is sold. Alcohol licences are easy to get and hard to lose. This has resulted in a situation whereby communities are powerless to stop the increase of liquor outlets in their neighbourhoods. Communities have been demanding a greater say on alcohol in their neighbourhood and the Law Commission has recognised this. Liquor outlets are frequently clustered in the most socio-economically deprived neighbourhoods. A high density of liquor outlets leads to increased competition and lower prices. This is problematic when the commodity being sold is alcohol. When alcohol availability is high, so are rates of alcohol-related harms. New Zealand research has shown that high liquor outlet density is associated with increased total police events, including: anti-social behaviour; sexual offences; dishonesty offences; violent crime; drug and alcohol offences; traffic offences; family violence; motor vehicle accidents; property damage. 70 If local alcohol policies are voluntary, not all local authorities will develop one. Without a local alcohol policy, communities are denied the level of input needed to influence licence application decisions and the ability to retake control of alcohol harms in their neighbourhoods. Twenty-four-hour liquor licensing contributes to disorder, violence, crime and traffic accidents. Limiting the availability of alcohol by restricting trading hours is among the most effective measures to reduce alcohol- related harms. 71 It reduces excessive drinking, targets the heaviest drinkers and has the least impact on low to moderate drinkers. It reduces alcohol- related crime, violence and road accidents. The maximum trading hours proposed in the Bill are quite liberal. This is all the more reason why it is important to make the development of local alcohol policies mandatory so that communities have the opportunity to reduce the hours that alcohol is sold and supplied in their neighbourhoods, if they so wish. What should the Bill include? We commend the Government for listening to the overwhelming voice of New Zealanders who want a greater say in how alcohol is sold and supplied in their communities. The clause empowering territorial authorities to develop local alcohol policies which may include policies on any matter relevant to the object of the Bill is welcome. However, it is particularly important that local alcohol policies be made mandatory for all local authorities and we urge the Committee to make this amendment. Mandatory local alcohol policies would ensure that all communities have a say about alcohol in their neighbourhoods, encourage all local authorities to consider the nature As the law currently stands, the public has little or no input into where and how alcohol is sold.

We welcome the Government’s decision to accept the Law Commission’s proposals to require licensing decision makers to consider a range of factors other than just the applicant’s suitability when processing applications. A broadening of the factors which authorities will be required to take into consideration when making decisions about licensing will benefit operators who currently operate responsibly, while compelling unscrupulous operators to improve their practice or face the prospect of losing their licence. Taking into account the impact of any new licensed premises on the surrounding community will help prevent the clustering of alcohol outlets, reduce the availability of alcohol and reduce alcohol harms. We would like the Select Committee to adopt the restricted trading hours originally recommended by the Law Commission and make a one-way door policy compulsory rather than voluntary. While we welcome the Government’s decision to revoke the licensing exemptions for the House of Representatives and Prison Officers’ canteens, we urge the Committee to also revoke licensing exemptions for Police, Defence and Fire Service canteens. As the Law Commission noted, “less controlled access to alcohol should not be used as a reward for commendable public service”. The Law Commission outlined very compelling reasons for these exemptions to be removed: Defence Force establishments could be licensed in similar ways to civilian licences, but managed internally under military authority, such as the military police, with NZDF reporting annually to the Alcohol Regulatory Authority. Police and Fire Service canteens could operate simply under a club licence, thus minimising compliance costs. It is important to note that the New Zealand Police support the removal of exemptions for Police canteens. We recommend the Committee reject the proposed continued exemptions for these premises.

Licensing and availability ContinueD www.drugfoundation.org.nz 45nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Potential inconsistencies with the Bill of Rights Act The Attorney-General has considered the Alcohol Reform Bill for consistency with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and concluded that several provisions appear to be inconsistent with the affirmed rights, and are not justified under section 5 of the Bill of Rights Act. 72 It is our view that all five areas of concern identified by the Attorney-General are valid (though some are more serious than others) and we urge the Committee to give these concerns due scrutiny. We are particularly concerned about the proposal to make it possible for police to arrest someone for breaching a liquor ban, which is an ‘infringement offence’. It is not clear why an arrest for a breach of a liquor ban is necessary. If there is a risk of public disorder, alternative powers of arrest are available to police. We agree with the Attorney- General’s assessment that granting powers of arrest for an infringement offence appears to be inconsistent with the right against arbitrary arrest or detention under the Bill of Rights Act. Infringement offences are not sufficiently serious to justify a power to arrest. The intention is to keep such offending out of the criminal justice system such that an offender does not result in a recorded conviction. Furthermore, the purpose of arrest and detention in the Bill is not clear as the process for an infringement notice is effectively completed once the infringement notice is issued. The arrested person would either have to be immediately released or held without a clear obligation of release, both of which call into question the coherence of the proposed scheme. Concerns have also been raised about allowing police to compel someone suspected of an infringement offence to give the name, address and whereabouts of anyone connected in any way with the alleged offence. This raises issues about the right to silence and the right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. The Bill also has a number of ‘reverse onus’ provisions, which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. This appears to contravene the cardinal principle of the presumption of innocence that lies at the core of our legal system. While these issues lay outside the Drug Foundation’s core area of expertise, we urge the Committee to devote close attention to ensuring that the Alcohol Reform Bill does not contradict the rights and principles enshrined in the Bill of Rights Act. Regulations banning or restricting certain alcohol products We welcome the provisions under Clause 383 giving specific powers to make regulations banning or restricting certain alcohol products. While it is difficult to predict future types of alcohol products that could be sold, there are already strong concerns regarding some products. We consider that this provision (subject to minor modifications) will provide the regulatory authorities with sufficient powers to ban or restrict certain products deemed dangerous or especially appealing to young people. There are already some concerns regarding caffeinated RTDs. Many RTDs sold in New Zealand contain energy- additives, such as caffeine and/or guarana (guarana is a natural source of caffeine). Bourbon and colas are the most popular type of RTD. Pulse, for example, is the fastest-growing RTD and has 7% alcohol (vodka) combined with flavoured soda and guarana. Although research is limited, available evidence suggests that energy-additive RTDs can mask the intoxicating effects of alcohol and therefore increase the risk of alcohol-related harm. Young people are particularly vulnerable to increased problems from ingesting these products, since they are more likely than adults to take risks and Other matters to suffer high rates of acute alcohol problems, including alcohol-related traffic accidents, violence, sexual assault, and suicide. 73 Caffeinated RTDs may cause a ‘wide-awake drunk’ effect when consumed in large amounts, causing intoxicated people to perceive that they are safe to drive because the caffeine combats the drowsiness normally associated with alcohol. 74 We draw the Committee’s attention to the recent determination by the US FDA after a year-long probe into the safety of caffeinated alcoholic beverages that caffeine is an “unsafe food additive” to malt alcohol beverages. Following this ruling, the federal government may seize the products if companies don’t remove the caffeine from them. The three-month delay between the regulations coming into force after the date of their notification in the Gazette under Clause 383 is unduly long. If a product is deemed to be dangerous to health after consulting with the Minister of Health, then the Government should implement a ban or restriction as soon as possible. We suggest that this timeframe be amended to the day one month after the date of notification, unless the Minister is satisfied there exists or is about to exist a situation serious enough to justify urgent action. Addiction treatment We are pleased to note that the explanatory note to the Bill states that the Bill will be supported by robust public education and treatment interventions. Treatment works. It reduces alcohol harm to individuals, families and communities, is cost- effective, and the benefits of effective treatment are felt across many sectors. The unmet need for alcohol treatment is significant. Greater investment in the addiction treatment sector is urgently needed so that people who are in need of help can find it. only a quarter (25.8%) of people with diagnosed alcohol abuse and just over a third (36.9%) of people with diagnosed alcohol dependence have sought help for their alcohol probleMs in the past year. 75 only a sMall proportion of people with drinking probleMs are ever diagnosed. it is estiMated that in the past year 2.6% and 1.3% of the population suffered froM alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, respectively. 76 those who do seek help tend to struggle alone for a long tiMe before reaching out. the Median delay before seeking treatMent for alcohol abuse is 16 years, and for alcohol dependence it is seven years. 77 only 7% of drink drivers were referred for aod assessMents by the courts in 2006/07. MÄori are twice as likely as non-MÄori to have wanted help in addressing their alcohol Misuse but not received it. Key facts Treatment works. It reduces alcohol harm to individuals, families and communities, is cost-effective, and the benefits of effective treatment are felt across many sectors. The unmet need for alcohol treatment is significant. Caffeinated RTDs may cause a ‘wide-awake drunk’ effect when consumed in large amounts, causing intoxicated people to perceive that they are safe to drive because the caffeine combats the drowsiness normally associated with alcohol. Bill 46 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill 25.8 % 7 % Other matters ContinueD Treatment is a cost-effective way to reduce alcohol harm in our communities. The cost of alcohol harm to New Zealand has been calculated at $1.31 billion a year. 78 For every dollar spent on treatment, five dollars are saved in health, social and criminal justice services. 79 Treatment reduces the costs of alcohol harms to society by reducing criminal offending and incarceration rates, domestic and child abuse decreases, and socio-economic inequalities lessen as people in recovery contribute more to society through employment. We support the Commission’s recommendation for some of the proceeds of the proposed increase in alcohol excise to be applied to spending on alcohol treatment services and training. We have elaborated on our rationale for this on page 22. Despite the social and economic benefits of providing effective addiction treatment, there is a disconnect between the level of resourcing and the level of need in New Zealand. Under-resourcing of addiction treatment means that opportunities to reduce alcohol harm are being missed. Currently, judges are able to call for alcohol and other drug (AOD) assessments and direct offenders into treatment as part of the sentencing process. However, a lack of available treatment programmes means this is rarely possible. Judge John Walker told the Law Commission that many offenders appearing before the District Court would benefit from addiction treatment, but that the ability to incorporate this into sentencing is “dependent on treatment being available”. He went on to say, “Unfortunately, more often than not, it \[treatment\] isn’t.” Only 7% of drink drivers were referred for AOD assessments by the courts in 2006/07. Of those with a single conviction, only 1% were ordered to be assessed. Of those with two convictions, just 6% were ordered to be assessed and of those with four convictions, only 31% were ordered to be assessed. For some people with a drinking problem, a court appearance could be the catalyst for change, providing a valuable window of opportunity to address their drinking problem. A lack of investment in the addiction treatment sector means that these opportunities are being missed. Better integration across existing agencies and systems is crucial for treatment to be delivered more effectively. Even though under- resourcing is the single most important issue for the treatment sector, fragmentation and a lack of co- ordination are also significant impediments to better treatment. www.drugfoundation.org.nz 47nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill Footnotes ContinueD 72 report of the attorney-General under the new Zealand Bill of rights act 1990 on the alcohol reform Bill. 8 november 2010. 73 simon m and mosher J. 2007. alcohol, energy drinks, and youth: a dangerous mix.

The New Zealand Drug Foundation, established in 1990, is an independent trust with a national focus on minimising drug-related harm. This includes social and health harms caused by legal drugs, such as tobacco and alcohol, as well as illegal drugs, such as cannabis. Our focus is on advocating for policies that build a healthy society where there is the least possible harm from drug use. All efforts to control or reduce the harm from drugs must be evidence based, socially just and maintain the rights of individuals and the aspirations of communities. 48 www.drugfoundation.org.nz nZ Drug Foundation submission alC ohol reForm Bill The Drug Foundation advocates evidence-based policy on these issues, and provides reliable and credible information to organisations and individuals. The Drug Foundation recognises that drugs, legal and illegal, are a part of everyday life experience. Drugs, and their use, impact on many of us, and on the people we care about. Harms to individuals and families include injury, disease, social, personal and financial problems, and a reduced quality of life. Harms to society include unsafe communities, increased need for law enforcement, and high health and economic costs. For these reasons, the Drug Foundation is committed to reducing drug use and its harmful consequences. Our focus is on advocating for policies that build a healthy society where there is the least possible harm from drug use. All efforts to control or reduce the harm from drugs must be evidence based, socially just and maintain the rights of individuals and the aspirations of communities.

Tēnā koe The Drug Foundation welcomes the opportunity to address alcohol tax reform. We know what an important opportunity this is. Luckily, we have been talking about alcohol tax for years, so we already have the relevant information to share with the tax working group. Alcohol has become more affordable over the past decade and there is plenty of evidence that consumption is related to the price and affordability of alcohol. New Zealand has an ‘alcogenic’ environment – a situation which the Law Commission in 2010 previously characterised as the “unbridled commercialisation of alcohol”. This means New Zealand sees high alcohol-related harms that impact on individuals, families and society as a whole. Harmful use is interconnected with some of the biggest issues facing New Zealand today, for example, poverty, family violence, mental health and homelessness. These harms are most often carried by the most vulnerable groups. Raising the price of alcohol is one of the most (if not the primary) cost-effective ways to reduce alcohol consumption. The Drug Foundation knows that alcohol tax can play a large role in reducing these harms. Increase the excise tax on alcohol by 50% The 2010 Law Commission Report recommended increasing alcohol excise tax by 50% and investigating minimum pricing options. We agree with these recommendations. There is a lot of evidence to support the conclusion that increasing prices would result in a reduction of alcohol-related harms and help offset the societal costs of harmful alcohol use. Introducing a minimum pricing scheme Increasing excise tax alone may not significantly raise the cost of very cheap alcohol. High percentage, low cost alcohol would most likely still be available in alcohol stores. Implementing minimum pricing would achieve health goals that raising alcohol taxes alone cannot. Minimum pricing prevents below-cost selling and the deep discounting of alcohol that some retailers engage in. The key benefits would be raising the retail price of the alcohol products that provide the cheapest forms of absolute alcohol. Use more alcohol revenue to increase funding for education and treatment Māori, Pacific and those living in deprived neighbourhoods are more likely to experience harm from alcohol. Services are over-extended and underfunded so people cannot get the help they need. 50,000 kiwis every year want help with their substance use, largely for alcohol, but they cannot get it. Regardless of whether excise tax is raised, a greater proportion of the revenue from excise tax on alcohol should be used towards prevention, treatment, education and rehabilitation services. New Zealand has not addressed alcohol pricing or tax in years. So, our previous submission on the Alcohol Reform Bill is still relevant. We have attached this to help inform your thinking about excise tax and a minimum pricing scheme. • Submission on the Alcohol Reform Bill (2011) Alcohol Pricing, page 18-23.

NZEI Te Riu Roa (NZEI) is the professional organisation and industrial union that  represents the interests and issues of its 47,000 members.  Our members are employed  as teachers and leaders in the early childhood education and primary sectors (including   Kura Kaupapa Māori and Wharekura), support staff in the early childhood, primary,  intermediate and secondary education sectors, school advisers employed by Universities  and Colleges of Education, and Special Education staff employed by the Ministry of  Education.   2. The main objective of NZEI is to advance the cause of quality  public education generally  while upholding and maintaining the just claims of its members individually and  collectively.  3. NZEI is one of the largest unions and professional bodies in Aotearoa and has a long  history of playing a positive role in the education sector and on wider social issues  affecting our members and the tamariki and whānau they serve.   NZEI POSITION   4. NZEI supports the public policy objectives behind the establishment of the Tax Working  Group, and the Group’s focus on the structure, balance and fairness of the tax system.  A  fair tax system is critical to the resourcing of  a quality public education for all New  Zealanders.  5. NZEI has no position on the details of tax policy.  Our members are both taxpayers and  work for an essential public service that is funded by tax.  However, in line with our  mission of upholding quality public education and justice for people working in  education, we welcome the Government’s commitment  to Treasury’s Living Standards  approach, and support changes to the tax system that will increase equity and fairness.     6. Specifically, our organisational values would be reflected in  changes that:  - Lead to increased income equality for families, as economic inequality is the major  factor leading to poor educational outcomes for children - Support working people’s ability to earn a sustainable income for themselves and  their families - Increase Government’s capacity to sustainably fund a 21 st  century education system  that meets everyone’s needs.    7. New Zealand’s economy has been restructured since the 1980s into an increasingly low‐ grade, low paid one, with a significant proportion of insecure work.  Paying less to  working people results in less revenue for the government.  However, taxing people on    very basi in h 8.

NZIER report -Taxing times i Key points Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to review a range of proposed taxes on the primary sector against principles of good tax policy. Taxes are necessary to fund government services, but involve potentially large economic costs The Tax Working Group convened by Victoria University of Wellington proposed a set of principles for a good tax system in its 2010 report that we have applied in assessing a series of proposed new taxes on the primary sector: • Efficiency and growth • Equity and fairness • Revenue integrity • Fiscal cost • Compliance and administration cost • Coherence. No tax that raises the levels of revenue required by modern economies can meet these criteria at the same time: trade-offs are required In practice, public finance economics recommends that governments adopt a ‘broad- base, low-rate’ (BB/LR) approach to designing tax systems: • Taxes should apply to wide ranges of activities • Individual taxes on specific sub-sectors of the economy should be avoided • Rates of taxation should be as low as possible, while still meeting revenue needs and equity concerns • Taxes should be seen as a system, not a collection of individual measures designed to meet specific policy objectives. New Zealand’s current tax system has been consistently assessed as being one of the best in the OECD at raising revenue at least cost While reviews by local and international bodies have recommended changes at the margin, no serious case has been made for moving away from the BB/LR approach. Most of the tax policy proposals advanced prior to the 2017 general election by parties now forming part of or supporting the Government find little support in our framework • Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water might be justified on efficiency grounds, but should be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a robust assessment of the actual public policy problem such measures are seeking to address • Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on any grounds: it would be an outlier within the New Zealand tax system (i.e. it NZIER report -Taxing times ii would be the only tax applied exclusively to an exported product), is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it is applied on a very narrow base (i.e. one product) and would likely raise very little revenue • Applying a tax to one by-product of farming (nitrate) is difficult to justify: it would be an additional tax on one production process; is likely to have high compliance and administrative costs because it would be applied on a very narrow base and would likely raise very little revenue. Using the proceeds of this tax to finance specific expenditure would likely lead to sub-optimal spending or taxation levels • Extending the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to agriculture can be justified, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences, especially international leakage and loss of competitiveness, are to be avoided.

Introduction Leading up to the 2017 general election, the political parties now forming or supporting the Government proposed a range of new taxes on the primary sector. A number of these proposals, with some modifications, are on the new Government’s agenda. Federated Farmers of New Zealand Inc., B+LNZ (Beef + Lamb New Zealand Ltd), DairyNZ, Horticulture NZ, and IrrigationNZ have asked us to assess these proposals against principles of good tax policy. In undertaking this review, we have adopted a systems approach. Rather than look at individual proposals in isolation, we have examined how they would fit within the whole New Zealand tax system. The Tax Working Group (TWG), which conducted the last major review of taxes in New Zealand, stressed that system-wide coherence was one of the key principles it used. We return to the TWG’s other principles below. 1.1. New Zealand tax policy Given our focus on the tax system, we first outline the basic structure of that system and the policy considerations have been used to arrive at where we are today. After a series of reforms undertaken in the 1980s and 1990s, the New Zealand tax system has long been regarded as one of most efficient within the OECD. 1 The guiding principle that has led to this result goes by the general name broad-base low-rate (BB/LR). Major features of the BB/LR approach in New Zealand have been: • Repeal of many small, ad hoc, taxes and charges, like stamp duty and the TV licence fee • Repeal of taxes that might be justified on equity grounds, but which raised a limited amount of revenue, were costly to administer and were relatively easy to avoid, like gift and death duty • Replacing taxes on business inputs (like tariffs 2 and the wholesale sales tax) with taxes on outputs (income and consumption), i.e. Goods and Services Tax (GST) • Progressive removal of tax incentives – departures from treatments applied to sectors or the whole economy designed to promote specific economic developments – and the resulting increases in revenue used to fund across- the-board rate reductions. Today, the New Zealand government annually raises about $67 billion or 91% of total revenue from the income tax and GST. Of the remaining 9%, 4.5% is road user charges 1 Mourougane (2007), p. 2. 2 While the removal of tariffs was undertaken as part of a trade liberalisation programme and wider economic reform agenda, tariffs had been a major source of general revenue for successive governments. For example, in 1915, customs and excise duties contributed 56.03% of total revenue, falling to a modest 33.26% in 1934 (Statistics New Zealand 1935). NZIER report -Taxing times 2 and fuel excise; 3.5% is excises on tobacco and alcohol and the remaining 0.8% is comprised of a range of smaller taxes. 3 Successive governments wishing to change tax revenue have altered the rates of income tax and GST, rather than add or repeal specific taxes. Figure 1 Income tax and GST raise over 90% of the Government’s annual revenue Projections for financial year ended 30 June 2018 Source: Treasury 1.2. A much-reviewed system Since BB/LR was adopted as a guiding principle for tax policy, there have been many reviews of the New Zealand tax system undertaken both locally and by international bodies like the OECD and the IMF. Three major local reviews have been: • The Committee of Experts of Tax Policy (1999) 4 • Tax Review 2001 (2002) 5 • The Tax Working Group (2010). 6 Comprehensive reviews of the tax system were undertaken by the OECD in 2000 and 2007. Successive biennial Economic Surveys of New Zealand by the OECD have also 3 Tariffs ($148m), gaming duties ($240m), motor vehicle fees, ($237m), petroleum and mineral royalties ($200m). Approved Issuer Levy and cheque duty ($31m) and energy resources levies ($31m). All figures are revenue raised for the year ended 30 June 2017. 4 https://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/sites/default/files/1998-other-tax-compliance.pdf 5 http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/reviews-consultation/taxreview2001 6 https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/twg Income tax: individualsIncome tax: companiesGSTRoad transportExcisesOther NZIER report -Taxing times 3 considered tax matters to greater or lesser degree. 7 Likewise, the IMF’s routine consultations with the New Zealand authorities also address tax policy. 8 While each of these reviews have made recommendations for specific changes to the tax system, none has suggested moving away from the current overall BB/LR approach. 1.3. Principles of good tax policy The BB/LR approach is the result of applying a set of consistent principles. In this report, we have used the six principles of a good tax system proposed by the TWG in 2010. These principles are very similar to those applied by successive governments and recommended by the OECD and the IMF. 9 The TWG explained its principles as: 10 • Efficiency and growth: Taxes should be efficient and minimise as far as possible impediments to economic growth. That is, the tax system should avoid unnecessarily distorting the use of resources (e.g. causing biases toward one form of investment versus another) and imposing heavy costs on individuals and firms. Another term used to describe efficient taxes is “neutrality”. • Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. The burden of taxes differs across individuals and businesses depending on which bases and rates are adopted. Assessment of both vertical equity (the relative position of those on different income levels or in different circumstances) and horizontal equity (the consistent treatment of those at similar income levels, or similar circumstances) is important. The timeframe is also important, including how equity compares over peoples’ life-times. • Revenue integrity: The tax system should be sustainable over time, minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage, and provide a sustainable revenue base for government. • Fiscal cost: Tax reforms need to be affordable given fiscal constraints. 11 • Compliance and administration cost: The tax system should be as simple and low cost as possible for taxpayers to comply with and for the Inland Revenue Department to administer. 12 • Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. 7 Reviews since 1975 can be found online at: http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-economic-surveys-new- zealand\_19990162 8 See http://www.imf.org/en/Countries/NZL. 9 See Brys et al. (2016) and International Monetary Fund (2017), especially Chapter 2. 10 Tax Working Group (2010) p. 15. 11 As none of the proposals we are examining involve reductions in revenue, we have not needed to apply this criterion. 12 The TWG was focused mainly on income tax, hence the reference to Inland Revenue. New Zealand Customs administers tariff duties, excise taxes and GST on imports. The New Zealand Transport Authority (road user charges and motor vehicle licence fees), the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (mineral royalties) and the Department of Internal Affairs (gaming duty) also administer various tax regimes. NZIER report -Taxing times 4 1.4. The special case of taxing economic rents There is one case where public finance economics recommends a departure from the general principle of neutrality, and that is the taxation of natural resources like minerals where the owners of rights to exploit those resources can earn excess profits, or economic rents. Partly because mineral resources are not a large part of the New Zealand economy, whether departing from the BB/LR approach is justified in the case of natural resource taxation has not featured prominently in local tax policy debates. 13 However, the Labour Party’s proposal to impose a tax on all commercial uses of water was an example of such a tax, and therefore we will provide a brief discussion of the main elements of such taxes. One important feature of economic rents is that they can be taxed with little or no efficiency cost. 14 This is because economic rents are an extra return above that required to compensate the owner of the capital earning the rent for risk and the opportunity cost of their investment. Taxing away that extra return, or a part of it, does not diminish the attractiveness of the investment compared to investment that only earn “normal” (i.e. rent-free) profits. So just taxing rents would not cause investors to reduce the amount that they have invested. Under a traditional income tax, economic rents are taxed at the same rate as all other returns to capital and labour. 15 Some countries, therefore, impose additional taxes on owners of natural resources that can earn rents. The Australian Treasury has long favoured resource rental taxes, given the importance of extractive industries to Australia’s economy. 16 While the case for taxing rents is conceptually sound, differentiating between normal and excess rates of return is difficult in practice. Most countries do not include additional taxes on rents in their main income taxes. Royalties on extraction, which are easier to measure (because they are often charged on the quantity mined, rather than the profits earned) are, however, common. New Zealand applies royalties to a small number of minerals (petroleum, coal, gold), raising about $200 million annually. 13 Resource rental taxes are different from the more common environmental taxes used to correct market failures that lead to sub-optimal levels of pollution. We discuss this issue further in Section 2.3. Although environmental taxes were out of scope of the 2010 TWG, the 2001 Tax Review did discuss ‘Eco Charges’. The Labour Party and the Green Party have advocated for environmental taxes in their tax and environmental policies and we note that the terms of reference of the recently announced review of the New Zealand tax system includes how the tax system can help deliver positive environmental and ecological outcomes. 14 Garnaut (2010). 15 It is possible, at least conceptually, to design a broad-based tax that taxes rents at a higher rate than normal returns. A cash- flow tax is one such instrument, and implementing such a tax remains the goal of many tax policy experts in the United States. In its 2017 review of the United States economic policy, the IMF recommended that the United States convert its income tax to a cash-flow tax and elements of this proposal were enacted as part of the President Trump’s tax bill. Some years ago, the New Zealand Treasury investigated whether a cash flow tax was practical in New Zealand and decided it wasn’t, mainly for reasons to do with the fiscal and economic cost of a transition. See Katz (1999) and Wilson (2002). 16 See Australian Treasury (2009). NZIER report -Taxing times 5 1.5. New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme Introduced in 2008, the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), while technically not a tax or a charge, is a significant economic instrument used to change behaviour. A carbon tax is an alternative instrument often used to achieve the same goals as an ETS, and indeed, the Green Party proposed in its manifesto that the NZ ETS be replaced by such a tax. It is, therefore, appropriate to provide a brief description of the scheme here. 17 The NZ ETS puts a price on greenhouse gas emissions. This is intended to create a financial incentive for people to invest in technologies and practices that reduce emissions. The NZ ETS requires all sectors of New Zealand’s economy to report on their emissions and, with the exception of biological emissions from agriculture, to purchase and surrender emissions units to the Government for those emissions. Just over half of New Zealand’s greenhouse gas emissions are covered by the NZ ETS’ surrender obligations. The scheme also encourages forest planting by allowing eligible foresters to earn emission units as their trees grow and absorb carbon dioxide. An emission unit represents one metric tonne of carbon dioxide, or the carbon dioxide equivalent of any other greenhouse gas. Currently, the only eligible emissions unit in the NZ ETS is the New Zealand Unit (NZU). Figure 2 provides a schematic overview of how the NZ ETS works.

What has the Government proposed? Prior to the election, the Labour Party, New Zealand First and the Green Party all issued manifestos that proposed changes to the taxes applied to the primary sector. More details are in Appendix A. Following the government formation process, a number of these proposals are to proceed, at least in a modified form. Some of the proposals to be adopted are amalgams of the various parties’ positions, others are conditional on further study and, in some cases, the policy announcement is not to proceed with proposed initiatives in the first term of the Government. The proposals that we have analysed in this report are: • A tax on all commercial users of water (which is not to proceed this term, but could conceivably be considered post-2020). Included in this analysis is a discussion of the proposal to tax exports of bottled water • A tax on nitrate (while this not proceeding this term, the proposal is a good example of how taxes on narrow bases can have high costs) • Including agriculture in the NZ ETS (which is to be subject to further study by the newly established Climate Commission). NZIER report -Taxing times 7 2. Assessment of the proposals Just because a tax can be imposed, or has been imposed in some other place or at some other time, doesn’t mean that it should be imposed. In this section, we provide our initial assessment of the policies the new Government has said it will be advancing to determine whether they might be justified on grounds of improving the overall tax system. We have also included an analysis of some of the proposals that the Government has indicated will not be progressed immediately, because they represent interesting examples of how to analyse taxes within our framework, and because such taxes could be considered at a later date by government. This analysis is only preliminary, as many of the important details of what has been proposed have yet to be announced. 2.1. Summary of assessment In Table 1, we provide a high-level summary of our assessment against the TWG’s principles.

Resource rental tax on water Table 2 The water royalty could be justified on efficiency grounds Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First specifically states that the proposal to place a royalty on the commercial uses of water will not proceed this Parliamentary term. Given the prominence of this issue prior to the election, we include some high-level commentary on this matter. Again, detailed analysis is not possible given the lack of detail on these specific proposals. As we noted above, there is a conceptual case for applying an additional tax on owners of rights to use natural resources where they can earn economic rents. However, there are many steps required from that case to deciding in practice whether a royalty should be applied to users of water in New Zealand. The first, and perhaps most important, is whether rents are actually being earned and, if so, why. Using water for agricultural purposes is often capital intensive, as it requires investment in water storage and irrigation equipment, in addition to operating costs of irrigation (electricity, etc.) and resource management costs. The return on this investment will not likely give rise to rents and should thus only be subject to normal income tax treatment. This is a further example of the potential complexity of a resource rental tax. In the case of most natural resources like minerals, rents arise because of the finite supply of the resources, which is a product of nature. Water itself is not a finite resource in New Zealand (notwithstanding droughts) in the way that minerals are. Minerals, once mined, are not replaced by nature. Water, however, is continually going through a cycle as rain water eventually returns to clouds via evaporation. 18 18 Tietenberg and Lewis, (2012), p. 206. NZIER report -Taxing times 9 Figure 3 The water cycle is complex Source: US Geological Survey The water cycle, can however, be measured in millennia. Water that seeps into deep aquifers (groundwater storage in the picture above) may be trapped for thousands of years, as is water that falls as snow and forms glaciers and ice sheets. 19 Water that is taken from anywhere in the cycle, from rivers and streams or underground bores and used for man-made purpose (drinking, irrigation, etc.), will eventually be returned to the cycle in some form. 20 Rights to use water in New Zealand are the product of law, not nature. If it is established that these laws give rise to rents (which is far from certain or simple), then a better approach would be to question whether the laws are efficient. If they are found not to be, then addressing the conditions in law that give rise to rents, rather than using the indirect measure of a tax on excess profits would make sense. More generally, the entire question of water use and its regulation is a complex matter that is still under active consideration. 21 We note, in particular, that the stated aim of the policy is “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. 22 It is not clear to us that using a tax would represent the best and most efficient way of achieving this aim. Using taxes to align private and social costs, as is the case with externalities, requires the government to know the difference between those costs. That is, how 19 For a description of the hydrological cycle, see the United States Geological Survey’s website at: https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclesummary.html#infiltration. 20 This raises the point of where in the water cycle any royalty should apply: should it just apply to water taken from rivers, streams and aquifers, or also to rain water? 21 See Ministry for the Environment (2017). 22 Labour Party Manifesto 2017: Water, p.8. NZIER report -Taxing times 10 much the tax should be. (We return to this point below when considering the nitrate tax). The Labour Party’s proposal was to apply different rates of tax to different uses of water in each region. This would give the royalty the nature of a charge for use, which would be more efficiently imposed by way of tradeable permits or auctions, because these regimes have the advantage of revealing the true social value of the resource. Applying a resource rental tax on all uses of water should, therefore, be compared with other regulatory instruments, following a strong assessment of the actual problem such measures are seeking to address. 2.2.1. Bottled water royalty Following the coalition formation negotiations, the Government announced that it would introduce a “royalty” on exports of bottled water. No details have been announced regarding the rate of the royalty, on whom it will be levied and by whom it would it will be administered. Also unavailable is any clear discussion of what policy problem the royalty is intended to address. This tax is not specifically directed at the agricultural sector: if anything, it is a tax on part of the manufacturing sector. The context of the proposal, however, is clearly the Labour Party’s proposal for a wider tax on commercial users of water, which the new Government has announced is not going to proceed in the term of the current parliament. We have included this tax in our report because it represents a recent example of how very specific proposals can emerge from the government formation process without the usual input from experts and consultation with affected parties. Table 3 The royalty on bottled water is very hard to justify Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence      Source: NZIER The Labour Party’s original proposal was based on concerns about the way in which water use rights are allocated. If that is the case with the narrower proposal, then it might be better to change that over time, rather than introducing a new narrow tax. This all points to the need for a clear problem definition and for all alternative solutions to be considered. One possible way to impose this tax would be to use the current excise regime, administered by New Zealand Customs, which is a product-specific tax regime, albeit one that applies only to domestic consumption. As excises are not charged on exports NZIER report -Taxing times 11 the system used for items like wine and spirits would require modification if it were to apply to exported water. 23 Because it will apply to a narrow sub-sector of the economy, it is likely to involve proportionately high administrative and compliance costs. To put this in context, the value of bottled water exports from New Zealand is very small, as shown in Figure 4. 24 If the tax was set at the GST rate (15%), it would have raised about $1.8 million in 2017. Officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade have advised Parliament that taxing water exports could breach New Zealand’s trade agreements. 25 If it were subject to a tax, bottled water would be the only manufactured export that would be taxable by New Zealand (under New Zealand’s GST regime, exports are zero- rated and royalties on minerals apply equally to exports and domestic consumption). Figure 4 Bottled water exports are very small Value of exports in NZD at FOB of bottled water for the year ending 30 June Source: Statistics New Zealand Taxing exported bottled water in isolation is difficult to justify on tax policy grounds. It goes against the BB/LR approach. We note that commercial bottlers of water are subject to income tax on their profits. If the industry continues to grow at its current 23 Under the Customs and Excise Act, the manufacture of goods subject to excise in New Zealand must take place in a Customs controlled area. Goods that are intended for home consumption are taxed at the time they leave the controlled area (called “entered for home consumption”). Goods that are intended for export are either exported immediately after they leave the manufacturing area or are moved to a licensed export warehouse and are exempt from duty. 24 The data in Error! Reference source not found. relates to exports of natural and mineral water without additives. We take this to be the target of the Government’s proposal. Exports of drinks that contain or are made from water (like soft drinks and beer) are clearly much higher. However, they are not “water”. This point shows another problematic aspect of the proposal: what is to be counted as “water”. 25 New Zealand Herald 30 November: “Tax on water exports would breach NZ trade agreements says top MFAT official”. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1&objectid=11950475 0 2,000,000 4,000,000 6,000,000 8,000,000 10,000,000 12,000,000 14,000,000 1998200020022004200620082010201220142016 NZIER report -Taxing times 12 rate, then, assuming bottlers continue to be profitable, the sector will make a greater proportional contribution to the tax take. It is unclear why an additional tax is required. 2.3. Nitrate tax Table 4 A nitrate tax scores poorly Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓  ✓   Source: NZIER The Green Party proposed a specific levy of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy is an impost on an input, while the principles of good tax policy state that outputs (income and consumption) should be taxed. It is also a tax on one input into dairy farming, rather than applying generally. This levy is also an example of an important finding in public finance economics about the difference between regulation of prices versus quantities. 26 In cases of environmental externalities, the desired outcome is to reduce the quantity of pollution to an optimal level. Environmental economics does not consider pollution a bad thing in its own right, due to a reduction in amenity values. 27 Rather, the environmental economics framework considers pollution undesirable only if it is the result of a breakdown in the decision-making process of the relevant market, most often in the form of externalities, 28 but also due to public goods 29 or instances of common property. 30 Provided economic decision-makers are taking all the costs and benefits of their actions into account (along with other conditions), markets will operate to produce an equilibrium outcome and this outcome will be optimal. 31 The central contribution of 26 The seminal article is Weitzman (1974). 27 Not to be confused with a large body of literature on how to value the conservation of natural resources, especially national parks, which is critically interested in amenity values. 28 Where the full benefits or costs of an activity are not accurately reflected in market prices. 29 Where it is not possible for firms to set prices equal to marginal cost. Maler (1985) presents an extensive welfare framework for environmental economics based on “the environment" being a public good (although he does also suggest that it is a common property good). 30 Where profit-maximising firms do not face the true scarcity value of an input. 31 Pigou (1920/2005) is often credited as being the first person to state this result, although Sedgewick is also credited at having touched on the matter in his Principles of Political Economy. Baumol (1972) was an early developer of the formal version of the modern concept of Pigouvian taxes and Baumol and Oates (1988) did much to popularise its use. NZIER report -Taxing times 13 economics to the study of environmental issues is that there may be a non-zero optimal level of pollution. 32 This is still a current view. 33 Government will seldom be able to predict with much certainty what the optimal level of pollution will be. While economics predicts that applying a tax will reduce the quantity produced, the amount of that reduction is an empirical matter that can only be determined by measurement of the responsiveness of supply and demand to price (known as elasticities). We are not aware of whether the $2 levy proposed by the Green Party will be sufficient to achieve an optimal level of nitrate use. An alternative approach, which is in use in Taupō, is to set the quantity of nitrate that can be used and then use a rights-trading regime to deliver the optimal outcome of social marginal cost equalling social marginal benefit. 34 The Green Party’s proposal is that the revenue raised by the levy will be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. We assume that means “environmentally sustainable” given the traditional focus of the Green Party. Thus, the levy would be what is called a “tied-tax”. But not only is the revenue tied to a particular expenditure, that expenditure is to be directed at reducing the very thing that is being taxed. It is possible, therefore, that the tax would be the victim of its own success. If the tax is very successful in reducing nitrate use, then the amount of revenue raised will fall and it may be that the amount raised would be insufficient to fund the desired level of expenditure. 2.4. Extending the NZ ETS Table 5 Extending the NZ ETS could be justified Efficiency Equity Revenue integrity Compliance and administration cost Coherence ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ ✓ Source: NZIER Extending the NZ ETS to agriculture can be justified within the tax policy framework we are using to assess proposals, but would need to be undertaken as part of a comprehensive policy programme if unintended consequences are to be avoided. 32 See Bator (1974) for an early contribution along these lines. 33 Stavins (2008) begins his entry on environmental economics in the New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics with: “The fundamental theoretical argument for government activity in the environmental realm is that pollution is an externality: an unintended consequence of market decisions, which affects individuals other than the decision maker". 34 Lake Taupo nitrogen cap and trade programme was established in 2011 as part of Waikato Regional Council’s Regional Plan. For details, see: https://www.waikatoregion.govt.nz/Community/Your-community/For-Farmers/Taupo/Nitrogen- management-in-the-Lake-Taupo-catchment/. For reviews of the scheme, see OECD (2015) and Duhon, McDonald and Kerr (2015). NZIER report -Taxing times 14 Issues of leakage (where production shifts to another country that does not impose a carbon charge) and export competitiveness are critically important issues to address to avoid imposing a cost for limited or no environmental benefits. Although there is some evidence that it is possible to lower emission rates from agricultural activity without reducing livestock numbers (for example, by use of nitrogen inhibitors in fertiliser application, or by feed management in growing cattle), measurement of emissions from a specific agricultural activity (for example, by individual livestock) is currently not achievable. 35 The aim of any domestic policy decisions regarding agriculture (and indeed any sector subject to emissions reduction initiatives) should be to minimise the total long-run cost of meeting New Zealand’s climate change commitments in a global context, including the cost of fulfilling any obligations arising from failure to meet these commitments. Ensuring that the benefits are greater than the costs, even if the costs seem very large and global in scale, is a core part of public policy. Benefits, however, are not just financial, nor are costs. Matters like international reputation, support for rules-based global solutions for global problems and burden-sharing between developed and developing countries are all important, but are unlikely to determine optimal domestic policies. This objective captures the relatively simple point that the lowest cost means of meeting the climate change target should be adopted. Although this is a simple point, it is not necessarily one that is easy to achieve. The reality is that it may prove cheaper to pay emitters in another country to reduce emissions rather than to achieve any reduction within New Zealand. This is not a failure of policy. All emissions regardless of where in the world they are emitted will become part of the global atmosphere and thus make the same contribution to climate change as any other emissions. 36 All costs should be considered when designing policy, for example, a balance should be sought between the benefit of including all emitters in any scheme, and the cost of monitoring individuals who have only a small effect on overall emissions. In most cases, the initial entity on whom the costs fall will not be the party who eventually pays, as the costs are diffused through the economy. The exception is where entities are exposed to international competition. In this case, they are unlikely to be able to increase prices to reflect the cost of climate change mitigation policy (unless the policy is international). This means that the party that receives the benefit of the emission (the consumer) does not also bear the cost of the emission. As much of New Zealand’s agricultural production is destined for export markets where it is a price-taker, there are clear risks to competitiveness if New Zealand imposes commitments on agriculture when other countries have not. The design and effect of the free-allocation system that the Government has proposed will therefore be very important for determining the outcome of extending the scheme. 35 Kerr (2016) and Hollis et al. (2016). 36 However, the process of international carbon trading has been controversial and the New Zealand Government decided in 2015 to limit the ETS to domestic market. NZIER report -Taxing times 15 The compliance and administration costs of the NZ ETS will depend very much on how the scheme is extended to cover livestock emissions, including key issues like point of obligation, and there is still a lot of policy uncertainty over the how the scheme will work in practice. For example, if the obligation to surrender units is applied at the processor level (the current default in the legislation), then providing individual farms with an incentive to reduce emissions without reducing stock numbers will be dependent on how the economic impact of the scheme is passed down the production chain. 37 In a major report to Business New Zealand in 2007, when plans for the NZ ETS were in their infancy, NZIER set out a series of pre-conditions that would need to be met before establishing such a scheme would be justified. 38 While much has transpired since, those pre-conditions remain relevant to considering the question of whether agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. At the international level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • Acceptance that climate change presents a sufficient risk, albeit one with uncertainty, for it to be prudent to take action now to reduce the probability of significantly larger damage and costs later; • Understanding of the potential for significant amelioration of climate change through reductions of emissions from human activities; • International commitments to reduce emissions with an internationally agreed means of counting net emissions; and • New Zealand and international agreement among a significant number of countries on emissions reduction targets. These conditions now seem to have been largely met, particularly following the Paris Accord. At the domestic level, the pre-conditions we proposed were: • An accurate and comprehensive emissions monitoring and reporting system, for measuring performance relative to targets and reconciling abatement with allowances and credits; • The conditions required for a market to operate – a clearly and specifically defined tradable unit, transferability of units and enforcement of transfer, sufficient numbers of competitive buyers and sellers, institutions and infrastructure for trade and exchange, and reasonable transaction costs; • Established accounting, financial reporting and tax rules for participants in the ETS to use; • Sufficient economic efficiency benefits from trading to outweigh the costs of establishing and operating an ETS; • Public and social consensus that emissions trading will deliver the intended policy outcomes such as controlling emissions, without significant 37 If processors add a charge per head for animals processed at an abattoir or per kilo of milk solids in the case of dairy farming, then the economic impact on farmers would be invariant to the amount of effort applied to reduce emissions at the level of individual animals. 38 Branson et al. (2007). NZIER report -Taxing times 16 unintended side-effects. This will require there to have been a thorough economic analysis of the potential impacts of any ETS for New Zealand; and • Sufficient public and social consensus on the need for moving towards emissions trading to ensure durability and avoid disruptive policy reversals that undermine the value of investments and confidence in the system. Experience with the NZ ETS to date means that there is now more evidence available regarding whether these pre-conditions can be met than there was in 2007. We note that Federated Farmers and other sector groups have been active in continuing to engage with the Government on these issues, for example in its submission to the last review of the NZ ETS. 39 Despite its conceptual appeal, applying the NZ ETS to biologically-based emissions would still be a world-first and the case for doing so is yet to be made. The above list of pre-conditions remains, in our view, an appropriate starting point for further official consideration of this matter. 39 We note that in addition to Federated Farmers also made a submission to the Productivity Commission’s inquiry into a low emissions economy. Federated, Horticulture NZ, Beef+Lamb NZ, and Dairy NZ are all members (along with some other agricultural sector groups and the Ministry of Primary Industries) of the Biological Emissions Reference Group (or BERG) which has been working over to jointly build an agreed evidence-base on current and future opportunities to mitigate biological (methane and nitrous oxide) greenhouse gas emissions on-farm and the costs and opportunities and barriers of doing so.

NZIER report -Taxing times 19 Appendix A Detailed proposals This appendix outlines the details of the taxes studied in the main body of this report. A.1 Labour policy A.1.1 Freshwater royalty In its manifesto, the Labour Party proposed a “freshwater royalty”, that would be applied to “large commercial users”, including water bottlers, irrigators and other industrial users. The stated purpose of the royalty was to “encourage the best and most efficient use of freshwater”. Some features that were to apply were: • The royalty would be set on a per cubic metre basis • Different rates would apply in different regions, and different uses would also attract different rates • A premium would be charged on the taking of pristine water suitable for bottling • Details of the scheme would be developed by experts, including the Treasury, with input from users, councils and other stakeholders. A.1.2 Climate change The Labour Party committed to setting a target of net zero for greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with legally binding emissions reduction targets, and carbon budgets to keep New Zealand on track to this goal. It also promised to establish an independent Climate Commission to recommend interim emissions reduction targets and provide advice on the ramifications of not achieving them. A Climate Commission has independently been recommended by the New Zealand Parliamentary Commission for the Environment, based on the model of the UK Climate Change Act. 40 A.1.3 Emissions trading In its environmental manifesto, the Labour Party proposed that it would reform the NZ ETS so it puts a price on carbon that drives behaviour change away from carbon- polluting goods and services towards low or zero-carbon options. As part of these reforms, the Labour Party announced that it would not allow the importation of international units until “it is clear that they have environmental integrity, are from a reputable source and a mature international market, and are realistically priced; and for the foreseeable future will manage access to any such units through direct acquisition by the Government”. More generally, it proposed that at least 50% of all units surrendered to meet obligations under the NZ ETS would need to be NZUs issued by the New Zealand Government. 40 Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (2017). NZIER report -Taxing times 20 It also proposed to bring agriculture into the NZ ETS in its first term with a free allocation of 90%. 41 A.2 Green Party policy A.2.1 Nitrate tax In its policy paper, Clean Water, Great Farming, the Green Party proposed to implement a nitrate pollution levy, calculated using the nutrient management tool OVERSEER, to incentivise farmers to pollute less. For an initial period of three years, the levy would only apply to dairy farmers. Over an unspecified timeframe, the Green Party said that the levy would be extended to include beef and sheep farming, other agriculture, horticulture, and other sources of nitrogen pollution. The levy would be set at a rate of $2 per kilogram of nitrate leached per hectare per year. The levy would be collected from dairy processors, not individual farmers. The revenue (estimated by the Greens at $136.5 million), would be used to fund sustainable farming programmes and the clean-up of waterways. A.2.2 Replacing NZ ETS in favour of carbon charges The Green Party’s Climate Protect Plan proposes replacing the NZ ETS with a “Kiwi Climate Fund”. The fund will be a combination of a tax of carbon emissions, a bounty on carbon absorption by forests and a universal payment system to recycle revenue to adult New Zealand citizens and residents. While an independent Climate Commission will advise on rates of any taxes, the Green Party expects prices at the following levels to be indicative of what would be set in 2020: • $40 per tonne of carbon dioxide emissions (excluding biological emissions); • $6 per tonne of nitrous oxide emissions from agriculture; and • $3 per tonne of methane emissions from agriculture. The policy states that levels of taxes would rise over time “in line with the necessity of reaching net zero emissions by 2050”. Foresters would receive a “guaranteed minimum payment” for every tonne of carbon dioxide sequestered. This would “initially” be set at the same rate that applies to emission, i.e. $40 per tonne. A.3 New Zealand First New Zealand First proposed to repeal the NZ ETS and replace it with a UK/Norway- style Climate Change Act and to establish a new Parliamentary Commission for Climate Change as an Office of Parliament. The Parliamentary Commissioner would be responsible for reporting against both the Kyoto and Paris Accord by setting a three- 41 Under transitional provisions in the NZ ETS, when trade-exposed sectors become covered by the scheme, emitters are given a free allocation of emission units, based on emission levels in the past. NZIER report -Taxing times 21 yearly ‘Carbon Budget’ designed to reach these commitments (first Budget to become operative in 2021). Resources previously devoted to the NZ ETS would be applied to research and development and climate change adaptation. The Parliamentary Commissioner would also provide independent advice to central and local government on meeting the Carbon Budget and preparing for climate change. A.4 The Government’s agenda The new Government’s policy programme is based on a coalition agreement between the Labour Party and New Zealand First and an agreement on confidence and supply between the Labour Party and the Green Party. A.4.1 Labour Party and New Zealand First coalition agreement Specific tax and related provisions directed at the primary sector in the coalition agreement are: • Introduce a royalty on exports of bottled water • No resource rentals for water in this term (2017 to 2020) of Parliament • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and an independent Climate Commission, based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment • If the Climate Commission determines that agriculture is to be included in the NZ ETS, then upon entry, the free allocation to agriculture will be 95% but with all revenues from this source recycled back into agriculture in order to encourage agricultural innovation, mitigation and additional planting of forestry. 42 A.4.2 Labour Party and Green Party confidence and supply agreement The agreement between Labour and the Green Party includes the following matters: • Adopt and make progress towards the goal of a Net Zero Emissions Economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries in accordance with milestones to be set by an independent Climate Commission and with a focus on establishing Just Transitions for exposed regions and industries • Introduce a Zero Carbon Act and establish an independent Climate Commission • All new legislation will have a climate impact assessment analysis • A comprehensive set of environmental, social and economic sustainability indicators will be developed 42 Note that the Labour Party’s proposal of 90% free-allocation has been increased to 95% and there is now a proposal to recycle “revenues” from the agricultural sector. It is unclear what this relates to, as the ETS operates by way of units, not money. NZIER report -Taxing times 22 • A new cross-agency climate change board of public sector CEOs will be established. A.4.3 Climate change Under the Paris Agreement, New Zealand has committed to reduce its emissions to 30% below 2005 levels by 2030, and under the Climate Change Response Act 2002, has committed to reduce its emissions to 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The new Government has stated its intention to adopt and make progress towards the goal of a net zero emissions economy by 2050, with a particular focus on policy development and initiatives in transport and urban form, energy and primary industries. It will establish a Climate Commission to provide independent advice and, in particular, to consider whether and how agriculture should be included within the NZ ETS. Some details of the Government’s proposed action plan are contained in a Cabinet Paper from the Minister for Climate Change considered by the Cabinet on 17 December 2017. 43 In that paper, the Minister acknowledged the transition to lower emissions will be challenging and will require a fundamental economic shift, saying: 26. New Zealand has an existing 2030 target (our Paris Agreement contribution). This commits us to a reduction in emissions to 11% below 1990 levels by 2030 (30% below 2005 levels). 27.Based on current estimates, approximately 193 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO 2 e) abatement (ie reduce emissions, absorb through forests or buy international emissions reductions) is required over the 2021-2030 period to meet this target. Achieving the 2030 target will require significant action across multiple sectors of the economy, particularly if the target is primarily to be met by domestic efforts. For example, the forecast abatement from forestry would only mitigate approximately 18 MtCO 2 e across the 2021-2030 period (I understand that the proposed Billion Trees Planting Programme could lead to between 10 and 30 MtCO 2 e of additional carbon dioxide being stored). 28. Taking bolder action on climate change will require further investment, policy intervention, social adjustment, and economic transformation. This could include moving towards 100 per cent renewable electricity generation, with: fossil fuel generation only called upon in years of hydroelectric electricity generation shortages; the electrification of low grade industrial heat sources; and a shift to mostly electric vehicles with more domestic freight carried by rail. New methane inhibitors and techniques to reduce biological emissions would also need to be developed, and we will 43 See: http://www.mfe.govt.nz/more/cabinet-papers-and-related-material-search/cabinet-papers/100-day-plan-climate- change NZIER report -Taxing times 23 need changes in land use, including substantial afforestation.

Submissions to the Tax Working Group by Tim Horsbrugh c/o Wairarapa Property Investors Association. Questions for submitters Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Current System is working well. Current System is fair, with the one exception is that rental property expenditure is for the benefits of people and this should be encouraged. (more said in my comments below) Property investors currently pay a lot in GST for renovation projects. Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Property investors often buy run down properties and then bring them upto rental standard. These expenses should be subject to either depreciation or R&M. The current system encourages landlords to rent out substandard new purchases, and then renovate a year later so these renovation expenses can be used for justified R&M or depreciation expenses. (a silly rule that goes against the tenant.) Property Investors cannot claim building depreciation, or major building improvements yet a farmer can claim depreciation for a hay barn or for a new roof on the woolshed. The tax system favours improvements to animal houses over people houses. Improvements to rental houses should be encouraged not unencouraged. With a shortage of rental property, many social housing tenants with a poor history and CV are missing out on quality accommodation. Landlords currently choose tenants who are the lower risk options. We need new housing for the lower socioeconomic people so I as a landlord should be encouraged to either build a new house, or buy another rental house and to house a social housing tenant. In order to do so we need a win win which may mean an agreement stating that for the first five years of renting I must sign up a social housing tenant, the rent can be paid from winz directly to me, and any insurance claims for damage by the tenant will be provided for by WINZ. In return there will be an incentive, like all renovation expenses can be claimed for in depreciation over this 5 year period or no capital gain tax put on this house providing I keep this for 5 plus years. We need to look for ways to encourage good behaviour to solve problems. Encourage the current landlord to find the solution to our housing crisis, rather than put up more disincentives to invest. Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? No, certainly not. This will sku the investment type. Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? There are too many disincentives with rental property. As mentioned depreciation and the new bright line test extension to 5 years are two examples. Share market trading and people who renovate their own house and sell quickly, or trade farms are not paying income tax. These areas could be tightened. The 5 year bright line test should be applied to other investment types like shares. Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? No new taxes need to be introduced.. We just need policing of the current taxes, like taxing profits made through share market speculation. (or widen the bright line test to shares) A capital gains tax other than the family home will create an uneven playing field and disruption in the market. I know many will get out of providing rental property investment and will just focus on building a beautiful castle to live in which is untaxed. This is not what is needed in NZ. Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? When a landlord replaces a leaky roof, or installs new carpet and a heatpump the cashflow from that property is terrible for a year or two. To claim a loss is critical so landlords can keep their head above water cashflow wise. Ringfencing or removing this loss will bring many landlords to their knees. Stay away from ring fencing losses otherwise rents will go up and maintenance expenditure will decline. Incentivise the long term landlords and tax the speculators. Don’t put us all in the same box. Higher taxes on rental property will only mean higher rents. This will make rental accommodation affordability worse. The best way to lower rents is with supply and demand. Not by letting the Govt build 100,000 homes, but by encouraging the private landlord to build one or two more purpose build high specked new houses each. This can easily be done. Give them better access to finance, or let them build on the back of a big section etc Give them an incentive to build a new home and house a social housing tenant for 5 years and the housing crisis will be solved. With more houses supplied to the market the prices will fall and rent will stabilise. Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? No. If a capital gains tax in introduced then it needs to be fair and across all asset types and all houses, businesses and farms......everything which includes the family home. This is fair but is also political suicide. Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? No.. as above. The rental property crisis will only get worse. Current Investors will sit on their own mansions and will get out of rental property.

It is important to highlight from the outset that the METRs as derived and presented in the TWG Paper are not what are commonly accepted to be marginal effective tax rates. In the TWG Paper, METRs have been defined as the “tax rate on real, pre-tax income for investments that earn the same rate of return.” The calculation is further obfuscated by in effect deeming the reduction in the nominal return due to the inflation component of the nominal return a tax. Ultimately, the framework, methodology and calculations confuse, nominal and real, pre and post-tax and ignore the key drivers underlying savings decisions – risk and prevailing and expected nominal after-tax returns. We consider the summary presentation of the TWG Paper METRs to be misleading as it does not represent what it purports to. It is not a schedule of METRs but a schedule of the combined marginal Income Tax, Inflation and Local Authority Rates imposts on various asset classes. Further, the TWG Paper METRs are specific to the nominal interest rate and inflation environment and do not represent an appropriate comparison across asset classes. The asset class comparisons fall short as the METRs are assessed against a fixed real rate of return and other than for Housing/Property only relate to the Bank Deposit component of PIE, Superannuation Fund or Company investment. In other words, the TWG Paper assumes that only Housing/Property has a capital return component and that PIE, Superannuation Fund and Company investments don't. This is clearly not the case. \[1\] \[1\] 2 The METRs on savings as presented in Figure 21 of the TWG Paper cannot therefore be accepted at face value. If a capital return component were to be included for PIE, Superannuation Fund and Company investments, then all three would have lower METRs than that presented in the TWG Paper analysis. The TWG Paper also omitted a key asset class being direct Share Investment. If this asset class were to be included, it would also have a lower MERT than Rental Property under the TWG Paper framework. Given underlying concerns with the TWG Paper you have asked us to expressly address a calculation of marginal effective tax rates for four specific asset classes: Bank Account, Share Investment, Rental-property (equity) and Owner-Occupied Housing (equity). Further you asked that we replicate the TWG Paper methodology to establish the equivalent risk adjusted components of the combined marginal Income Tax, Inflation and Local Authority Rates imposts on various asset classes, the marginal effective income impost (“MEII”). We have taken a different approach to the effective tax on Owner-Occupied Housing (based on the opportunity cost of renting and owning a home and specifically factoring in non-deductible maintenance expenditure required to sustain any capital appreciation). Further, we have provided for Rental-property capital gains to be subject to either no capital taxes (as per the TWG Paper) or deferred capital taxes equivalent to half the prevailing marginal tax rate on income. We emphasise that inflation is a key determinant of the differentials in the TWG Paper METR estimates as it is treated as a “tax” on Bank Deposits and although a factor in other asset classes there is a partial offset as it is also a component of the return on these assets. We have therefore isolated the “inflation impost” as this is a monetary phenomenon and should not in our view be confused with marginal effective income tax rates. Morgan Wallace Framework & Methodology Taxes are nominal and investor required rates of return are nominal after tax, in turn based on their expectations for inflation and the risk and return characteristics of specific investments. Our framework is therefore to assess the required nominal rate of return for each asset class for a given reference nominal interest rate. For each asset class we establish a distinct capital appreciation component of the return with the balance of the required rate of return delivered through the nominal income stream (interest/dividends/rent/imputed rent). The marginal effective income tax rate on savings is then derived. We then derive and separately identify the Inflation and Local Authority Rates imposts. Our assessment of the required nominal rate of return for each asset class is made through application of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). We have adopted the post-tax version of CAPM as employed by The Treasury in its capital charge regime and the Commerce Commission in its various pricing decisions. 3 Our calculation of the required nominal rate of return for each asset class assumes no leverage. Should leverage be introduced the required nominal rate of return on equity would increase correspondingly. We have prepared a spreadsheet model to not only present components of the TWG Paper METRs but also to allow scenario analysis and in particular model parameters that we consider more relevant to the prevailing economic environment. In Appendix One we step through the derivation of returns and the effective marginal income tax rates, inflation and local authority rates imposts equivalent to the TWG Paper Base Case. Morgan Wallace Analytical Outputs The components of the TWG Base Case METRs adjusted for the risk adjusted required returns of the various asset classes is a represented below. The key inputs into the TWG Paper Base Case are the Real Pre-tax Interest Rate, Inflation and the Real Pre-tax Capital Gain rate (3%, 2% and 1% respectively). Morgan Wallace notes that collectively the TWG Paper Base Case assumptions are inconsistent with the prevailing nominal interest rate environment as they deliver up a required risk free nominal interest rate of 5% when the prevailing rate is 3%. Accordingly, we present scenarios where we employ different assumptions for the Real Pre-tax Interest Rate, Inflation and the Real Pre-tax Capital Gain rate. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Bank Deposit Share Investment Rental Housing (deferred capital taxes) Rental Housing (no capital taxes) Owner-Occupied Housing Marginal Effective Income Imposts TWG Paper Base Case Return/Inflation/Capital Gain: 3%/2%/1% Nominal TaxesInflationRates 4 Scenario A B C Real Pre-tax Interest Rate 2% 2% 3% Inflation 1% 1% 0% Real Pre-Tax Capital Gain 1% 0% 1% As is clearly demonstrated in the following charts removing and/or reducing inflation and/or real pre-tax capital gains from the baseline assumptions removes much of any perceived anomaly in the marginal effective income imposts. 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Bank Deposit Share Investment Rental Housing (deferred capital taxes) Rental Housing (no capital taxes) Owner-Occupied Housing Marginal Effective Income Imposts Scenario A Return/Inflation/Capital Gain: 2%/1%/1% Nominal TaxesInflationRates 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Bank Deposit Share Investment Rental Housing (deferred capital taxes) Rental Housing (no capital taxes) Owner-Occupied Housing Marginal Effective Income Imposts Scenario B Return/Inflation/Capital Gain: 2%/1%/0% Nominal TaxesInflationRates 5 To clearly demonstrate the consequences of the Housing risk in the current economic environment where Housing affordability is at issue a further scenario is presented below consistent with the current interest rate environment but with provision for a Real Pre-tax Capital Loss of 2%. We would not dismiss such a scenario lightly noting that the Japan Home Price Index Composite for the Tokyo Metropolitan area stood at 90.96 in December 2017 in contrast to 185.47 in December 1993 a decline of 51% over 24 years 1 . 1 Sourced from http://www.reinet.or.jp/en/tentative\_calculation.html 0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%40% Bank Deposit Share Investment Rental Housing (deferred capital taxes) Rental Housing (no capital taxes) Owner-Occupied Housing Marginal Effective Income Imposts Scenario C Return/Inflation/Capital Gain: 3%/0%/1% Nominal TaxesInflationRates 0%10%20%30%40%50%60% Bank Deposit Share Investment Rental Housing (deferred capital taxes) Rental Housing (no capital taxes) Owner-Occupied Housing Marginal Effective Income Imposts Real Housing Price Falls Return/Inflation/Capital Gain: 2%/1%/(2%) Nominal TaxesInflationRates 6 Concluding Observations The Marginal Effective Income Imposts (“MEIIs” – which the TWG Paper defines as METRs) are particularly sensitive the key assumptions of Real Pre-tax Interest Rate, Inflation and the Real Pre-tax Capital Gain rate. It is our view that the principal assumptions adopted in the TWG Paper are not consistent with the prevailing expectations for real and nominal returns and need not be representative of consensus expectations for longer term real and nominal returns. Consideration of a range of scenarios is essential if a true picture of the prospective MEIIs are to be considered. Further the components of the MEIIs need to be clearly identified as relating to prevailing marginal income tax rates and expectations re likely nominal returns, inflation rates and capital asset appreciation/depreciation. Far from the suggestion in the TWG Paper that Housing is a significantly tax preferred asset class we submit that Housing has largely been an inflation preferred asset class that has benefitted particularly in the recent past from accommodating monetary policy and the associated decline in both nominal and real interest rates to historic lows. Further we note that based on our analysis direct Share Investment has been tax preferred not only to Bank Deposits but also Rental Housing. Further direct Share Investment has also been an inflation preferred asset class and does not incur Local Authority Rates. Under the TWG Paper Base Case and all scenarios presented the MEII on direct Share Investment tracks significantly below Bank deposits and Rental Housing.

Owner -Occupied Housing 0.2 (est. reduced tenancy risk) Based on the above inputs and applying the post investor tax CAPM the required returns from each asset class are given by: Risk Free x (1 – Tax) plus Beta x Post Tax Market Risk Premium The post-investor tax required returns are therefore: Bank Deposit 3.39% (5.06% x (1-33%) + 0 x 6.5%) Share Investment 7.94% (5.06% x (1-33%) + 0.7 x 6.5%) Rental Housing 5.67% (5.06% x (1-33%) + 0.35 x 6.5%) Owner-occupied Housing 4.69% (5.06% x (1-33%) + 0.2 x 6.5%) Components of post-investor tax required returns: Capital Income Bank Deposit 0 3.39% Share Investment 2 4.91% 2.89% Housing 3 Rental 3.02% 2.57% Owner-Occupied 3.02% 1.62% The equivalent pre-tax returns depend on the effective tax rates. The TWG Paper assumed nil for Housing Capital returns and applied the marginal tax rate for Bank Deposits and added Rates back to the marginal tax rate for Housing. As noted previously no consideration was given to the taxation of direct Share Investments. 2 The Smartshare NZ Top 50 Fund Gross Dividend Yield is currently 4.31% and therefore assuming tax of 33% the Net Yield would be 2.89%. The balance of the required rate of return is assumed to be capital gain. 3 The TWG Paper provides for 1% real capital gain. The balance of the required return is assumed to be Net re nt/imputed rent. The TWG Paper assumes a lower income yield of 1.98% on the basis of delivering a capped real return of 3%. 8 We consider the marginal tax rate on Housing Capital returns dependent upon the specific status of the investor. For owner-occupied housing the rate can safely be assumed to be nil. For Rental-property it would certainly be less than the marginal tax rate due to the ability to defer tax but need not be nil. We have therefore considered alternative assumptions of 16.5% and nil. The Income yield of rents/imputed rents is assumed to be taxed at 33%. For Share Investments we have assumed a nil tax rate for Capital returns and 33% for income consistent with our assumption regarding Net Yield. Tax rates on the components of post-investor tax required returns are therefore: Capital Income Bank Deposit 0% 33% Share Investment 0% 33% Housing - Rental 0%-16.5% 33% - Owner-Occupied 0% 33% 4 The components of the required pre-tax returns as derived from the required post-tax returns are therefore: Capital Income Bank Deposit 0% 5.06% Share Investment 4.91% 4.31% Housing - Rental 3.02%-3.62% 3.83% - Owner-Occupied 3.02% 2.43% The aggregate required pre-tax returns are therefore: Bank Deposit 5.06% Share Investment 9.43% Housing - Rental 6.97% - 7.59% - Owner-Occupied 5.51% The ratio of post-tax to pre-tax returns are therefore: Bank Deposit 67% Share Investment 84% Housing - Rental 75%-81% - Owner-Occupied 85% The nominal METRs are therefore: Bank Deposit 33% Share Investment 16% Housing - Rental 19%-25% - Owner-Occupied 15% 4 The imputed rent is deemed equivalent to payments made from tax paid income including maintenance expenditure and arguably insurance essential to maintaining the real value of the asset. 9 The TWG Paper adds an inflation “tax” and a for Housing a Local Authority Rates “tax” to derive the TWG METRs, which we consider to be the marginal effective income imposts “MEIIs”. To do so the post-tax real returns are derived. Real after-tax returns: Bank Deposit 1.36% (1+3.39%)/(1+2%)-1 Share Investment 5.82% (1+7.94%)/(1+2%)-1 Housing - Rental 3.59% (1+5.67%)/(1+2%)-1 - Owner-Occupied 2.64% (1+4.69%)/(1+2%)-1 The real pre-tax returns are: Bank Deposit 3.00% (1+5.06%)/(1+2%)-1 Share Investment 7.29% (1+9.43%)/(1+2%)-1 Housing - Rental 4.87% (1+6.97%)/((1+2%)-1 to 5.48% (1+7.59%)/(1+2%)-1 - Owner-Occupied 3.44% (1+5.51%)/(1+2%)-1 The ratio of real post-tax to real pre-tax returns are therefore: Bank Deposit 45% Share Investment 80% Housing - Rental 66% to 74% - Owner-Occupied 77% The Real or Inflation adjusted marginal effective tax rates adjusted for the inflation impost are therefore: Bank Deposit 55% Share Investment 20% Housing - Rental 26%-34% - Owner-Occupied 23% The Inflation impost component of the returns are therefore: Bank Deposit 22% (55%-33%) Share Investment 4% (20%-16%) Housing - Rental 8% (26%-19% - rounding) to 9% (34%-25%) - Owner-Occupied 8% (23%-15%) The TWG Paper also introduces a 0.34% pre-tax provision for Local Authority Rates. This does not effect the required after tax return but in our analysis has been added to the pre-tax return to Housing equating to a 4% to 7% lift in the Housing MEIIs.

Established in 1983, the Federation has twenty affiliated local associations situated throughout New Zealand. It is the national body representing the interests of over 7,000 property investors on all matters affecting rental-housing. If an opportunity is available, the NZPIF would like to appear before the Tax Working Group Industry Background To assist readers understand the extent of the economic and social importance of the private rental industry in New Zealand and the implications of residential tenancies legislation the following background points are offered. What is the extent of the private rental industry? There are approximately 270,000 landlords in New Zealand. There are no corporate or institutional residential landlords. There are over 464,000 residential rental properties 1 , housing over 600,000 tenants, and worth around $150 billion 2 . Private landlords are the largest providers of rental accommodation in New Zealand. Approximately 85% of tenants rent from a private landlord or trust 3 . Median weekly rent for all accommodation is $380 4 . The amount spent on rent each week is $64 million and annually this is $3.3 billion. Most property investors (57%) have been engaged in the business for 10 or more years 5 , which dispels the myth that people are investing in property to make a “quick buck”. Instead, most property investors are using their rental income business as a mechanism for saving for retirement and are professional and committed long-term service/accommodation providers. 1 “Landlord group's code sets high standards” 5/9/08 NZ Herald 2 NZ Herald 10/1/07 3 2013 Census 4 Tenancy Bond Centre statistics 5 ANZ NZPIF Annual Survey 2006 4 Introduction The New Zealand Property Investors’ Federation welcomes the opportunity to provide input into the Tax Working Groups work. The stated aim of ensuring the New Zealand tax system is fair, balanced and administered well is laudable. We agree with the Government's starting position and guiding principle that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible. Our submission is limited to our area of knowledge and expertise around housing and specifically rental housing. This is a critical area as the Group is to give special regard to housing affordability in their research and reporting. The Group has been asked to report on whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy. It is critical that the Group correctly defines the productive economy as if done so then the provision of rental property to workers can only be seen as an essential part of the productive economy. The same cannot be said for buying and selling of shares. Apart from providing accommodation for a third of all New Zealanders, the rental industry pays annual tax on a net rental income of around $1.5 billion, pays rates and supports many other industries such as insurance, property management and many trades. The Group has been asked to consider whether taxing capital gains or land (except for the family home), or other housing tax measures would improve the tax system and make housing more affordable. The NZPIF is concerned that the Group has received incorrect information that has lead you to state that "rental property is undertaxed relative to other assets". A report from Finance and Economic Consultants, Morgan Wallace, shows that rental property is in fact overtaxed compared to most other assets. Other countries that have either a CGT or land tax have still seen large housing price rises, so tax is not a method to control house prices in New Zealand. In addition, increasing the cost or reducing the return of providing rental property has seen higher rental prices of the past seven years. This is leading to rental unaffordability and overcrowding, plus making it harder for aspiring first home buyers to save a deposit. Housing has for many years been targeted to ensure that property speculators pay all the tax they should. This includes the IRD establishing the Property Compliance Team and the introduction of the two year Bright Line Test. The NZPIF has always supported 5 measures to ensure property speculation is properly taxed, however the extension of the Bright Line Test to five years affects rental property purchases more than speculative property purchases. While the NZPIF promotes holding rental property for the long term, many things can happen over a five year period meaning that a property needs to be sold. The Bright Line Test therefore adds extra risk when buying and providing a rental property to tenants that does not apply to other assets. This is unfair and could lead to shortages in rental property supply. If looking to introduce fairness to the tax system, the NZPIF believes that the Bright Line Test should apply to all assets, including shares and businesses. This could be a way to increase tax revenue. DISCUSSION Tax paid by rental property Industry Regarding rental property, the current broad based system is working well despite there being a higher level of scrutiny towards property taxes than other taxes. Contrary to public opinion, NZ Rental Property Owners do pay tax, and have paid tax on approximately $1.4b of rental income in each of the last five years. In addition, their spending on maintenance, upgrading their properties, insulation, insurance, rates and all the other costs they carry have resulted in substantial GST payments to Inland Revenue. The current system is a good blend of encouraging investment in relatively low yielding property and providing relatively cheaper rental prices for tenants while still contributing significantly to New Zealand's taxation revenue requirements. While many commentators continue to state that rental property has a tax advantage, the IRD have continually advised that housing is not tax advantaged in New Zealand. A recent report into Marginal Effective Tax Rates by Finance and Economic Consultancy, Morgan Wallace, confirms the IRD position. The 2010 Tax Working Group claimed that rental property lost $500m a year and therefore was a net tax taker rather than a tax payer. This was repeated so often that it is still believed to be true by many. However the 2010 TWG's own information showed that rental property only made a loss in two of the past 27 years. Updated IRD information shows that the rental 6 property industry actually only made a loss in one year since their records started in 1981. The reason for the loss was a peak in mortgage interest rates during 2008 which could not be passed onto tenants through higher rents. This demonstrates that rental property owners protect tenants from interest rate fluctuations. The following graph 1 is an update of the 2010 TWG's graph, showing that the rental property industry pays tax on approximately $1.4 billion of rental income a year. As such the rental property industry pays a considerable amount of tax, with the level of tax appearing to be increasing. Graph 1 Balancing the productive and speculation sectors Rental property is a major part of the New Zealand economy, not only providing shelter for a third of the population while also paying tax and supporting many other industries. The rental property industry employs lawyers, accountants, property managers and various trades people. The industry spends money on rates, insurance, repairs and maintenance, all of which attract GST. 7 The rental property industry is definitely part of the productive economy and not the speculative economy as appears to be assumed. Marginal Effective Tax Rates The following graph is taken from the Tax Working Group's background paper the Future of Tax. It purports to show the marginal effective tax rates for a variety of assets. Apart from rental property, other assets METR ranges from 47.2% to 55.7%. This information led the Tax Working Group to conclude that "owner occupied and rental housing is undertaxed relative to other assets." However there are some major errors with this study, as pointed out in a report by finance and economic consultants, Morgan Wallace. (Attached) A key error is that while PIE funds, Superannuation funds and companies have a capital growth element to them, this has not been accounted for in the study. Only property has capital growth as a factor, which is the prime reason why the stated METR is so low. More than this, the study treats PIE Funds, superannuation and companies like bank deposits, not only assuming they don't increase in value, but that they actually lose value due to the effects of inflation. This incorrectly increases their METR. 8 Another point is that the study omits to include shares as an asset. Clearly share prices are a key part of share investment, which is why the changing price of shares is promoted on a daily basis by the finance industry. Morgan Wallace said that "If this asset class were to be included, it would have a lower METR than rental property under the TWG Paper framework." Morgan Wallace state that the study "cannot therefore be accepted at face value. If a capital return component were to be included for PIE, superannuation and company investments, then all three would have lower METR than presented in the TWG research paper." If the study included shares and correctly treated companies the same as rental property, then rental property has a higher METR than shares or companies. The following graph shows the METR for these assets when capital return is included in all assets that have a capital growth component. The TWG background paper says that "there may be room for improvement to make our current system more consistent". The clear implication of this (using incorrect information) is that rental property should be taxed more than other assets to increase its METR. Clearly this would be a mistake and distortionary. Fairness and balance The TWG asks "does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy". Although the financial services industry frequently says otherwise, rental properties are a substantial part of the productive economy. 9 The current tax system appears to be reasonably balanced, however there is a case towards better implementation of tax policy. While there is a property compliance team within the IRD to ensure property traders pay their fair share of tax, no such division exists for share traders. Similarly, while there is a Bright Line Test for property, no such test exists for shares. Tax revenue could be increased by implementing a bright line test for shares which could then be used to reduce income tax for companies so they are more in line with other countries. Can tax make housing more affordable Some believe that taxing rental property will make housing more affordable by discouraging rental property purchases and thereby reducing demand for property overall. This is not correct. It is already difficult to purchase and provide a rental property to a tenant. Table 1 below is a budget for buying and renting the average New Zealand home to a tenant. It also compares the cost of renting the average NZ home to owning it. This example allows for a 10% cash deposit of $53,000 (meaning the other 25% must come from equity in other assets) and yet the rent does not cover outgoings. New Ring Fencing laws already encourage higher rental prices. To break even, the weekly rent would need to be $760pw or the deposit would need to be $185,000. Even without a first home owner paying off any mortgage principle, it is still $79 per week cheaper to rent than own the average NZ home. This indicates that rental property is good value but also that there is room for rental prices to increase. Increasing rental property tax will lead to higher rental prices. If it doesn't initially, then it will lead to a reduction in supply of rental properties which ultimately will lead to higher rental prices. Saving a deposit is the hardest part for first home owners. Rent is often the most significant cost for those saving for a home of their own, so higher rental prices will make this task even harder. Tax rules for rental property are not the cause of any housing unaffordability, therefore increasing property taxes will not help affordability. 10 Countries with extra housing taxes compared to New Zealand have also had high house price increases. If tax does not stop property price increases in these countries, tax will not stop property price increases in New Zealand. Table 1. Cost of providing the average NZ home as a rental plus cost comparison between renting and owning the average NZ home NZPIF Study, December 2017 Rental Owner Home Owner Property Value (REINZ NZ Median house price) $530,000 $530,000 Chattels value 4% $21,200 Deposit / Investment 10.00% $53,000 15.00% $79,500 Mortgage $477,000 $450,500 Mortgage Interest rate (Average of the four main banks floating rates) 5.86% 5.86% Weekly Rent (national upper quartile rental price) $560 Annual rent $29,120 Annual Expenses Term of mortgage Mortgage Interest only $27,952 25 $34,370 Insurance $1,000 $1,000 Rates $3,000 $3,000 Property Manager (incl gst) 8.0% $2,330 Other $500 $500 Maintenance as % of rent 8.0% $2,330 $2,330 2 week vacancy provision $1,120 Total expenses $38,231 $41,199 Chattels depreciation claim at 10.0% $2,120 Tax Refund/Payable 33.0% -$3,706 Landlords cost before Ring Fencing Landlords cost post Ring Fencing -$5,405 -$9,111 Homeowners cost above renting Annual $12,079 Weekly $232 Homeowners cost above renting with no principle repayments Annual Weekly $4,109 $79 Capital Gains Tax New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Our economic system is based on capital gains not being taxed and the introduction of such a tax would have a significant negative effect on the economy. We need to encourage people to save in a variety of ways rather than spend all their their income. A CGT would have the opposite effect. A CGT has not stopped property price escalation in countries that have such a policy and there is no evidence that New Zealand will be any different. Research suggests that it is relatively difficult to administer and does not raise significant tax revenues. Such a tax can also have a negative effect on the volatility of 11 tax revenue, with people generally not selling during economic slowdowns thereby reducing CGT revenues. The two year Bright Line Test was introduced to ensure property speculators and traders paid their fair share of tax. The NZPIF reluctantly accepted this, despite the policies additional effect on rental property providers. However the extension of the test to five years directly affects rental property providers and in effect has become a pseudo CGT just for rental property. Without any hardship clauses, this is very unfair as a lot can happen over a five year period. Excluding primary residents would greatly reduce the potential tax revenue from a CGT. In addition, excluding primary residents would discourage investment in other assets whose capital increases were taxed, in favour of overcapitalising their own homes. New Zealand currently has an undersupply of rental property that has led tenants to comment about lack of choice and high rental prices. A CGT would reduce the return on all rental property and raise rental prices. A CGT would discourage the provision of rental property when we need more of it. Rental price increases have been higher than general inflation for a number of years. This is due to previously introduced and adverse legislation such as removing depreciation allowances, LVR restrictions and minimum standards plus two High Court rulings and cost increases for insurance, rates, repairs and maintenance. A CGT would add to the difficulty that many are having in providing homes to people. Land Tax A land tax excluding the family home would be distortionary and should not be introduced. It would encourage homes with large plots of land which would not be in the best interest of many areas in New Zealand, but particularly in areas like Auckland. A land tax would increase business costs which would increase the price of all goods and services to all New Zealanders. It would be complicated for mixed use premises, such as home and incomes, mixed- use commercial/residential properties and farms. It would also be difficult for properties that move into and out of being taxed due to their changing use. A land tax would increase the cost of providing rental property leading to either a reduction in supply, an increase in price, an increase in overcrowding or a likely combination of all three. 12 A land tax would be hardest on tenants making it harder for them to save a deposit and become homeowners. Because it would not apply to all assets, a land tax would be distortionary to property investments. Conclusion Our broad based taxation system works well, providing tax revenue to pay for essential services that our country needs. The provision of rental property contributes to the productive economy and pays a fair share of tax. Increasing property tax would not be equitable and the burden would mostly fall on tenants. A case could be made to ensure share traders pay their fair share of tax by including shares in the Bright Line Test and introducing a share traders compliance unit within the Inland Revenue Department. The introduction of a CGT or Land Tax would not make housing more affordable, but it would make rental property more difficult to provide at a time when we need more of it. Rising rental prices through higher costs and taxes would make it harder for tenants to save a home deposit, thereby making housing less affordable.

Tax rules for rental property are not the cause of any housing unaffordability, therefore increasing property taxes will not help affordability. 10 Countries with extra housing taxes compared to New Zealand have also had high house price increases. If tax does not stop property price increases in these countries, tax will not stop property price increases in New Zealand. Table 1. Cost of providing the average NZ home as a rental plus cost comparison between renting and owning the average NZ home NZPIF Study, December 2017 Rental Owner Home Owner Property Value (REINZ NZ Median house price) $530,000 $530,000 Chattels value 4% $21,200 Deposit / Investment 10.00% $53,000 15.00% $79,500 Mortgage $477,000 $450,500 Mortgage Interest rate (Average of the four main banks floating rates) 5.86% 5.86% Weekly Rent (national upper quartile rental price) $560 Annual rent $29,120 Annual Expenses Term of mortgage Mortgage Interest only $27,952 25 $34,370 Insurance $1,000 $1,000 Rates $3,000 $3,000 Property Manager (incl gst) 8.0% $2,330 Other $500 $500 Maintenance as % of rent 8.0% $2,330 $2,330 2 week vacancy provision $1,120 Total expenses $38,231 $41,199 Chattels depreciation claim at 10.0% $2,120 Tax Refund/Payable 33.0% -$3,706 Landlords cost before Ring Fencing Landlords cost post Ring Fencing -$5,405 -$9,111 Homeowners cost above renting Annual $12,079 Weekly $232 Homeowners cost above renting with no principle repayments Annual Weekly $4,109 $79 Capital Gains Tax New Zealand should not introduce a Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Our economic system is based on capital gains not being taxed and the introduction of such a tax would have a significant negative effect on the economy. We need to encourage people to save in a variety of ways rather than spend all their their income. A CGT would have the opposite effect. A CGT has not stopped property price escalation in countries that have such a policy and there is no evidence that New Zealand will be any different. Research suggests that it is relatively difficult to administer and does not raise significant tax revenues. Such a tax can also have a negative effect on the volatility of 11 tax revenue, with people generally not selling during economic slowdowns thereby reducing CGT revenues. The two year Bright Line Test was introduced to ensure property speculators and traders paid their fair share of tax. The NZPIF reluctantly accepted this, despite the policies additional effect on rental property providers. However the extension of the test to five years directly affects rental property providers and in effect has become a pseudo CGT just for rental property. Without any hardship clauses, this is very unfair as a lot can happen over a five year period. Excluding primary residents would greatly reduce the potential tax revenue from a CGT. In addition, excluding primary residents would discourage investment in other assets whose capital increases were taxed, in favour of overcapitalising their own homes. New Zealand currently has an undersupply of rental property that has led tenants to comment about lack of choice and high rental prices. A CGT would reduce the return on all rental property and raise rental prices. A CGT would discourage the provision of rental property when we need more of it. Rental price increases have been higher than general inflation for a number of years. This is due to previously introduced and adverse legislation such as removing depreciation allowances, LVR restrictions and minimum standards plus two High Court rulings and cost increases for insurance, rates, repairs and maintenance. A CGT would add to the difficulty that many are having in providing homes to people. Land Tax A land tax excluding the family home would be distortionary and should not be introduced. It would encourage homes with large plots of land which would not be in the best interest of many areas in New Zealand, but particularly in areas like Auckland. A land tax would increase business costs which would increase the price of all goods and services to all New Zealanders. It would be complicated for mixed use premises, such as home and incomes, mixed- use commercial/residential properties and farms. It would also be difficult for properties that move into and out of being taxed due to their changing use. A land tax would increase the cost of providing rental property leading to either a reduction in supply, an increase in price, an increase in overcrowding or a likely combination of all three. 12 A land tax would be hardest on tenants making it harder for them to save a deposit and become homeowners. Because it would not apply to all assets, a land tax would be distortionary to property investments. Conclusion Our broad based taxation system works well, providing tax revenue to pay for essential services that our country needs. The provision of rental property contributes to the productive economy and pays a fair share of tax. Increasing property tax would not be equitable and the burden would mostly fall on tenants. A case could be made to ensure share traders pay their fair share of tax by including shares in the Bright Line Test and introducing a share traders compliance unit within the Inland Revenue Department. The introduction of a CGT or Land Tax would not make housing more affordable, but it would make rental property more difficult to provide at a time when we need more of it. Rising rental prices through higher costs and taxes would make it harder for tenants to save a home deposit, thereby making housing less affordable.
