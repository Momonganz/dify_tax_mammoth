The measure is intended to counter avoidance through the use of superannuation schemes of the already legislated increase in the top personal tax rate, effective from 1 April 2000. The specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT), set at 33 percent, is a tax on employers’ monetary contributions to superannuation funds. Increasing the top personal tax rate to 39 percent and leaving the SSCWT rate unchanged at 33 percent introduced scope for avoidance. Employees earning over $60,000 could negotiate an increase in their employer superannuation contributions, subject to the 33 percent SSCWT rate, with a corresponding reduction in salary and wages subject to tax at 39 percent. They could withdraw the increased employer contributions shortly afterwards, thus avoiding the 39 percent top personal marginal tax rate. The measures in this bill address this concern. They do not restrict employers contributing to a superannuation fund as a way of remunerating employees. However, their contributions must stay in the superannuation fund until the employee leaves the job or withdraws the money for reasons of significant hardship. Otherwise, a 5 percent fund withdrawal tax will apply. At 5 percent, the fund withdrawal tax should remove any tax benefit for those earning over $60,000 from substituting employer contributions to a superannuation fund for salary and wages. Furthermore, the tax also applies to any return on employer contribution withdrawn, not just the original amount of employer contribution, if this can be identified. The following amendments are being made: • Employers may apply a voluntary 39 percent SSCWT rate for all employees. Only employers whose employees earn over $60,000 a year are likely to use this. • A withdrawal tax of 5 percent of the amount withdrawn by an employee from a fund is being introduced. This tax will be restricted to the amount of the employer contribution on that employee’s behalf if the trustee can identify this. • The withdrawal tax will not apply when funds are withdrawn after the employee ceases employment or withdraws money on the basis of significant hardship. • Existing contributions and contributions that continue at current levels will not be subject to the withdrawal tax. 4 The SSCWT rate will stay at 33 percent for defined benefit funds. Employers may elect to apply the optional 39 percent SSCWT rate from 1 October 2000. The period from 1 April to 1 October 2000 will allow employers and superannuation funds time to establish necessary systems. If the higher rate is elected the fund withdrawal tax will not apply to any amount withdrawn which has been subject to that higher rate. These measures minimise the compliance cost impact on employers, employees and superannuation funds as much as possible. They also ensure that current contributions and already determined levels of future contributions will not be affected by the fund withdrawal tax. Application date The fund withdrawal tax will apply from the income year beginning 1 April 2000 to contributions made after that date on behalf of: • employees beginning employment on or after 1 April 2000; and • existing employees on or after 1 April 2000 if the amount of their contribution has been increased, unless that increase was set before 1 April 2000 according to a superannuation fund trust deed or an employment contract. Employers may elect the optional 39 percent SSCWT rate from 1 October 2000. Because the measures are being implemented through the income tax process, superannuation funds will be required to account for any tax levied in their tax return for the 2000-2001 income year and subsequent years. Background There are two types of superannuation funds to which employers may contribute, each requiring a different tax solution. The first type is defined contribution funds. These are funds in which the employer contributes a sum to the fund on behalf of an employee that typically vests in the employee after a period of service, although some funds have immediate vesting. Once the sum is vested, the employee may have access to that employer contribution along with any contribution he or she has made in accordance with the fund’s rules. Access is normally restricted to retirement or withdrawal on cessation of employment, although funds may be withdrawn when the employee is suffering hardship and sometimes for specific reasons such as meeting Christmas expenses. The second type of fund consists of defined benefit funds. These funds require the employer to make contributions sufficient to ensure that the employee receives certain defined benefits on retirement, such as a set percentage of pre-retirement salary. 5 For purposes of SSCWT, the principal difference is that defined contribution funds allow an employer’s contribution to be linked to an individual employee, while under defined benefit funds the employer may make a bulk payment which cannot be attributed at the time of payment to those employees who may benefit from that payment. Key features The bill inserts sections CL3 to 9 and NE 2AA into the Income Tax Act 1994, and amends sections NE 2(1) and OB 1 and Schedule 1 of that Act. It also inserts a new section 165 AA into the Tax Administration Act 1994. Defined contribution funds Employer contributions to qualifying employment superannuation funds will continue to be subject to a 33 percent SSCWT rate. A fund withdrawal tax of 5 percent of the amount of employer contribution withdrawn and any return on that employer contribution will apply if this contribution is withdrawn other than on: • cessation of employment with that employer; and • significant hardship, which has been defined to include permanent incapacity of the member of the fund. If a superannuation fund cannot identify whether an amount withdrawn comprises an employer contribution, the withdrawal tax will apply to the full amount withdrawn. “Withdrawal” has been defined to include any return on any employer contribution also withdrawn. The fund withdrawal tax will not apply to: • employer contributions made before 1 April 2000; and • contributions made after 1 April 2000, for the benefit of an existing fund member, if the employer contribution as a percentage of salary does not increase or the increase is according to trust deed or employment contract in existence before 1 April 2000. A 50 percent or more increase in employer contributions in either of the two years preceding an employee’s cessation of employment will result in the withdrawal tax applying to those contributions made after 1 April 2000 on cessation of employment on the employer contribution that is withdrawn. A consequence of this rule is that any contribution on behalf of an employee in the first two years of that employee’s employment will trigger this rule, subjecting any withdrawal other than that done on the basis of hardship to the fund withdrawal tax. 6 Without this measure, employees who were close to leaving their employment and earned over $60,000 a year might choose to have their employer increase their superannuation fund contributions rather than increase their salary. They could then shortly access those funds, with a tax rate of 33 percent effectively applying. This measure minimises this concern. On the wind-up of a superannuation fund, the 5 percent fund withdrawal tax will apply to employer contributions unless this amount is transferred to a further superannuation fund by the fund that is winding up. On transfer, employer contributions retain their nature. Unallocated reserves, as at 1 April 2000, can be allocated to an employee to meet the employer’s obligation to that employee but will not count as employer contributions and will not be subject to tax on exiting or withdrawal. Reserves after this date may be subject to the fund withdrawal tax if withdrawn. Defined benefit funds The current SSCWT rate of 33 percent will continue to apply to employer contributions to existing and new defined benefit funds. Voluntary increase in SSCWT rate If all the superannuation fund contributions by an employer are on behalf of employees earning over $60,000 it may be simpler for employers, employees and superannuation funds for the employer to apply a 39 percent SSCWT rate to employer contributions. The withdrawal tax will not apply to these contributions. Employers will be able to elect this rate as an alternative to the 33 percent SSCWT rate from 1 October 2000. The withdrawal tax will also not apply to employer superannuation contributions made from 1 April to 1 October 2000, even though the 39 percent SSCWT rate does not apply for that period if: • the amount of employer contribution is not increased, unless that increase was set before 1 April 2000 according to a superannuation fund trust deed or an employment contract; and • the employer elects the 39 percent SSCWT rate from 1 October 2000. The 1 October 2000 application date for this election is to allow employers and superannuation funds time to establish necessary systems. Implementation The most compliance cost-efficient way to implement the fund withdrawal tax is to place the liability on the superannuation fund rather than the person making the withdrawal. This approach minimises both compliance costs for employees and administrative costs, which eventually have to be borne by taxpayers. 7 To this effect, 15.15 percent (5 percent divided by the tax rate, rounded to two decimal points) of the amount withdrawn or the employer contribution, if known, will be deemed to be gross income of the superannuation fund for income tax purposes. This requires no new tax processes, minimises compliance and administrative costs and allows prompt introduction of the measure. Trustees will be able to recover the tax from payments to members. The Government Actuary will monitor the use of defined benefit funds and, specifically, withdrawals from these funds. 8 MULTI-RATE FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (Clauses 7-9, 13 and 17) Summary of proposed amendments The introduction of a three-tier fringe benefit tax (FBT) will allow fringe benefits that can be attributed to an employee to be subject to FBT at a rate based on the employee’s marginal tax rate. Those fringe benefits that are not attributed to individual employees will be subject to FBT at the 49 percent rate. These amendments to the FBT rules will reduce the effect of the increase in the FBT rate to 64 percent for fringe benefits provided or granted on or after 1 April 2000, which was enacted in December 1999. The FBT rate was increased to equate with the top personal tax rate of 39 percent to prevent high-income earners substituting salary or wages for fringe benefits to avoid the increase in the top personal tax rate. Without these changes, the 64 percent rate would further exacerbate the over-taxation of low- income employees and would overtax middle-income employees subject to a 33 percent personal tax rate. The amendments will generally allow employers to choose to apply a FBT rate based on the remuneration they pay to the employee receiving the fringe benefit. Employers will continue to pay FBT on the value of benefits provided or granted to employees. The new rules will apply as follows: • Certain benefits (motor vehicles other than pooled vehicles, low-interest loans and other benefits with a taxable value exceeding $1,000 per category per year) must be attributed to the individual employee receiving them. Such benefits will be taxed at a FBT rate based on the employee’s marginal tax rate. • Employers will be able to attribute other individual fringe benefits with a value of $1,000 or less, per category per year, if they so wish. Again, such benefits will be taxed at one of three FBT rates based on the employee’s marginal tax rate. • Fringe benefits not attributed to an individual employee and pooled fringe benefits (such as pool motor vehicles) will be subject to FBT at 49 percent. • Employers will continue to pay FBT tax on a quarterly basis at either 64 percent or 49 percent. FBT will be subject to adjustment in the fourth quarter, when the liability for attributed benefits will be calculated using a FBT rate based on the marginal tax rate of the employee to whom benefits have been attributed. Application date The new rules will apply to fringe benefits provided or granted on or after 1 April 2000. For administrative reasons, all employers will be required to pay 64 percent on benefits provided or granted during the first quarter (1 April 2000 to 30 June 2000). Any overpayment of FBT in this first quarter can be recovered through the square-up process in the last quarter. 9 For employers who pay FBT on fringe benefits provided to shareholder-employees on an income year basis, the new rules will apply to benefits provided or granted during the 2000-01 income year. Background The FBT rate will increase to 64 percent from 1 April 2000, to prevent high-income employees substituting fringe benefits for monetary remuneration to avoid the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39 percent, also from 1 April. Since their introduction in 1985, the FBT rules have overtaxed low-income employees. The Government announced late last year, when the FBT rate was increased to 64 percent, that it would look at this issue with a view to introducing legislation early this year to lower the tax rate on fringe benefits provided to lower-income employees. These proposed amendments are in response to that undertaking and provide a workable solution to this issue while minimising any increase in compliance costs. Key features The bill amends sections ND 1 and ND 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and inserts new sections ND 1A to 1F and ND 2A. A new definition is being added to section OB 1 of that Act. Also amended is section 120 C of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in relation to the payment of interest on FBT refunds. Multi-rate FBT system Employers will have the choice of whether to pay FBT at 64 percent on all the benefits they provide or use the multi-rate fringe benefit system. Using the flat 64 percent rate would be appropriate for employers who provide fringe benefits predominantly to high-income employees, as they would avoid any compliance costs associated with the multi-rate fringe benefit rules, such as attributing and tracking benefits and calculating the individual employee’s FBT rate. If employers opt into the multi-rate fringe benefit rules, they will be required to attribute the following fringe benefits to the individual employee who receives the benefit: motor vehicles (other than pooled vehicles), low-interest loans, and other benefits that have a taxable value of over $1,000 per category per year. For example, if an employer provides or grants fringe benefits of the type covered by paragraph (f) of section CI 1 of the Income Tax Act, the $1,000 will be calculated by reference to the total taxable value of all benefits covered by that provision. That is, the total value of premiums paid for life insurance, pension insurance, personal accident or sickness insurance and contributions to a friendly society insurance fund will be added together to calculate whether an individual has gained a fringe benefit in excess of $1,000. Attributed benefits will be taxed at a FBT rate based on the employee’s marginal tax rate as shown in table 1. 10 TABLE 1: FRINGE BENEFIT TAX RATES FOR BENEFITS ATTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES ON THE BASIS OF THEIR MARGINAL TAX RATE Employee’s cash remuneration from employer Employee’s marginal tax rate FBT rate applicable to employee 1 $0 -$38,000 21%27% $38,001 - $60,00033%49% Over $60,00039%64% Employers will be able to attribute fringe benefits with a taxable value of $1,000 or less provided to individual employees, if they so wish. An employer who chooses to attribute a category of fringe benefits with a taxable value of $1,000 or less must attribute all the benefits provided in that category that can be attributed to individual employees. All benefits not attributed to an individual employee, including pooled benefits such as pooled motor vehicles, will be subject to FBT at 49 percent. Benefits provided to previous employees and low-interest loans provided by life insurers to policyholders or associates will be treated as non-attributed benefits and subject to FBT at 49 percent. The benefits provided to previous employees or provided to policyholders or associates will be treated as non-attributed benefits because previous employers or life insurers will not have access to income information of the recipient of the benefit. A benefit will be attributable to an individual if the asset or the benefit is principally assigned, used or available for use by that employee. This is despite the fact that it may not have been used solely by that employee. For example, an employee has a car specifically provided for her use, which includes private use for which fringe benefit tax is payable. However, from time to time other employees use this car for their private use, while the first employee uses another vehicle temporarily. The total fringe benefit from making the car available for private use is attributable to the first employee, to whom it has been principally assigned, and will be taxed at the FBT rate appropriate to her. This rule will ensure that benefits are taxed only once, while reducing compliance costs, and provides guidance in determining whether a benefit can be attributed or is pooled and non-attributable. If a benefit cannot be attributed to an individual employee, as there is no principal user, it becomes a pooled benefit and is taxed at the non-attributable rate of 49 percent. Return filing requirements and FBT rates Employers who file FBT returns on a quarterly basis will be able to elect whether to pay FBT on the taxable value of all attributable or non-attributable fringe benefits at either 49 percent or 64 percent for the first three quarters of an income year. In the fourth quarter return, the employer will be required to undertake an end-of-year square-up whereby the taxable value of benefits attributed to individual employees 1 The FBT rate is calculated using the formula (t / 1-t) where t is the marginal tax rate of the employee. For example, if the marginal tax rate of the employee is 39% the FBT rate is 64% (0.39 / 1-0.39). 11 during that year will be subject to FBT at a rate based the employee’s marginal tax rate. As part of this square-up process, a credit will be given for the FBT paid in the previous three quarters. This square-up process may result in employers underpaying or overpaying their FBT liability during the year. If FBT has been overpaid during the year, the employer will be entitled to a refund. Table 2 shows the return filing obligations for those employers filing quarterly FBT returns. TABLE 2: RETURN FILING OBLIGATIONS FOR EMPLOYERS FILING QUARTERLY FBT RETURNS PeriodEmployer’s obligation Quarter 1Apply either the 49% or 64% rate to benefits provided or granted (both attributed and non-attributed benefits) during that quarter. Quarter 2Apply either the 49% or 64% rate to benefits provided or granted (both attributed and non-attributed benefits) during that quarter. Quarter 3Apply either the 49% or 64% rate to benefits provided or granted (both attributed and non-attributed benefits) during that quarter. Quarter 4 (square-up return)If the employer has applied the 49% rate in any quarter, the employer must undertake an end-of-year square-up; OR if the employer has applied the 64% rate in the previous three quarters, the employer can either: (a) pay 64% for Quarter 4 and avoid this square-up and attribution process; or (b) use the square-up process. Requiring an end-of-year square-up ensures that an employee’s FBT rate for attributed benefits is calculated on the actual cash remuneration paid during that year. If an employer ceases to employ staff and does not intend to re-employ staff during that income year, the square-up process must be undertaken in the quarter in which staff employment stopped. In such cases, the quarter’s return and payment will be due on the last day of the second month following the end of that quarter. For example, if an employer ceased employing staff during the second quarter and did not recommence employing staff during that income year, the return and payment of any FBT would be due on 30 November. 12 The FBT returns and the tax payable for the first three quarters will continue to be due on the 20 th of the month following the end of the quarter. The return and any tax payable for the fourth quarter will be due on 31 May following the end of that quarter. This additional time will allow employers to undertake the end-of year square-up process. If an employer decides to pay FBT at 64 percent in the last quarter, the tax and return will continue to be due on 20 April. Employers who file annual FBT returns or income year returns can use the square-up process to determine the appropriate FBT rates to apply to attributable and non- attributable benefits, or apply the 64 percent rate to all benefits and avoid the square- up process. For annual FBT payers, the return and any tax payable will continue to be due on 31 May following the end of the income year. For income year FBT payers, the return and any tax payable will continue to be due on the terminal tax date of the employer. As a transitional measure to allow Inland Revenue to implement system changes related to these rules all employers will be required to use the 64 percent rate for the first quarter (1 April 2000 to 30 June 2000). Any overpayment of FBT can be recovered through the square-up process in the last quarter. Calculation of annual income of employees The cash remuneration paid to an employee by his or her employer during the income year will be used to calculate the appropriate FBT rate to be applied to benefits that can be attributed to an individual. This will include salary or wages, withholding payments, extra emoluments, payments to specified office holders, and any salary, wages or other gross income to which section OB 2(2) applies, such as salary or wages paid to shareholder-employees of close companies. It will not include the taxable value of fringe benefits provided by that employer or the value of employer superannuation contributions subject to specified superannuation contribution withholding tax. For employees who receive secondary employment income, their FBT rate for attributed benefits provided by the primary employer will be calculated on the basis of the cash remuneration paid by the primary employer only. The FBT rate for any attributed benefits provided by the secondary employer will be calculated on the basis of the cash remuneration paid by the secondary employer only. Employers will not be required to determine how much income an employee receives from other sources (unless the other source is a division or branch of the employer). In determining an employee’s annual income, employers will be required to take into account all cash remuneration paid by any division or branch of the employer if that division or branch is treated as a separate employer or associated person of the employer. If an employee starts or ceases work during the year or is a part-year employee, the employer will be required to annualise the cash remuneration paid during the income year to determine the employee’s annual cash remuneration for the purposes of calculating that employee’s FBT rate. This rule will not apply to part-time, full-year employees. 13 Shareholder-employees and their associates Because shareholder-employees may have control of remuneration decisions of the employing company, the amendments include specific rules to deal with major shareholders who are also employees. A “major shareholder”, in relation to a close company, is a person who owns, has the power to control (whether directly or indirectly) or has the right to acquire 10 percent or more of the ordinary shares or voting rights of the company. In calculating the annual income of a major shareholder-employee for the purposes of determining the employee’s individual FBT rate for attributed benefits, the employer will be required to include dividends and any interest paid or payable for that income year, in addition to cash remuneration paid or payable. This FBT rate will also be used to calculate the FBT payable on attributable fringe benefits provided or granted to an associate of a major shareholder-employee that are subject to FBT. This rule will not apply if those benefits are received by that associated person in an employment capacity with that employer. If a major shareholder-employee receives or is entitled to receive any benefits that have been included in the pool of non-attributed benefits, the taxable value of the non- attributed benefits for all employees will be subject to FBT at 64 percent. Information requirements Employers will need to ensure that their systems can provide the information necessary to undertake the end-of-year square-up process, including: • details of the fringe benefits and their taxable value attributed to individual employee each quarter; and • the annual cash remuneration of employees who receive attributed fringe benefits. Because these changes apply with effect from 1 April 2000, it is important that employers start to identify what information needs to be maintained and develop appropriate systems as soon as possible. 14 How the multi-rate system will operate EXAMPLE: FRINGE BENEFITS RECEIVED BY EMPLOYEES (QUARTERLY FILING EMPLOYER) Taxable value ($) of fringe benefits received PER QUARTER Annual “income” from employer $ Motor vehicles Super- annuation 1 Medical insurance 2 Cards and flowers 3 Discounted goods 4 CEO$80,000$1,800\*$750$200$50 Manager 1$65,000$200$50 Manager 2$50,000$1,800\*$200$100$50 Employee 1$40,000$200$50 Employee 2$40,000$200$50 Employee 3$30,000$200$50 Employee 4$30,000$200$50$50 Employee 5$30,000$200$50 Employee 6$30,000$200$50$50 Employee 7$15,000$200$50 Total/benefit$3,600$750$2,000$200$500 Total value all benefits $7,050 \*based on a $30,000 vehicle used every day in the quarter (90 days) 1 The contributions to a superannuation scheme are covered by paragraph (g) of section CI 1 and therefore is a category of benefits. 2 The medical insurance premiums are covered by paragraph (f) of section CI 1 and therefore is a category of benefits. 3/4 The cards and flowers and discounted goods are covered by paragraph (h) of section CI 1 and therefore are a category of fringe benefits. FBT obligations for the first three quarters An employer would aggregate the taxable value of all fringe benefits provided in a quarter and then apply either the 49 percent or 64 percent flat rate to this total. In this example the total value of the fringe benefits provided in the quarter is $7,050. An employer who chose to apply the 49 percent rate would be liable for $3454.50 in FBT for that quarter. For the purposes of this example, we will assume that this liability is constant over the first three quarters of the year, meaning that the employer will have paid $10,363.50 in FBT at the end of the third quarter. The same benefits are provided in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, this example ignores the transitional requirement to pay 64 percent in the first quarter during the 2000-01 year. An employer who chooses to apply the 49 percent rate in any quarter must undertake the square-up process in the fourth quarter. Alternatively, if the 64 percent rate was applied in every quarter, the employer has the option in the fourth quarter of undertaking a square-up, or simply applying the flat 64 percent rate again. 15 Over the first three quarters employers should maintain accurate records relating to the value and type of fringe benefits provided, as well as who the employee recipient was. The fourth quarter square-up STEP 1 – Attributable fringe benefits Employers would need to identify which of the fringe benefits they had provided over the year had to be attributable. Under these rules, all motor vehicles, low-interest loans, and fringe benefits with a taxable value of over $1,000 per category per year must be attributed in the square-up process. This $1,000 value applies to an entire category of fringe benefits. Section CI 1 sets out the types of fringe benefits covered by the FBT rules, and the benefits included in paragraphs (a) to (h) will be treated as separate categories. In the example above, the following fringe benefits must be attributed, and therefore taxed at a FBT rate based on the employee’s “income” (see Table 1): • The CEO’s motor vehicle. As the income received in this case is over $60,000, the appropriate FBT rate to apply is 64 percent. ($1,800 x 4 quarters) x 64% = $4,608. • Manager 2’s motor vehicle. As the income received in this case is between $38,000 and $60,000, the appropriate FBT rate to apply is 49 percent. ($1,800 x 4 quarters) x 49% = $3,528. • The CEO’s superannuation scheme as it exceeds $1,000 as a single category benefit over the year. ($750 x 4 quarters) x 64% = $1,920. Therefore the total FBT that should have been paid on attributable fringe benefits is $10,056. STEP 2 – Non-attributable and low-value fringe benefits The next step for the employer is either to: (a) Simply add the value of all other fringe benefits provided over the year and multiply this amount by the flat non-attributable FBT rate of 49 percent. • The medical insurance. ($200 x 4 quarters) x 10 employee recipients = $8,000. • The cards and flowers. ($200 x 4 quarters) = $800. • The discounted goods. ($50 x 4 quarters) x 10 employees = $2000 • This equals a total of $10,800 in non-attributable fringe benefits, which results in $5,292 in FBT liability. ($10,800 x 49% = $5,292). OR: 16 (b)Attribute a category(s) of low-value fringe benefits (value less than $1,000) and apply 49 percent to non-attributable fringe benefits. This option may be relevant to an employer with a large number of low-income employees receiving fringe benefits. The choice of attributing low-value benefits such as these rests on the employer weighing the additional compliance costs against any tax saving. If an employer chooses to attribute a low-value fringe benefit to an employee, all the benefits in that category must be attributed to all the individual employees receiving the fringe benefit. This example will assume the employer would only wish to attribute the medical insurance provided, with the flat 49 percent pooled rate applying to the cards, flowers and discounted goods category. • To attribute the medical insurance, the employer must apply the correct FBT rates as follows: Employees at the 64% rate: (2 x ($200 x 4 quarters)) x 64% = $1,024 Employees at the 49% rate: (3 x ($200 x 4 quarters)) x 49% =$1,176 Employees at the 27% rate: (5 x ($200 x 4 quarters)) x 27% =$1,080 TOTAL FBT Liability =$3,280 • As above, the FBT liability of the cards and flowers is $800, and $2,000 for the discounted goods. This results in $1,372 of FBT liability for non-attributable fringe benefits ($2,800 x 49% = $1,372), plus $3,280 in FBT liability from attributing the medical insurance. Therefore this employer would save $640 in total FBT liability by attributing the medical insurance ((a) $5,292 – (b) $4,652 = $640). STEP 3 – Reconciliation The final step for the employer is to add the FBT liability over the year for attributable and non-attributable benefits. The FBT paid over the first three quarters is subtracted from this amount, leaving the total final FBT payment for the year. Using method (a) for non-attributed benefits Using method (b) for non-attributed benefits Total FBT liability on attributable benefits $10,056.00$10,056.00 Total FBT liability on non- attributed benefits $5,292.00$4,652.00 $15,348.00$14,708.00 Subtract the amount of FBT already paid during the year ($10,363.50)($10,363.50) Total FBT due as a result of the square-up $4,984.50$4,344.50 17 Therefore, in this case, the employer is liable to pay either $4,984.50 or $4,344.50 in the fourth quarter tax return due on 31 May. The reason this amount is higher than the payments over the first three quarters is that this employer opted to use the 49 percent rate, when a significant amount of the fringe benefits provided (in terms of value), went to employees subject to the 64 percent rate. 18 USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST ON FRINGE BENEFIT TAX (Clauses 16 and 18) Summary of proposed amendment Use-of-money interest on fringe benefit tax paid either on an annual basis or an income year basis is to be removed. This is a simplification measure designed to reduce compliance costs for those who pay small amounts of the tax, by reducing the number of returns and payments they make. Application date The amendment applies to the 2001-2002 and subsequent income years. Background The discussion document Less Taxing Tax, released in September last year, considered a number of tax simplification proposals aimed at small businesses. The proposals in the discussion document received wide support, and a number are expected to be enacted this year, of which this is the first. Fringe benefit tax is generally paid on a quarterly basis, although some taxpayers have the option to pay it once a year. Use-of-money interest is applied to yearly payments to compensate the Government for the tax deferral. Removing interest is intended to increase the incentive for taxpayers to make one payment and therefore file one return each year, rather than four returns and payments. Key features Section 120S of the Tax Administration Act 1994, which imposes the interest on those paying fringe benefit tax on an annual or income year basis, is being repealed. Remedial Issues 20 THE FIF RULES AND COMPANY MIGRATION (Clauses 4 and 5) Summary of proposed amendments Amendments are being made to clarify how the foreign investment fund rules apply when a resident entity migrates from New Zealand. • The market value of the holding on the date of migration will be used for assessing the threshold as to whether the rules apply, as well as the value on entry to the rules themselves. • Holders on revenue account will be treated as if they had sold their holding immediately before the change in residence and repurchased it immediately after. This will crystallise for tax purposes any gain or loss without having to sell the entity. • The entity will not need to prepare separate audited financial statements for the periods before and after migration in the year of transition if its shareholders are to use the accounting profits method for that year. Application date The amendments apply retrospectively to the 1999-2000 and subsequent income years. Background The foreign investment fund rules are part of New Zealand’s international tax rules, which are designed to reduce distortions in the investment decisions of our residents. They do this by ensuring that as far as practicable, the worldwide income of New Zealand residents is taxed as it accrues. The rules were enacted in 1992, but it was only in 1993 that company law was amended to allow for transfers of incorporation, so clarification of the rules to cater for this is necessary. Amendments are being made to clarify that the market value on the date of migration is to be used in assessing the threshold for entry to the rules, as well as the opening value of the entity when calculating income. This is consistent with the policy intent that entry into and exit from the foreign investment fund rules should be at market value. A further amendment is being made to make it easier to use the accounting profits method in the year of migration. The lack of separate audited accounts for the period from the change in residence to the end of the entity’s accounting period will not preclude its use by its shareholders. 21 Key features • Under new subsection CG 14(1)(ca) of the Income Tax Act 1994, the cost or expenditure of the holding is to be the market value on the date of the change of residence. • Under new subsections CG 23(7A) to (7C), the shares are considered to have been sold and reacquired on the date of the change in residence. One consequence of this is that gains and losses will be crystallised at that date for tax purposes for holders of shares on revenue account. • New subsection CG 23(7D) removes the requirement for separate financial accounts to be prepared for an entity up to the date of migration if the accounting profits method is to be used in that year by its shareholders. 22 SSCWT CONTRIBUTIONS TREATED AS SALARY OR WAGES (Clause 12) Summary of proposed amendment The amendment removes a technical problem in the legislation relating to the specified superannuation contribution withholding tax (SSCWT) rules. It will ensure that the payment of PAYE deducted from an employer’s contribution to a superannuation fund, if the employee and the employer have agreed to treat the employer’s contributions as salary or wages, will satisfy the employer’s obligation to pay the contribution to the superannuation fund. Application date The amendment will apply retrospectively from 26 November 1998 to coincide with the enactment date of the rules that allow an employee and employer to agree to treat employer contributions to a superannuation fund as salary or wages of the employee. Background The SSCWT rules were amended by the Taxation (Tax Credits, Trading Stock, and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1998 to allow an employee and employer to agree to have specified superannuation contributions treated as salary or wages and therefore made subject to PAYE rather than SSCWT. However, the legislation does not allow the PAYE deducted and paid from the employer’s superannuation contribution to be treated as satisfying the employer’s obligation to pay contributions to the superannuation fund. Such a provision exists for SSCWT deducted from contributions. Key features Section NE 6 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to allow the PAYE deducted and paid to satisfy an employer’s obligation to pay contributions to the superannuation fund, if the employee and employer have agreed to treat the superannuation contribution as salary or wages. The proposed amendment will ensure that the legislation reflects the original policy intent and is consistent with the current treatment afforded to contributions subject to SSCWT.

Total reported private sector R&D expenditure increased by an average of 6.25 percent per year from 1990/91 to 1997/98. This compares to an increase in the OECD as a whole of about 2.4 percent per year over the same period. 2.The Government is committed to encouraging private sector R&D in New Zealand. We do a great deal to assist R&D. In addition to providing tax concessions through immediate deductibility of scientific research expenditure, the Government also purchases around $650 million of R&D per year directly from Crown Research Institutes and universities. Although this level is slightly below the OECD average, public purchase of R&D has been increasing at a rate of 12 percent per year since 1995 compared to the OECD as a whole, where there has been an increase of 3.0 percent per annum. Budget measures to encourage R&D 3.As part of our commitment, the Government announced in the Budget that we would support private sector R&D by introducing a new grants programme and providing an increase in funding for Technology New Zealand. We opted for a grants approach because we considered that it was better, safer and fairer than tax concessions. The new grants programme has been running for eight weeks and has attracted over 800 applications. Good progress is being made on considering and, where appropriate, approving these applications. Uncertainty in current tax treatment 4.Some taxpayers and tax practitioners have responded to the Budget announcements by pointing out that the measures do nothing to address the existing uncertainty over the current tax treatment of R&D. 5.Practitioners we have spoken to have noted that the main area of uncertainty relates to distinguishing between capital and revenue R&D expenditure. The tax treatment depends on whether costs are classified as revenue or capital. In broad terms, expenditure is capital if it gives rise to an enduring benefit to the taxpayer. Otherwise, it is revenue expenditure. 6.Broadly, expenditure on revenue account is immediately deductible for tax if the required link with income is shown. Expenditure on capital account is not immediately deductible (unless it relates to “scientific research”, which is treated more favourably than other capital expenditure). Instead, expenditure on capital account is either deductible over the life of an asset or, on occasion, may not be deductible at all. There is little case law in New Zealand on R&D expenditure to assist taxpayers in determining whether R&D costs are on capital or revenue account. It is, therefore, not clear in tax law when R&D expenditure will be immediately deductible and when it will not be. Page 2 7.We understand that, although the tax treatment of R&D expenditure is uncertain, taxpayers are immediately deducting almost all of their R&D costs. However, this carries the risk of potential disputes with Inland Revenue, and penalties and use of money interest that apply when tax is underpaid. Summary of proposal 8.The Government is proposing to address this uncertainty by introducing the measure outlined in this discussion paper. Broadly, the proposal is to clarify the capital/revenue boundary by permitting taxpayers to follow accounting treatment to the extent that when R&D expenditure is immediately written off for accounting purposes, it will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. 9.Normal tax treatment will continue to apply to fixed asset inputs into the R&D process such as buildings and vehicles. Generally these will be depreciable. All other expenditure on research will be immediately deductible for tax purposes. 10.Expenditure on development (except for fixed asset inputs) will be immediately deductible unless and until all of the following criteria, which are set out in paragraph 5.3 of the accounting standard for R&D (Financial Reporting Standard 13: Accounting for Research and Development Activities, or FRS-13), are satisfied: • The product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably; • The technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated; • The entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process; • The existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated; • Adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process. 11.Only development costs incurred after all the criteria are satisfied will not automatically be immediately deductible for tax. 12.Under this proposal, all R&D costs (except for fixed asset inputs) will be immediately deductible for tax unless and until the expenditure gives rise to an identifiable and valuable asset under FRS-13. 13.The proposal will not disadvantage any taxpayers, relative to existing tax treatment. Taxpayers who capitalise and amortise development expenditure for accounting may still argue that such expenditure is on revenue account for tax purposes. 14.Taxpayers will need to apply the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 in relation to R&D costs (including costs that are immaterial for accounting) in order to obtain the benefit of the proposal. Existing tax provisions will continue to apply to taxpayers who are not required to apply the paragraph 5.3 criteria and who choose not to. Page 3 15.By clarifying which expenditure is immediately deductible and which is not, there should be more certainty for taxpayers and fewer disputes between taxpayers and Inland Revenue. That should allow businesses to focus more on their business and less on their tax affairs. Submissions 16.Submissions are invited on the proposals in this discussion paper. In particular, the Government wishes to receive views on issues such as the definitions of research and development, the form of the legislation, whether compliance with paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 should be required both for tax and financial reporting, and the desirable application date. 17.Submissions may be made in electronic form to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: Research & development proposal C/- General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P.O. Box 2198 WELLINGTON 18.Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. They should be made by 26 January 2001. Page 4 PART II: SUMMARY OF CURRENT TAX TREATMENT 19.Three sets of provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 permit the deduction of R&D expenditure - the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2, the specific deduction allowed for scientific research expenditure (section DJ 9), and the depreciation rules. Which of these provisions permits a deduction for an item of R&D depends on the nature of the expenditure. General deductibility 20.The general deductibility provisions allow a taxpayer a deduction for expenditure if the expenditure is incurred in the income earning process and is not “of a capital nature”. Case law 21.In relation to R&D expenditure, there are only two New Zealand cases that are helpful in considering the capital/revenue boundary, and both were decided by the Taxation Review Authority (TRA). The TRA in Case N 55 1 considered whether the holding company of a group of companies that manufactured farm machinery could deduct expenditure incurred in developing a prototype 4-wheel drive farm vehicle. The prototype was built but the project was abandoned. The TRA held that the expenditure was necessarily incurred in carrying on the taxpayer’s business but was capital expenditure and non-deductible under the general deductibility provisions. It was incurred with a view to bringing into existence an asset for the enduring benefit of the business. The TRA stated that, as a rule, a certain degree of ongoing product development expenditure would properly be treated as a revenue item. 22.Case P 3 2 involved a taxpayer who manufactured and sold an extensive range of safety helmets. If existing stock for an order were not suitable, the taxpayer’s engineers would modify existing samples to meet the customer’s need. The TRA held that the costs of modifying a product to meet a customer’s need did not relate to the capital structure of the business and were on revenue account. The TRA considered that such modifications may produce an enduring benefit in the form of a new product, but that was only a corollary of being related to a particular order or range of products. Thus the expenditure was still deductible as being on revenue account. 23.In the Australian case of Goodman Fielder Wattie Ltd 3 Hill J. considered the deductibility of certain R&D expenditure of a taxpayer who was in the business of developing antibodies for application in the medical field. Hill J said that he did not need to consider whether the expenditure in question was deductible under the general deductibility provisions, because it would in any event be deductible under a specific provision allowing deductions for capital expenditure on scientific research. He said, however, that there was much to be said for the view that it was on revenue account. He noted that a company engaged in an enterprise involving new technology, where the nature of its activity requires ongoing research into product development, incurred expenditure that was recurrent, and part of the regular cost of its trading operations. 1 13 NZTC 3,434 2 14 NZTC 4,017 3 91 ATC 4438 Page 5 Timing of deduction 24.R&D expenditure that is deductible under the general deductibility provisions (or section DJ 9, discussed below) is deductible when it is incurred, subject to the application of the general timing rules in section EF 1 and EF 2. These provisions apply in limited circumstances to defer the timing of a deduction for expenditure that would otherwise be immediately deductible. 25.Section EF 1 broadly applies to expenditure on the purchase of goods that are not used, and services that are not performed in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The deduction for such expenditure is deferred until the goods are used and services are performed. 26.Section EF 2 defers expenditure incurred in relation to revenue account property until the property is sold. Revenue account property is property the sale proceeds of which are taxed – such as a patent. Section DJ 9 – deductibility of scientific research expenditure 27.Expenditure that is not deductible under the general deductibility provisions may be deductible under section DJ 9, which allows a deduction for expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in connection with scientific research carried out for the purpose of earning income. 28.Expenditure on depreciable assets used in the R&D process (such as plant and buildings) does not qualify for an immediate deduction. These inputs into the R&D process are depreciated in the same way as other capital assets of a business. The depreciation rules 29.Capital R&D expenditure, which is not deductible under section DJ 9, is deductible over time if it results in a depreciable asset (such as an intangible asset listed in Schedule 17 of the Act, or a prototype) that is used or available for use in the income earning process. However, if such expenditure does not give rise to a depreciable asset, the expenditure may not be deductible at all. (This is called “black hole” expenditure.) Page 6 PART III: ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF R&D EXPENDITURE 30.The treatment of R&D expenditure for financial reporting purposes is set out in FRS- 13. Nature of R&D expenditure covered by FRS-13 31.The commentary to FRS-13 notes that R&D activity is distinguished from non-research based activity by the presence or absence of an appreciable element of innovation. R&D that can be expensed 32.FRS-13 differentiates between “research” costs and “development” costs. (See below for definitions and a discussion of the distinction between these.) Research costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. FRS-13 requires development costs to be recognised as an asset (meaning they are not immediately expensed) when, and only when, all of the following criteria are met: • The product or process is clearly defined and the costs attributable to the product or process can be identified separately and measured reliably; • The technical feasibility of the product or process can be demonstrated; • The entity intends to produce and market, or use, the product or process; • The existence of a market for the product or process or its usefulness to the entity, if it is to be used internally, can be demonstrated; • Adequate resources exist, or their availability can be demonstrated, to complete the project and market or use the product or process. 33.Development costs in excess of the likely future economic benefits from the R&D are expensed even if they meet the criteria in paragraph 5.3. 34.To the extent the criteria above are not met, FRS-13 requires development costs to be expensed. If the criteria are met, FRS-13 requires development costs incurred from that point to be amortised and recognised as an expense on a systematic basis so as to reflect the pattern in which the related economic benefits are recognised. Amortisation begins when the product or process is available for sale or use. Other factors in determining whether R&D can be expensed Application of FRS-13 35.FRS-13 is not limited to an entity’s own R&D activities. FRS-13 applies to R&D activities carried out under contract for other entities where, under the substance of the arrangement, the contractor entity carries the risks and benefits of the R&D. 36.FRS-13 also provides the following exemptions, however, with regard to certain levels of R&D expenditure, certain types of R&D expenditure and certain entities. Page 7 • FRS-13 applies to all financial reports where such application is of material consequence. Where development costs are not material, therefore, they may be expensed even if they meet the criteria under paragraph 5.3. • Entities that qualify for the exemption under the Framework for Differential Reporting may expense all R&D costs in the period in which they are incurred. • FRS-13 does not cover the costs of exploration and development of oil, gas and mineral deposits in the extractive industries. Other FRS-13 requirements 37.The following requirements of FRS-13 are also relevant: • Development costs that have been expensed because the criteria in paragraph 5.3 were not met are not reinstated if the criteria are subsequently met. • Development costs recognised as an asset must be reviewed at the end of each accounting period and written off if the criteria for asset recognition no longer apply or the costs are in excess of related future benefits. These written-off costs must be reinstated if the events leading to the write-off no longer apply. “Research” and “development” defined 38.“Research” and “development” are defined in FRS-13 as: “Research” is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding. “Development” is the application of research findings or other knowledge to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services prior to the commencement of commercial production or use. 39.The distinction between research and development may be expressed as follows. Research activities typically involve investigation into something unknown in circumstances where there is a significant degree of uncertainty. In contrast, development activities typically involve elements of application of research findings in circumstances where the degree of uncertainty involved has been significantly reduced by the research activity. 40.FRS-13 provides a series of examples of activities that would typically be research, development or neither. The following are examples of research: • research aimed at discovery of new knowledge; • searching for applications of new research findings or other knowledge; • formulation and design of possible new or improved product or process alternatives; • testing in search of product or process alternatives. Page 8 41.Examples of activities that would typically be included in development are: • evaluation of product or process alternatives; • design, construction and testing of pre-production prototypes and models; • design of tools, jigs, moulds, and dies involving new technology; • design, construction and operation of a pilot plant that is not of a scale economically feasible for commercial production. 42.Examples of activities that would typically be excluded from R&D are: • engineering follow-through in an early phase of commercial production; • quality control during commercial production, including routine testing of products; • trouble-shooting in connection with breakdowns during commercial production; • routine, ongoing efforts to refine, enrich or otherwise improve on the qualities of an existing product; • adaptation of an existing capability to a particular requirement or customer’s need as part of a continuing commercial activity; • seasonal or other periodic design changes to existing products; • routine design of tools, jigs, moulds and dies; • activities; including design and construction engineering, related to the construction, relocation, rearrangement, or start-up of facilities or equipment other than facilities or equipment whose sole use is for a particular R&D project. Application of FRS-13 to different entities 43.Various categories of entity must comply with generally accepted accounting practice (GAAP) in their financial reports. (FRS-13 is part of GAAP, so a requirement to comply with GAAP is a requirement to comply with FRS-13, where relevant.) Entities required by law to comply with GAAP are issuers, companies other than exempt companies (see below), the Crown, government departments, Crown entities, local authorities and producer boards. Certain other entities may also be required to comply with GAAP under their own constitutional documents. 44.Therefore FRS-13 applies to a wide range of entities. As noted below, however, it does not apply to some entities, and certain other entities may be exempt from complying with the majority of its requirements under the Framework for Differential Reporting. Exempt companies 45. “Exempt companies” are not required to comply with GAAP. Generally, exempt companies are small companies that are not part of a group of companies. Their assets must be under $0.45 million, revenue under $1 million, and they can neither be a subsidiary nor have a subsidiary. Overseas companies and companies that offer securities to the public cannot be exempt companies. Page 9 46. The requirements for financial reports of exempt companies are instead set out in the Financial Reporting Order 1994. This has limited detail but provides that non-current assets must be stated at cost or valuation, less aggregate depreciation or amortisation. This requirement may cover any development costs capitalised by the entity. However, no specific recognition and measurement requirements regarding R&D costs are set out in the Financial Reporting Order. Entities that qualify for differential reporting 47.Entities that qualify for exemption under the Framework for Differential Reporting have a partial exemption from FRS-13. Such entities can expense all R&D under paragraph 2.2 of FRS-13, rather than comply with the requirements in section 5. Broadly, an entity qualifies for exemption if it does not have public accountability (that is, it has not issued securities to the public and does not have the power to tax, rate or levy to obtain public funds) and either: • At balance date, all of its owners are members of the entity’s governing body; or • The entity is not large (an entity is large if it exceeds two of the following – annual total revenue of $5 million, assets of $2.5 million, or 20 employees). 48.Wholly owned subsidiaries of large companies qualify for exemption under the Framework for Differential Reporting. 49.Taking advantage of exceptions under the Framework for Differential Reporting is optional. Taxpayers that qualify for differential reporting may choose to comply fully with paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13, and capitalise development costs that meet the conditions set out in that paragraph. Partnerships and sole traders 50.Partnerships and sole traders are not required by law to comply with GAAP. The professional obligations on members under the Rules of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand should result in FRS-13 being complied with where an Institute member prepares the accounts. However, generally partnerships and sole traders will not be required to capitalise development costs that meet the criteria in paragraph 5.3. Page 10 PART IV: PROPOSED TAX TREATMENT 51.R&D that is expensed for accounting under paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 will be deductible under the general deductibility provisions in section BD 2 provided the link with the income earning process is satisfied (and the deduction is not otherwise prohibited under section BD 2(2)(a) – (d) or (f)). These exclusions relate to private expenditure, expenditure incurred in deriving exempt income or income from employment, and expenditure specifically disallowed as a deduction. 52.Therefore all research expenditure, and development expenditure incurred up to the point that the criteria in paragraph 5.3 are satisfied will be deductible. Only development costs incurred after all the criteria are satisfied will not automatically be deductible as revenue account expenditure. Timing of deduction 53.The timing of the deduction will be determined in accordance with normal rules, under which an expense is deductible when incurred, unless sections EF 1 or EF 2 apply. As noted earlier, these sections apply in limited circumstances to defer a deduction. Section EF 1 defers a deduction for the purchase of goods until the goods are used in deriving income, and defers a deduction for payment for services until the services are performed. Section EF 2 defers a deduction for the cost of revenue account property. 54.Other provisions in the Act will also apply as they normally do to revenue expenditure. For example, taxpayers who produce R&D for the purpose of sale may be subject to the trading stock rules and be required to include in income the value of their work in progress at year end. The effect of this requirement is to defer the deduction until the trading stock is sold. Costs that are amortised for accounting 55.Normal tax treatment will apply to costs that are capitalised for accounting. Because the proposal will operate as a “safe harbour”, taxpayers who amortise costs for accounting may nevertheless argue that such costs are on revenue account for tax purposes. 56.If R&D costs that are amortised for accounting are considered to be on capital account for tax purposes, they will be immediately deductible under section DJ 9 if they are incurred in connection with “scientific research”. Some taxpayers argue that that term includes development expenditure. Section DJ 9 will remain as it is. 57.Alternatively, such costs will be amortised under the tax depreciation provisions, or may be “black hole” expenditure. Entities that are not required to apply the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 58.Most entities are not required to apply the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13. Only R&D that is expensed in accordance with paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 will be automatically deductible under this proposal. Page 11 59.Entities that are not required to comply with paragraph 5.3, therefore, have two choices. If they choose to comply with paragraph 5.3, they will obtain the benefit of increased certainty of tax treatment. However, if they do not want to incur compliance costs in complying with paragraph 5.3, the existing tax treatment will continue to apply to them. Costs that are not material for accounting 60.Under paragraph 2.3 of FRS-13, paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 applies only where its application is of material consequence. This means that, if the amount of R&D expenditure incurred by a firm is not material, it may all be expensed for accounting. This amount may nevertheless be significant in fiscal terms, because what is “material” for accounting relates to the size of the entity. 61.It is proposed that, for tax purposes, taxpayers will need to apply the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 in relation to costs, irrespective of materiality. Writing off, and reinstatement, of amortised costs 62.Under paragraph 5.14 and 5.15 of FRS-13, R&D costs that are amortised can be written down or written off if the criteria for recognition no longer apply. Such costs may be reinstated if the criteria subsequently do apply. 63.It is not proposed that tax follow FRS-13 in relation to costs that are amortised for accounting. (For example, the amortisation period for tax and accounting may differ.) Therefore amortised costs that are subsequently written off or down under paragraph 5.14 or 5.15 will not be immediately deductible under this proposal. Definition of R&D 64.The FRS-13 definitions of “research” and “development” are discussed earlier in this paper. It is proposed that if activity falls within those definitions, taking into account the commentary on the definitions, it will be R&D for the purposes of the proposed tax amendment. 65.The definitions refer to new knowledge and new or substantially improved products and processes. This is explained in paragraph 4.4 of the commentary, which refers to the distinguishing feature of R&D – there is an appreciable element of innovation. To be R&D, the activity must depart from routine and break new ground. If it follows an established pattern, it is normally to be excluded. 66.The costs of creating a product that is new to the firm will not be R&D unless these conditions are met. For example, the making of a new sound recording by a recording company using standard techniques will not be R&D. Similarly, the writing of a new software programme using standard techniques will not be R&D. Also, the purchase of new technology is not in itself R&D. Page 12 Fixed asset inputs into the R&D process 67.Fixed asset inputs into the R&D process (such as vehicles, buildings and patents) will continue to be depreciated at tax depreciation rates rather than accounting depreciation rates. When no tax depreciation is allowed for fixed asset inputs (for example, intangibles not listed in Schedule 17, such as know-how or goodwill), no tax deduction will be available in relation to the acquisition of those assets. R&D “black hole” expenditure 68.Expenditure that is not deductible at all is called “black hole” expenditure. Theoretically, some R&D expenditure will fall within this category – for example, development costs on capital account that do not give rise to a depreciable asset. In practice, however, it appears that taxpayers generally find a way to deduct black hole expenditure. 69.The proposal is likely to reduce the amount of any R&D expenditure that is black hole. R&D costs that do not lead to an asset will be expensed for accounting. They will, therefore, be immediately deductible for tax. 70.The Government accepts that black hole expenditure may still occur in theory. We have always stated that we would welcome actual examples showing the extent to which this occurs in practice. If it is demonstrated that substantial R&D expenditure will be black hole, the Government will consider that issue further. Software 71.The Commissioner of Inland Revenue set out his views on the tax treatment of software development costs in 1993 in the Tax Information Bulletin, Vol. 4 No. 10. That item includes a discussion on the deductibility of the costs of developing software for in-house use. Broadly, pre-development costs are immediately deductible, and development expenses are capitalised until the project is completed and then depreciated over three years. 72.Certain software development costs will be affected by this proposal. Software R&D costs will be treated in the same way as any other R&D costs. Not all software development will be R&D for the purposes of FRS-13. In order to fall within FRS-13, there must be an appreciable element of novelty. The activity must depart from routine and break new ground. Examples of the proposed tax treatment 73.The proposed tax treatment is best demonstrated by way of example: Page 13 Example 1 Prototype engine A Co is a car manufacturer that, for some years, has been in the process of developing a new car engine that is particularly efficient in fuel consumption. All expenditure on salaries and materials, and depreciation on assets used in the process, has been expensed to date, as the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 have not been met. Under this proposal, for tax purposes, the fixed asset costs will be depreciated at the tax depreciation rates. Other costs will be immediately deducted. In 2000 the company builds a prototype and is satisfied that, with minor modifications, the engine will work. A Co intends to make those modifications, complete final trials and begin production. The company expects that it will reap significant future economic benefits from the sale of cars that run on the engine. Building the prototype will be development as defined in FRS-13. The criteria for recognition as an asset are likely to be met in 2000. From this point onwards, the costs of the minor modifications will be capitalised and amortised for accounting. They are, therefore, not automatically immediately deductible for tax under this proposal. Example 2 Software B Co is a jeweller that mines diamonds from its own mines. It hires a consultant to produce software that analyses details of the dimension and character of uncut diamond in order to select the cutting technique and maximise the value of the final jewellery. No existing software performs this function. The copyright in the software will belong to B Co, and the consultant is paid on an hourly basis rather than charging a success fee. B Co carries the risks and benefits of the software development and is, therefore, entitled to use the proposal. It is likely that the software design will be development for the purposes of FRS-13, assuming there is an appreciable element of innovation. For both tax and accounting, B Co can expense all fees paid to the consultant in connection with the software until the criteria in paragraph 5.3 are satisfied. B Co does not need to apply the treatment of software development costs set out in Tax Information Bulletin, Vol.4 No. 10. Example 3 Failed development A research company, C Co, has developed a genetically engineered low fat food product. Under FRS-13, depreciation and other costs have been expensed, as the existence of a market for the food has not been demonstrated. Using the tax treatment set out in this proposal, C Co depreciates the fixed assets and immediately deducts the other costs. Page 14 C Co now believes there is a potential opportunity to sell the product and commits to producing it commercially. Commercial production would be a significant extension to C Co’s income-earning activities, and it considers expenses in connection with the project are on capital account under general tax principles. C Co carries out market research before starting commercial production to establish the existence of a market. The market research shows that the majority of New Zealanders will not eat genetically engineered food, and C Co aborts its production project. The criteria for capitalising development costs in FRS-13 are not satisfied. To the extent that C Co treats the market research expenditure as development costs (see paragraph 4.12 of FRS-13) it will be expensed under FRS-13 in C Co’s financial reports. It can, therefore, be expensed for tax purposes. The market research may previously have been treated as black hole expenditure. Form of legislation 74.There are two possible ways of incorporating the proposal into legislation. The first would effectively involve copying the relevant part of the financial reporting standard into the Act. The second would involve referring to that relevant part in the Act. Specific incorporation 75.This would involve incorporating into the Act the current wording of the definitions of “research” and “development”, together with paragraphs 4.4 and 5.1 to 5.4 from FRS-13. Although this has the advantage of having all the tax rules relating to R&D within the Act, the courts could interpret that wording in a different way to wording in the financial reporting standard. As the proposal is intended to clarify the capital/revenue boundary for tax purposes by linking it to the capital/revenue boundary for accounting purposes, departures from the accounting standard should be kept to a minimum. 76.Further, the deliberately flexible wording of the financial reporting standard might not sit well in the Act. Incorporation by reference 77.Cross-referencing to the financial reporting standard is the approach adopted in the trading stock rules. Section EE 5 refers to generally accepted accounting principles and, in particular, to Financial Reporting Standard 4 (Accounting For Inventories). 78.The main feature of this approach is that if the financial reporting standard changes, there is no need to change tax legislation unless the Government wishes to do so. We understand that before any financial reporting standard is amended, comprehensive consultation would be undertaken. This would give the Government time to amend the Act if necessary. Page 15 Preferred approach 79.The Government prefers incorporation by reference but welcomes submissions on this issue. Compliance with paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13 for financial reporting purposes 80.The main argument for requiring alignment between tax and financial reporting is that the proposal will create pressure on FRS-13 as taxpayers seek to expense as much development expenditure as possible. The legal and commercial requirements imposed on taxpayers when reporting to their shareholders may counterbalance this pressure. This counterbalance will not exist if taxpayers are allowed to adopt FRS-13 paragraph 5.3 for tax purposes only. 81.The argument against requiring alignment is that it might be impractical and impose higher compliance costs in some cases. 82.Submissions are welcomed on this issue. Fiscal risk from avoidance activity 83.The Government is concerned about recategorisation of expenditure as R&D, and avoidance schemes developing around R&D. In order to minimise the fiscal risk therefore, we propose to enable items to be excluded from the definition of R&D by regulation. This will enable the Government to move quickly against avoidance schemes. A similar approach to defining R&D was recently adopted in the United Kingdom in section 837A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. 84.The Government may also consider taking specific anti-avoidance measures to complement section BG 1. Tax audit 85.Two areas of dispute could arise between Inland Revenue and the taxpayer. The first is whether the expenditure is R&D. 86.The second is whether the criteria in paragraph 5.3 are satisfied. It is a matter of judgement when the criteria for amortisation in that paragraph are satisfied. Taxpayers will be in the best position to make those judgements. They are likely to be challenged by Inland Revenue only when they are clearly not sustainable. 87.Taxpayers will not be able to obtain a binding ruling on whether their accounting treatment of R&D costs complies with paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13. The Commissioner cannot issue a binding ruling if the application for a ruling would require him to form an opinion as to a generally accepted accounting principle or a commercially acceptable practice (sections 91E(4)(j) and 91F(4)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Page 16 PART V: OTHER ISSUES Full deductibility of R&D expenditure 88.Some taxpayers have asked why the Government does not move now to allow immediate deductibility of all R&D, instead of proceeding with the FRS-13 proposal in tandem with the new funding for grants announced in the Budget. 89.With both options there is the fiscal risk of reclassification of expenditure as R&D. This is most likely to occur in relation to activities at the boundary between development and production. The FRS-13 proposal relies on the accounting requirement to amortise development expenditure at the end of the R&D process to reduce that fiscal risk. In effect, there would be a buffer between immediately deductible development expenditure, and production expenditure, which would be less favourably treated for tax purposes. That buffer is development expenditure that is amortised because it satisfies the criteria in paragraph 5.3 of FRS-13. 90.If the alternative approach, immediate deductibility of all R&D costs, were adopted there would be no buffer between immediately deductible development expenditure and costs at the development/production boundary that are more properly classified as production. It would be important to define the development/production boundary with as much precision as possible. This approach to the definition is generally adopted in other jurisdictions. 91.If we were to consider full deductibility, one example that the Government could look to is the Australian tax definition of R&D, attached as an annex to this paper. This contains a list of activities which are excluded from R&D. Some of the items in that list seek to clarify the development/production boundary – for example, the exclusion for pre-production activities such as the demonstration of commercial viability, tooling-up and trial runs. (Other items, such as research into the social sciences, arts or humanities, are presumably excluded because the Australian government wishes to target its tax concession to science and technology-based activities.) Legislative timetable and application date 92.It is likely that any legislation to implement the proposal will not be enacted until the latter part of 2001. Ordinarily, this would mean application from the 2002-2003 income year. However, the Government will consider applying the amendments from the beginning of the 2001-2002 income year if taxpayers preferred this.

TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS OF BENEFICIARY INCOME FROM TRUSTS TO MINORS Contents Introduction1 Submissions2 Application date of the minor beneficiary rule2 The rule and its rationale3 Exceptions to the rule4 Definition of a “minor”6 Operational issues6 APPENDIX: Australian Legislation8 Page 1 Taxation of distributions of beneficiary income from trusts to minors Introduction The Government announced in the Budget that it will introduce legislation to tax distributions of beneficiary income from trusts to minors at the trustee rate of 33% (“the minor beneficiary rule”). This income is currently taxed at the minor’s marginal tax rate, which can be as low as 19.5%. The purpose of the rule is to limit the tax benefits of using a trust as a device for splitting income with minors. Income splitting can occur within a family unit when taxpayers allocate income to other members of the family who face lower marginal tax rates, in order to achieve tax savings. This may involve a person transferring income-producing assets to a trust. The income arising from that asset is then distributed as beneficiary income to minors who are on a low marginal tax rate. This income is often, in substance, not income of the children. Other than the general anti-avoidance rules in the Income Tax Act 1994, New Zealand does not have specific rules to limit the ability of trusts to be used to split income. Before 1988, the trust taxation rules did contain some limited rules to counter opportunities for income splitting. These rules broadly provided that income of a trust was taxed to the trustee instead of a beneficiary if it remained within the possession or under the control of the trustee; these rules had particular application to infant beneficiaries. These restrictions, however, were generally considered to be ineffective. For example, income could arguably be taxed to an infant beneficiary by passing it through to a sub-trust in the infant beneficiary’s favour. Rather than placing further restrictions on the ability of the trustees to have income taxed to beneficiaries, the Consultative Committee that developed the current taxation rules in 1988 recommended the removal of these restrictions on income splitting. This was a reflection of the flatter tax rates that New Zealand was moving towards in 1988 which significantly reduced the benefits of income splitting. 1 However, the incentive to use trusts to split income has subsequently increased as a result of the increase in the range to which the lower marginal tax rates apply, the reduction in the lower marginal rate and the increase in the top marginal tax rate to 39%. 1 The Consultative Committee on Full Imputation and International Tax Reform. International Tax Reform. Full Imputation. Part 2. Report of The Consultative Committee. July 1988, p.79. Page 2 A number of detailed issues will require analysis in the design and development of this policy. These issues include exceptions from the proposed minor rule, the definition of a “minor” and operational matters. Submissions In developing this policy, the Government is seeking the views of interested members of the public on the details of how the Government’s policy should best be implemented. In particular, the Government wishes to receive submissions that deal with issues such as: - Appropriate exceptions to the minor beneficiary rule. - How the term “minor” should be defined. - Associated operational matters. Submissions may be made in electronic form to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: Minor Beneficiary Rule c/o General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Submissions should be made before 24 July 2000. They should include a brief summary of their major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for officials to consult those making the submission to discuss their submission if required. Application date of the minor beneficiary rule Legislation for the minor beneficiary rule will be introduced in Parliament later this year, probably in October. Once enacted it will come into effect in respect of income derived from 1 April 2001, or for the equivalent income year. Page 3 The rule and its rationale In a Budget press statement Hon Dr Michael Cullen, Minister of Revenue, stated: “The Government will introduce legislation this year to require trust distributions of beneficiary income to minors to be taxed at the 33 percent trustee tax rate. This will limit the benefits of any income splitting through directing trust income to children. Currently this income could be taxed at rates as low as 19.5 percent.” Under current tax law a trust’s annual income is separated into two classes: beneficiary income and trustee income. Beneficiary income is all income earned by a trust in an income year which vests absolutely in the beneficiary, or is distributed to the beneficiary during or within six months after the end of the income year. Trustee income is all of a trust’s annual income which is not beneficiary income. Therefore distributed income is taxed to the beneficiaries, whereas retained income is taxed to the trustees. Trustee income is taxed at a flat rate of 33%, whereas beneficiary income is taxed at the marginal tax rate of the beneficiaries, which may be as low as 19.5%. This can encourage parents who are taxed at the 33% or 39% marginal tax rates to settle income-earning assets on a family trust. In the normal course of events parents will fund activities associated with their children from their after-tax income. By using a trust, however, the income is channelled through the trust to the children. That same amount spent on the children, if it covers expenses over and above normal parental obligations, is claimed to be beneficiary income of the children and is consequently taxed at their marginal rate, which is likely to be 19.5%. This income which is claimed to be income of the children is, in substance, often not theirs, and should not qualify for a tax rate set to apply to lower income earners. For example, Inland Revenue records show that in the 1998 income year, about 3,500 children under the age of six received beneficiary income exceeding $27 million in total. This is an average of $7,700 income for each child under the age of six and excludes interest and dividend income distributed by trusts. It seems hard to argue that such substantial income attributed to minors can fairly be said to qualify for tax rates meant to apply to low incomes. Australia does not allow trust income of child beneficiaries to be taxed as if it were income derived by a low-income earner. Australia taxes beneficiary income of minors at the trustee rate and top personal income tax rate – 47%. It is proposed that New Zealand follow a similar approach, at the New Zealand trustee rate of 33%, rather than the top personal tax rate of 39%. However, beneficiaries with total income (including beneficiary income) over $60,000 will be required to pay 39% on any income over $60,000. The choice of 33% recognises that the alternative is for the income to be accumulated in the trust for the required period (up to 18 months). In that case the 33% trustee rate applies. Page 4 The rule will apply only to beneficiary income from trusts for which current law now requires a trust tax return. This excludes, for example, bare trustees, who are merely nominees of the beneficiary. It is not intended that the rule will apply in respect of assets such as bank accounts in the name of children. The rule will be limited to beneficiary income of minors. It is not proposed that it apply to beneficiary income of spouses, even though it is recognised that, subject to anti- avoidance provisions, income can be allocated to low-income spouses to produce tax benefits. A spouse’s income is more likely to be in substance, income of that spouse. The minor beneficiary rule will apply to distributions from trusts to a non-resident beneficiary where there is a New Zealand resident settlor, subject to the normal double taxation agreement rules. The issue of distributions to a minor from group investment funds (GIFs) is especially difficult. On the one hand, GIFs are treated as qualifying trusts and consequently should be subject to the rule unless they fit within one of the exceptions. On the other hand, the restrictions on how investments can be made by GIFs means that income splitting opportunities do not arise. Further consideration on GIFs will be undertaken in consultation. Distributions from unit trusts to a minor will not be subject to the minor beneficiary rule. Unit trusts are not subject to the normal trust taxation rules, but are taxed as companies. Exceptions to the rule It is recognised that minors receive income as beneficiaries of a trust in a wide variety of circumstances, some of which do not involve income splitting. For example, a minor may receive income from a trust established for his or her benefit in satisfaction of a claim for damages for loss of parental support through death or injury. Consequently, it is appropriate to exclude some of these situations from the application of the minor beneficiary rule. The Australian rules for minor beneficiaries - in Division 6AA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 - contain a number of exclusions from the 47% rate. For example, excluded are minors who are: • In full-time employment. • Entitled to a child disability allowance or disability support pension. • Disabled or have a continuing inability to work, or are permanently blind. • Entitled to a double orphan’s pension, and who are not wholly or substantially dependent for support on relatives. Page 5 • Are unlikely, by reason of permanent disability to be able to engage in full-time employment, and who are not substantially dependent for support on relatives. The higher tax rate in Australia also does not apply to certain classes of beneficiary income. For example, it does not apply to: • Income of a trust which arose out of a will, a codicil, intestacy or a court order. • Income of a trust from property which was transferred to the trust for the benefit of the minor beneficiary as a result of the death of a person if the property came from a policy of life insurance, the proceeds of a provident, benefit, superannuation or retirement fund, or a payment by the employer of a deceased person. • Income of the trust from property which was transferred to the trust for the benefit of a minor if the property has been received by the transferor from a deceased estate. The exception applies only if the property was transferred within three years of the death of the person from whom the transferor received the property and the amount transferred would have been received by the beneficiary of the trust if the deceased person had died intestate. • Income arising from the investment of property transferred to the trust for the benefit of the minor beneficiary by way of or in satisfaction of a claim for damages, in certain specified situations (for example, workers compensation). • Distributions from public funds established for the benefit of persons in necessitous circumstances and maintained exclusively for that purpose. • Moneys arising from property transferred as a result of family breakdown. • Income derived from the investment of property held as a result of winnings in legally authorised and conducted lotteries if the beneficiary was the beneficial owner of the prize. The Australian exclusions concern situations where the potential for income splitting is limited. The New Zealand exceptions will be similar to those in place in Australia, as modified during the consultation process to suit circumstances in New Zealand. The relevant provisions of the Australian legislation are included as an appendix to this paper, to allow consideration of the appropriateness of these exceptions to New Zealand. Division 6AA is not limited to income derived by minors indirectly through a trust. It applies equally to income derived directly by minors, such as dividends and interest. Income derived directly by minors will not be covered by the New Zealand rule. Distributions of beneficiary income to minors from the Maori Trustee and Maori authorities will not be subject to the rule. The Maori Trustee is taxed as a Maori authority except in its capacity as a collection and distribution agent for rents, royalties or interest, in which case the Maori Trustee is taxed as if it were beneficially entitled to the income. The appropriate tax treatment of Maori authorities, including the Maori Trustee, is being considered as part of the review of the taxation of Maori authorities. Page 6 Definition of a “minor” How the term “minor” is defined for the purposes of the minor beneficiary rule is necessarily somewhat arbitrary. The Age of Majority Act 1970 provides that a minor is a person under the age of 20 years, in the absence of an alternative definition or any indication of a contrary intention in specific legislation. The qualifying age of a person is varied in many pieces of legislation, depending on its purpose. Whether a minor includes a person, who is or has been married also depends on the particular legislation. The preferred age for the purposes of this rule is under the age of 18. This is the age used in Australia. By the time the child is 18, it is considerably less likely that the income will, in substance, be that of the family, rather than that of the minor. The age of 18 is also, for example, the age at which the Minors’ Contracts Act 1961 provides that a contract will be enforceable against a minor. Operational issues There are two options for ensuring that the beneficiary income of minors is taxed at a minimum of 33%. The first option is to tax the beneficiary income as if it were income of the trust. This income is not trustee income but beneficiary income which is taxed at the trust level at a minimum rate of 33%. However, beneficiaries with total income (including beneficiary income), over $60,000 would need to include in their annual tax return, so much of their beneficiary income as brought their total income over $60,000. A credit would be given for tax paid at the trust level at 33%, but additional tax would be liable to ensure tax was paid at the correct 39% rate. Minor beneficiaries will not be required to return this beneficiary income in a tax return unless their total income (including beneficiary income) is over $60,000. For example, a child earns $40,000 directly and receives $30,000 in beneficiary income. The beneficiary income is taxed at 33% in the trust. The child includes $10,000 in his or her own income with a credit for 33% tax paid at the trust level. Additional tax is payable by the child of 6 cents in the dollar on this $10,000. The second option is to continue to require the minor beneficiary to return all the beneficiary income. As is now the case, tax would be deducted by the trustee as agent for the beneficiary, and the child would include the full amount as income in his or her return with a credit for tax paid at the trustee level. The credit would need to be limited to ensure that the beneficiary did not receive a credit for the 33% rate paid on income below $38,000. An advantage of the second option is that it may impose lower compliance costs on trustees in terms of the provisional tax rules, however overall, the first option would seem to have lower compliance and administrative costs. Page 7 The second option includes all beneficiary income in the child’s income so that it is taken into account for determining his or her eligibility for social assistance targeted through the tax system, such as student loan repayment obligations, child support obligations and family assistance. However, given that the measure applies only to child beneficiaries, this is unlikely to affect many.

Page 12 102AD Taxable income to which Division applies The eligible taxable income of a year of income of a person who is a prescribed person in relation to the year of income is the amount (if any) remaining after deducting from the eligible assessable income of the person of the year of income - (a) any deductions allowable to the person in relation to the year of income that relate exclusively to that eligible assessable income; (b) so much of any other deductions (other than apportionable deductions) allowable to the person in relation to the year of income as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, may appropriately be related to that eligible assessable income; and (c) the amount that bears to the apportionable deductions allowable to the person in relation to the year of income the same proportion as the amount that, but for this paragraph, would be the eligible taxable income of the person of the year of income bears to the sum of - (i) the taxable income of the person of the year of income; and (ii) the apportionable deductions allowable to the person in relation to the year of income. 102AE Eligible assessable income (1) Definition For the purposes of this Division, the eligible assessable income of a year of income of a person is so much of the assessable income of the person of the year of income as is not excepted assessable income.

(3) Reference to income of minor under s 92 A reference in paragraph (2)(d) to an amount (not being business income) that is included in the assessable income of a person under section 92 in respect of the individual interest of the person in the net income of a partnership shall be read as a reference to so much of an amount so included in that assessable income as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is attributable to so much of the assessable income of the partnership as would, in the opinion of the Commissioner, have been excepted assessable income if the assessable income of the partnership had been derived by that person. (4) Reference to income of minor under s 97 or s 100 A reference in paragraph (2)(e) to an amount included in the assessable income of a person under section 97 or 100 shall be read as not including a reference to any part to which this Division applies of an amount included in that assessable income under either of those sections.

(6) Excepted assessable income not to exceed arm's length amount Subject to subsection (7), if any 2 or more parties to: (a) the derivation of the excepted assessable income mentioned in subsection (2); or (b) any act or transaction directly or indirectly connected with the derivation of that excepted assessable income; were not dealing with each other at arm's length in relation to the derivation, or in relation to the act or transaction, the excepted assessable income is only so much (if any) of that income as would have been derived if they had been dealing with each other at arm's length in relation to the derivation, or in relation to the act or transaction. (7) Subsection (2) not to apply where agreement intended to secure eligible assessable income Subsection (2) does not apply in relation to assessable income derived by a person directly or indirectly under or as a result of an agreement that was entered into or carried out by any person (whether before or after the commencement of this subsection) for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of securing that that assessable income would not be eligible assessable income. (8) Incidental purpose disregarded In determining whether subsection (7) applies in relation to an agreement, no regard shall be had to a purpose that is a merely incidental purpose.

(8) Property deemed transferred for benefit of beneficiaries For the purposes of this section, where - (a) any property is transferred to the trustee of a trust estate; and (b) the trustee has a discretion to pay or apply the income derived from that property to or for the benefit of specified beneficiaries or beneficiaries included in a specified class of beneficiaries, that property shall be taken to have been transferred to the trustee for the benefit of each of those specified beneficiaries or for each of the beneficiaries in that specified class of beneficiaries, as the case may be. 102AGA Transfer of property as the result of a family breakdown (1) Definitions For the purposes of subparagraph 102AE(2)(b)(viii) or 102AG(2)(c)(viii), the transfer of property (the “subject property”) by a person the “transferor”): (a) to the minor mentioned in subparagraph 102AE(2)(b)(viii); or (b) to the trustee mentioned in subparagraph 102AG(2)(c)(viii) for the benefit of the beneficiary mentioned in that subparagraph; is “as the result of a family breakdown” if the requirements of subsection (2) or (3) of this section are met. (2) Circumstance of family breakdown The transfer will be as the result of a family breakdown if: (a) a person ceases to live with another person as the spouse of that person on a genuine domestic basis (whether or not legally married to that person); and (b) at least one of the persons: (i) is the natural parent; or (ii) is the adoptive parent; or (iii) is the step-parent; or (iv) has legal custody or guardianship; of the minor or the beneficiary; and (c) an order, determination or assessment of a court, person or body (whether or not in Australia) is made wholly or partly because the person has ceased to live as the spouse of the other person on a genuine domestic basis; and (d) the effect of the order, determination or assessment is that a person (whether one of the spouses, the transferor or any other person) becomes subject to a legal obligation to maintain, transfer property to, or do some other thing for the benefit of, the minor or beneficiary or one of the spouses; and Page 20 (e) the transferor transfers the subject property to the minor, or to the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary, in giving effect to the legal obligation (including in discharging the legal obligation if it falls on someone else, and whether or not the legal obligation could have been given effect in some other way). (3) Transfer result of family breakdown The transfer will also be as a result of a family breakdown if: (a) when the minor or beneficiary is born, his or her natural parents are not living together as spouses on a genuine domestic basis (whether or not legally married); and (b) an order, determination or assessment of a court, person or body (whether or not in Australia) is made wholly or partly because the natural parents are not living together as mentioned in paragraph (a); and (c) the effect of the order, determination or assessment is that a person (whether one of the natural parents, the transferor or any other person) becomes subject to a legal obligation to maintain, transfer property to, or do some other thing for the benefit of, the minor or beneficiary or one of the natural parents of the minor or beneficiary; and (d) the transferor transfers the subject property to the minor, or to the trustee for the benefit of the beneficiary, in giving effect to the legal obligations (including in discharging the legal obligation if it falls on someone else, and whether or not the legal obligation could have been given effect in some other way). 102AH Commissioner may allow rebate (1) Fair and reasonable tax rebate Subject to this section, where it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that, in relation to income derived during a year of income by a prescribed person, or by a trustee on behalf of a prescribed person, under arrangements entered into on or before 26 July 1979, it would be unreasonable that the whole of the additional amount of tax payable in respect of that income by virtue of the application of this Division should be payable, the Commissioner may grant to the prescribed person or the trustee, as the case may be, in an assessment in respect of any such income, a rebate of tax of such amount (if any) as the Commissioner considers fair and reasonable, not exceeding that additional amount. (2) Condition for rebate where parents of prescribed person have taxable income In a case where a parent of the prescribed person, or the parents of the prescribed person, has or have in relation to the year of income a taxable income or taxable incomes, neither the prescribed person nor any trustee is entitled to a rebate under subsection (1) in relation to income that is subject to tax by virtue of the application of this Division, unless it is established to the Commissioner's satisfaction that the tax payable in respect of that income under this Act, apart from this section and section 102AJ, is greater than the tax that would have been payable in respect of that income if the parent of the prescribed person who has the higher taxable income (or in a case where the parents have equal taxable incomes, the father) had been liable to pay tax in respect of an amount equal to the taxable income of that parent increased by so much of the aggregate of the incomes of the children of that parent, or of trustees for the children, as represents income to which this Division applies that was derived under arrangements entered into on or before 26 July 1979. Page 21 (3) Relevant factors in determining amount of rebate In determining the amount of any rebate that may be granted to a person in accordance with subsection (1) - (a) the Commissioner may, if he is satisfied that the aggregated taxable income referred to in subsection (2) was, by reason of any tax avoidance agreement, lower than it would have been but for any such agreement, take that factor into account as a factor operating against the granting of the rebate; and (b) the Commissioner may have regard to such other matters as he thinks fit. (4) Discretion to disallow or reduce rebate Where the Commissioner, in an assessment, has granted a rebate to a person under this section and the Commissioner subsequently forms the opinion that the rebate should not have been granted or that a lesser rebate should have been granted, nothing in section 170 prevents the amendment of the assessment for the purpose of disallowing or reducing the rebate, as the case may be. (5) Discretion to grant or increase rebate at any time Nothing in section 170 prevents the amendment of an assessment at any time for the purpose of granting a rebate under this section or increasing a rebate granted under this section. (6) Definition of “tax avoidance agreement” In this section, “tax avoidance agreement” means an agreement, not being an agreement entered into or carried out in the course of ordinary family or commercial dealing, that was entered into or carried out by any person for the purpose, or for purposes that included the purpose, of securing that a person who, if the agreement had not been entered into or carried out, would have been liable to pay income tax in respect of a year of income would not be liable to pay income tax in respect of that year of income or would be liable to pay less income tax in respect of that year of income than that person would have been liable to pay if the agreement had not been entered into or carried out. 102AJ Rebate in case of serious hardship (1) Right to tax rebate In any case where it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that - (a) the tax that, apart from this section and apart from section 265, would be payable by a person in respect of a year of income exceeds the tax that, apart from section 265, would be payable by the person in respect of that year of income if this Division had not been enacted; and (b) for any reason, the exaction of the full amount of tax that, apart from this section and apart from section 265, would be payable by the person in respect of that year of income would entail serious hardship, that person is entitled, in his assessment in respect of that year of income, to a rebate of tax of such amount, not exceeding the amount of the excess referred to in paragraph (a), as the Commissioner considers reasonable. (2) Reference to tax payable by a person A reference in subsection (1) to tax payable by a person shall be read as including a reference to tax payable by a trustee of a trust estate in pursuance of section 98 in respect of a share of a beneficiary of the net income of the trust estate. Page 22 (3) Discretion to grant or increase rebate at any time Nothing in section 170 prevents the amendment of an assessment at any time for the purpose of granting a rebate under this section or increasing a rebate granted under this section.
The tax status of credit unions An issues paper 6 September 2000 Prepared by: The Treasury Ministry of Economic Development Policy Advice Division of Inland Revenue The tax status of credit unions: an issues paper First published in September 2000 by the Policy Advice Division of the Inland Revenue Department, PO Box 2198, Wellington, New Zealand. ISBN 0-478-10338-7 Page 1 INTRODUCTION 1.For over a century income derived by credit unions, except for that derived from a business carried on beyond the circle of membership, has been exempt from taxation. 2.In 1989 the Consultative Committee on the Tax Treatment of Life Insurance and Related Areas recommended that income derived by credit unions should be subject to tax. That recommendation was accepted by the Government of the day, but implementation of the recommendation was deferred until a review of the regulatory environment was completed. 3.Taxing the income derived by credit unions would be consistent with the tax treatment of other non-profit bodies who make distributions to members. Those bodies pay tax in the normal way. 4.The regulatory review of credit unions has not been completed, although the deposit limit for credit unions has recently been increased from $40,000 to $250,000. This has raised concerns that the increase could create or extend any competitive advantage associated with the credit union tax exemption. The Government has therefore directed the Treasury and Inland Revenue, in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Development, to report on whether the current exemption is appropriate. 5.In deciding whether the current exemption is appropriate, the Government will need to consider the implications of removing it. 6.This paper addresses issues about the way in which credit unions should be taxed if the exemption were to be removed. It sets out a number of proposals for consideration if this was to be the case. Submissions 7.Submissions are invited on the proposals in this paper. In particular, we are interested in receiving submissions that deal with issues such as: • whether it is appropriate to treat credit unions in the same manner for tax purposes as other non-profit bodies who make distributions to members; • whether or not credit unions’ tax exemption leads to a competitive advantage relative to other financial services providers, and if so, the extent of that advantage; • details of the extent of compliance costs associated with any of the proposals in this paper; Page 2 • whether a minimum threshold should be applied so that smaller credit unions are not subject to income tax. If so, should the minimum threshold be based on values of assets, the deposit limit chosen by a particular credit union, or types of common bond? 8.Submissions may be made in electronic form to: Policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: Tax Status of Credit Unions C/o General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON 9.Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. They should be made by 6 October 2000. SUMMARY OF PROPOSALS SET OUT IN THIS ISSUES PAPER • Either: -The tax treatment would be determined by the nature of the legal entity carrying on the credit union business; or -Credit unions could be deemed to be companies (for tax purposes only). • Credit union dividends would continue to be treated as interest for tax purposes. They would, therefore, be allowed as a deduction to credit unions. • Section HF 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (Profits of mutual associations in respect of transactions with members) would be simplified for credit unions. No apportionment of rebates would be required. • No deduction would be allowed for amounts transferred to reserves to meet a credit union’s reserve asset ratio requirements. However, the requirement that amounts transferred cannot be returned to members would be reviewed. Page 3 Ancillary issues • Assets could be revalued at market value for tax purposes, at the date taxation was imposed. • Distributions from retained earnings would be treated as interest paid, as they are at the moment. • If distributions were able to be made from the general reserve, conceptually, these amounts should be treated as interest. However, the tax treatment of these distributions would be considered as part of the review of whether reserved amounts should be able to be repaid to members. • Continuity of losses and imputation credits would be protected against changes in “shareholding” if credit unions were deemed to be companies. • The issue of whether taxation should start from a particular date or from the beginning of an income year would be discussed with credit unions. PART I: BACKGROUND Current tax treatment 10.Income derived by credit unions, except for that derived from a business carried on beyond the circle of membership, is exempt from income tax. 11.Cases such as Port Chalmers Waterfront Workers Union v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[1996\] 17 NZTC 12,523 discuss what is meant by “business carried on beyond the circle of its membership”. In that case the workers’ union received “equity payments” in relation to the proposed introduction of containerisation. The Court of Appeal held that the nature of work involved in securing, maintaining and dealing with the equity payments did not constitute carrying on a business. 12.The court further held that whether investment or other operations amount to carrying on a business is a question of fact and degree turning on the nature, purpose and extent of the activities undertaken. It is, therefore, a matter of fact and degree when determining whether a credit union that deposits money in a bank is carrying on a business beyond the circle of its membership, and consequently whether the interest derived is subject to tax or not. 13.Therefore interest derived by credit unions from non-members is not subject to tax unless the business test is satisfied in relation to that income. 14.Interest paid to members is taxed in the members’ hands. Page 4 History of the tax exemption 15.The rationale for the exemption is unknown. The exemption applies to both credit unions and friendly societies. Friendly societies have had a tax exemption since the first Tax Act was enacted, in 1891. No records are held on why the exemption was introduced. A possible rationale was recognition of the benevolent nature of friendly societies. Alternatively, at that stage low-income earners were not subject to income tax, making it rational to exempt organisations such as credit unions, the membership of which consisted of low-income earners. 16.Before the enactment of the Friendly Societies and Credit Unions Act 1982 (the FSCU Act) the friendly society movement had operated loan funds within their societies. The statutory recognition given to credit unions in the FSCU Act required those loan funds to be registered as credit unions. 17.The taxation treatment of credit unions was reviewed in 1989 by the Consultative Committee on the Tax Treatment of Life Insurance and Related Areas. The committee recommended that income derived by credit unions should be subject to tax, but it was eventually decided to defer the implementation of the recommendations until the regulatory environment for credit unions was reviewed. 18.In 1995, the Treasury released the discussion paper Friendly Societies and Credit Unions: Proposed legislative reforms, on which credit unions and interested parties were invited to make submissions. 19.During September 1998, the Ministry of Commerce released a discussion paper on a proposal to include credit unions under the Companies Act 1993. That proposal, however, was not adopted, and work on alternative regulatory regimes has not yet begun. 20.More recently, the Ministry of Economic Development invited submissions on the proposal to increase the deposit limit for credit unions. The deposit limit has now been increased to $250,000. The current tax review was advanced ahead of the completion of the regulatory review because of concerns about competitive neutrality following the increase. PART II: COMPETITIVE NEUTRALITY 21.There are two competitive neutrality issues in any discussion of the tax treatment of credit unions: • whether the tax exemption for credit unions provides a competitive advantage over other financial service providers who do not enjoy such an exemption; and • whether legislative constraints placed by the FSCU Act on the structure and operations of credit unions disadvantage them relative to other financial service providers who are not subject to the same restrictions. Page 5 The tax exemption issue 22.The tax exemption allows credit unions to finance capital growth tax-free because income retained by credit unions is not subject to tax. At the end of the 1997-98 income year, credit unions held general reserves (which cannot be distributed to members for prudential reasons) $21.7 million, other reserves $5.7 million, and retained earnings of $10.2 million. (See appendix.) 23.Other businesses have to finance capital growth from after-tax profits. Hence, if they pay tax at company rates, they have to earn 50 percent more before tax in order to achieve the same outcome as credit unions. 24.The increase in the credit limit, it is argued, could allow credit unions to move beyond their niche market and enter new markets and compete more directly with mainstream financial institutions. That niche market is defined by the requirements that credit unions be member-owned co-operatives that provide savings and loan facilities to their members, along with other statutory constraints on their activities. 25.It is argued that the tax exemption, coupled with an opportunity to expand business as a result of the increased deposit limit, could create a competitive advantage, or increase any existing advantage that credit unions have over other financial service providers. Constraints imposed by the FSCU Act 26.The FSCU Act, in so far as it applies to credit unions, is very prescriptive. The requirements for credit unions include the following: • Each credit union must have a common bond of membership, such as locality, occupation or employer. The Registrar of Credit Unions has a very limited discretion to approve an admixture of qualifications. • Credit unions may borrow only for short terms and for restricted amounts from a registered bank in the form of an overdraft, or from another credit union, friendly society or association of credit unions. • They have no open market for the application of funds. They may make personal loans only to members. Application of surplus funds is limited to trustee investments. The maximum period of a loan is ten years (secured) and five years (unsecured). Loans to any member may not exceed 10 percent (secured) and 5 percent (unsecured) of the total value of assets of the credit union. • They must not hold land for investment purposes, and any interest in land from exercising a right under a security must be disposed of within six months. • They must retain a portion of their income for prudential reasons. Amounts retained for this purpose cannot be paid out to members. Page 6 27.One argument is that the potential for credit union growth is limited because of these factors. The opposing argument is that the geographical common bond requirement is artificial, and the increase in the deposit limit will create a significant competitive distortion. 28.Although credit union numbers have been decreasing since the 1980s, numbers of members have been increasing, as has the value of assets. This growth may have implications for the competitive neutrality of these organisations. The appendix outlines the growth of credit unions over the last 30 years and shows aggregate income and expenditure, and aggregate funds and assets of credit unions for the 1997-98 year. 29.Submissions are sought on whether or not credit unions’ tax exemption leads to a competitive advantage relative to other financial services providers. PART III: TAXATION ISSUES 30.In anticipation of the increase in the deposit limit for credit unions from $40,000 to $250,000, the Government asked the Treasury and Inland Revenue, in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Development, to report on the tax status of credit unions. In order to decide whether the current exemption is appropriate, the Government will need to consider the implications for removing it. This part of the paper describes the Government’s general direction in tax policy, and considers what an appropriate tax treatment for credit unions would be if the exemption were removed. 31.The Government’s revenue strategy was set out clearly in the June 2000 Budget speech: “The Government is committed to a broad-based tax system that raises revenue both fairly and efficiently. There is also a commitment to ensure that the business and wider community have certainty about the way in which tax issues will be managed. To this end the following revenue strategy has been adopted: To generate the Government’s revenue requirements at least possible economic cost, whilst supporting the Government’s equity objectives. This leads to the following tax policy priorities: • maintaining revenue flows • minimising the economic costs of the tax system • tax simplification • maintaining the integrity of the tax system by encouraging voluntary compliance and reducing avoidance, and • maintaining a direct tax system augmented by broadly based indirect taxes.” Page 7 32.It can be argued that it is inequitable for other non-profit bodies which make distributions to members to be subject to tax on income, while credit unions escape the tax net. Legal form of credit unions 33.The tax treatment of any taxpayer is generally determined by the legal form through which the business is conducted. Although credit unions have identical legal forms and functions, they are a diverse group that applies different practices in satisfying their individual functions. 34.There are two options for the tax treatment of credit unions. One is for them to remain unincorporated bodies, as they are at present. The other option would be to deem them to be companies – for tax purposes only. Under either option, the calculation of the credit union’s taxable income would be the same. Tax treatment of unincorporated bodies 35.If credit unions were to remain unincorporated bodies their taxable income would be taxed in the hands of the individual organisation. Interest and credit union dividends would generally be deductible to the credit union, and subject to resident withholding tax, the latter being the current tax treatment. A timing difference could occur if interest derived in one year is set aside to be paid out in a subsequent year. In the later year, interest paid by the credit union may exceed interest received, leading to a tax loss being incurred in that year. That loss would be available to set off against income derived in a future year so this would not amount to double taxation. A more flexible approach, however, could be taken if the deemed company option were adopted, because companies have the ability to use an imputation credit account. 36.Unincorporated bodies are generally taxed at individual tax rates. However, the Consultative Committee on the Tax Treatment of Life Insurance and Related Areas recommended that the tax rate applying to credit unions should be the company rate of 33 cents in the dollar. 37.Credit unions with taxable income of less than $38,000 would pay less tax under the individual tax rates than if the company tax rate applied. Those with income in excess of $60,000, however, would be subject to the highest marginal tax rate of 39 cents in the dollar on income above that figure if individual tax rates applied. Company tax model 38.Income tax is imposed on the taxable income of the company. Distributions of income are taxed in the shareholder’s hands as dividends. At present, credit union dividends are deemed to be interest for tax purposes and this is unlikely to change. Credit union dividends would therefore be deductible in calculating the credit union’s taxable income, and subject to resident withholding tax. Page 8 39.The definition of a “dividend” includes the use by a shareholder of any property of the company, including benefits from the low-interest loans to shareholders. These dividends are referred to as non-cash dividends. 40.Company tax paid can be imputed to dividends distributed to shareholders, ensuring that there is no double taxation. Non-cash dividends can be imputed in the same way as other dividends. If imputation credits are insufficient to cover the shareholders’ liability on the dividends, resident withholding tax is payable on the balance. 41.The company tax model provides a more flexible approach where a loss occurs because income of the credit union has been retained and is paid out in a subsequent year. Credit unions could be allowed to elect that some payments to members could be designated as dividends instead of interest. Amounts designated as dividends would not be deductible, thereby reducing any loss that would otherwise have occurred. Tax paid by the credit union in previous years could be used to attach imputation credits to those dividends, ensuring that no further tax was paid by the member. 42.This type of tax treatment is available to statutory producer boards – see sections ME 30 and 31 of the Income Tax Act 1994. 43.Shareholder continuity requirements apply for the purposes of carrying forward imputation credits and losses incurred by the company. Excessive compliance costs can be associated with monitoring these requirements, and special provisions apply for widely-owned companies and the like. If credit unions were deemed to be companies, continuity of imputation credits and losses would be protected. 44.Some distributions are excluded from the definition of a dividend, notably available subscribed capital (ASC). ASC is money contributed to a company by its shareholders. It can be paid to shareholders tax-free if shares are redeemed or repaid. Deposits in credit unions are described in the FSCU Act as shares, but the Income Tax Act 1994 recognises these amounts as loans, and treats dividends paid as interest. If credit unions were deemed to be companies, that treatment should not change. Deposits would not be treated as ASC, but withdrawals of amounts deposited would not be subject to tax. They would be treated, for tax purposes, in the same way as the repayment of a loan, that is, there would be no tax consequences. Any other capital contributed by members could qualify as ASC. 45.The company income tax rate is 33 cents in the dollar. Mutuality principle 46.The Report of the Consultative Committee on the Tax Treatment of Life Insurance and Related Areas recommended that credit unions should be subject to the tax treatment applying to co-operatives (mutual associations). They should have the option to account for all income as if it had been derived from dealings with members, thus avoiding the need for an imputation credit account. Page 9 47.The general principle of income tax law known as mutuality starts from the premise that persons cannot make a profit from trading with themselves. 48.Nevertheless, section HF 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which applies to co- operatives and other mutual organisations, overrides the mutuality principle in relation to member transactions “where any amounts derived .... would be gross income of the association if the transactions were not of a mutual character”. Such amounts derived are treated as gross income for tax purposes. 49.Section HF 1 also allows a deduction for rebates (distributions of profit) relating to member transactions. Any portion of a rebate that is attributable to non-member transactions is not allowed as a deduction. 50.This treatment is based on the recommendations of Taxation in New Zealand, Report of the Taxation Review Committee, published in 1967. The committee recommended that profits from non-member transactions as well as retained profits from member transactions should be taxed in the mutual association’s hands. The tax treatment of mutual associations is illustrated in figure 1. FIGURE 1: HOW MUTUAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE TAXED Member rebates attributable to non-member transactions (no deduction allowed to the mutual association) treated as dividends but can have imputation credits attached (provisio to s HF 1(5)) MUTUAL ASSOCIATION Deduction allowed for rebates which are attributable to member transactions (section HF 1(2) &(3)) Returns to members (referred to as rebates) Rebates for which there is no nexus to income not taxable in member's hands Member rebates attributable to member transactions (have been allowed as deductions to the mutual association) Rebates relating to transactions which are taken into account in determining the taxable income of the member taxable in the member's hands non-member transactions member transactions Page 10 51.As far as credit unions are concerned, loans to members result in the derivation of interest which would be gross income if the mutuality principle did not apply. Clearly, therefore, if the current exemption were withdrawn, this interest would be subject to tax under section HF 1. 52.Some credit unions deposit reserves with banks and derive interest from those deposits. These transactions would be categorised as non-member transactions and could invoke section HF 1 (2) and (3), which requires the apportionment of rebates between member and non-member transactions. 53.Because credit union interest and dividends are currently treated as interest and subject to tax in members’ hands, there is no need to apportion rebates paid by credit unions. It is proposed, therefore, to simplify section HF 1 as it would apply to credit unions, by allowing a deduction for all interest and credit union dividends paid. Transfers to general reserves 54.The Income Tax Act 1994 provides that expenditure or loss incurred in deriving gross income is an allowable deduction. 55.In previous submissions, credit unions have argued that a deduction should be allowed for amounts transferred to general reserves. They are required to maintain a general reserve for prudential reasons. The current minimum reserve asset ratio is 5 percent of total assets, although this is to increase to 10 percent shortly as a result of the withdrawal of an exemption under the Securities Act 1978. 56.The Income Tax Act 1994 contains no provision that would allow a deduction for these transfers because they are not an expenditure or loss. 57.New Zealand banks are subject to minimum capital requirements which, in some ways, are similar in nature to credit unions’ reserve asset ratios. New Zealand incorporated banks must at all times meet the following minimum requirements: • Capital of the banking group must not be less than 8 percent of the banking group’s risk weighted exposures. • Tier one capital of the banking group must not be less than 4 percent of the banking group’s risk weighted exposures. • Capital of the banking group must not be less than $NZ 15 million. 58.Capital can include shares as well as revenue and similar reserves. Where banks are required to retain reserves to satisfy the minimum capital requirements, no deductions are allowed for this for tax purposes. 59.Accordingly, it would be inequitable to allow credit unions to claim a deduction for transfers to the general reserve for tax purposes. Page 11 60.The main concern of credit unions in this area appears to be that amounts transferred to the general reserve cannot be distributed to members or reduced, even if total assets of the credit union are reduced. Upon the winding up of a credit union, the balance in the general reserve must be transferred to another credit union, or applied for charitable purposes. The Credit Unions Review: Discussion Paper, published by the Ministry of Commerce in September 1998, said that if an independent trustee model were adopted for credit unions, the existing controls under the FSCU Act on lending, borrowing, reserve requirements, and investing could be removed. 61.As the changes under the Securities Act constitute the adoption of an independent trustee, the rules relating to the general reserve in the FSCU would be reviewed if income of credit unions become subject to tax. Minimum threshold 62.There is a trade-off in the tax system between revenue and compliance costs. In some cases collecting the correct amount of tax can impose excessive compliance costs on taxpayers. In this situation, a minimum threshold may reduce compliance costs relative to small amounts of income, while the overall effect on tax collections is minimal. One example of a minimum threshold in the Income Tax Act is the deduction of $1,000 that applies to non-profit bodies who do not make distributions to members. 63.There are a number of disadvantages attached to a minimum threshold, however. These disadvantages are: • They can create a precedent for other small businesses to claim a tax exemption. • Pressure can be applied to the Government for increases in the level of the threshold. • They can create an incentive for credit unions to limit their activities in order to maintain the tax exemption. 64.Nevertheless, because there is concern about the effect of taxing the income of smaller credit unions, this paper invites submissions on the feasibility of establishing a minimum threshold. Over the years it has been suggested that this should apply to credit unions which: • have assets of less than a certain amount; • elect to maintain the deposit limit at the current level of $40,000; • have a common bond based on an industry group. Page 12 PART IV: ANCILLARY ISSUES Valuation of assets 65.The Association of Manchester Unity Credit Unions argues that, for tax purposes, assets should be valued at market value at the date taxation begins. 66.Under other reforms, when non-taxable entities have become subject to tax on income derived, assets have been valued according to market value. We can see no objection to this suggestion, although it may impose compliance costs on credit unions. Distributions from retained earnings 67.The Association of Manchester Unity Credit Unions argues that distributions from retained earnings should be tax-free. These distributions are treated as interest for tax purposes, and this tax treatment should continue. Distributions from general reserve 68.It has been submitted that distributions from the general reserve should not be subject to tax. Conceptually, these distributions are interest. 69.If tax were to be imposed on income derived by credit unions, however, there would need to be a review of the rules in the FSCU that relate to the general reserve. This issue would be considered as part of that review. Continuity of losses and imputation credits 70.In relation to the regulatory review, the New Zealand Association of Credit Unions submitted that credit unions should be included within the definition of “special corporate entity” for tax purposes. This would protect the continuity of tax losses and imputation credits. This issue would arise only if the option to deem credit unions to be companies were adopted (or if any credit unions incorporate as companies). 71.It is anticipated that legislation would be introduced to protect continuity for credit unions. However, it is unclear at this stage whether including credit unions within the definition of “special corporate entity” is the best way to do this. It will be necessary for further work to be undertaken in this area if credit unions are eventually deemed to be companies. Commencement date 72.The New Zealand Association of Credit Unions also noted that if tax is to be imposed, it should apply from a particular date, not from the beginning of an income year. It considers that this is the fairest option. The disadvantage of the income year basis is that credit unions with early balance dates may be taxed up to six months before their standard balance date counterparts and up to twelve months before credit unions using late balance dates. Page 13 73.This is an issue which will need to be explored with other credit unions, and submissions would be welcome on this point.

It also contains details of proposed legislative solutions. In line with the generic tax policy process, submissions are invited on these proposals. 2.The New Zealand tax system generally maintains a capital-revenue boundary: income from capital receipts is generally not taxed whereas other income is taxed. Boundaries in the tax system give scope for income that may lie on one side of the boundary to be legally recharacterised to lie on the other side of the boundary. 3.This boundary becomes problematic in the context of services-related payments. Payments that would generally be taxable in the same manner as wages and salary may easily be characterised as non-taxable capital payments. As such there is a risk to the personal services income tax base. 4.There are two components to the services-related payments problem. The identified problem areas are “restrictive covenant” and “exit inducement” payments. A restrictive covenant payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. An exit inducement payment is the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person to give up a particular status or position. 5.These payments are treated as capital receipts and are, therefore, non-taxable in the hands of recipients. The risk to the tax base results from the potential for these non- taxable capital receipts to be substituted for taxable personal services income. 1 Such arrangements have been increasing in recent years and are likely to continue to increase as a result of the new 39% income tax rate. There is an associated risk to the integrity of the tax system in that the payment of large, tax-free amounts to some individuals may give rise to the perception that the tax system is unfair, which would undermine voluntary compliance. 6.The revenue risk posed by these payments is reduced but not removed if the payments are not deductible to the payer. This is because the non-taxation/non- deductibility of the payments can still produce a more attractive result for both payers and recipients in some situations than if the payments were taxable and deductible. For instance, if the payer (typically a company) is on a 33% rate and the recipient is on the new 39% personal income tax rate, the payer sacrifices a deduction at the rate of 33% but the recipient escapes taxation at the rate of 39%. Also, if the payer is a tax-exempt entity or has tax losses, any deduction is of less value to these entities than to a tax- paying entity. For these reasons, making the payments non-deductible would not be sufficient to protect the tax base. 1 Personal services income includes payments made under both contracts of service (employment contracts) and contracts for services. It also includes payments made to office holders. References in this paper to “services” or “personal services” generally include employment, and being an independent contractor and office holder. Also, examples of employment situations in this paper generally include independent contracting and office holding. Page 2 7.The Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) reviewed the treatment of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments and recommended that the Government consider legislation to make them taxable. 8.This issues paper proposes making these types of services-related payment taxable. A number of associated amendments concerning deductibility and timing matters are also proposed. 9.It is proposed that amendments addressing the revenue risk posed by these services-related payments should be included in the next tax bill to be introduced in Parliament, with application from the date of enactment. Submissions 10.Submissions are invited on the proposals in this issues paper. In particular, the Government wishes to receive submissions that deal with issues such as: -The scope of the proposed provision for taxing restrictive covenant payments. -The proposal not to exclude restrictive covenant payments on the sale of a business. -The scope of the proposed provision for taxing exit inducement payments. -The proposal that special legislative provision be made to ensure that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments can be deducted. Submissions may be made in electronic form to: policy.webmaster@ird.govt.nz Alternatively, submissions can be addressed to: Services-related payments c/o General Manager Policy Advice Division Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON Submissions should contain a brief summary of their main points and recommendations. They should be made by 31 July 2000. Page 3 Restrictive covenant payments 11.A restrictive covenant payment is the consideration given for a restriction on a person’s ability to perform services. This part of the paper explains why this type of services-related payment represents a risk to the tax base, and proposes a legislative solution which involves making these payments taxable. Problem 12.The New Zealand courts have held that payments for restrictive covenants are non-taxable capital receipts. In the cases of Henwood 2 and Fraser 3 , the taxpayers each received payment for acting or advertising services in relation to a particular product and a payment for an agreement that restrained them from endorsing any other similar product during the contract term. The taxpayers treated the restrictive covenant payments as capital receipts and, therefore, as not taxable. In both cases the Court of Appeal upheld that treatment. 13.Payments under personal services contracts can be highly sensitive to tax considerations. Once a total fee for a contract has been agreed, the apportionment of receipts between taxable services and a non-taxable restrictive covenant can be quite flexible. There is currently no guideline on how to apportion the amount paid under a personal services contract to a restrictive covenant, and this can result in a high proportion of a total payment being characterised as a non-taxable capital receipt. For example, in the Henwood case, 88% of the total remuneration was referable to the restrictive covenant. 14.When there is flexibility regarding the apportionment of receipts between taxable and non-taxable elements of a personal services contract, taxpayers are well placed to maximise non-taxable restrictive covenant receipts and minimise their taxable personal services receipts. 15.Restrictive covenant payments occur frequently in the entertainment, sports and advertising industries. The concern is that the use of restrictive covenants will increase over a wide range of industries, thereby reducing the standard wage and salary tax base. This trend is already apparent at the high end of the remuneration range, and will be accelerated by the new 39% rate. 16.Restrictive covenant payments can be made more than once over the duration of a personal services contract (this cannot be done with exit inducement payments). This length of time over which restrictive covenant payments can be substituted for taxable income from services increases the associated revenue risk. 2 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Henwood (1995) 17 NZTC 12,271. 3 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser (1996) 17 NZTC 12,607. Page 4 17.The Court of Appeal held in Buckley & Young 4 that restrictive covenant payments are generally non-deductible capital payments. Therefore the actual revenue loss from this payment type should be limited to the extent to which the payer and the payee are on 33% and 39% income tax rates respectively and tax-loss or tax-exempt entities make the payments. 18.In summary, there is clearly an ability for non-taxable restrictive covenant payments to be substituted for taxable personal services income. A legislative solution is, therefore, desirable to address the revenue risk posed by these payments. Proposed solution 19.It is proposed to make restrictive covenant payments taxable under the Income Tax Act 1994. This follows the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) that the Government consider legislation to make restrictive covenant payments taxable. 20.The solution proposed in this paper is based on United Kingdom legislation 5 – which taxes restrictive covenant payments to employees and office holders – but has been modified to apply also to independent contractors. The proposed solution would provide that if a person gives an undertaking which has the effect of restricting the person’s ability to perform as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any payment to that person or any other person in respect of the undertaking is taxable to that person. 21.A possible form of legislation for making restrictive covenant payments taxable would be 6 : If a person gives an undertaking the tenor or effect of which is to restrict the ability of the person to perform as an employee, office holder or independent contractor, any payment or benefit to the person or any other person in respect of the undertaking is gross income of the person. 22.This solution is quite broad in that the contract to provide services and the restrictive covenant contract can be with different persons. It should cover any combination of payment and agreement between multiple entities by focusing on the restrictive covenant payment itself. 7 23.The solution does not, however, address the situation of an employee making a restrictive covenant agreement with a wholly-owned company, the shares in which the employee subsequently sells to his or her employer. The amount received by the employee for the sale of shares may be treated as a non-taxable capital receipt. This arrangement would be enough to break the link between the employment relationship and the restrictive covenant. A specific anti-avoidance rule would be required to ensure that a payment received under such an arrangement would be taxable. 4 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Buckley & Young (1978) 2 NZLR 485. 5 Section 313 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (UK). Under this provision payments made under restrictive covenant agreements relating to employees or office holders are treated as taxable emoluments from employment. This provides a model for legislative inclusion of these payments in taxable income in New Zealand. 6 This draft will be reviewed as submissions are received and after further consideration. 7 This would include, for example, the arrangement in the Fraser case, in which four entities were involved in the transaction. Page 5 24.This specific anti-avoidance rule would be a backstop to the primary provision making restrictive covenant payments taxable. It would clarify that payments in the circumstances described are to be taxed. The inclusion of a specific anti-avoidance rule would not preclude the application of the general anti-avoidance provision. 25.Restrictive covenant payments should be brought within the “source deduction payment” definition (the PAYE rules) to ensure withholding at source. Restrictive covenant payment on sale of a business 26.An issue arising from the proposal to tax restrictive covenant payments is whether a restrictive covenant payment associated with the sale of a business should be taxed. Restrictive covenants are commonly given to preserve the goodwill being transferred on the sale of the business. Payment for the restrictive covenant is sometimes incorporated in a single payment for goodwill. 27.It is proposed that the reform to tax restrictive covenant payments should not exclude restrictive covenant payments on the sale of a business. Submissions are welcome on this aspect of the proposed reform, especially on the implications for the tax treatment of goodwill payments and any compliance cost difficulties taxpayers would face in valuing restrictive covenants connected with the sale of a business. Exit inducement payments 28.An exit inducement payment is the consideration given by a prospective employer or contractor to a person to give up a particular status or position. This part explains why this type of services-related payment represents a risk to the tax base, and proposes a legislative solution which involves making these payments taxable. Problem 29.The New Zealand courts have held that exit inducement payments are non-taxable capital receipts. In Fraser, 8 the taxpayer received a payment to induce him to leave his former profession and to enter into the advertising contract. The taxpayer treated this exit inducement payment as a capital receipt and, therefore, non-taxable. The Court of Appeal upheld that treatment on the basis that the taxpayer had given up his career as a current affairs presenter to enter into the advertising contract. 8 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Fraser (1996) 17 NZTC 12,607. Page 6 30.A more recent court decision is Case U8. 9 That case held that “loss of status” does not require a significant change of profession, and thus lowers the hurdle that must be surmounted for a payment to be considered non-taxable. In Case U8, the taxpayer was paid an inducement to leave a large finance company and to take up an appointment with a smaller finance company. The taxpayer treated this inducement payment as a capital receipt and, therefore, as not taxable. The Taxation Review Authority upheld that treatment, deciding that the payment was not an advance payment for performing services for the new employer but rather was compensation for a change of status in leaving the security of a large corporation. 31.The exit inducement decisions in Fraser and Case U8 provide scope for substituting non-taxable capital receipts for taxable income from services. Exit inducement payments are starting to be regularly made, especially in the professional services area. It seems that these payments are being received by people as an incentive to change the firm for which they are working within the same occupational area. This incentive has increased with the new top personal income tax rate of 39%. 32.It is uncertain whether exit inducement payments are deductible to the payer. There is no New Zealand case law that holds that exit inducement payments are deductible or non-deductible. Inland Revenue has not issued any policy statements on the deductibility of these payments. 33.Two factors limit the use of exit inducement payments and, therefore, the potential revenue loss. First, exit inducement payments can only be made at the beginning of an employment relationship. Second, payers may also be reluctant to offer these payments because they are non-refundable if the recipient leaves early or does not begin the new employment. 34.The non-taxable nature of exit inducement payments, however, combined with uncertainty as to the deductibility of these payments, means that there is a risk to the tax base. And regardless of the deductibility of exit inducement payments, there is a revenue risk to the extent that the payer and recipient are on 33% and 39% income tax rates respectively and tax-loss or tax-exempt entities make the payments. They allow otherwise taxable income from services to be replaced with non-taxable receipts. A legislative solution is, therefore, desirable to address the revenue risk posed by these payments. Proposed solution 35.It is proposed that exit inducement payments be made taxable. This follows the recommendation of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance (1998) that the Government consider legislation to make exit inducement payments taxable. A specific charging provision could be inserted in the Income Tax Act 1994 to this end. The proposed provision would tax any compensation for loss of a vocation, position or status or any payment for leaving a position. 9 Case U8 (1999) 19 NZTC 9,068. Page 7 36.A possible form of legislation for making exit inducement payments taxable would be 10 : Any payment, compensation or benefit derived by a person in connection with a loss of a vocation, position or status or for leaving a position is gross income of that person. 37.The proposed solution would cover an exit inducement payment made to compensate the payee for leaving a contract of employment. The drafting is also broad enough to cover the situation where the position being vacated is not an employment one – for example, an independent contractor position or an office such as a board membership. The exit inducement cases of Vaughan-Neil 11 and Pritchard v Arundale 12 involved a barrister and a partner in a firm of chartered accountants respectively, both being a position where the payee was a non-employee. The Fraser and Case U8 cases involved taxpayers leaving employment situations. 38.The solution focuses on payments for vacating a position. This is consistent with the nature of an exit inducement payment as compensation for giving something up in the course of starting a new position. It is not necessary for the provision to apply to inducements to take up a position because these are generally taxable as monetary remuneration to an employee or business income to an independent contractor. 39.The proposed provision would need to address a case like Fraser, where the emphasis in the judgments was that the taxpayer was being compensated for the loss of his career as a television presenter, as well as the traditional type of exit inducement case which involves a loss of status. 13 The provision would also need to encompass situations such as that in Case U8, which represents an extension over previous exit inducement cases. That situation does not involve a distinct change of career or loss of social status, but only a change of employment or position within the same industry. It is necessary, therefore, to include within the proposed charging provision compensation for a simple loss of a particular contract of services or contract for services. 40.The charging provision would need to be sufficiently broad to cover in-kind consideration such as an exit inducement which involved the transfer of shares to the recipient, not just monetary payments. 14 41.Exit inducement payments should be included in the “source deduction payment” definition (the PAYE rules) to ensure withholding at source. Deductibility and timing issues 42.This part of the paper deals with deductibility and timing issues arising from making restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments taxable. A number of associated amendments are proposed. 10 This draft will be reviewed as submissions are received and after further consideration. 11 Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners (1979) STC 644. 12 Pritchard v Arundale (1971) 47 TC 680. 13 For example, Jarrold v Boustead (1964) 41 TC 701, Pritchard v Arundale and Vaughan-Neil v Inland Revenue Commissioners. 14 Pritchard v Arundale involved the transfer of shares to the taxpayer. Page 8 Deductibility of services-related payments 43.Restrictive covenant payments are generally non-deductible capital expenditure. If these payments become taxable they should also be able to be deducted by the payer over the term of the restrictive covenant. This will ensure consistency with the treatment of salary and wages and other payments for services. Because case law establishes that restrictive covenant payments are generally non-deductible, it will be necessary to make special legislative provision to ensure that these payments can be deducted. 44.There is no New Zealand case law that explicitly states whether exit inducement payments are or are not deductible to the payer. Moreover, Inland Revenue has not issued any public rulings or policy statements on the deductibility of these payments. However, if these payments become taxable, special legislative provision should be made to ensure deductibility. Again, such treatment would provide consistency with the treatment of salary and wages and other payments for services. 45.A special provision for the deductibility of restrictive covenant payments and exit inducement payments could follow the model of providing express relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure, which is used in other places in the income tax legislation, such as section DJ 13. This means that it will still be necessary for a payment to have the necessary connection with gross income as required by the general deductibility rule in section BD 2(1)(b)(i) and (ii). 46.A final issue is that an unqualified provision for deductibility of restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments would introduce an inconsistency with the treatment of wages and salary. This is because wages and salary are non-deductible capital expenditure to the extent that they relate to work of a capital nature undertaken by recipient employees, as in Christchurch Press Company Ltd 15 . If outright relief from the exclusion for capital expenditure were provided, restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments could never be characterised as capital expenditure, even when the work is of a capital nature. Employers could, therefore, prefer to make these payments instead of wage and salary payments if capital works are involved. 47.To prevent such different treatment, it is proposed that restrictive covenant and exit inducement payments be deductible in the same circumstances as salary and wages. Timing of income and expenditure 48.It is envisaged that the ordinary tax accounting principles and provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 will apply to determine the time at which services-related payments are included in gross income or allowed as a deduction. No special legislation should be needed. The particular tax accounting principles that apply will depend on the type of taxpayer. 15 Christchurch Press Company Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1993) 15 NZTC 10,206. Page 9 49.In the case of cash method taxpayers derivation of income is based on the actual receipt of income. So if a payment for a restrictive covenant with a three-year term is paid to an employee as a lump sum in year one, the entire amount is derived and, therefore, taxed in that year of receipt. 50.This treatment may result in some cash method taxpayers being shifted into a higher marginal tax bracket. This already occurs, however, when these taxpayers are paid lump-sum bonuses. Moreover, there is no cash flow problem because the tax liability only arises once the payment has been received. Accordingly, special provision should not be made to spread the payment. 51.A specific amendment will be necessary to allow a deduction to employees who have been taxed up-front on a lump-sum payment received for a restrictive covenant, if they have to repay a portion of the payment because they do not comply with the covenant for its full term. 16 52.In the case of a taxpayer carrying on a business, the accrual or earnings method applies to determine when an amount is derived. This method is based on the right to receive income (an entitlement to bill) rather than actual receipt. 17 An up-front restrictive covenant payment received by an independent contractor could be spread over the term of the covenant. 53.The ordinary statutory rules will apply to determine the timing of deductibility of these services-related payments. In particular, section EF 1 effectively requires a deduction for expenditure to be spread over the term to which the expenditure relates. 18 For example, in respect of an up-front $30,000 payment made under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term, the allowable deduction for each of the three years would be $10,000. 54.In the case of exit inducement payments, payment is likely to be deducted in full in the year of payment. That is because the statutory criteria in section EF 1 requiring expenditure to be spread over the contract term would not be applicable. 19 There is usually no enduring aspect to an exit inducement beyond the requirement that the payee start a service relationship. 16 A model for such a provision is section DJ 18, which allows a person who has been taxed on the proceeds of crime under section CD 6 a deduction for any restitution made. 17 Arthur Murray v Commissioner of Taxes (1965) 114 CIR 314. 18 Section BD 4 of the core provisions governs the timing of allowable deductions. Section BD 4(2) provides that if an allowable deduction is subject to a timing regime, the deduction must be allocated to an income year in accordance with that regime. “Timing regime” is defined in section OB 1 to include a regime for allocating allowable deductions to an income year other than the income year to which the allowable deduction would have been allocated in the absence of the regime. In the absence of a timing regime, the payments under a restrictive covenant agreement with a three-year term would be incurred in year one when the agreement is entered into and therefore would have been deductible in that year. However, the timing regime in section EF 1, relating to “accrual expenditure”, would require the expenditure on the restraint to be spread over its three-year term. “Accrual expenditure” is defined very broadly in section OB 1 to mean any expenditure that is allowed as a deduction other than expenditure covered by other specific timing regimes, such as the trading stock or accrual rules. Section EF 1(5)(d), applying to choses in action, would be used to determine the unexpired portion of any amount of accrual expenditure relating to restrictive covenants that would need to be added back into the recipient's income, by reference to the unexpired part of the period in relation to which the restraint is enforceable. This mechanism achieves the spread of income. 19 Once the payment is made there is generally no unexpired portion to be added back to income in future years in terms of section EF 1. Page 10 Legislative timetable and application date 55.It is proposed that amendments addressing the services-related payments problem should be included in the next tax bill to be introduced in Parliament, with application from the date of enactment.

discussion document on the GST review. It also contains other issues raised in submissions on the discussion document or identified by officials. In 1997 the then Government agreed that officials should undertake a post- implementation review of GST in accordance with the Generic Tax Policy Process. The Government discussion document GST: A Review was released in March 1999. The objectives of the GST review were to: • reduce compliance and administrative difficulties in the practical application of GST; • limit the scope for obtaining unintended GST advantages. The GST proposals are wide-ranging and include extensive base maintenance, compliance cost and remedial measures. This bill does not, however, address every single GST issue that may need to be addressed. The review of GST continues, and the Government’s tax policy work programme already contains further specific areas for review, particularly in the financial and imported services areas. Submissions on the GST proposals in the bill covered a wide range of issues. The main recommendations following submissions are as follows: • Input tax credits for changes in use of imported goods A significant number of submissions opposed the retrospective application of the proposed legislation to remove the ability of a taxpayer to claim a one-off input tax credit in relation to assets introduced into the GST base from overseas. Officials are not recommending any changes to the proposal because of the revenue risk involved and the aggressive nature of the arrangements. The proposed legislation contains a savings provision from the retrospective nature of the proposal. The savings provision requires that the taxpayer must have agreed with the Commissioner, in writing, to the claim. Some concerns have been expressed about the uncertainty of this requirement, and officials are therefore recommending clarification and are discussing the wording with submissioners. • Associated persons Some submissions expressed concern at the breadth of the proposed definition of “associated persons”. Officials consider that the general scope of the proposed definition is appropriate but are recommending some minor amendments to clarify the application of the definition. • Second-hand goods The bill proposes to limit the input tax credit for second-hand goods to the GST cost initially paid by the vendor in relation to sales of appreciating assets (such as land) by a non-registered person to a registered associate. 4 The proposal addresses a base maintenance issue involving associates entering into transactions primarily to claim an input tax credit where there is no output tax liability on the other side. The issue could be addressed in several ways but we consider the solution proposed is the simplest and best-targeted option. • Deferred settlements The proposed legislation addresses a revenue risk caused by the difference between the time at which GST is returned (if the vendor accounts for GST on a payments basis) and an input tax credit claimed. (If the purchaser is on the invoice basis this will be immediately.) The bill is drafted to exclude transactions when settlement is required within 93 days. Submissioners commented on whether there was a need for amendments to target deferred settlements and also noted that the 93-day grace period would not be sufficient for some business transactions. While officials are convinced that reform is required to prevent the growing number of deferral arrangements, it is acknowledged that the proposal could be narrowed in its focus and thereby ensure that genuine transactions are not caught. Officials therefore recommend that the time period in which a deferred settlement will not be subject to the proposed amendments be extended from 93 days to 365 days. • Last day of taxable period The proposed legislation limits the extent to which taxpayers are able to use an alternative day as the last day of their taxable period. The proposal was recommended as some taxpayers have been able to use the existing right to choose an alternative last day of taxable period to obtain sizeable tax timing advantages. Officials have met with representatives from the Corporate Taxpayer Group to discuss their submission on this proposal. From these discussions, and the written submissions, new issues have been raised concerning the ability of exporters to mitigate the cash flow disadvantages of GST. In officials’ view, these issues require further analysis, and we recommend that the relevant clauses be removed from the bill. Officials will report to the Government after further consideration of the cash flow impacts of GST on exporters. • One-off adjustments for changes from exempt to taxable use There is currently some doubt as to whether it is possible to make one-off, rather than periodic, adjustments for assets with a value in excess of $10,000. For revenue protection reasons, for assets shifting from non-taxable to taxable use the bill did not extend the ability to make on-off claims beyond a proposed threshold of $18,000. A submission has been made on behalf of Community Housing Limited that significant compliance costs would arise from this limitation where assets regularly undergo a 100 percent change in use. To address this concern, and at the same time reduce the revenue risk in providing one-off adjustments, officials recommend that taxpayers be required to apply to the Commissioner when claiming a one-off input tax credit in relation to 100 percent change in use from making exempt supplies to taxable supplies. The taxpayer will have to satisfy a number of criteria, including that one-off adjustments are also made for taxable 5 to non-taxable changes in use, before the Commissioner will approve such an adjustment. • General insurance Officials recommend that amendments affecting the treatment of interest included in subrogation payments be removed and the issue deferred for further consideration as part of the planned review of the GST treatment of financial services. This change has been agreed with the Insurance Council. To address other concerns expressed by the Insurance Council, officials recommend the following changes to the proposed legislation affecting the treatment of general insurance: -The clause that would impose a GST liability on an insured person in relation to an insurance payment to a third party (if registered for GST) should be amended to place the liability instead on the third party where the third party receives the payment. This change is recommended after the Insurance Council indicated that the existing proposal would impose significant compliance costs on the industry. -The inclusion of further amendments to clarify the treatment of subrogation payments and the availability of an input tax credit for such payments. • Definition of “input tax” Submissions were received that suggested that the proposed reform did not go far enough to resolve inconsistencies that existed between the application of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 and the Customs and Excise Act 1996. Officials recommend further legislative amendment should be made to make the reforms more effective. These reforms will make it easier for agents of non- resident principals (who are selling the non-resident’s goods in New Zealand) to claim an input tax credit for GST levied at the border. • Remedial and drafting matters Officials have made a number of other recommendations to clarify the proposals contained in the bill and make minor drafting changes. • Tax-free shopping Although not related to any of the matters contained in the bill, an extensive submission was received from Global Refund, with support from the Retail Merchants Association, concerning the introduction in New Zealand of GST refund scheme for tourists. Submissions note that such a scheme in New Zealand would compare favourably with the refund scheme recently introduced in Australia. Officials recommend that at this stage the submission be declined. Officials will report to the Government at a later date on the likely benefits and costs associated with tax-free shopping. 6 TAX-FREE SHOPPING Clause: N/A Submissions (4 – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc, 18 – Global Refund) A GST refund scheme on purchases by tourists should be introduced in New Zealand by January 2001 to promote retailing, tourism and exports, thus providing significant economic benefits. The introduction of an effective refund system in New Zealand would compare favourably with the refund scheme recently introduced in Australia. Such a scheme is preferable to any expansion of the current sealed bag system as it is administratively simpler, is easily accessible, would facilitate refunds being spent at the airport prior to departure, is consistent with similar systems operated offshore, would minimise concerns about fraud, and would apply to both domestically produced and imported merchandise. Global Refund seeks approval to work closely with government officials on the implementation of a refund scheme. Comment Under the current legislation goods supplied in New Zealand to a tourist may be zero- rated either if they are exported by the supplier (for example, delivered directly to their overseas address) or exported under the “sealed bag” system. The sealed bag system may either involve goods being sent from the retail store to an international terminal and collected by the tourist at the border, or goods purchased by the tourist being placed in a sealed bag which can only be opened when the tourist has left New Zealand. If a refund scheme were introduced in New Zealand along the lines of that advocated in submissions, tourists would purchase goods from a participating retailer for the GST inclusive price. The retailer would give the tourist a “tax-free shopping cheque” which documents the details of the purchase. On the tourist’s departure from New Zealand, the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs) would be able to verify the export by inspecting the goods documented in the tax-free shopping cheque. The tourist would then present the validated cheque at an airport refund counter for their cash refund, comprising the GST paid less the operator’s commission. The operator would recover the refund as a GST input tax credit from Inland Revenue. (For GST purposes the operator would be exporting the goods and therefore would be entitled to the input tax credit.) As well as making cash refunds, the operator would undertake marketing and reporting activities for various purposes such as increasing retail sales and minimising the risk of fraudulent exporting. 7 Since 1 July 2000 a similar scheme for GST refunds has been operating in Australia. However, the Australian Customs Services, rather than a private operator, administer the scheme. To collect a refund tourists must buy goods worth $300 or more from a single business no more than 30 days before departure. Tourists may purchase several lower-priced items from the one business, either at the one time or over several occasions within the 30-day period, provided the total purchases amount to $300 or more and only one tax invoice is issued for the goods purchased. The goods can be used in Australia before departure, although the refund applies only to goods which tourists take with them as hand luggage. All retailers who are registered for Australian GST purposes can participate in the scheme. No change has been made to Australia’s existing sealed bag or airport duty free shop sales. Officials understand that the Australian system will be reviewed in 12 months’ time. Officials note the comments made about the potential economic benefits of a GST refund scheme arising from increased retail sales and promotion of exports in comparison with the current sealed bag system, which retailers find costly to comply with. We consider that making any decision on the desirability of introducing a GST refund scheme for tourists will require detailed consultation with Customs and retailers, and that the following issues will need to be addressed: • Administrative costs: Customs consider that a tax-free shopping system in New Zealand may not be viable because of high administrative costs, regardless of whether or not Customs operated the system. Costs would be incurred in relation to export verification at all international airports and seaports. • Benefits to tourists: The progressive removal of tariffs and a GST rate of 12.5 percent in New Zealand (compared with 17.5 percent in the United Kingdom) mean that tourists would not receive a significant saving. High minimum purchase amounts and commission fees would also limit the benefits of a GST refund scheme to tourists. In addition, departing passengers might experience delays at refund counters and risk missing their flights. • Fraud: There is a risk that input tax credits may be paid in relation to false exports or goods that have been exported but are re-imported free of GST. International experience has also shown that some operators fail to refund monies due to their customers, yet claim input tax credits from the revenue authorities. • Tax revenue costs: Tax-free shopping would reduce the current tax base. The amount of revenue that is collected from tourism is approximately $473 million per annum. In addition to retail spending, this figure includes GST on supplies of services such as accommodation, domestic travel and entertainment. • Policy intent of taxing supplies to tourists: The current sealed bag system is consistent with a tax system based on whether or not consumers have access to the goods supplied. If tourists have access to goods they can theoretically be “consumed” in New Zealand and GST should apply. This is consistent with the taxation of services provided to tourists in New Zealand. Any change to allow GST refunds in relation to goods to which tourists have access in New Zealand would alter the current tax boundary. 8 • Impact on the criteria for zero-rating other supplies: The broad GST policy is to tax consumption in New Zealand (including consumption by tourists). However, temporary imports and certain goods held in New Zealand prior to export (such as bloodstock) are zero-rated. These policy considerations would need to be re-evaluated in the light of any proposal to zero-rate goods purchased by tourists under a GST refund scheme. Recommendation Officials recommend that a GST refund scheme not be considered for introduction in this bill, but that officials report to the Government again on the overall economic, revenue, and compliance and administrative implications of such a scheme. 9 DEDUCTIONS FOR GST IN CALCULATING TAX DUE ON GROSS INCOME Clause: N/A Submission (8 – Mr C G Duff) Allow the payment of GST to the Government as a deduction for income tax purposes. Comment Deductions from income tax are allowed where expenditure is incurred in producing taxable income. For example, a business may incur advertising expenditure in order to promote its products and generate sales. As there is a link between the advertising expenditure and income, it is appropriate that the business should be able to deduct the advertising expenditure from its income. This is in sharp contrast to the payment of GST to the Government. As GST is a tax that is charged on behalf of the Government by registered persons on the supply of their goods and services, it does not form part of business income nor can it be said to be a cost incurred in producing income. This is reflected in the Income Tax Act 1994 (section ED 4), which excludes GST charged on the supply of goods and services from the term “gross income”. The section goes on to provide that any GST paid by a registered person on their purchases is not allowed as a deduction for income tax purposes. Section ED 4 therefore keeps the income tax and GST systems separate. This approach is also consistent with standard accounting practices, as set out in Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 19. The standard is very clear that registered persons act as collectors of GST in respect of their taxable activities, and therefore the reportable income earned and expenditure incurred by a business is, in general, exclusive of GST. The method by which GST is collected further illustrates that paying GST is not an expense that is incurred in producing income. The GST that is remitted to the Government is the net difference between the GST charged in supplying goods and services less the GST that is paid on purchases. To this end, the collection and remittance of GST to the Government is, in general, outside the principles ordinarily associated with calculating the tax that is payable on income. For the reasons above, officials consider that under the ordinary principles that allow deductions for income tax, a deduction for the amount of GST remitted to the Government should not be allowed. Officials also note that if the amount of GST remitted to the Government were deducted from income tax, this would result in a significant revenue loss. In the period from May 1999 to June 2000 Inland Revenue received payments of GST amounting to approximately $5,900 million. If this submission were accepted, a revenue loss of approximately one-third of this amount would result. 10 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 11 THE SPECIFIC ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISIONS Clauses 69, 73(6), 82 and 84 Submission (20 – KPMG) The large number of amendments of an anti-avoidance nature should be tested and considered in the light of the scheme and purpose of the GST Act. In particular, consideration should be given to whether the changes proposed can be structured and targeted more clearly as anti-avoidance measures with more limited application and therefore a lower compliance cost. Comment The bill contains a number of important base maintenance measures which are designed to limit the scope for obtaining unintended GST advantages. The bill also contains a large number of compliance cost saving and remedial measures. The base maintenance measures include: • restricting the second-hand goods input tax credit in transactions between associated persons; • requiring GST to be paid in respect of assets held on deregistration on the basis of their market value; • removing avoidance opportunities in relation to deferred settlements; and • preventing GST refunds for goods imported and subject to a “change in use”. Maintaining the GST tax base is crucial to meeting the Government’s revenue requirements. The base maintenance measures in the bill have been subject to the generic tax policy process and, therefore, to extensive consultation. In particular, they were considered as part of the discussion document GST: A Review, which was published in March 1999. As a result of those consultations significant modifications have been made in some areas to narrow the scope of the measures. These measures are consistent with the scheme and purpose of the GST Act. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 12 DEFINITION OF “ASSOCIATED PERSONS” Clause 67 Issue: Implications of the definition Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) There should be a thorough review of the practical implications of the proposed new definition of “associated persons” before any changes are made to the current legislation. Comment The definition of “associated persons” is an important one in the GST Act because it is used in a number of specific anti-avoidance provisions. For example, it appears in the rule in section 10(3) countering the supply of goods and services to associated persons at an under-value to minimise output tax, and the proposed rule limiting input tax credits for sales of second-hand goods between associated persons. These anti- avoidance provisions recognise that transactions between related persons are more likely than in the case of transactions between other persons to be influenced by non- arm’s length considerations. The existing definition in the GST Act is deficient because it does not treat as associated certain categories of persons between whom there is a significant degree of connection, for example, a trustee and a settlor of a trust. Each of the tests in the new definition can be justified on the basis of it representing a sufficient degree of connection between the relevant persons. The two submissioners who opposed strengthening the definition did not identify any reason, in principle, why it should not be strengthened in the manner proposed. The universal tripartite test prevents the other tests of associated persons being circumvented by the interposition in arrangements of relatives, companies, and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. An example would be a situation involving a trustee, a company wholly-owned by the trust and a beneficiary under the trust. 13 This is illustrated in the diagram below: The trustee and the beneficiary are associated under the trustee-beneficiary test and the trustee is clearly associated with its wholly-owned company. There is a sufficient connection between the beneficiary of the trust and the company wholly-owned by the trust to justify treating these persons as associated. Also, the existing associated persons definition in the GST Act already contains a version of the tripartite test, the only difference being that one of the three persons needs to be a company. This requirement is removed under the universal tripartite test in the bill, as there is no reason, in principle, why the tripartite test should apply only in relation to companies – its general concept should apply universally. For example, consider the settlor, trustee and the beneficiary of a trust, all of whom are individuals. The settlor is associated with the trustee under the new settlor-trustee test and the trustee is associated with the beneficiary under the trustee-beneficiary test. Accordingly, because of their common relationship with the trustee, there is a sufficient connection between the beneficiary and the settlor of the trust to justify treating them as associated under the universal tripartite test. ICANZ submitted that it is not appropriate to base the GST definition of “associated persons” on the broader definition used in section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994 because the latter definition applies only for a small selection of transactions and taxpayers where there is a special risk of avoidance. However, since its original enactment in 1988 as part of the international tax reforms, the section OD 8(3) definition of associated persons has been incorporated into a number of Income Tax Act provisions which have general application, such as the entire depreciation regime and section HK 11 (liability for tax of company left with insufficient assets). It is therefore not correct to describe the section OD 8(3) definition as being relevant only in a narrow range of provisions. The section OD 8(3) definition was developed in 1988 after the enactment of the GST Act. If the section OD 8(3) definition had been available in 1986 it may well have been adopted at that time for the GST Act. Again, there is no reason, in principle, why the broader definition in section OD 8(3) should not be employed in the GST Act. Also, not all of the broader features of the section OD 8(3) definition have been adopted in the new GST definition of associated persons. In particular, the new GST Trustee Company Beneficiary 100% ownership 14 definition does not include the test associating two persons habitually acting in concert. This test was not included because of its uncertain application. It should be noted that the proposed definition is, in fact, narrower in some respects than the existing definition. First, the threshold for determining whether a company and any other person are associated is proposed in this bill to be raised from 10 percent to 25 percent. Second, the more narrow definition of “relatives” contained in paragraph (b) of the definition of “relative” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is used for the purposes of the test for associating relatives. Generally, this definition of relative extends to the second degree of relationship rather than the fourth degree used in the existing associated persons test. The connection between “relatives” outside the paragraph (b) definition (for example, extending to great nephews under the fourth degree of relationship) is not sufficiently strong to justify treating them as associated persons. In contrast, there is a sufficiently strong relationship between de facto spouses to justify treating them as associated persons. The KPMG submission refers to the difficulty that an independent contractor would face in knowing whether the recipients of its services were associated with each other, citing the example of different trading subsidiaries of a large group of companies. However, this submission seems to misconstrue the application of the operative provisions in the GST Act which utilise the definition of associated persons. This is because these provisions focus on whether the supplier and the recipient are associated, not whether the persons receiving supplies from a supplier are themselves associated. The example in the KPMG submission is meant to illustrate how the new GST definition of associated persons is cast too widely. However, the relevant parties in this example are already associated under the existing definition, and there would seem to be a sufficient connection between the parties to justify so treating them. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Iterative universal tripartite test Submission (12 – ICANZ) The tripartite test in proposed section 2A(1)(i) should not include a reference to itself, as this causes the test to operate iteratively. Comment Officials do not consider that the tripartite test in proposed section 2A(1)(i) operates in an iterative manner The test was intentionally drafted in the same manner as the tripartite test in section OD 8(3)(c), which, as the submission notes, was amended in 1991 to prevent it operating in an ad infinitum manner. To put the matter beyond 15 doubt, however, the reference to paragraph (i) in proposed section 2A(1)(i)(i) should be changed to paragraph (h). Recommendation That the reference to paragraph (i) in proposed section 2A(1)(i)(i) be changed to paragraph (h). Issue: Defacto relationships Submission (12 – ICANZ) The relationship of husband and wife included in the definition of associated persons should only be extended further to long-term de facto relationships (three years or longer). Comment The relatives test in the new definition of associated persons has been extended to include people in a relationship in the nature of marriage, that is, de facto spouses. The current non-application of the GST definition of associated persons to de facto spouses is somewhat anomalous given that there would typically be a much closer relationship between de facto spouses than there would between first cousins or great nephews (which come within the existing definition of relatives for the purposes of the definition of associated persons in the GST Act). De facto spouses are currently recognised for certain purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts, in particular, for calculating entitlement to family support tax credits and child support. The common statutory language used to describe a de facto relationship is a “relationship in the nature of marriage”. This language has been employed in the new GST definition of associated persons. Officials do not support restricting the de facto spouse test to relationships that have existed for three years or longer. A relationship is either a relationship in the nature of marriage or it is not. The other provisions of the Inland Revenue Acts which refer to de facto spouses are not restricted in this way. Various criteria can be used to determine in a particular case whether a relationship between a couple is such that they can be regarded as de facto spouses. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 16 Issue: Scope of the universal tripartite test Submission (Matter raised by officials) The test in proposed section 2A(1)(i) which treats two persons as associated if they have a common relationship to another person should be amended to prevent it having the effect of associating relatives within the fourth degree of relationship even though the relatives associated persons test itself only extends to the second degree of relationship. Comment The definition of associated persons in proposed section 2A contains a more narrow test for associating relatives than the existing associated persons definition in the GST Act. The new relatives test extends only to the second degree of relationship rather than the fourth degree as under the existing test. This narrowing of the relatives test recognises that the connection between relatives outside the second degree of relationship (for example, extending to great nephews under the fourth degree of relationship) is not sufficiently strong to justify treating them as associated persons. The test in proposed section 2A(1)(i) treats two persons as associated if they have a common relationship to another person. This test – referred to as the universal tripartite test – prevents the other associated persons tests being circumvented by the interposition in arrangements of relatives, companies and trusts which are under the influence or control of the main protagonists. However, the universal tripartite test could have the inadvertent effect of effectively extending the relatives test to include persons within the fourth degree of relationship. This was not intended. This extension can be prevented by providing that the universal tripartite test does not treat two individuals as associated if they are both associated with the same other person under the relatives test. Recommendation That an amendment be made to provide that the universal tripartite test in proposed section 2A(1)(i) does not associate two individuals if they are both associated with the same other person under the relatives test in proposed section 2A(1)(c). 17 FINANCIAL SERVICES Clause 68 Issue: Debt collection services Submissions (12 – ICANZ) The reference to a “creditor’s debt” should not be included. If that wording is retained a provision should be inserted to treat internalised debt collection activities carried out by businesses that are not principally providers of financial services as taxable. (2W – NZ Post) The amendment to treat third party debt collection services as taxable supplies should proceed. Comment It is accepted by submissioners that the provision of debt collection services should generally be treated as a taxable supply. The bill removes the existing exemption of debt collection services. The reference to a creditor’s debt is intended to retain the current scope of the exemption for debt collection carried out by banks and other providers of financial services in relation to financial services they have provided themselves. The provision of financial services (internalised debt collection services) is treated as an exempt supply regardless of whether or not the supplier is “principally” a provider of financial services – the definition of financial services and the exemption are activity based, not entity based. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Financial options Submission (12 – ICANZ) The term “financial option” should be defined. 18 Comment The bill includes a financial option in the definition of financial services, therefore exempting their supply. A term not defined in an enactment takes its ordinary meaning from the context in which it is used. A financial option is the right to buy or sell, at a specified price during a specified timeframe, specified financial assets, such as equity securities or currency. Officials consider that the ordinary meaning of the term “financial option” is sufficiently clear, and will be known, to those taxpayers who will be affected by this amendment, and therefore no definition is needed for this term. Officials also note that the purpose of this amendment is to give legislative foundation to the current treatment of financial options in practice by taxpayers and Inland Revenue. Officials further consider that it is desirable to retain flexibility in the meaning of the services listed as “financial services” in section 3 of the Act, and that defining a financial option would limit this flexibility. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deliverable and non-deliverable futures contracts Submission (12 – ICANZ) The terms “futures contract”, “deliverable futures contract”, “defined market” and “arm’s length” need to be defined or explained. Comment The bill includes within the definition of “financial services”, and therefore gives exempt treatment to, the supply of a non-deliverable futures contract and supply of futures contracts that provide for the delivery of financial commodities. A term not defined in an enactment takes its ordinary meaning from the context in which it is used. Officials consider that the ordinary meaning of the term “futures contract” is sufficiently clear, and will be known, to those taxpayers who will be affected by this amendment, and therefore no definition is needed for this term. As with ICANZ’s submission that “financial option” should be defined, officials consider that it is desirable to retain the current flexibility in the meaning of the term “futures contract” under the GST Act. Defining the term would limit this flexibility. 19 The Securities Amendment Act 1988 definition of “futures contract” is for the purposes of that Act, which regulates the raising of funds and is mainly directed towards the protection of the public. The purposes of the GST Act differ from those of the Securities Amendment Act 1988, and adopting definitions from that Act will unduly limit the scope of the GST Act. The term “defined market” is intended to refer to a discernible or distinct market. It is not intended to refer to an “authorised futures exchange” under the Securities Amendment Act 1988, or any other specifically defined market, as many futures contracts, notably those utilised in the electricity supply market, are not in fact provided over a futures exchange or “traded” in any sense. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Deliverable futures contracts for money Submission (Matter raised by officials) The provision or assignment of a futures contract that provides for the delivery of money should be treated as an exempt supply. Comment The bill ensures that supplies of futures contracts that provide for the delivery of non- financial commodities are treated as taxable supplies. This is achieved by exempting the provision or assignment of futures contracts that provide for the delivery of a commodity if the supply of that commodity is itself an exempt supply. The GST Act, however, deems money to be neither a good nor a service, and thus outside the scope of GST. Under the amendment the supply of a futures contract that provides for the delivery of money could, therefore, be subject to GST, contrary to the policy intent. Officials therefore recommend that clause 68(1) be amended by inserting a reference to a futures contract that provides for the delivery of money. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 20 DEFINITION OF “INPUT TAX” Clause 69 Issue: Reform does not go far enough Submissions (12 –ICANZ, 21W – Denham Martin & Associates) Denham Martin & Associates argue that the proposed amendment to the definition of “input tax” does not go far enough to resolve problems arising from the interaction between the Customs and Excise Act 1996 and the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The situation outlined in the submission involves the importation of goods that are not acquired or applied for a purpose of making taxable supplies. In these circumstances GST will be levied and paid by the person importing the goods. Where the goods are supplied subject to approval and are found to be faulty the goods will not be “acquired” or “applied” as required by the amendment. As a consequence, a credit for the GST paid at the border will not be allowed. The submission recommends either inserting the word “imported” into the definition of “input tax” or, alternatively, amending section 12 of the GST Act to align it with the definition of input tax. ICANZ supports the change to the definition of input tax to include the words “acquired” and “applied”, but also suggests that the wording should be changed to “imported”. Comment The bill allows importers acting as agents for principals outside New Zealand to claim input tax credits for GST paid on goods they import. Under the current legislation, if legal title to any goods does not pass to the importer, they may be denied an input tax credit even though they have paid GST on the importation of the goods. Both submissioners recommend that an input tax credit should be allowed to registered persons if they import goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The intention is to mirror in the definition of “input tax” the wording in section 12, which allows the New Zealand Customs Service (Customs), by reference to the Customs and Excise Act 1996, the power to levy GST on the importation of goods to New Zealand. Although this has merit in policy terms, the word “imported” has broad application. The Customs and Excise Act 1996 defines the term “importer” as a person by or for whom goods have been imported, including: • persons to whom the goods are consigned; or • persons that have ownership, possession or any beneficial interest in the goods on or at any time after their importation and the goods have left the control of Customs. 21 Using the word “imported” in the definition of “input tax” could allow an input tax credit where it is not appropriate to do so. Using the word “imported” could allow a final consumer to interpose an intermediary that is registered for GST in New Zealand to import the goods, claim a credit for any GST levied by Customs, and then pass the goods through to the final consumer. Example: A non-resident individual wishes to move to New Zealand. The individual would contract the services of a non-resident international moving company. The moving company would have arrangements with a New Zealand-based transport company to handle the goods once they reach New Zealand. The New Zealand transport company (acting as agent for the international moving company) could then claim a credit for the GST (if any) that is imposed on bringing the individual’s goods into New Zealand. Although the transport company has no proprietary interest in the goods, it may intrinsically form part of the taxable supply (transporting goods from A to B). Hence the import would arguably be for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies by the New Zealand transport company. Under these circumstances the handling of goods could be sufficient to entitle the transport company to claim an input tax credit for the GST levied by Customs on the imported goods. In officials’ view, it would be inappropriate for an input tax credit to be allowed in these circumstances. This is because the intention of GST to tax final consumption that occurs in New Zealand would be defeated. Using the word “imported” in the definition of “input tax” will also create the expectation that a credit for GST levied by Customs will be available in most instances. For the reasons described above, a credit is not always appropriate and a number of exclusions to the meaning of the word “imported” would be required in order to protect the integrity of the GST base. This would create confusion and add another test to those of “acquired” and “applied” (which appear elsewhere in the GST Act) to determine when a registered person is entitled to claim an input tax credit. Officials agree in principle with the proposal to amend section 12. Section 12(4)(c) permits a refund of GST imposed by Customs where there has been an error in calculating the tax. However, no refund is permitted if the registered person imported the goods for the purpose of carrying on their taxable activity. This prevents a taxpayer from claiming an input tax credit and claiming a refund from Customs (double dipping) if goods are faulty or tax has been levied in error. The exclusion could be disadvantageous to registered persons who import goods for the purpose of carrying on their taxable activity but (for example) because of faults in the goods never use them in their taxable activity. Officials recommend that the wording in section 12(4)(c) be amended so that the exclusion will only apply if the importer qualified for an input tax credit in relation to the imported goods. 22 Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by making an amendment to section 12(4)(c). Issue: Clarifying the application of the reform Submission (Matter raised by officials) The amendment in clause 69 is intended to allow a refund of GST levied at the border when goods were entered for home consumption but were not acquired by the importer. This can occur in situations where the registered person may import the goods and apply them (through a New Zealand branch) or hold them as agent for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The reform, however, falls short of its objectives in relation to the activities of some agents. Comment The principal issue is whether an input tax credit should be allowed in all instances where GST is levied on goods that have been imported for the purpose of making taxable supplies. In most instances a credit should be available. However, if the goods are imported by a person who is an agent (that is, the goods are imported as part of the person’s taxable activity, but not for the purpose of making taxable supplies) the position is less clear. In officials’ view, if the goods are not imported for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies an input tax credit should not be allowed. Under current legislation the availability of an input tax credit depends on whether the goods were acquired from the offshore supplier. Therefore: • If the importer does not take possession or ownership of the goods, an input tax credit will not be available. In principle, the credit should be available to the non-resident as the supplier of the goods. • If the importer takes possession or ownership of the goods a credit will be available to that person. The non-resident will not be entitled to the credit as that person is not the supplier of the goods. The problem with this framework is in the assumption that the non-resident will register for GST so as to claim the credit for GST levied at the border. In general, it is undesirable to make non-residents comply with the tax rules of another tax jurisdiction in which they have limited involvement. The GST Act has two sections that attempt to keep offshore non-residents out of New Zealand’s GST system. One of these sections concerns the use of New Zealand agents. The Act currently provides input tax relief when supplies are made to an agent acting on behalf of a non- resident principal. It does not provide for the situation where the agent makes supplies on behalf of the principal. 23 The problem with this is the assumption that the non-resident will register for GST so as to claim the input tax credit for GST levied at the border. Example: A non-resident art gallery decides to sell several pieces of artwork that have some significance to New Zealand. Knowing that the artwork will get a better price in New Zealand, the art gallery arranges through an agent, who is resident in New Zealand, to sell the pieces in New Zealand. The value of the art and the activities of the non-resident art gallery would suggest that it should register for GST in New Zealand as it is selling the work in New Zealand. The agent, who is registered for GST, imports the pieces of art and arranges for their sale. As the agent does not acquire any proprietary rights to the artwork, it will not be entitled to an input tax credit for any GST levied at the border. The only party that would be entitled to an input tax credit is the art gallery. If, however, the art gallery did not register for GST, the input tax credit for the tax paid at the border would be unavailable. Officials recommend the inclusion of another amendment that deals with supplies by resident agents made on behalf of a non-resident principal. The change will, in the case where a non-resident supplies goods in New Zealand through an agent, deem the supply to be made by the agent, provided the agent is registered for GST. The agent will then be responsible for charging GST and remitting it to the Government on the non-resident’s behalf. In return, the agent will have the benefit of being able to claim a credit for any GST charged at the border. A further technical amendment is also required as it is arguable that the word “applied” could (on a broad interpretation) go so far as to allow the handling of goods to be sufficient to entitle the handler an input tax credit for GST levied on the goods by Customs. It is possible that the New Zealand business could actively participate in the import by acting as a freight forwarder. Goods could be bulk consigned to the freight forwarder, who would then break the goods down into the customer orders. The problem with this is that goods can be forwarded to a final consumer without attracting GST. This issue is similar to the concerns raised above in relation to the previous submissions to use the word “imported” in the definition of input tax. Officials recommend that a technical amendment be made to limit the application of the word “applied” to instances where the importer will supply the imported goods rather than performing as its principal function the delivery of the goods or the facilitation of that delivery. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 24 THE SECOND-HAND GOODS INPUT TAX CREDIT Clause 69 Issue: Matching input tax credit claims and output tax paid on deregistration Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended to provide that an associated registered purchaser of goods from a deregistered supplier who acquired the goods before the introduction of GST is entitled to a second-hand goods input tax credit not exceeding the amount of output tax paid by the supplier on deregistration. Clause 69 should also be amended to provide the second-hand goods input tax credit to an associated registered purchaser of goods from a deregistered supplier, who acquired the goods after the introduction of GST, does not exceed the amount of output tax paid by the supplier on deregistration. Comment The bill provides that if a person deregisters and pays output tax on the basis of the market value of assets acquired after the introduction of GST, the second-hand goods input tax credit allowed to an associated registered purchaser of the assets will be the lesser of the tax fraction of the purchase price or the open market value of the supply. This provision should be amended to ensure that the amount of the input tax credit the purchaser is entitled to does not exceed the amount of output tax paid by the supplier on deregistration. This achieves symmetry between the output tax paid by the supplier and the input tax credit allowed to the purchaser. The bill should also be amended to provide symmetry in relation to the supply of an asset acquired by the supplier before the introduction of GST on which output tax had been paid on deregistration based on the cost of the asset. The amount of the input tax credit the associated registered purchaser is entitled to should not exceed the output tax paid by the supplier on deregistration. Whether, therefore, the asset was acquired by the deregistered person before or after the introduction of GST, the amount of the input tax credit an associated registered purchaser of an asset receives should not exceed the output tax paid by the supplier on deregistration. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 25 Issue: Whether the proposal should proceed Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19W – NZLS) The revenue concern is exaggerated and the solution suggested is fundamentally inequitable. Therefore the proposal to limit the second-hand goods input tax credit in relation to supplies between associated persons should not proceed. Comment An input tax credit is allowed to a registered person who acquires second-hand goods from a non-registered supplier, even though no GST is charged on that supply. This is intended to recognise the GST paid when the non-registered supplier acquired the goods. Allowing a credit avoids the double taxation that would arise on the resale of goods on which GST was charged when acquired by the non-registered supplier. For example, the following diagram illustrates a situation where an appreciating asset has been purchased by a private consumer who subsequently on-sells the good to a registered trader who also on-sells the good. The total private consumption is $1350. Ideally, net GST (output tax payable less input tax claimable) should be returned on this amount. If no offsetting input tax credit were allowed to the trader, the net GST returned would equal $190. Over-taxation of $40 therefore occurs. Allowing an input tax credit to the trader equal to the output tax paid by the first consumer (and returned by the registered seller) in effect provides a matching GST effect until the ultimate final consumption. If however the trader obtained an input tax credit in respect of the $900 (as currently allowed) rather than the $360, under-taxation of $60 would occur (i.e. the difference between 1/9 th of $900 and 1/9 th of $360). Non- registered consumer $360 $900$1350 Taxable supply. $40 ($360 x 1/9) output tax paid. No corresponding input tax credit. Non-taxable supply. No output tax. No input tax credits. Taxable supply $150 ($1350 x 1/9) output tax. No corresponding input tax credit as final consumption as occurred. Registered trader Final consumer Registered seller 26 The input tax credit for second-hand goods has resulted in registered purchasers claiming large GST refunds in relation to goods (particularly land) on which GST has not been paid by the seller (because, for example, the goods were acquired before the introduction of GST). Therefore the credits are windfall gains to the registered purchaser rather than refunds of tax previously paid. As a result, in some cases second-hand goods are sold to an associated person primarily to claim the input tax credit. The ability to claim an input tax credit on the purchase of second-hand goods which are retained for a substantial period of time before being resold also provides a substantial timing advantage in that no offsetting output tax is payable until subsequent sale. This tax advantage is addressed in the bill by limiting the second-hand goods input tax credit in relation to supplies between associated parties to the lesser of: • the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or • one-ninth of the purchase price; or • one-ninth of the open market value. (The current treatment is based on the lesser of purchase price or open market value.) This would treat the associated parties as, in effect, one entity and provide a similar treatment to that which applies if a person acquires an asset wholly for private purposes then subsequently uses it wholly as a business asset. Officials consider that the second-hand goods input tax credit should be limited as proposed in the bill for the following reasons: • The ability to receive large windfall gains is not restricted to transactions involving pre-GST assets. All non-taxable supplies of appreciating assets to associated persons will be affected, not just those relating to goods acquired before the introduction of GST. The introduction of this proposal will provide a clear cut-off point for arrangements involving second-hand goods input tax credits for land and other appreciating assets, providing certainty in the tax treatment for both taxpayers and the Government. The proposed change was first outlined in the March 1999 discussion document and has been subject to lengthy consultation under the generic tax policy process. • The proposal is consistent with the policy of taxing final consumers. The proposal clarifies that registered persons are entitled to input tax credits to ensure that only the final consumer of goods or services incurs the GST cost. Allowing input tax credits in relation to goods that have not previously been subject to GST merely subsidises the purchase price and creates an unintended GST advantage. Retaining the current scheme of allowing a credit on acquisition for GST actually paid is consistent with the treatment of supplies of new goods. • The treatment is the same as if the asset was applied for taxable purposes rather than sold. The proposed approach means that the GST treatment is the same as if the supplier, having acquired the goods for non-taxable purposes, had applied the goods in a taxable activity instead of selling them to an associated person. 27 In these circumstances an input tax credit for the change in use would be allowed under current section 21(5) based on the cost of the asset. • Commercial transactions would be unaffected. Transactions occurring with an associated person for good commercial reasons will still go ahead as the commercial benefits arise irrespective of any windfall input tax credit. • Compliance difficulties should not be widespread. Only transactions between associated parties involving high value appreciating assets are affected. Purchasers should be able to acquire the necessary information from the vendor if they do not already have the information themselves. The proposal is therefore simpler and better targeted than alternative options for reform. Officials note that to address the base maintenance issue inherent in allowing second- hand goods input tax credits Australia and the United Kingdom operate margin schemes. Under these schemes, a credit of tax is either deferred until the registered person sells the good, or GST is calculated on the difference between the purchase and sale price of the good. Canada does not allow any input tax credit for acquisitions of second-hand goods unless GST has actually been paid. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Alternative options for reform Submission (12 – ICANZ) The policy should be more clearly directed to genuinely attack the benefit derived in inappropriate circumstances. For example, deny a credit if the asset is a pre-GST asset. Comment ICANZ consider that one option to target the inappropriate payment of credits is to deny a credit only if the asset is a pre-GST asset. Officials note that the effect of the proposal in the bill would be to deny an input tax credit in these circumstances but consider that the proposal should also apply in relation to other supplies of second-hand goods between associated persons. This is because, as previously noted, the ability to receive large windfall gains is not restricted to transactions involving pre-GST assets. This approach will provide a consistent principle that in transactions involving associated persons an input tax credit should only be allowed for GST previously paid. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 28 Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19W –NZLS) The proposal creates an anomaly between supplies of second-hand goods to associated persons and supplies to non-associated persons. ICANZ submits that the change should apply to all supplies of second-hand goods between both associated and unassociated persons so that there is no unfair disadvantage in genuine commercial transactions. Comment Submissioners consider that the current proposal creates a distortion between supplies made by associated persons and supplies made by unassociated persons and is therefore inequitable. However, any extension of the proposal to supplies made by unassociated persons would be a tax cost to taxpayers, and significantly increase compliance costs, as its scope would be much greater than the proposal in the bill. A purchaser could face significant compliance costs in ascertaining the GST cost incurred by a non-associated vendor. An alternative approach would be to extend the proposal to non-associates but to deny an input tax credit if the GST component of the cost price, in circumstances where the cost was lower than the market or purchase price, was unable to be ascertained. This approach, however, would favour associates (who are in a better position to ascertain the amount of GST actually borne) and would therefore be inappropriately targeted. An alternative solution would be, as in Canada, to deny second-hand goods input tax credits. A change of this nature, however, would need to be consulted on widely and officials would not, therefore, recommend its inclusion in this bill. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 19W – NZLS) In the alternative, the credit should be deferred until the goods are on-sold. In relation to transfers of land between associated persons the credit should be delayed for 3 years if the value of the land is $300,000 or more. If the land is sold to a third party, before the end of three years, then the credit may be claimed at the time the land is sold. Comment Submissioners consider that the tax advantage could instead be addressed by deferring a second-hand goods input tax credit until a registered person sells the second-hand good. This option was included in the discussion document (described as a “margin 29 scheme”). The majority of submissioners on the discussion document did not, however, favour this option for compliance cost reasons. In particular, it was noted that compliance difficulties would arise in relation to record keeping and apportionment. Under a margin scheme, a purchaser is entitled to an input tax credit when the asset is sold. However, transactions can be manufactured to remove the effect of the deferral. For example, a registered person could transfer property to an associated registered person, thereby receiving an input tax credit immediately. Consequently, any effective margin scheme would require assets subject to the scheme to be “locked in” and, therefore, all subsequent purchasers would also be required to defer the credit until sale. This would affect a significantly greater number of registered persons than those affected by the proposed limitation in the bill. A margin scheme would also impose significant economic and compliance costs on those affected. In particular: • Timing disadvantages from lost interest (or returns) from the GST component of a purchase for the period between acquisition and sale. These costs can be significant, particularly if a good is expensive or held for a long time. • Increased bookkeeping and invoicing requirements. High-volume businesses with large and varying amounts of trading stock would incur significant costs in tracking the margin on all sales. • The obligation for unrelated (non-associated) purchasers to ascertain the status of a good and its GST treatment. As an input tax credit for previous tax paid would no longer be allowed on acquisition, this would itself create a distortion in the treatment between new and second-hand goods, particularly if the margin scheme were applied to all second-hand goods. In relation to transfers of land between associated persons, ICANZ considers that the credit should be delayed for 3 years if the value of the land is $300,000 or more. Officials consider that for certain assets (especially land) three years is a relatively short period of time for taxpayers to wait in order to claim a credit. This approach would not therefore address the current tax advantages. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Submission (19W – NZLS) The tax advantage should be addressed by applying the existing general anti- avoidance provision. 30 Comment Officials’ view is that specific anti-avoidance provisions are generally easier to interpret and apply than the general anti-avoidance provision. Their application is, therefore, more certain. For this reason they are usually preferable to reliance on the general provision (either as currently drafted or as proposed), which is primarily intended to perform a backstop role. The second-hand goods proposal seeks to remove the current weakness in the GST framework allowing large windfall gains to registered persons. This is unlikely to be achieved as effectively if the general anti- avoidance provision were relied upon instead. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Consistency with the taxation of value added Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 19W – NZLS, 20 – KPMG) The change moves from a true added value tax so that consumption in New Zealand will be overtaxed, with detrimental effects on the economy. Disallowing an input tax credit but requiring the purchaser to account in full for output tax on any subsequent disposal is not in accordance with the principles of the GST legislation, which is intended to tax effectively (in net terms) only the margin. Comment As discussed earlier, an input tax credit is allowed to a registered person who acquires second-hand goods from a non-registered supplier, even though no GST is charged on that supply. The amendment proposes to limit the second-hand goods input tax credit allowed in relation to supplies between associated persons to the lesser of: • the GST component (if any) of the original cost of the goods to the supplier; or • one-ninth of the purchase price; or • one-ninth of the open market value. The submissioners consider that this treatment is inconsistent with general GST principles in that it could give rise to tax on a greater amount than the value that is added by the registered person. A fundamental principle underpinning GST is that registered persons pay output tax on supplies made and obtain input tax credits for GST paid. If input tax credits are provided to registered persons where no GST has been paid, they are receiving a subsidy through the tax system. That result was not intended when GST was introduced. 31 The second-hand goods input tax credit was introduced for reasons of compliance cost savings and the desirability of recognising the GST cost originally borne by the non- registered vendor. As a consequence, it should only be allowed to the extent that GST is actually incurred by the non-registered vendor (in the bill this limitation applies only to associated persons for compliance cost reasons). It was not intended to provide a means of calculating the value added by the registered person. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Effect of the proposed changes to the definition of “associated persons” Submission (20 – KPMG) Because of the proposed changes to the definition of “associated persons” the proposal to limit the second-hand goods input tax credit is inappropriately broad. Comment Officials consider that the proposed scope of the associated persons definition, and therefore the application of the second-hand goods input tax proposal, is appropriate. The definition is used in certain provisions to recognise that transactions between related persons are more likely than transactions between other persons to be influenced by non-arm’s length considerations. As previously stated, the existing definition of associated persons in the GST Act is deficient because it does not treat as associated certain categories of persons between whom there is a significant degree of connection. Each of the tests in the new associated persons definition can be justified on the basis of it representing a sufficient degree of connection between the relevant persons. Also, not all of the broader features of the section on which the new provision is based (section OD 8(3) of the Income Tax Act 1994) have been adopted in the new GST associated persons definition. In addition it should be noted that the proposed associated persons definition is in fact narrower in some respects that the existing GST associated persons definition. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 32 TOKENS, STAMPS AND VOUCHERS Clauses 70(4) and 72(1) Issue: The need for proposed section 5(11H)(b) Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed section 5(11H)(b) is redundant and does not need to be enacted. Comment Officials consider that the proposed provision is not redundant because it replicates the effect of an existing provision for the purposes of the GST treatment of “exported” services such as education services provided in New Zealand to non-resident students. If such services are supplied in exchange for a token, stamp or voucher, the value of the supply will be recognised at the time the token, stamp or voucher is acquired, rather than at the time it is redeemed. Therefore if the supply cannot be zero-rated because it is reasonably foreseeable that the services will be performed in New Zealand, GST will be required to be returned at the time the voucher is sold. The GST treatment is, therefore, established when the voucher is sold on the basis of whether or not future services will be performed in New Zealand. If a standard rated supply of “exported” services could be recognised on the redemption of a voucher, difficulties might arise in valuing the supply if the consideration paid for the voucher differed from the value of the services at the later time of redemption. For example, the price of accommodation supplied in a hotel may change between the time a voucher for the accommodation is sold and the time a tourist arrives in the hotel. However, officials do consider that proposed section 5(11H) should be clarified further so that the option to recognise GST on redemption cannot apply in relation to the supply (rather than the redemption) of a postage stamp or “exported” services. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that a minor drafting change be made to clarify that the option to recognise GST on redemption cannot apply in relation to the supply (rather than the redemption) of a postage stamp or “exported” services. 33 Issue: Scope of the terms “token”, “stamp” and “voucher” Submission (12 – ICANZ) Terms used such as “token, stamp or voucher” should be broadened to include more modern trade forms such as electronic debit cards. Comment The Oxford dictionary definition of a voucher is “a document which can be exchanged for goods or services as a token of payment made or promised by the holder or another”. The submission considers that the term “voucher” is limited to the more traditional forms of vouchers such as vouchers physically exchanged for goods or services. The requirement to present the document ensures that it cannot be used to receive goods and services in excess of the consideration paid for the voucher. Electronic cards such as phone cards need not be returned to the supplier as they expire automatically. Therefore the ordinary meaning of a token or voucher should apply whether or not the document was returned to the supplier. The submission considers that a phone card is more equivalent to a concession pass used on public transport and would not, therefore, be considered to be a voucher. In officials’ view a concession pass for public transport is not a voucher but is verification that the holder is eligible for a reduced rate. A ticket allowing transport of a set amount or for a certain period (for example, a 10-trip ticket or monthly pass) would, however, be a voucher as it is a “token of payment” redeemable for certain goods and services. Officials consider that the ordinary meanings of the words “token, stamp and voucher” are sufficiently broad to include electronic cards such as phone cards. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Options to recognise GST to be mutually exclusive Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 13W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The proposed section 5(11G) should be redrafted to explicitly state that the option to treat the redemption of the token as the supply, and the treatment of the sale of the token as the supply, are mutually exclusive options. Section 5(11G) does not explicitly over-ride section 5(11E); therefore a supplier who elected to charge GST at 34 the time of redemption of a token would still also be required to charge GST when the token was sold. Comment A minor change to section 5(11G) should be made to clarify that the election to treat the redemption of the token as the supply, and the treatment of the sale of the token as the supply, are mutually exclusive options. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Issuer election of redemption option Submission (12 – ICANZ) Only the issuer of a token, stamp or voucher should be able to elect that the GST be payable on redemption. Comment The submission notes that it is unclear what would happen if a third party purchases a token, stamp or voucher and on-sells it to a customer. In this case the purchaser chooses to sell the voucher rather than redeem it. The intention is that the specific rules in the bill affect the issue of a token, stamp or voucher and the supply of goods and services provided in exchange for that token, stamp or voucher. Other supplies (sales) of the token, stamp or voucher between registered persons will not be affected as the face value of the token, stamp or voucher will remain unchanged, and any GST charged will be offset by an input tax credit. Officials agree that this treatment should be clarified in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 35 Issue: Certainty of GST treatment Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed section 5(11G) should require the supplier to identify on the face of the token, stamp or voucher whether there has been a supply for GST purposes to enable any person who receives the token, stamp or voucher to know whether GST has been accounted for. Comment Difficulties may arise if one person issues a voucher and another person provides goods or services on the redemption of the voucher. If GST were recognised by the first supplier there would be no GST implications when the voucher was redeemed. The second supplier might not, however, know that GST had already been accounted for. Officials consider that if the goods and services to be supplied on the redemption of a voucher are supplied by a person other than the issuer of the voucher, GST should be recognised on redemption only by agreement between the issuer of a voucher and the supplier of the goods and services. For example, a gift voucher may be issued by one bookshop to be redeemable at an affiliated bookshop. The GST treatment of the issue of vouchers should be established by agreement between the bookshops. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the bill be amended to clarify that the option to recognise GST on the redemption of a voucher applies by agreement between the issuer/s of a voucher and the supplier/s of the goods and services specified in the voucher. Issue: Clarification of clause 70(4) Submission (13W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The provisions in clause 70(4) should be redrafted to achieve the intended result and to clarify when input tax credits may be claimed in respect of supplies and redemptions of tokens, stamps and vouchers purchased for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies in the course of a taxable activity. Replacement draft legislation has been submitted. 36 In particular, the submission raises the following issues: • The provision treating the sale of a token as a supply of goods and services is not necessary as a token is within the ordinary definition of a service. It also notes that if the purchaser of the token is using it in the course of a taxable activity it should be entitled to claim an input tax credit. • The proposed legislation in subsections 5(11F) and (11G) should focus on the goods or services supplied on redemption, not the service of redemption. • It should be clarified that the treatment adopted by the supplier of a voucher has no effect on the recipient. Comment Although treating the sale of a token as a supply of goods and services is not strictly necessary, officials consider that it significantly aids comprehension. Not explicitly deeming a supply to occur on the sale of a token and then providing that a supply does not occur on redemption (as proposed by the submissioners) may create confusion as to what supply has been made for GST purposes. This will be further explained in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the legislation, once enacted. Officials consider that the current proposed legislation would allow the purchaser of a token to claim an input tax credit even though the token is acquired for the purpose of acquiring goods and services, and not for the immediate purpose of making taxable supplies. It is sufficient that the token is acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. For example, a voucher may be acquired as a promotional give- away and it is not necessary that the purchaser acquire the actual goods and services for which the voucher will be exchanged. As noted above, the bill should be clarified to provide that the specific GST treatment affects only the issue of a voucher redeemable for goods and services and the subsequent supply of those goods and services on the redemption of a voucher. Therefore how the supplier elects to treat the transaction under 5(11G) would not have any effect on the recipient. Recommendation Officials recommend that the submission be accepted in part and that the bill be clarified to provide that the specific GST treatment affects only the issue of a voucher redeemable for goods and services and the subsequent supply of those goods and services on the redemption of a voucher. 37 Issue: Clarification of the redemption option Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended to clarify that the option to recognise GST on the redemption of a voucher would apply only when it is not practical to recognise GST on acquisition. Comment The proposal in the bill will provide that the supply in relation to a token, stamp or voucher redeemable for goods and services will be recognised both for suppliers and recipients when the token, stamp or voucher is acquired. However, this rule may increase compliance costs in some instances and an exception to the proposed general rule will apply to vouchers with a face value so that the output tax is recognised on redemption at the supplier’s option. The rationale for the exception should be clarified in the bill by only allowing a supplier to recognise GST on the redemption of a voucher when it is not practical to recognise GST on acquisition. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 38 GENERAL INSURANCE Clauses 70(5) and 83(2) Issue: The proposal to clarify the scope of input tax and output tax in relation to payments under general insurance contracts Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposal to remove the words “indemnify” and “indemnity” in section 20(3)(d) and section 5(13) respectively should be introduced retrospectively, rather than with effect from the date of enactment. Comment The proposed changes are intended to clarify the scope for the claiming of input tax credits and the payment of output tax in relation to general insurance contracts. This is so as to remove any argument that contingency insurance policies (such as sickness and personal accident insurance policies) are excluded from the normal GST treatment of general insurance. The issue has been discussed with the Insurance Council of New Zealand, which has not made a submission that the change should be retrospective. Officials understand that this is because Inland Revenue has given a private binding ruling that contingency insurance policies are within the ambit of section 20(3)(d) and section 5(13). Thus the changes in the bill are seen as putting the matter beyond doubt rather than changing the law. Officials understand, based on information provided to us, that a retrospective change to section 20(3)(d) would not have a significant effect on the position taken by general insurers in relation to input tax in their GST returns. However, it is not certain that the same can be said about the implications of a retrospective change to section 5(13) and that such a change would not give rise to a retrospective GST liability for a registered recipient. As the types of insurance policies affected are likely to be those that involve non-registered recipients, these effects are possibly limited. However, in officials’ view even a small risk of a retrospective GST liability would outweigh the benefit (if any) of a retrospective change. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 39 Issue: Treatment of payments under general insurance policies Submission (Matter raised by officials) Clause 70 should be amended so that payments made to registered third parties are subject to output tax under section 5(13) in the hands of the third party, rather than in the hands of the insured person. Comment The commentary on the bill noted that under section 5(13), as currently drafted, there is an argument that, if under a contract of insurance an insurer makes a payment to a registered third party rather than to a registered insured, the insurer is entitled to an input tax credit but the third party does not incur a corresponding output tax liability. Clause 70 addresses this argument by providing that in the situation described the registered insured is liable to output tax. Officials have had discussions with the Insurance Council, which advised us that there would be significant compliance cost concerns for insurers if clause 70 proceeded in its current form. This is because if a third party suffers a loss at the hands of a person who is insured under a contract of insurance, the practice of insurers is to make payment under the contract to the third party directly. Clause 70 would require insurers to pay the GST portion of the payment to the insured. Officials therefore consider that the proposed section 5(13) in clause 70 should be amended to ensure that a registered third party who receives a payment under a contract of insurance, rather than the insured under that contract, is liable to output tax under section 5(13). Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 40 SUBROGATION PAYMENTS Clauses 70(5) and 73(9) Issue: The relationship between section 5(13) and 5(13B) Submission (12 – ICANZ) The drafting of section 5(13) should be clarified to exclude from the output tax liability subrogation payments received by insurers that are already subject to output tax by virtue of section 5(13B) relating specifically to subrogation payments. Comment There is a degree of overlap between the two provisions. Officials do not consider that it gives rise to any significant difficulty in interpretation. Nevertheless, the drafting clarification should be made if that aids interpretation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Excluding as subject to output tax the interest component of a payment under a contract of insurance Submission (12 – ICANZ) The interest component of a payment under an insurance contract should be excluded from the amount of output tax payable by virtue of section 5(13) by a registered recipient. Comment Officials consider that the submission raises an important wider issue of the extent to which the interest component of any transaction should be excluded from the GST net. Officials consider that this issue would be better dealt with in the Government’s planned review of the GST treatment of financial services. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 41 Issue: The inability to obtain input tax credits in relation to subrogation payments Submission (10W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Although subrogation payments are subject to output tax in the hands of the recipient under section 5(13B), there is no corresponding ability for the payer of the payment to obtain an input tax credit. An amendment should be made to section 20(3) to allow an input tax credit to the payer of a subrogation payment. Comment Before the introduction of section 5(13B) it was arguable that subrogation payments received by insurers in respect of payments that they made under contracts of insurance, and which qualified for input tax credits under section 20(3)(d), were not liable for output tax as they were not necessarily received under a contract of insurance. This did not achieve the correct policy outcome, which is that general insurers’ services are valued, and GST imposed, on the basis of cash received less cash disbursed (including by way of payments under policies). The specific problem for insurers that has been identified arises in the situation where A (insured A) suffers a loss at the hands of B (insured B). A’s insurer (insurer A) pays A the amount of the loss plus GST. The GST can be claimed by insurer A as an input tax credit and, assuming insured A is registered, will be paid as output tax by insured A. Insured B is required to make payment to insurer A equal to the payment made by insurer A to insured A. However, assuming insured B is a registered person, insured B does not appear to be entitled to an input tax credit for the payment. This means that when insured B makes a claim against its own insurer (insurer B) to recover its loss insurer B will have to gross up the payment to the amount paid by insured B plus GST. To use a numerical example, insured A incurs a loss of $100 because of the actions of insured B. Insurer A pays insured A $112.50 (net $100 for both parties after input and output tax). Insured B pays insurer A $112.50 (net $112.50 to insured B because there is no input tax credit entitlement, net $100 to insurer A after output tax). Insurer B pays insured B $126.56 ($112.50 plus GST in order to fully reimburse insured B). Insurer B must, therefore, pay an additional amount of $14.06 because of the inability of insured B to claim an input tax credit for its payment to insurer A. 42 To further illustrate the point: In summary, both insurers and other parties making subrogation payments are arguably disadvantaged under the current law. The Act should therefore be amended to allow registered persons making subrogation payments input tax credits for those payments. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Remedial amendment to section 5(13B) Submission (Matter raised by officials) The drafting of section 5(13B) appears to state that subrogation payments are deemed to be consideration for a supply of services by the insurer if an input tax credit has been allowed for the subrogation payment. The policy intent at the time the provision was enacted, however, was that subrogation payments should be deemed to be consideration for a supply of services by the insurer if an input tax credit has been allowed for the payment in respect of which the subrogation payment is made. Officials consider that section 5(13B) should be amended to address this issue. Insurer A Insured A Insurer B Insured B $112.50 (net $100 after output and input tax) $100 damage $126.56 ($112.50 plus GST) $112.50 (net $100 to Insurer A, net $112.50 to Insured B) 43 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application date of the amendment Submission (10W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) The submissioner’s proposed change to section 20(3) to remove the disadvantage to insurers should apply from 1 October 1986, in accordance with the 1996 amendment that introduced section 5(13B). Comment Officials consider that it is not appropriate for this amendment to apply from the date from which section 5(13B) originally applied (1 October 1986) as the revenue consequences of doing so are unknown. In any event, there is some uncertainty in the interpretation of section 5(13B) itself (see matter raised by officials above) which requires an amendment. The section will be amended with effect from the date of enactment of the bill, and the change to section 20(3) should, therefore, also apply from this date to give a certain, symmetrical treatment of subrogation payments. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The exclusion from output tax under proposed section 10(15C) of the interest component of a subrogation payment Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed section 10(15C) should be deleted from the bill. Comment The proposed 10(15C), which excludes the interest component of a subrogation payment from GST, was included in the bill following a submission from ICANZ on the discussion document, GST: A Review. Officials now have some concerns that the proposal is inconsistent with the mechanism for taxing general insurers, which is to require output tax to be paid on premiums and allows input tax credits for insurance payments. The possible inconsistency arises because this mechanism is based on cash flows rather than the 44 nature of the payments. In addition it is an open question whether interest should consistently be treated as exempt under the GST Act. Currently the exemption is largely confined to interest in relation to loans and similar instruments, and does not apply to interest generally. Irrespective of the arguments for including or excluding the interest component of a subrogation payment, officials consider that the issue is part of the wider one of the extent to which the interest component of any transaction should be excluded from the GST net. As with the similar issue raised by ICANZ in relation to the interest component of general insurance payments, officials consider that this issue would be better dealt with in the Government’s planned review of the GST treatment of financial services. Officials have consulted with the Insurance Council on this issue and the Council has agreed to this approach. Officials note that, in any event, if the proposed section 10(15C) were retained, it would be necessary to make further amendments to the bill to provide that the interest component relates to an exempt supply and to exclude the interest component from any input tax credit claim in respect of the subrogation payment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 45 TIME OF SUPPLY FOR RATES Clause 72(3) Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The GST Act deems a supply of goods and services by a local authority to occur where any amount of rates is payable to the local authority. The bill proposes that the time of the supply be the earlier of: • the date on which an instalment notice is issued if the instalment notice requires payment by a particular date; • the date on which payment is required by the instalment notice; • the date on which payment is received. The term “instalment notice” should be clearly defined so as to remove any ambiguity regarding its meaning. The term should be defined so as to prevent routine “notices of levy” triggering the time of supply. Comment The automatic entitlement of local authorities to use the payments basis of accounting is proposed to be removed from 1 July 2001. Any local authority that exceeds the payments basis threshold will, therefore, be required to account for GST under the invoice basis from that date. The bill also proposes to clarify the time of supply for rates payable to local authorities accounting for GST on the invoice basis. A GST liability will arise on the date an instalment notice is issued that requires payment of an instalment of rates by a particular date. This notice is akin to an invoice as it establishes an obligation to make a payment. In comparison, a “notice of levy” is notification of a resolution to strike a rate for a particular year. Although it advises the amount of rates payable in instalments and their due dates, it should not trigger a GST liability. The obligation to make a payment is established when a notice is issued for a particular instalment. A notice of levy may both notify as well as establish an obligation in relation to a particular instalment. For example, a notice issued at the beginning of a year could advise a ratepayer of their annual rates liability and set out the instalment payment pattern. That notice could also establish the obligation to make payment in relation to the first instalment. Officials agree that notices of levy should not trigger a supply for GST purposes in relation to annual rates, and recommend that a minor amendment be made to the bill to ensure that a GST liability arises in relation to each separate instalment payment, rather than the total amount of rates payable for the year. 46 Recommendation That the submission be accepted but dealt with by a minor drafting change rather than a definition of “instalment notice”. 47 UPLIFT TO MARKET VALUE RULES Clause 73(1) and (2) Submission (18 – NZLS) Section 10(3A) should be removed or a new paragraph be inserted in that provision providing that section 10(3) does not apply where the recipient “would have been entitled to a deduction under section 20(3) if the supplier had been a registered person and had complied with the requirements of this Act”. In both cases, the deemed consideration under section 10(3) needs to be consistent with the approach to input tax under the proposed section 3A. Comment The relevant part of section 10(3) treats a supply made at an under-value between associated persons as being made at market value. Section 10(3A), however, prevents this rule applying if the recipient is a registered person who acquired that supply for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and is entitled to an input tax deduction. The first option suggested by the submission involves the repeal of section 10(3A). This would result in all supplies between associated persons being valued for GST purposes at their market value. If transactions between registered persons were required to be transacted at market value any increase in output tax would be matched by an equivalent increase in input tax credits. Therefore requiring an uplift to market value would impose unnecessary compliance costs for no revenue gain. Sections 10(3) and 10(3A) are directed at supplies made to unregistered recipients at less than full value. Officials consider, therefore, that the option of repealing section 10(3A) should not be followed. The second option suggested by the submission involves inserting an additional paragraph in section 10(3A) providing that section 10(3) does not apply when the recipient would have been entitled to an input tax deduction if the supplier had been a registered person. A modified version of this option is appropriate to cater for two situations where a registered recipient who acquired the supply for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies is not entitled to an input tax deduction. The first is when a supply not consisting of second-hand goods (for example, services or livestock) is made by an unregistered supplier to a registered recipient – no output tax is charged on the supply, so no input tax credit is available to the recipient. The second situation is when the application of the new restriction on second-hand good input tax credits (proposed section 3A(3)(a)) means that the registered recipient is not entitled to an input tax deduction – it is necessary, therefore, to “switch off” this restriction for the purpose of section 10(3A). 48 Recommendation That the second part of the submission as modified above be accepted. 49 “CASH PRICE” Clause 73(4) Submission (12 – ICANZ) The amendment to deem the value of the supply to be the higher of the cash price or open market value should not proceed, as any price that is higher than the cash price would reflect a financing element which should be excluded from GST. Comment When a supply of goods or services is made under a credit contract, the value of that supply is deemed to be the “cash price” (under the Credit Contracts Act 1981) of the goods or services provided under the credit contract. The “cash price” is either the lowest price for which anyone could have purchased the goods or services from that vendor on the basis of payment in full when the contract was entered into, or, if there is no such price, the fair market value of the goods or services at the time the contract was made. The use of “cash price” in the GST Act was meant to determine the consideration given by the purchaser for the non-credit portion of the credit contract (for the goods or services). There are several problems with using the term “cash price” for GST purposes: • There is uncertainty as to the boundary with respect to determining the vendor – for example, whether it extends to any branch of that vendor in New Zealand, or, depending on the price, branches overseas. • The definition of “cash price” does not distinguish between classes of customers, such as retail and wholesale customers. • Theoretical lowest prices could be used. For example, managers of retail outlets may have a discretion to give a maximum discount of, say, 30 percent. Even though managers may never in practice give this level of discount, it is theoretically the “lowest price.” Therefore any price higher than the “cash price” will not, as ICANZ submits, necessarily reflect a financing element. It may instead reflect that an inappropriately low value has been given to the “cash price” of a good or service, owing to any one or more of the factors outlined above. However, officials do consider that the intended application of the provision should be clarified so that the value of goods and services supplied under a credit contract is equivalent to the consideration given by the purchaser for the non-credit portion of the credit contract (for the goods or services). 50 Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the clause be clarified by referring to the price that purchaser would have paid for those goods and services from the supplier who provided them if the purchaser had made payment in full at the time that credit contract was entered into. 51 DEREGISTRATION Clause 73(6) and (7) Submission (12 – ICANZ) If the amendment proceeds, there should be an “amnesty” period (for example, six months) after enactment to deregister to allow the increased threshold to apply. Registered persons under the proposed $40,000 compulsory registration threshold should be able to make the deregistration adjustment based on the lower of cost and open market value. Comment The proposed requirement on deregistration to pay output tax based on the market value of assets retained rather than as currently, the lower of cost or market value, was contained in the GST discussion document released in March last year, and has been subject to lengthy consultation under the generic tax policy process. Any change will take effect from the enactment of the bill. Taxpayers will, therefore, have had at least 18 months to plan for any change. A further amnesty period would not be appropriate. Officials do not consider that there should be any difference in the GST treatment of assets retained on deregistration by persons who voluntarily registered and those who were required to register. The anomaly in the GST treatment between assets retained and sold after deregistration and assets sold before deregistration applies in both instances and should be removed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 52 EXPORTED GOODS AND SERVICES Clause 74 Issue: Extending the zero-rating of exported information services Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposal to zero-rate certain exported information services should be extended to include the supply of information in relation to land. Comment The proposed amendment will zero-rate certain exported information services that are directly connected with moveable personal property situated inside New Zealand if the services are supplied to a non-resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. In many cases, the connection with moveable personal property situated in New Zealand is incidental, such as when pharmaceutical samples are supplied from offshore by a non-resident to a New Zealand tester. In these cases the services provided by the New Zealand tester can be reasonably regarded as being consumed offshore and, therefore, should not be subject to New Zealand GST. Officials do not consider that the amendment should be extended to exported information supplied in relation to land in New Zealand, such as the supply to a non- resident of a New Zealand architect’s plan for building in New Zealand. In the case of such services there is a sufficiently substantive New Zealand connection to regard the services as being consumed in New Zealand and, therefore, subject to New Zealand GST. Not zero-rating information services supplied in relation to land in New Zealand is consistent with the approach generally followed by other countries with a GST. For example, the European Union Sixth Directive on Value Added Tax specifically excludes services relating to land from the rule that the services of consultants involving the supply of information are taxable only in the country of the recipient of the information. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 Issue: The definition of “foreign-going ship” Submission (12 – ICANZ) The term “foreign-going ship” should be redefined to include both trade boats and pleasure craft when the goods have been supplied as stores for consumption outside New Zealand. Comment The term “foreign-going ship” is used in proposed section 11(1)(l) to zero-rate goods supplied for use as stores for consumption outside New Zealand on aircraft or ships going to destinations outside New Zealand. The term is defined as a ship, other than a pleasure craft (as defined in the Maritime Transport Act 1994) or a fishing ship (as defined in the Maritime Transport Act 1994), going to a destination outside New Zealand. The existing reference to “foreign-going ship” uses a definition in the now repealed Shipping and Seamen Act 1952. The new definition simply updates these references and does not change the effect of the existing law, which also excludes pleasure craft. Officials do not consider that the existing law should be changed to zero-rate stores supplied for the purpose of consumption outside New Zealand in relation to pleasure craft. Pleasure craft are excluded for enforcement reasons. Although it is reasonably certain that stores supplied to overseas–bound ships engaged in the scheduled commercial transport of goods or passengers will, in fact, be consumed outside New Zealand, the same does not apply in the case of pleasure craft. It would be difficult in practice to verify that stores supplied for the purpose of consumption outside New Zealand on a pleasure craft were in fact consumed outside New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Goods supplied “free alongside ship” or “ex-factory” Submission (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) Goods supplied “free alongside ship” or “ex-factory” should qualify for zero rating when they are entered for export, or deemed to have been entered for export, even if they are not exported by the supplier where it is clear the goods will be exported and the recipient is outside New Zealand at the time the goods are supplied. 54 Comment The submission suggests defining the term “exported by the supplier” for the purposes of section 11(1)(a) to (ad) to include sales of goods to a place outside New Zealand when the recipient is outside New Zealand at the time the goods are supplied. Proposed section 11(1)(a) to (e) simply re-enacts without change the existing law on the zero-rating of exported goods. Officials do not consider that this amendment should be made for several reasons. First, the requirement that goods be exported by the supplier was specifically inserted in existing section 11(1)(a) to (ad) to assist the enforcement of the zero rating provisions. The requirement is intended to ensure that the supplier takes sufficient measures to ensure that the goods will in fact be exported. Previously, the Act allowed the goods to be zero-rated when they were entered for export. The supplier would complete the Customs documentation. There was no requirement, however, for the supplier to ensure that the goods were actually exported. Significant practical difficulties existed in relation to the policing of these provisions because there was no efficient method to verify whether goods had been actually exported. Second, the provisions focus on the physical exportation out of New Zealand of the relevant goods, and not the recipient of the goods as suggested by the submission. This approach is consistent with the destination principle under which GST applies only to goods and services consumed in New Zealand. Third, referring to a recipient outside New Zealand is also problematic in the case of companies (both foreign and New Zealand) which have operations both in and outside New Zealand. If a non-resident company has a branch in New Zealand it is arguable that it is not outside New Zealand when goods are exported by the branch to its head office. Similarly, if goods are exported to an offshore branch of a New Zealand resident company the proposed requirement that the recipient be outside New Zealand may not be satisfied. In policy terms the goods in both cases should be zero-rated. These problems do not arise under the existing provisions, which simply focus on the physical exportation of the goods out of New Zealand. It should be noted that the supply of goods on “free alongside ship” contractual terms may satisfy the requirement that the supplier export the goods if the conditions of the contract make it clear that the goods will, in fact, be exported. This could be the case if the seller has ensured that the goods have been delivered alongside the vessel or aircraft departing New Zealand in the manner usual in that harbour or airport. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 55 ZERO-RATING OF GOING CONCERNS Clause 74 Issue: Time at which the status of a taxable activity as a going concern should be ascertained Submissions (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) The change is inconsistent with a transaction tax that seeks to impose taxation at the time a transaction takes place and creates an environment of further confusion. The going concern nomenclature suggests that the concept of going concern only exists at the time of transfer and not at the time of supply. A two-prong test raises a potential issue, with taxpayers accounting for a transaction as a going concern at the time of supply where at the time of transfer there is no supply of a going concern. The sale of a going concern should only be zero-rated at the time of supply if it is reasonably foreseeable that it would be operating as a going concern at the time of transfer. (12 – ICANZ) The timing of the test of a going concern should only be considered once, either at the time when the supply occurs, or when the actual transfer occurs – not both of these. If a requirement that the purchaser be able to continue the activity were included this would further restrict registered persons’ ability to zero-rate as going concerns. (19W – NZLS) Under the proposed amendment the going concern test will clearly apply at the time of supply. However, the test will also have to be met at the time the assets are transferred. (13W – Rudd Watts & Stone) For clarification, the words “by the recipient” should be added to the end of proposed section 11(1)(m)(ii). Comment The transfer of a going concern between registered persons is zero-rated for a number of reasons. These include the objectives of eliminating cash flow problems for purchasers starting up new businesses and of reducing the risk of a vendor charging GST on a transaction but failing to pay the GST to Inland Revenue. 56 A supply qualifies for zero-rating only if the vendor and purchaser agree in writing that the supply is of a going concern. This precludes the possibility of a vendor not paying output tax on the basis that the supply is of a going concern and a purchaser claiming an input tax credit on the basis that the supply is not of a going concern. The amendment seeks to clarify the time at which a going concern must exist to enable the parties to reach agreement. It provides that there must be a going concern at the “time of supply” (generally the earlier of invoice or payment). The amendment also, in effect, provides that the taxable activity must be capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a going concern at the time of transfer or settlement. Neither the Corporate Taxpayer Group nor ICANZ have provided any examples of when the proposed “two tier” test might be problematic. However, there may be situations where an agreement is entered into for the transfer of a going concern but it transpires that something less than a going concern is in fact transferred. In that case, if the parties have agreed at the time of supply that the transfer is of a going concern, the transaction will have been zero-rated. The fact that a going concern is not then transferred will require the parties to reverse this treatment. This may be problematic, for example, if the vendor is unable to collect the GST from the purchaser. Officials consider that any such potential issues can be removed by an amendment to the requirement in section 11 (1)(m)(ii) that there must be a going concern at the time of transfer. The amendment would be to the effect that the agreement between the parties must contemplate that the taxable activity be capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a going concern. This amendment would also incorporate the drafting suggestion made by Rudd Watts & Stone. Officials do not agree with the second point made by ICANZ. The example given by ICANZ is that of a person with no farming ability purchasing a farm with the intention of turning it into a resort. In that situation officials consider that the ability to zero-rate the transaction would still exist. That is because the test is an objective one based on the state of what is transferred. The farming business is still capable of being carried on by the purchaser as a going concern, notwithstanding the purchaser’s intention or particular skill base. In addition, the inherent nature of a going concern is that it is capable of being operated by the purchaser in a similar manner to its operation by the vendor. If this requirement were removed the whole concept of a going concern would need to be revisited. Officials do not consider that there would be any benefit in doing this. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted in part by requiring that the agreement between the parties contemplate that the taxable activity be capable of being carried on as a going concern rather than adopting the stricter requirement that the capability exist at the time of transfer or settlement. 57 RESIDENTIAL ACCOMMODATION Clause 76(3) and (5) Submission (12 – ICANZ) Clarify the ambit of the proposed exemption for the supply of residential property under a head lease to ensure it applies if a company leases accommodation for an employee as a condition of the employment contract with the employee. Comment The proposed section provides that the exemption will not apply if the property will be used by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. Officials consider that the exemption would still apply if an employee uses property supplied as part of their employment contract as their private residence. It would not, however, apply if a person uses the property mainly for business purposes. Recommendation That the submission be declined as the legislation already provides an exemption for residential accommodation provided by an employer to an employee. 58 PENALTY INTEREST Clause 76(5) Submissions (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The amendment should not proceed, as there is neither a supply of goods nor services when penalty interest is charged. (12 – ICANZ) The amendment should apply at the election of the supplier to lower any compliance costs arising from the need to apportion input tax credits. Comment The proposal to exempt all penalty or default interest will remove the current technical distinction perpetuated by provisions of the Credit Contracts Act 1981 between certain penalty interest charged under credit contracts (and interest generally) and other forms of penalty interest. Officials do not consider that it can be said that penalty interest does not relate to any supply when it is charged in relation to a contract for the supply of goods and services, or at least in relation to money outstanding under such a contract. Treating the charging of penalty interest as a supply will not “erode” the concept of supply or the base upon which GST is founded. In many other situations under the GST Act, such as the supply of general insurance services, the GST Act deems there to be a supply. This is not so much because there is no supply but rather because the supply cannot always be easily defined. Officials note that the threshold over which registered persons must make output tax adjustments for exempt use is proposed in this bill to be raised from the lesser of five percent of turnover or $48,000 per annum to the lesser of five percent of turnover or $90,000 per annum, and this should reduce any compliance cost concerns. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 59 LAST DAY OF TAXABLE PERIOD Clause 77(2) Issue: Greater flexibility in allowing taxpayers to choose the last day of their taxable period Submission (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) Registered persons should be given the option of adopting an alternative last day of taxable period beyond the current statutory limitation. Comment The last day of a registered person’s taxable period is generally the last calendar day of the month. To promote some flexibility in choosing an alternative day as the last day of a registered person’s taxable period the legislation allows a registered person to select as the last day of a taxable period a day seven days either side of the last calendar day in which the taxable period would normally end. The policy reasons for the concession were to reduce compliance costs by allowing taxpayers to align the end of their taxable period with their internal reporting date for accounting (subject to the Commissioner’s agreement). Some registered persons have used this measure to obtain sizeable timing advantages between groups of registered persons. Officials are concerned that widening the concession could allow more opportunities to create timing advantages. Officials are also concerned at the impacts the submission will have on compliance costs. The legislation only allows taxpayers to alter the day on which their taxable period ends. The date on which GST must be paid to the Government is not affected and remains the last working day of the month following the last day of their normal taxable period. If a taxpayer elects a day significantly into the following month this shortens the time available for that taxpayer to calculate their GST and furnish a return. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 60 Issue: Impact on previously agreed positions with Inland Revenue – “sound commercial reason” and “tax timing advantage” Submissions (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 12 – ICANZ) The amendment should not impact on previously agreed positions with Inland Revenue to counter timing disadvantages that were expected to arise with certain exporters. The phrase “sound commercial reason” should include situations where exporters attempt to mitigate these tax-timing difficulties. ICANZ broadly agrees with the proposal to allow the Commissioner the power to reverse an earlier decision that allows registered persons to change the last day of their taxable period. However, there should be tax avoidance and the absence of a sound commercial reason before the Commissioner can reverse the decision. Whether there is a “tax timing advantage” should be able to be assessed with respect to individual registered persons or GST registered groups but should not encompass registered persons that are outside a group. Comment The bill gives the Commissioner the right to reverse an earlier decision to allow registered persons to determine a day in substitution for the last day of their taxable period if they cannot provide sound commercial reasons, other than a tax timing advantage, for maintaining the change. Both submissioners note that in some instances registered persons have adopted an alternative last day of their taxable period and that this has been done in order to overcome tax timing disadvantages. The submissioners state that these changes have been made so as to prevent exporters from being disadvantaged by delays in refunding GST paid on their purchases. (Exporters will, in most instances, be in a refund position as most of their supplies are zero-rated, that is, they are taxed at the rate of zero percent.) Officials have since met with representatives from the Corporate Taxpayer Group to discuss their submission. From these discussions, and the written submissions, new issues have been raised concerning the ability of exporters to mitigate the cash flow disadvantages of GST. In officials’ view these issues require further analysis. Officials recommend that the proposed amendment contained in clause 77(2) be removed from the bill and the issue deferred for further consideration until after officials have reported to the Government on the overall economic, revenue, compliance and administrative implications in relation to the cash flow impacts GST has for exporters. 61 Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that the Committee agrees to remove clause 77(2). 62 THE SIX-MONTHLY RETURN FILING PERIOD Clause 78 Issue: Increase the threshold Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed amendment should not proceed and, instead, the threshold that determines a registered person’s eligibility to account for GST on a six-monthly return filing basis should be increased from $250,000 to $300,000. Comment The bill gives the Commissioner the discretion to allow a registered person to remain a six-monthly filer if the turnover of that person exceeds $250,000. This is provided that the registered person can demonstrate: • a good history of filing and paying tax; • good record keeping practices; • that they have previously accounted on a six-monthly filing basis; and • the nature and volume of supplies suggests that six-monthly filing is appropriate. The submission argues that the threshold should be adjusted for inflation rather than introducing a Commissioner discretion. The six-monthly return filing period is primarily directed at small businesses and businesses with a seasonal turnover. For the year ending June 1999 the proportion of persons accounting for GST on a six-monthly basis out of all registered persons was approximately 30 percent. The large majority of registered persons that made up that 30 percent had turnovers of less than $150,000 and on this basis it was considered that increasing the threshold to $300,000 is unlikely to provide any substantial benefits. This suggests that the policy objectives of allowing six-monthly filing are still being met. In some instances, however, the threshold may be too low, especially for businesses with seasonal fluctuations and those that have just reached the threshold. It is for this reason that it was proposed that the Commissioner be given the discretion to allow certain registered persons the ability to remain on a six-monthly filing basis. The reason a Commissioner discretion is preferred over increasing the threshold generally is that it allows access to six-monthly filing based on the particular circumstances of the business. 63 Officials are also concerned that raising the threshold could increase compliance costs on taxpayers that are not suited to cope with the cash flow demands that are created by six-monthly return filing. This is because of the effect that paying six months of collected GST has on working capital. There is also evidence to suggest that the preparation of a GST return can be more difficult over longer periods unless bookkeeping systems are completely up to date. Longer filing periods mean that a registered person’s recollection of past events may be less than complete. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 64 THE PAYMENTS BASIS OF ACCOUNTING FOR GST Clause 80(2) Issue: Access to accounting for GST on a payments basis Submission (12 – ICANZ) Businesses that exceed the threshold that allows them to account for GST on a payments basis should be allowed to remain on that basis provided that they file monthly returns. The main argument for the proposal is that small businesses are not sophisticated, and it is too hard for non-accountants to manage the inclusion of accounts receivable and accounts payable in their accounting systems. The invoice basis poses difficulties for practitioners in terms of reconciling the GST account when applying professional accounting standards to the client’s financial reports. Comment A basic GST principle is that a GST liability arises at the earlier of issue of an invoice or receipt of payment. Consistent with this principle, registered persons are generally required to account for GST on an invoice (or accruals) basis. As noted by the Court of Appeal, GST is a tax on supplies, not on receipts, 1 and is determined by the contractual relations between the supplier and the recipient. 2 The recognition of GST should also follow these principles. The payments basis (otherwise known as the cash basis) permits a registered person to recognise a GST liability on the supply of goods and services when payment is received from the customer. Similarly, a registered person accounting for GST on the payments basis is only allowed an input tax credit on its purchases when the registered person makes payment. The reason for the proposal to adjust the payment basis threshold was not to address concerns that accrual adjustments (as required under the invoice basis) are too difficult for many, but rather to reflect movements in purchasing power since 1990, when the threshold was last reviewed. The suggested increase to $1.3 million also includes an amount for expected inflation for the next five to ten years. 1 Commissioner of Inland Revenue v New Zealand Refining Company Limited (1997) 18 NZTC 13,187. 2 Wilson & Horton Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (1995) 17 NZTC 12,325. 65 The submission argues that allowing greater access to the payments basis will significantly reduce compliance costs. These compliance costs are often associated with the invoice basis of accounting because that method requires the complex task of making accrual adjustments for debtors and creditors – an area of accounting where there is ample scope for errors that could entail penalties. Officials do not agree with the submission for the following reasons: 1. If the recommendations put forward by the submissioners were accepted this would result in a fundamental shift in the time of supply rules (which are one of the key GST building blocks), if not in the nature of GST more generally. 2. Allowing more registered persons to use the payments basis would increase the amount of GST returned when cash was received for a supply of goods and services rather than when the goods and services were supplied. This could have a significant impact on revenue depending on the numbers of registered persons that elected either to remain on the payment basis (as they cross the threshold) or to switch from the invoice basis. 3. Allowing unrestricted access to the payments basis could also undermine specific anti-avoidance proposals, particularly in the areas of deferred settlements and debt factoring. This is unlikely to be ameliorated by monthly filing. 4. The present $1 million threshold allows 94 percent of all GST registered persons to account using a cash basis. The proposed increase to $1.3 million allows a further 6,000 registered persons access to the payments basis. This raises the availability of the payments basis to approximately 95 percent of registered persons. This suggests that the threshold is still meeting its policy objectives. 5. For registered persons that have a turnover that exceeds the proposed $1.3 million, the Act gives the Commissioner the discretion to direct a registered person to account for GST on a payments basis. In exercising the discretion the Commissioner must consider whether the nature, volume and value of the supplies made by the registered person and the nature of their accounting system suggests that it would be appropriate for that person to account for GST on the payments basis. Officials consider that where there is a genuine need for a registered person to use the payments basis (but cannot because of the threshold) the Commissioner discretion is the preferred means of allowing extended access to the payments basis as the exercise of the discretion is based on the individual circumstances of the case. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 66 DEFERRED SETTLEMENTS Clause 82 Issue: Whether the proposal is necessary Submissions (12 – ICANZ) The proposal is not necessary because the term “payment” is sufficiently broad to address the perceived mischief. The proposal to allow the Commissioner to aggregate two or more transactions with a low value if separate transactions have been entered into to avoid the $225,000 threshold makes a supposedly simple amendment more onerous and far-reaching. (19W – NZLS) The perceived mischief should be addressed through the application of section 76, the general anti-avoidance provision. Comment The proposal is necessary to address the often substantial discrepancy between the time at which GST is returned (if the vendor is on the payments basis this will not be until payment is received) and an input tax credit claimed (if the purchaser is on the invoice basis this will be immediately). Arrangements have been entered into between both associates and non-associates under which settlement is deferred for very long periods of up to 20-30 years. In some instances it appears that arrangements are entered into primarily to obtain the tax deferral advantage. ICANZ has referred to extracts from Inland Revenue’s Tax Information Bulletins and Technical Rulings manuals in support of a proposition that Inland Revenue adopts a wide definition of the term “payment”, accepting such methods of payment as accounting journal entries, acknowledgement of debt and mortgage back and cheque swaps. The implication to be taken from this is that the range of circumstances in which a person may pay GST on a payments (or cash) basis in any transaction is narrow. The extracts referred to, however, have, in officials’ view been taken out of context. The context in question is an attempt by Inland Revenue to provide guidance as to “whether satisfaction of the obligation to pay imposed by the agreement for sale and purchase has occurred”. 3 Clearly if the obligation to pay is not satisfied, payment has not occurred. Officials question, therefore, the conclusion that payment will generally have occurred in most of the transactions in question. 3 IRD Technical Rulings Manual, para 109.22.5.1. 67 Officials consider that the proposal to require deferred transactions over $225,000 to be accounted for on an invoice basis would be easily circumvented if taxpayers were able to split a transaction into two or more transactions to fall under the threshold. Although officials agree that it does add some complexity, the provision to allow the Commissioner to require such transactions to be aggregated is clearly necessary. In relation to the view expressed by the NZLS that Inland Revenue apply section 76, the general anti-avoidance provision, officials note that there is a preference in policy terms for specific anti-avoidance provisions because their application is more certain. Section 76 is primarily intended to perform a backstop role in relation to the specific anti-avoidance provisions. The continuing prevalence of settlements that are deferred to obtain a tax advantage and the associated revenue risk provide, in officials’ view, a clear need for a specific anti-avoidance rule. As outlined below, officials do, however, consider that the scope of the specific rule can be narrowed in a manner that ensures that the main target is transactions involving a significant deferral and hence a significant GST advantage. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: The 93-day exclusion period should be extended Submissions (19W – NZLS) The exemption for shorter term agreements (93 days) may not be sufficient as the settlement period for the sale of commercial (and some residential) buildings may be longer than that for entirely legitimate reasons. An alternative solution would be to amend the proposed section 19D so that it is more targeted to very long-term settlements where the abuse is. (12 – ICANZ) The proposed section 19D should be limited to supplies where payment is not required to be made until more than 365 days after the agreement is entered into. By changing the provision’s application to affect transactions of over one year only, genuine transactions are likely to be protected, while the period will be too short to attract GST avoidance schemes. 68 Comment Officials note the concern expressed by both submissioners that the 93-day exclusion period is too short for many genuine transactions. Officials also note that the arrangements that have necessitated the proposed section 19D involve deferral periods of more than one year. Officials therefore agree that by extending the 93-day period to one year most genuine transactions will fall outside the scope of proposed section 19D and most transactions entered into to gain a GST timing advantage will be caught. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Alternative solutions Submissions (19W – NZLS) The Commissioner should have a discretion to require any person to register on an invoice basis if the Commissioner considers that a transaction would have the effect of avoiding GST. (12 – ICANZ) If the arrangements in question give rise to a significant base maintenance risk, this could be addressed by allowing input tax to be claimed only by the invoice basis person to the extent that payment has been made. Comment In officials’ view, the suggestion that the Commissioner have a discretion to require registration on an invoice basis if there has been tax avoidance is inappropriate for dealing with the specific issue sought to be addressed by the proposed section 19D. In particular, to address particular deferred settlement arrangements, the Commissioner would need the further discretion to place the taxpayer in question on an invoice basis retrospectively. This would create an unacceptable level of uncertainty in the operation of the GST legislation. Another problem with the suggestion is that it would require taxpayers previously on the payments basis to account for all future supplies on an invoice basis. This could give rise to compliance difficulties for taxpayers with less sophisticated accounting systems. In contrast, the proposed section 19D will affect only supplies with a value of more than $225,000 GST inclusive. 69 Officials do not agree with the submission by ICANZ that it would be better to defer the input tax credit to the invoice basis purchaser until payment. This is because there will be a considerable number of taxpayers on an invoice basis who routinely enter into transactions above the $225,000 threshold. Changing the timing of input tax credits in relation to a specific type of arrangement for these taxpayers will involve mismatches in the treatment of input and output tax and compliance costs which could be greater than those borne by vendors affected by the existing proposal (as modified). Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Whether, if the proposed section 19D is to be enacted, there should be some amendment to the timing of deduction of input tax credits associated with the transaction Submission (19W – NZLS) If proposed section 19D is to be enacted, there should be some amendment to the input tax rules to allow the GST component of supplies associated with the invoice basis supply also to be deducted on an invoice basis. Comment Although there is some potential merit in the submission, it is unclear what would constitute a “supply associated with the invoice basis supply” and hence what supplies would qualify for the suggested accelerated input tax credit. In addition, the extent to which associated inputs would involve a significant delay between the time of invoice and payment is unknown. Officials do not, therefore, agree that the type of provision submitted for would be appropriate. In any event, if the Committee agrees that the exclusion period under the proposed section 19D should be extended to one year, significantly fewer transactions would be affected by any potential mismatch between the timing of the payment of output tax and the timing of input tax credits for “associated” supplies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 70 Issue: The proposal to allow the Commissioner to aggregate transactions with a low value Submission (19W – NZLS) The current drafting of subsection 3(a) of the proposed section 19D is ambiguous and should be clarified. Comment In officials’ view proposed subsection 3(a) is drafted clearly and there is no ambiguity requiring clarification. The NZLS now agrees with this view. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification as to whether the “$200,000” threshold is exclusive of GST Submission (12 – ICANZ) Clarification is needed that the value of “$200,000” referred to is exclusive of GST. If the value were to be inclusive of GST, this could cause a push towards the zero- rating of property transactions as a going concern to fall below the threshold. Comment The threshold proposed in the bill is $225,000, and this is inclusive of GST. There is no reference in the bill to a $200,000 threshold, although this was suggested as the (GST exclusive) threshold in the March 1999 discussion document. In our view no clarification is needed, therefore. Officials do not consider that any problems arise from a potential push to the zero- rating of property transactions as going concerns. Under the provisions relating to going concerns (as clarified in this bill) there is clear guidance as to the circumstances in which zero rating will or will not be available. Officials do not consider that these circumstances will alter depending on the level of the threshold under proposed section 19D. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 71 INPUT TAX CREDITS FOR GOODS IMPORTED AND SUBJECT TO A “CHANGE IN USE” Clause 84 Issue: The retrospective application of the proposal from 1 October 1986 other than where the Commissioner has agreed in writing to a claim before 16 May 2000 Submissions (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG, 16 – Bradbury and Muir on behalf of its client SeaHunter Fishing Limited) Taxpayers who have taken positions based on the legislation as it is written at the time must be entitled to have those positions tested against that legislation. There is a general understanding with successive governments that if a claim has been made before the announcement of remedial legislation or the introduction of the amending bill, the claim can continue to be considered under the existing rules through savings clauses. To do otherwise imposes commercial constraints on the investment of money and resources and introduces an element of uncertainty into the tax system. Proposed sections 21D and 21E(1) should only apply from the date of assent, or, at the earliest, from the introduction of the legislation: not from 1 October 1986. In addition, at a minimum, the limitation on claims approved by Inland Revenue in writing prior to 16 May 2000 should be changed to claims or tax positions submitted to Inland Revenue by that date. (12 – ICANZ) This degree of retrospectivity encourages Inland Revenue to drag out its review process of refund claims that it disagrees with from a policy perspective until it introduces legislation to change the rules. The comparatively small amount of revenue at stake compared to issues that have preceded this and the length of time this issue has been around are further reasons for not introducing this legislation retrospectively. In addition, officials may not have addressed the associated Bill of Rights issue following the problems with the forgiveness of debt last year. (16 – Bradbury and Muir on behalf of its client SeaHunter Fishing Limited) Clause 84 will introduce retrospective legislation depriving taxpayers of rights which they currently enjoy and are legislatively guaranteed by the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, and is therefore unconstitutional. In SeaHunter Fishing Limited’s case a claim for a refund was lodged in the period ending 31 May 1997 and has not yet been paid or agreed to. 72 (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) The retrospectivity is excessive in relation to the perceived abuses. Comment The input tax credits in question arise as a result of a loophole in the current section 21(5) of the GST Act that allows an input tax credit when an asset that is not used in making taxable supplies starts to be used in making taxable supplies. Section 21(5) is intended to allow an input tax credit only where GST has been imposed, that is, on goods and services acquired after 1 October 1986. Limiting the subsection in this manner was a deliberate policy decision at the time GST was introduced. The subsection recognises that where GST has been paid and not deducted, an input tax credit should be available where the asset is applied in a registered purchaser’s taxable activity. It would not be logical or equitable to allow an input tax credit where no GST had been charged. A simple outline of the typical tax structure at which the proposal is aimed is as follows: • A non-resident registers for GST purposes and imports a large asset (for example, a boat) for a short period. • The asset is classified by New Zealand Customs Service as a temporary import and thus does not attract GST at the border. • The asset is leased to a New Zealand company, the leasing activity constituting a “taxable activity” for GST purposes. • On the basis that the asset was previously outside New Zealand, thus not used in making taxable supplies, but starts to be used, albeit temporarily, in making taxable supplies, the non-resident claims an input tax credit for the lesser of one- ninth of the cost of the asset or the open market value of the supply of the asset. Against the policy background outlined above, officials consider that such structures are at the aggressive end of the scale and, without the change, pose a significant, albeit difficult to quantify, revenue risk. The proposal was first raised by the previous Government in the discussion document GST: A Review, released in March 1999. As submissioners have noted, it was not suggested in the discussion document that the change would be retrospective. At that stage officials were aware of some activity involving use of the structures in question but this was not thought to pose a significant revenue risk. In March 2000, however, officials became aware that there was a growing proliferation of such structures. Two structures that officials were aware of together involved GST refund claims of about $10 million. It was also apparent that such structures were being actively marketed. The new Government, therefore, decided to accelerate the application date for the change. 73 The GST legislation currently imposes no time limitation within which taxpayers must claim input tax credits. Without making the change retrospective to 1 October 1986, there was thus a clear risk that the growing profile of such structures would cause an unquantifiable level of input tax credit claims in respect of past periods. It is for these reasons that the Government has decided that the level of retrospectivity in this case is justified. In relation to the point raised by ICANZ that retrospectivity of this kind might encourage Inland Revenue to “drag out” its review process, officials are not aware of any instance of Inland Revenue deliberately delaying the process to stall a GST refund until the introduction of the legislation. Lastly, officials note that before the bill was referred to Cabinet, advice was received from the Ministry of Justice that there was no breach of the Bill of Rights in relation to this issue. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Application of shortfall penalties Submission (20 – KPMG) Should the legislation be passed in its current form, an amendment to the current section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be made to expressly exclude taxpayers from liability for shortfall penalties. Comment Officials consider that, should the legislation be passed in its current form, the suggested change to section 141B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 would be unnecessary for two reasons: • Making the proposed change to section 21(5) would itself be an acknowledgement that the taxpayer’s interpretation was at least arguable and on this basis that interpretation is unlikely to be regarded as “unacceptable” for the purposes of the shortfall penalty. • Section 141B(6) provides that the interpretation to be considered is the position taken by the taxpayer in the relevant tax return. • Section 141B(7) states that the matters that must be considered in determining whether there is an unacceptable interpretation include the actual or potential application of all the tax laws that are relevant. This would include the law at the time the taxpayer adopted the position in question as well as a later retrospective change. 74 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: General provision to preserve taxpayers’ rights whenever there is retrospective tax legislation Submission (20 – KPMG) A provision should be inserted into the Tax Administration Act to preserve taxpayers’ tax positions when legislation of a retrospective nature is introduced. The rule would also require the Government of the day to publicly announce any change in the law that is to be retrospective as soon as possible after the Government has taken the decision to change the law. Comment As the submissioners note, taxpayers are afforded some protection by processes that include consideration of Bill of Rights issues and by the ability of select committees to ensure that retrospective legislation is carefully considered in each case. However, as noted in Phillips v Eyre, 4 for every guiding principle that retrospective legislation is of questionable policy, there are exceptions based on whether justice would otherwise be served. The suggested provision would remove the ability for appropriate exceptions to be made, as in this case. It is also important to note that a fundamental constitutional principle is the legislative supremacy of Parliament, an example of which is that Parliament may not bind its successors, and no Parliament is bound by Acts of its predecessors. The suggested provision would be inconsistent with this principle. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 4 (1870) LR 6 QB 1. 75 Issue: Whether the proposal in any event produces the right policy outcome Submission (16 – Bradbury and Muir on behalf of its client SeaHunter Fishing Limited) The better policy alternative would be to abandon the proposed sections 21D and 21E altogether. This is because by bringing an asset into the GST net the owner becomes liable to charge and account for GST on any subsequent disposal of the asset. Unless an input deduction is allowed the Government would, in effect, be paid GST on the entire value of the asset rather than the “added value”. This is contrary to fundamental GST/VAT principles and undermines the integrity of GST. It is also inconsistent with the treatment given to other assets brought into a taxable activity. New Zealand prides itself on having a broad-based GST with minimal exceptions. The amendment is contrary to that approach because it singles out one class of taxpayers for special treatment and creates an exception. As such, it is an undesirable precedent. There are no avoidance considerations that could justify it. Comment Input tax credits should generally be allowed only where the recipient of goods or services has borne a GST cost and where output tax is payable by the supplier. To do otherwise would provide taxpayers with windfall gains and give rise to a significant revenue loss. As already noted, section 21(5) applies only to assets acquired after 1 October 1986, to ensure that the allowance of input tax credits is limited to cases where GST has actually been paid. Denying input tax credits for assets that have been used offshore and in respect of which GST has not been paid is therefore consistent with the current policy. The problem addressed by the proposed sections 21D and 21E arises from the boundary between the tax base in New Zealand and those offshore. It is one of a number that arise from boundaries in the operation of GST. This bill addresses broadly similar issues in relation to second-hand goods (arising from the boundary between registered and non-registered persons) and deferred property settlements (arising from the boundary between payments and invoice GST accounting methods). Recommendation That the submission be declined. 76 Issue: The ambit of the proposal Submission (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) The perceived abuse would be better targeted by allowing the input tax credit subject to the following: • if the asset in question leaves New Zealand and there is no longer a taxable activity requiring GST to be paid on the market value of the asset at that time; • if the asset is sold out of the New Zealand tax base, ensuring that the supply cannot be zero-rated. If the asset does not leave the New Zealand tax base allowing the input tax credit is justified on the basis that the taxable activity will continue to produce an output that will be subject to GST. Comment As already noted, officials consider that input tax credits for changes in use should not be available in respect of assets that were previously offshore and bore no GST on their acquisition. The alternative solution proposed does not, as alleged, address the problem. If a taxable activity ceases, GST is payable on deregistration (which can be forced by the Commissioner) in any event. While the suggested removal of zero-rating for assets that leave the New Zealand tax base might be an improvement on the current position, it addresses only a limited set of the circumstances at which the proposed sections 21D and 21E are aimed. In addition, the suggested zero-rating “solution” assumes that the policy concern is one of timing, that is, output tax is not payable until some time after the input tax credit is claimed. However, the issue is not one of timing but whether the credit should be allowed at all. Consequently, officials do not agree with the third limb of the Corporate Taxpayer Group’s proposal, which is to allow the credit when the asset continues to be used in a taxable activity in New Zealand. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 77 Issue: The meaning of “in writing” Submission (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) The retrospective nature of the proposal combined with the requirement that to be excluded from its ambit the Commissioner must have agreed in writing to the claim can create an anomalous result for taxpayers who have claimed change in use adjustments on a periodic basis. The proposal applies adversely to a taxpayer that has, in a series of GST returns, consistently made an adjustment but received no specific written approval from the Commissioner. Comment GST is a self-assessed tax and, as the submission points out, specific written approval from the Commissioner to taxpayers for input tax credit claims would not normally be given. However, Inland Revenue does, following receipt of a return, provide the taxpayer with a computer generated notice confirming the taxpayer’s calculation. This may later be followed up with an audit. Officials consider that the computer generated notice would be sufficient to satisfy the criterion that the Commissioner has agreed in writing to the taxpayer’s claim. We also consider, however, that the “in writing” requirement should be clarified to remove the ambiguity perceived by submissioners. The intention is that where the Commissioner has not queried a claim in writing before the introduction of the bill, or where the Commissioner has made such a query but agreed to the claim before the introduction of the bill, the claim should not be affected by the proposed sections 21D and 21E. This should be reflected in the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 78 ADJUSTMENTS FOR CHANGES IN USE Clause 84 BACKGROUND A registered person can claim input tax credits in relation to goods and services acquired principally for business purposes. Those goods and services may also be used for a private or exempt purpose. The Act deems such use to be a taxable supply by the registered person, and output tax is charged accordingly. A registered person cannot claim input tax credits in relation to goods and services acquired principally for private or exempt purposes. If those goods or services are also used for business purposes, the Act allows an input tax credit to reflect that taxable use. The principal objective of change in use adjustments is to ensure that input tax credits reflect the extent of the taxable use of goods and services. This is achieved by making adjustments to output tax or input tax if the original intended use of the goods and services changes or if the goods and services are acquired for both taxable and non- taxable purposes. The requirement to make output tax adjustments ensures that tax is borne by the final consumer when there is private or exempt use of goods or services. For example, the private use of goods or services acquired by a registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies represents a supply of goods or services to the registered person in his or her private capacity and, as such, should be subject to GST. Inland Revenue requires adjustments to be made in each taxable period that the asset is owned to reflect the continuing changes in use. This can result in high compliance costs for small amounts of revenue. An alternative to the “adjustments” approach is the “apportionment” approach, which is adopted in a number of other jurisdictions, including Australia. This limits the initial input tax credit to the estimated proportion of taxable use. Therefore in relation to an asset used, say, 60 percent for taxable purposes, an input tax credit of 60 percent of the GST component of the purchase price would be allowed. This amount would be further adjusted to reflect any changes in the asset’s continuing taxable use. The next stage of the GST review will consider the scope of the current rules and whether the current adjustment method should be replaced with an apportionment method, taking into account which of these is the preferable conceptual framework, which method provides the more accurate result and the relative compliance and administration costs of the two methods. In the meantime, the changes proposed in the bill will assist in reducing compliance costs. Submissioners on the proposed changes to the GST treatment of changes in use raised a number of issues including: 79 • whether or not any changes should be made at this stage, given that officials will be undertaking a longer term review of the current adjustment approach; • the need for a comprehensive explanation on enactment of the proposed changes; • the timing of output tax adjustments and extending the one-off basis to input tax adjustments. GENERAL ISSUES Issue: Defer any changes until the general review Submission (12 – ICANZ) No change should be made to the current change of use adjustments until a general review is undertaken. However, if change is necessary, adjustments should be allowed to be made annually. The methods of allocation should only be changed once the full GST review on this area has been completed. Comment The discussion document on the GST review compared the apportionment approach used in other jurisdictions with the current adjustments approach in NZ. It noted that an apportionment approach has considerable complexities. First, the approach assumes that intended continuing use can be predicted. Second, the treatment on disposal may be complex as it is unclear whether the apportionment should be calculated on the respective amounts of taxable and non-taxable use on acquisition, on disposal, in the intervening period or at a combination of these times. Canada and the UK have detailed rules to make these calculations. By not deeming a supply to occur when goods and services are used for non-taxable purposes, the apportionment rules do not reflect the principle that GST is borne by the final consumer. In the discussion document it was considered that this key principle should be retained but that the compliance costs imposed by the current requirements to make adjustments in each taxable period needed to be reduced. The proposals to reduce compliance costs were generally supported by submissioners on the discussion document but some submissioners considered that the current scheme creates inequities and should be replaced with an approach that directly apportions input tax as adopted in a number of other jurisdictions including Australia. Officials consider that the proposals to reduce compliance costs (including allowing taxpayers to make annual adjustments) should be enacted before the longer term review. Delaying the proposed changes to adjustments will only prolong the 80 difficulties taxpayers face in making input and output tax adjustments. Officials consider that these benefits would outweigh the costs of changing the legislation in the interim. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Communication on the proposed changes Submission (12 – ICANZ) In order to assist taxpayers in understanding the changes, the explanatory material published when the bill is passed into law should contain a comprehensive explanation of how these provisions apply in practice. Comment Officials will prepare a comprehensive Tax Information Bulletin on the changes in the bill. It will explain fully how the changes will apply in practice and will contain examples where necessary. Officials acknowledge the particular difficulties taxpayers have in making output tax adjustments. Therefore the Tax Information Bulletin will contain a detailed explanation of the new requirements. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Value of adjustments Submission (12 – ICANZ) If a person uses goods or services that were acquired prior to the introduction of GST for a non-taxable purpose, the person should be able to make the adjustment based on the lower of the cost or market value of the asset. Comment Officials consider it is clear that the legislation proposed in the bill would allow an adjustment on the basis of the lower of cost or open market value. No amendment is, therefore, necessary. 81 Recommendation That the submission be declined. OUTPUT TAX ADJUSTMENTS Issue: Scope of adjustments Submission (12 – ICANZ) If a person acquires goods and services before 1 October 1986 and ceases using them for business purposes prior to 1 October 1986, the person should not be required to make output tax adjustments for any subsequent non-taxable use. Comment The intention of the legislation is to require an output tax adjustment for any non- taxable use of business assets irrespective of whether or not they were purchased after the introduction of GST. In the situation raised in the submission an output tax adjustment should not be made, as the asset was not used for business purposes when GST was introduced. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Extent of adjustments Submission (9 – Ernst and Young) Output tax on deemed supplies from a change in use should never be higher than the input tax credit previously claimed on an earlier change of use. Comment A deemed supply arises from a change in use of goods and services from taxable to non-taxable purposes because the registered person is consuming the goods and services. Officials consider that the adjustment should not be related to the amount of the initial input tax credit, as the purchase of the goods and services and any non- taxable use are treated as, in effect, separate supplies. This approach achieves equity in the GST treatment of an asset used for private purposes by either a registered or non-registered person. For example, if a non-registered person rents a TV, that person 82 will pay GST on the rental cost and not receive an input tax credit. If a registered person acquires a TV for business purposes, that person would pay output tax but receive an equivalent input tax credit. If the person then uses the TV in their home output tax is charged on the value of that private use, being the market value of TV rentals. The submission considers that adjustments are based on the original input tax credit claimed on acquisition. This is a feature of apportionment approaches used in other jurisdictions. These approaches will be compared with the current adjustments approach in a longer-term review. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of adjustments Submission (13W – Rudd Watts & Stone) The timing of the proposed GST adjustment provisions in clause 84 needs to be clarified, as does the principle underlying periodic and annual adjustments. In particular: • It is not appropriate for the Commissioner to approve a method (other than actual use), and that it is inconsistent with self-assessment for the Commissioner to do so. • Some guidance is required as to the application of section 21C(1)(c) – annual output tax adjustments. • Some guidance is also required on why output tax payable under an annual method takes into account output tax paid in previous periods, whereas the output tax payable under the periodic method does not. Comment The proposed requirement for the Commissioner’s approval follows the current practice whereby taxpayers may use the direct attribution, turnover or a special method, with any special method being developed in consultation between the Commissioner and a taxpayer to ensure that it is appropriate. Officials do not consider that the requirement for Commissioner approval is inconsistent with self- assessment as it is expected that most taxpayers will be able to apply the actual use method in relation to determining the extent of private use or the turnover method in relation to exempt supplies. Other taxpayers who already have a special method will not need to reapply. Therefore the approval will only affect those taxpayers with new assets with mixed or changing use. The Tax Information Bulletin and other supporting Inland Revenue publications will provide more detail on the timing of the annual adjustment. Generally, this would be 83 expected to be in the taxable period in which a calculation of taxable and non-taxable use has been made for income tax purposes. Officials do not consider that additional detail is required in the legislation. The requirement to take into account previous output tax adjustments is a transitional rule to ensure that over-taxation does not arise if a taxpayer who currently makes periodic output tax adjustments changes to either the annual or one-off basis. Such a rule is not required if the periodic basis continues. The Tax Information Bulletin will provide further explanation on the operation of the rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that a Tax Information Bulletin provide a detailed explanation of the changes. Submission (12 – ICANZ) The bill as drafted is not clear that a taxpayer has a choice and does not provide protection for a taxpayer who has not made an adjustment in periods subject to Inland Revenue audit because they intended to make an adjustment later. Comment Officials consider that it is clear from the legislation that taxpayers have a choice regarding the time at which an output tax adjustment is made. This is supported by the commentary on the bill and the discussion document and will be further supported by the Tax Information Bulletin on the legislation, which will also state that taxpayers will not incur penalties if they make a legitimate choice and therefore have a reduced output tax liability in a period or periods before the change takes effect. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed section 21C(2) should be replaced with a test that focuses on a material change in use. Comment Proposed section 21C(2) requires a further output tax adjustment if a person has made a one-off adjustment and the non-taxable use of the asset increases by 20 percent or more. This rule seeks to balance compliance cost concerns with the need to maintain the GST base. 84 It is not clear what changes the submission would consider are material, and a specific threshold is likely to promote more certainty. This submission noted that a change of 20 percent in private use could occur in one period but not in another, while still triggering an output tax adjustment. Officials note that this difficulty would also arise in relation to material changes in use and is one of the factors for taxpayers to weigh up when considering whether to elect the one-off basis. Allowing one-off adjustments is designed to reduce compliance costs for assets with relatively constant use so as to eliminate the need to make ongoing adjustments in each taxable period. The submission highlights difficulties in relation to assets with significant fluctuations in use. It is, however, expected that taxpayers will not choose to prepay their adjustments in relation to these assets but will instead continue to make period-by-period adjustments or make adjustments annually. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (12 – ICANZ) There should be a rule which allows for input tax adjustments if circumstances giving rise to an initial or subsequent output tax adjustment made on a one-off basis are reversed. Comment As explained above, the one-off adjustment option will provide compliance benefits in relation to assets with relatively constant use. It is anticipated that in relation to assets with fluctuating use, taxpayers will choose to make period-by-period or annual adjustments. In that case any change in use that occurs during that period will be taken into account. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The threshold below which taxpayers are not required to make adjustments Submission (12 – ICANZ) The threshold for exempt supplies under which an output tax adjustment may not be required should be raised to $120,000. 85 Comment The submission notes that for the last 14 years taxpayers have, in effect, overpaid GST because the growth in the value of goods and services owing to inflation over the period has had the effect of lowering the worth of the thresholds. The proposed increase (from $48,000 to $90,000) will, however, ensure that inflation will not affect the value of the threshold for the next five to ten years. In setting the threshold there are competing considerations between reducing compliance costs and protecting GST revenue. Increasing the threshold on the basis of inflationary expectations only ensures that the balance achieved when the threshold was originally set is preserved. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (12 – ICANZ) The thresholds in the GST Act should be set by Order in Council, as this is a more flexible and timely manner in which to alter thresholds. Comment The legislation already provides that some thresholds, such as the registration threshold, may be changed by Order in Council. Given the current frequency of tax legislation, we do not believe that use of this Order in Council process would provide greater flexibility or timeliness. However, officials do consider that reviews of the statutory thresholds should occur more frequently than in the past. In relation to the registration threshold, for instance, officials plan to recommend the inclusion of regular reviews of the threshold in the Government’s tax policy work programme. Other thresholds should also be subject to regular reviews on this basis. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that thresholds be subject to regular reviews. 86 Issue: Calculating the extent of taxable and non-taxable use Submission (12 – ICANZ) “Interest netting” should be allowed in the turnover calculation. That is, interest expenses should be allowed to be deducted from interest income in calculating the value of exempt supplies. Comment The turnover calculation in relation to exempt supplies uses the formula: total value of exempt supplies total value of all supplies The calculation of the value of exempt supplies is a matter of administrative detail. If Inland Revenue publications authorise a particular method for calculating exempt supplies, the legislation will not preclude it. Officials consider that there should be some flexibility in the legislation to allow for different calculations where appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Application date Submission (12 – ICANZ) The amendment to prevent an unintended output tax liability for services provided by employees should apply from 1 October 1986 to remove any risk that an output tax adjustment is required from 1 October 1986. Comment The bill clarifies that an output tax adjustment is not required in relation to a supply of services by employees. Officials agree that the amendment should apply from 1 October 1986 to remove any risk of a requirement to make an output tax adjustment in relation to earlier taxable periods. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 87 INPUT TAX ADJUSTMENTS Issue: Scope of adjustments Submission (12 – ICANZ) The word “are” in the proposed section 21E(3) should be replaced with the phrase “are or were” to recognise that a change in use adjustment can be made where a person has owned goods for some time. Comment Officials do not consider that the draft legislation precludes an input tax adjustment in relation to taxable use of an asset acquired in an earlier taxable period. Section 21E applies to assets acquired for the principal purpose other than that of making taxable supplies that are applied in a taxable period (being the taxable period in which the asset was purchased as well as future taxable periods) for a purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 21E(3) provides that a single deduction may be made in relation to capital assets that cost less than $18,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Timing of adjustments Submission (9W – Ernst and Young for Community Housing) Section 21F should be amended to allow one-off input tax credits to be claimed at the time of a change in use from exempt to taxable supplies. If the use changes again, from taxable use to exempt use, a person should be required to make an offsetting output tax adjustment. The removal of the ability to claim one-off input tax adjustments where there are genuine changes of use of assets will result in significant compliance costs. The compliance costs arise in relation to both GST and income tax. For GST purposes, input tax credits would be required to be spread (potentially over a long period of time). For tax depreciation purposes, the cost of an asset is reduced by any input tax adjustment arising on a change in use. The cost is reduced in each income year by the amount of input tax credits. Accordingly for each of the remaining years of the property’s economic life, an adjustment to its depreciable cost base needs to be made before tax depreciation can be calculated. 88 The submission also considers that the proposed amendment would create an unjustified distinction in the GST treatment of an input tax credit claim in relation to a change in use of property and the sale of property. Comment Officials consider that the current legislation is unclear on whether or not a taxpayer may make a one-off input tax adjustment if the use of goods or services (that cost more than $10,000) changes entirely. It was not intended that the proposed amendment impose significant compliance costs by changing any existing practice of claiming one-off input tax adjustments. If the legislation were amended to allow taxpayers to claim input tax credits on a one- off basis significant revenue risks would arise. For example, if a registered person purchases property for the purposes of both commercial and residential rental but the property is used mainly for residential purposes the registered person would not be entitled to an input tax credit as the property is not acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. However, if the use subsequently changes so that some apartments are converted to offices the registered person would be entitled to an input tax credit for the increased taxable use. If an input tax credit for the increased taxable use were allowed in one taxable period rather than being spread over the time the property was owned by that person, that person could receive a significant tax advantage if the property was then sold as residential property. This opportunity arises because if an asset is acquired for the principal purpose of making non-taxable supplies, any sale of the asset will also be non-taxable. A similar risk would also arise in relation to private assets (such as cars) used for taxable purposes. To reduce the scope for avoidance officials consider that one-off input tax credits should not generally be allowed in relation to any change in use of goods and services from non-taxable use to taxable use. However, to address the particular compliance cost concerns raised in the submission, officials consider that the bill should be amended to allow taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for a one-off input tax adjustment in relation to 100 percent changes in use of goods and services that cost $18,000 or more. Officials agree with the recommendation in the submission that to the extent that the taxable use changes to non-taxable use taxpayers be required to make a one-off output tax adjustment. This change is an interim measure to ensure that the proposals in the bill (which are intended to reduce compliance costs) do not inadvertently increase compliance costs to taxpayers with assets that have entire changes in use. This approach will be subject to review as part of the general review of the GST treatment of changes in use included in the Government’s tax policy work programme. The criteria to be applied by the Commissioner in approving a taxpayer’s application for a one-off input tax adjustment would include: • Whether the taxpayer has made one-off input tax adjustments before the introduction of the bill; 89 • Whether the taxpayer has elected to make one-off output tax adjustments for any previous changes from taxable use to non-taxable use; • Whether making period-by-period or annual adjustments is practical in the circumstances; • The nature of the goods or services (for example, the length of ownership of real property is likely to be longer than that of other goods or services); • The extent of fluctuations in taxable use. (One-off adjustments should not be made if the extent of taxable use changes often. Few compliance benefits would arise if offsetting output tax adjustments were relatively frequent.) The supply of goods and services in relation to which a one-off input tax adjustment has been made will be treated as a taxable supply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part by allowing taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for a one-off input tax adjustment in relation to entire changes in use of goods and services that cost $18,000 or more. That if a one-off input tax adjustment is allowed and the taxable use reverts back to non-taxable use the taxpayer be required to make a one-off output tax adjustment. Note that this approach will be subject to review as part of the general review of the GST treatment of changes in use included in the Government’s tax policy work programme. Issue: Tax advantages arising from the valuation of changes in use Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended to include a specific anti-avoidance provision allowing the Commissioner to disregard a deemed supply for a change from taxable to non- taxable use of goods if the Commissioner considers that the registered person is making the change in contemplation of the sale of the goods. Comment The bill proposes that taxpayers may choose to make one output tax adjustment in relation to changes from taxable to non-taxable use of good and services. The adjustment would be valued under the existing legislation at the lesser of the cost of the goods and services or the open market value of the deemed supply (for example, the market value of the rental of an asset). Officials understand that taxpayers contemplating the sale of high-value assets (such as real property) after the bill is enacted are being advised to change the use of their property from business to private, make a one-off output tax adjustment for the 90 change in use and then sell the property. Under this scenario the GST liability would be one-ninth of the original cost of the asset compared with one-ninth of its market value if the taxpayer deregistered prior to sale. An existing opportunity to avoid paying GST on the basis of the market value is available if taxpayers deregister prior to selling their assets. A proposal in the bill seeks to correct the anomaly in the GST treatment between assets retained and sold after deregistration and assets sold before deregistration, thus removing the tax advantages. However, taxpayers may seek to avoid paying GST at market value by changing the use of their assets from business to private immediately prior to sale. Officials consider that a specific anti-avoidance provision should be introduced to provide that a deemed supply would not arise if a registered person were contemplating the sale of the asset for which a change in use was claimed. Therefore output tax based on the asset’s market value would be payable on any sale of the asset. The GST Act already contains a similar provision in relation to deregistration. If the Commissioner believes that the registered person is planning to sell the asset in the near future and that they applying for deregistration to avoid charging GST, the Commissioner may require the person to remain registered. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Exception from requirement to make output tax adjustments for changes in legislation Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended so that a person is not required to make an output tax adjustment for changes in use arising from a change in the law only in relation to assets acquired before the introduction of GST. Comment Proposed section 21(2)(b) provides that an output tax adjustment is not required if the change in use occurs because of a change in legislation. This exception should be limited to changes in use of goods and services acquired before the introduction of GST, as input tax credits were not allowed on their acquisition. Therefore there is no GST effect from the legislative change to make a supply exempt – no input tax credits were allowed and no output tax is payable. This achieves the same effect as an initial exemption. 91 However, an output tax adjustment should arise in relation to assets acquired after GST. The output tax liability offsets the input tax credit allowed. Again, this has the same effect as if the assets had always been exempt. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 92 TAX INVOICES Clause 86 Issue: Threshold for when an abbreviated tax invoice may be issued Submissions (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group, 12 – ICANZ) Increasing the threshold when an abbreviated tax invoice may be issued is adequate – but more should be done to reform the statutory tax invoice requirements. Suggested reforms include: • removing the need to have the words “tax invoice” and a description of the goods and services supplied appear on the document; and • raising the threshold when a tax invoice does not have to be issued from $50 to $1,000. Comment The bill increases the threshold when an abbreviated tax invoice may be issued, from $200 to $1,000. A tax invoice is a document that meets the following statutory criteria by displaying: • the words “tax invoice” in a prominent place; • the name and registration number of the supplier; • the name and address of the recipient; • the date the tax invoice is issued; • a description of the goods and services supplied; • the quantity or volume of the goods and services supplied; • either - -The total amount of tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or -Where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes tax. An abbreviated tax invoice does not require the name or address of the purchaser nor the quantity of the goods and services to be disclosed. Tax invoices are the key means by which Inland Revenue can maintain an audit trail and verify the claiming of input tax credits by registered persons. The statutory details build on the information that is ordinarily displayed for commercial purposes 93 (including a description, and the quantity, of what is supplied) by requiring the following additional disclosures: • the words “tax invoice” displayed in a prominent place; • the supplier’s GST number; and • whether the supply includes GST. A “tax invoice” is required for the deduction of input tax. Removing the requirement to have the words “tax invoice” could lead to there being more than one such document for a single supply. This could result in multiple input tax credits for a supply. Using the term “tax invoice” to a large extent removes this possibility. In relation to the suggestion that the threshold under which a tax invoice is not required should be raised from $50 to $1,000, officials are concerned at the potential risk to the revenue that could be created by such a move. Although the revenue involved in a single transaction of less than $1,000 is small, the huge volume of these transactions means that there is a very significant revenue risk. Further, materiality considerations could mean that any tax discrepancies arising from amounts of less than $1,000 are unlikely to be noticed during routine audit and audit selection. It should also be noted that the revenue risks associated with not issuing a tax invoice are such that some jurisdictions do not have a similar threshold. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Offence not to issue a tax invoice Submission (11 – Corporate Taxpayer Group) The legislation should be amended so as to: • reinstate the failure to issue a tax invoice as a specific offence in the Tax Administration Act; and • allow a registered person that has requested a tax invoice the right to claim an input tax credit without the invoice. Comment The submission notes that before the reforms made as part of the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties and Disputes Resolution Bill in 1996, it was a specific offence if a registered person did not supply a tax invoice within 28 days of being requested to do so. 94 The Tax Administration Act 1994 now makes it an offence “not to provide information (including tax returns and tax forms) to the Commissioner or any other person when required to do so by a tax law”. The legislation is not specific on whether the failure to issue a tax invoice is an offence under the Tax Administration Act 1994. Although the failure to issue a tax invoice is arguably covered by the present wording of the Tax Administration Act, officials consider that it would be desirable to clarify the application of the law. In respect of the submission’s second proposal, the main concern seems to be the situation where a document is issued that purports to be a tax invoice, but does not meet the statutory criteria as set out in section 24 of the GST Act. In some instances it can be difficult to get the supplier to issue another document that complies with the Act. Officials consider that the proposed solution is too broad and may include situations where the supplier is not legally required to issue an invoice and/or no GST is payable, such as where the supplier is not registered. Rather than giving an automatic right to registered persons to claim an input tax credit after 28 days of a request being made, officials consider that a better solution is the discretion that the Commissioner has under the Act to allow the original document to be treated as if it were a tax invoice. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Officials recommend that an amendment be made to the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make the failure to issue a tax invoice under the GST Act an absolute penalty offence. 95 DEBT FACTORING Clauses 87 and 88 Issue: The amendment should not proceed Submission (12 – ICANZ) Proposed section 26A should not proceed. When a debt is factored the vendor is prepared to accept an amount that is less than the full value of the debt. The difference between the amount the customer is charged and the value realised by the vendor should not be subject to GST as it is intrinsically a financial service. Consideration should be given to allowing a bad debt deduction for debts factored by a person on an invoice basis. Comment The broad policy intent of GST is that the final consumer pays the tax on a supply of goods and services made by a registered person (the supplier). The supplier is then responsible for returning that GST to Inland Revenue. If the debt is not collected the GST liability is not adjusted for a registered person on the invoice basis other than where it can be demonstrated objectively that the debt has become bad. In the case of a registered person who accounts on a payments basis, no adjustment is required since the payments basis requires GST to be recognised only to the extent that payment is received. Debt factoring raises a completely different set of circumstances. Debt factoring involves the assignment of a debt to a third party. The consumer is still obliged to pay the GST charged by the supplier. Therefore, unless the supplier adjusts the amount that is to be paid by the consumer, such as by providing a prompt payment discount, no adjustment of the GST liability of the supplier should be allowed. The amendments contained in the bill seek to resolve two problems involving the treatment of factored debts: • The potential scope for avoidance by registered persons on the payments basis, who might factor debts in order to convert taxable supplies into exempt supplies. The tax advantage that is created is equal to one-ninth of the discount (the GST component of the discount allowed on assignment). • The disparity in the way that GST liabilities are recognised by registered persons on the different accounting bases, with persons accounting on a payments basis being unduly advantaged. Officials acknowledge that the bill does not deal with situations where a registered person accounting for GST on an invoice basis may pay GST on amounts not received. Officials considered the possibility of a deduction being allowed for the discount given when a debt is factored. However, there are a number of concerns with this approach, including: 96 • The adjustment that is allowed in respect of bad debts is intended to address situations where it is certain that a debt will not be recovered. Allowing deductions for what are, in effect, doubtful, but not bad, debts undermines this certainty. • The GST timing advantage that would be gained if the assignor factored the debt rather than left it on their books and used normal debt collection mechanisms would provide an incentive to factor debt. • There would be difficulties in determining what portion of the payment for the debt related to the value of the debt as opposed to the time value of money loss borne by the factor in carrying the debt. • If an input tax credit were allowed for the discount component of a debt which was not bad at the point of assignment there would be no mechanism for the deduction to be clawed back in the event that the factor recovered an amount in excess of the debt’s transfer value. This is because amounts recovered in the course of a debt factoring activity are either exempt or are not connected with any supply. So, for example: Company A sells two items for $100 each on a GST inclusive basis. Each debt is factored to Company B for $80. Company B recovers $100 on the first debt and $70 on the second debt. There is thus a total loss of $30. However, if Company A were allowed a deduction on assignment to Company B, a deduction of $40 would be allowed. The bill (clause 87) does, however, provide relief for suppliers accounting for GST on an invoice basis where debts have been assigned on a recourse basis. A debt that has been assigned with recourse allows the purchaser of the debt, in the event that the debt proves to be uncollectable, to exercise a right to recover the purchase price of the debt from the assignor (the supplier). The debt is then returned to the assignor. In these circumstances, under clause 87, the assignor would, where the debt becomes bad, be entitled to adjust the GST liability on the supply of goods and services underlying that debt. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Clarification of amending legislation Submission (Matter raised by officials) A bad debt adjustment should be allowed in circumstances where a factored debt is found to be uncollectable and there is recourse to the assignor of the debt. 97 Comment Proposed section 26A requires a registered person accounting for GST on a payments basis to return GST on the book value of the debt if the debt is assigned to a third party. In some instances the third party will have recourse to the registered person if the debt is subsequently found to be uncollectable. In these circumstances, where the registered person recognises that the recourse debt is bad, it is appropriate that the registered person should be able to adjust the GST liability that was due on the goods and services underlying that debt. The present wording of the amending legislation is intended to provide relief in these circumstances. However, as the amendment is currently drafted, this relief is only available where the registered person accounts for GST on an invoice basis; if the registered person accounts for GST on a payments basis the legislation provides no relief. This is contrary to the intention of the amending legislation. Officials recommend that section 26 (which allows a registered person relief from a GST liability when a debt is bad) be amended accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 98 SPECIFIED AGENTS Clause 91 Issue: Commissioner’s right to withhold payments Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment should not proceed, as: • It is unprincipled for the Crown to prefer itself over other creditors. • The Crown should have to prove its debt in the same manner as any other creditor. Also, default assessments, which are usually not objected to within objection deadlines, are commonly issued in receiverships. Comment The bill proposes to allow a “specified agent” (receiver, liquidator etc) to deduct any input tax relating to supplies made before the agency period (period of receivership, liquidation etc) if the incapacitated company or other incapacitated person has not previously deducted the input tax. The bill also proposes to allow the Commissioner to set off the pre-agency input tax credits claimed by a specified agent against the pre-agency period tax debt of the incapacitated person. The submission notes that in the event that the Commissioner offsets any refund due against any tax due, whether preferential or non-preferential, the Commissioner would gain a preference over all other creditors which would be in breach of the Companies Act 1993, section 30 of the Receiverships Act 1993 and general common law principles. Officials consider that the Commissioner should be able to set-off input tax credits relating to supplies before the agency period because this will ensure that the credits are properly recognised in the period to which they belong and the Government is not disadvantaged merely because the credits are claimed late. With regard to the submission that the proposed amendment creates an “unprincipled” new preference, officials note that GST already has a degree of preferential status over other debts because of the fact that it is collected and paid by registered suppliers on behalf of the consumers who bear the cost of the tax. The proposed amendment is consistent with this preferential status. In any event, officials’ view is that the proposed amendment is a clarification of the existing law, rather than the creation of a new preference. 99 With regard to the argument in relation to default assessments issued by the Commissioner, taxpayers are able to challenge such assessments by filing the necessary returns. The whole process is at the control of the specified agent in these circumstances. Thus the focus in the submission on default assessments does not present any reason why the set-off should not as a matter of policy be allowed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) If the previous submission is rejected, the proposal should be expanded to provide that, in circumstances where a specified agent is appointed, an exception will be made with regard to the deadline for challenging a notice of assessment. Comment The submission suggests that the appointment of a liquidator or receiver be classed as an “exceptional circumstance” so as to provide taxpayers with a legal opportunity to challenge an assessment in which the Commissioner has set off refunds against any tax payable. Officials understand that the issue arises because the standard time for challenging a notice of assessment may be insufficient where a change-over is occurring and a receiver or liquidator needs to become familiar with the tax affairs of the incapacitated person. Officials do not consider that this should be regarded as an exceptional circumstance. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 100 REGISTRATION THRESHOLD Clause 93(1) Issue: Registration threshold should be increased to $50,000 Submission (12 – ICANZ) The registration threshold should be further increased to $50,000 in order to further reduce compliance costs to small businesses. Comment The registration threshold for GST determines when a person should be required to register for GST. If the total value of a person’s supplies in a 12-month period exceeds $30,000, the person is required to be registered. The threshold was last reviewed in 1990 and was raised from $24,000 to $30,000 as a consequence. In setting the registration threshold for GST there are two competing considerations: • A high registration threshold reduces compliance costs because it allows many small businesses to fall outside the GST system. • A low threshold reduces the potential for smaller businesses to place significant competitive pressures on businesses operating above the threshold. The increase in the registration threshold from $30,000 to $40,000 was calculated with regard to inflation and ensures that the balance achieved when the threshold was originally set is preserved. The $50,000 threshold proposed by ICANZ changes this balance and could create a new level of market distortion. Registered suppliers competing with a significantly increased number of unregistered suppliers would incur more of the economic incidence of GST. This could create a decline in the profitability of registered suppliers in affected industries. It would also create more incentive to manipulate turnover to remain under the threshold. For example, independent operators in the taxi industry would be able to charge GST- exclusive prices for fares because they would not have to register for GST. This could lower the market price for taxi fares and force larger taxi operators who are registered for GST, either to absorb the GST that they would have previously passed on to their customers or to alter their dealings in order to achieve a turnover below the threshold. Furthermore, a significant number of businesses have a turnover around $50,000, including many personal services operators such as hairdressers and personal tradespersons. These professions tend to have a higher proportion of final consumers as customers and lower amounts of inputs that are charged with GST. Consequently, they would be likely to opt out of the GST system if the threshold was raised to 101 $50,000. This would reduce the tax base and lead to a significant loss in GST revenue. Approximately 23,800 small businesses have a turnover between $40,000 and $50,000 (exclusive of GST). These businesses returned approximately $47 million in GST in the year ending June 1999. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The registration threshold should be indexed to inflation Submission (12 – ICANZ) The registration threshold should be indexed to inflation and reviewed approximately every two years, increasing by multiples of $5,000. Comment As mentioned above, the threshold was last increased in 1990. The submission suggested that reviews of the threshold should be conducted more regularly and should be pegged to inflation. ICANZ has suggested biennial reviews rising in multiples of $5,000 (where necessary) as an appropriate standard. Officials agree that the threshold should be reviewed on a more regular basis and plan to recommend the inclusion of regular reviews of the threshold in the Government’s tax policy work programme. However, officials consider that reviews every two years, given New Zealand’s low inflationary environment, would be unnecessary and costly. The frequency suggested by ICANZ could increase compliance costs by creating uncertainty as to movements in the threshold. The objective of reviewing the threshold is to ensure that it is set at an appropriate level so that persons over the threshold are able to sustain the costs incurred in complying with the GST system. Officials consider that inflation, although an important consideration in such a review, is not the only matter that should be taken into account. Future reviews of the threshold should not be restricted in what they can consider. Recommendation The submission be declined. 102 UNINCORPORATED BODIES Clause 95 Issue: Liability of trustees Submission (12 – ICANZ) GST debts should be recoverable from individual members of an unincorporated body, but trustees should only be liable to the extent of the assets which were held as part of the trust and not to the extent of the personal assets of the trustees. Comment Because unincorporated bodies are not separate legal entities, generally their members are personally liable for all debts of the body. This treatment arises under common law in relation to other debts and is reflected in the GST Act. As a practical matter, this liability can be reduced to some extent by the trust deed giving the trustees a right to be indemnified out of the trust property. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Liability of members’ estates Submission (12 – ICANZ) A previous member’s estate should not be liable for tax payable by the unincorporated body. Comment ICANZ considers that tax should only be recoverable from an estate if the person is a member of the unincorporated body at the time of death. The current legislation provides that after a member’s death the member’s estate is liable for any tax still unpaid. This liability should include amounts payable by a retired member for GST debt relating to supplies made when he/she was a member. This liability should not be removed if a debt due to the Crown remains unpaid. A person’s estate should be liable for the GST debt relating to the period when the person was a member of the unincorporated body, whether or not the person was a member at the time of their death. 103 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Definitions in section 57 Submission (19W – NZLS) Remove as many as possible of the definitions from section 57 and make them applicable to the whole Act. It is only necessary to retain the definition of “body” in section 57 itself. As a consequence, proposed sections 21D(4), 21E(4) and 42(2A) could be removed. Further consequential amendments should be made to section 2, section 42(2)(a) and section 42(2)(c). Comment Officials consider that the submitted changes are desirable as they would reduce the number of cross-references in the Act and simplify the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 104 GENERAL ANTI-AVOIDANCE PROVISION Clause 100 Issue: Publication of a standard practice statement Submission (12 – ICANZ) Following the amendment to section 76 (the general anti-avoidance provision in the GST Act), the Inland Revenue Department should publish a standard practice statement which considers examples of tax avoidance in a GST context to provide guidance to registered persons. Comment The general anti-avoidance provision in the GST Act is intended to be a “backstop” provision used to fill gaps that the various specific anti-avoidance provisions do not cover. There is a policy preference to rely primarily on specific anti-avoidance rules because they are generally easier to interpret and apply in specific situations, and therefore their application is more certain. The general anti-avoidance provision is relied on where the more precise specific anti-avoidance rules do not apply to counteract certain arrangements entered into to gain a tax advantage. An example of where the general anti-avoidance provision may apply is an arrangement entered into to avoid the restrictions on input tax credits for sales of second-hand goods between associated persons. This could involve an unrelated party being interposed in a back-to-back arrangement involving the sale of second- hand goods between two associated persons. The Inland Revenue Department is currently preparing a policy statement on the Income Tax Act 1994 general anti-avoidance provision to replace the existing statement that was published in 1990. The new GST general anti-avoidance provision in the bill has been modelled on the general anti-avoidance provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 1994. The new policy statement being prepared by Inland Revenue on the Income Tax Act 1994 general anti-avoidance provision will, therefore, be directly relevant to the GST provision. This alignment of the general anti-avoidance provisions in the GST and Income Tax Acts will allow a similar analysis to be used when considering each provision. Aligning these provisions also means that the case law dealing with the income tax provision can be used to interpret the GST provision. The structure of the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act 1994 was endorsed by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in 1998. The Tax Information Bulletin item on the bill will contain some examples of arrangements to which Inland Revenue considers the amended GST general anti- avoidance provision will apply. 105 Recommendation That the submission be noted. Issue: The need for section 76(5) – (7) Submission (12 – ICANZ) Proposed section 76(5), (6) and (7) should be deleted. These provisions are not required because of the change to the deregistration provisions. Anyone who brings themselves under the compulsory registration threshold and deregisters must account for GST at open market value. Comment Proposed section 76(5), (6) and (7) re-enacts the existing section 76(3). There has been no change in the scope of the provisions. The provisions are designed to prevent persons artificially splitting their business activities between associated persons and themselves to take advantage of the longer return period options, the payments basis of accounting for GST and the registration threshold. For the purpose of these threshold levels the value of all taxable supplies made by the persons involved in an arrangement are aggregated and attributed to each of those persons. Officials do not consider that these provisions will become unnecessary because of the new rules that will require people deregistering to account for output tax on assets acquired after the introduction of GST at their open market value. The provisions are unrelated. Section 76(5), (6) and (7) is not concerned with securing a one-off amount of output tax on the open market value of the assets employed in a taxable activity, but instead is directed at preventing output tax being avoided or postponed on the on- going supplies made by groups of associated persons. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The form of section 76(6) Submission (12 – ICANZ) Proposed section 76(6) should not be an anti-avoidance rule, but should be a charging section. 106 Comment Proposed section 76(6) is one of three provisions (the others being section 76(5) and (7)) which prevent persons artificially splitting their business activities to take advantage of the registration threshold, the payments basis of accounting, or the longer return period options. Officials do not consider these provisions have a charging effect, which would involve them deeming a supply to exist or increasing the consideration for a supply. Rather, the provisions apply only for the purposes of the threshold levels described above. Section 76(5), (6) and (7), read together, is properly regarded as an anti-avoidance provision. These provisions also constitute a simple re- enactment of the existing law contained in section 76(3), which has been in place since the enactment of the GST Act in 1985. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The scope of section 76(5) – (7) Submission (21W – Denham Martin & Associates) The anti-avoidance rule in section 76(5), (6) and (7) should be redrafted so as to limit its scope and reduce compliance costs by: • Having the rule operate only in relation to dispositions of taxable activities that occur after the date of Royal assent of the bill (or the date the bill was introduced). • Where the vendor ceases to have any taxable activity following the sale to the associated person, having the rule only operate in the 12 month period surrounding the disposition of the taxable activity and only apply to assess the turnover of the recipient of the taxable activity. • Having the rule operate, rather than it being “disapplied”, where the Commissioner thinks fit. Comment In the submission it seems to be assumed that proposed section 76(5), (6) and (7) is being enacted for the first time in this bill. For example, the submission refers to the legislation having “potential application to all taxpayers retrospectively to the introduction of GST, being 22 August 1985”. Proposed section 76(5), (6) and (7), however, simply re-enacts existing section 76(3), which has been in place since the enactment of the GST Act in 1985. During the approximately 15 years that existing section 76(3) has been in place, it has not been identified as imposing high compliance costs on taxpayers, and its operation has not been problematic. 107 Ensuring that a vendor who has ceased to have any taxable activity (and therefore will not have any output tax liability in any event) is not affected by this rule is achieved by the Commissioner having the discretion under section 76(7) not to apply the provision to such a person when it is considered that this would be equitable. The discretion would be so exercised if there was no prospect of any output tax liability because the vendor has ceased to have any taxable activity. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The breadth of the definition of “tax avoidance” Submission (13W – Rudd Watts & Stone) Paragraph (e) of the definition of “tax avoidance” in proposed section 76(8), referring to a reduction in the total consideration payable by a person for a supply of goods and services, should be removed from the bill because it is too wide. Comment The submissioner states that paragraph (e) in the definition of “tax avoidance” in proposed section 76(8) is too wide because it will treat as tax avoidance normal commercial arrangements such as where a purchaser receives a discount for prompt payment from an unrelated supplier. Officials note that the general anti-avoidance provision applies to counter arrangements that are contrary to legislative intent. It should, therefore, not apply to an arrangement such as that mentioned in the submission. The proposed section 76 is based on the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act 1994. As was noted by the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance in its 1998 report, giving meaning to the terms of a widely drafted general anti-avoidance provision such as that in the Income Tax Act 1994, is ultimately a matter of judgement for the courts. Therefore, simply because the general anti-avoidance provision is widely drafted does not mean that arrangements which are not contrary to legislative intent will be nullified. The submissioner also considers that it is not appropriate for the Commissioner to increase the amount of consideration paid between non-associated parties. (The submission also noted that this principle may not be applicable in the case of associated parties, where “due to their association the value of the consideration may not actually be parted with in a broader economic sense”.) There is a policy concern with vendors making supplies to associated persons for inadequate consideration, and a specific anti-avoidance rule (section 10(3)) treats the vendor as having received consideration equal to the market value of the supply. However, paragraph (e) of the definition of “tax avoidance” in the GST general anti- avoidance provision would be relevant if an arrangement was entered into which 108 involved interposing an unassociated party between two associated parties and arranging for a back-to-back supply arrangement for inadequate consideration. This is consistent with the backstop role of a general anti-avoidance rule, which is necessary to fill the gaps that specific anti-avoidance rules do not cover. It is, therefore, necessary that paragraph (e) of the definition of “tax avoidance” in proposed section 76(8) be retained to ensure the efficacy of the GST general anti- avoidance provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 109 MINOR DRAFTING CHANGES Clauses 66, 68, 70, 74, 84 and 95(3) Submissions (Matters raised by officials) The following minor drafting changes should be made to the bill: • Remove the reference to section 13 in section 2(1) (clause 66) with effect from 1 October 1996 (the date section 13 was repealed). • Clarify in proposed section 3(1)(k) (clause 68) that a deliverable futures contract for financial commodities need only be supplied on arm’s length terms, as opposed to being traded on arm’s length terms. • Omit the reference to “indemnity” in the proviso to proposed section 5(13) in clause 70. • Amend clause 74 in relation to proposed section 11A(1)(l) to clarify that it is subject to section 11A(2). • Amend proposed section 21D(3)(c) (clause 84) to ensure that it achieves its purpose of preventing a double input tax deduction in respect of the same goods. • Amend the term “output tax payable” in proposed section 21C (clause 84) so that it is consistent with the terminology used elsewhere in the GST Act. • Amend proposed section 21D (clause 84) to ensure that section 21E allows an input tax adjustment for the taxable use of goods and services for which output tax adjustments have previously been made for any non-taxable use. • Amend proposed section 57(3) (clause 95(3)) so that it refers to tax relating to the taxable periods during which the person is a member. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Alienation of income - the attribution rule 113 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS General comments The attribution rule is an anti-avoidance rule aimed at ensuring that in defined circumstances a person’s income from personal exertion is attributed to that person for tax purposes. When designing the rule officials kept two particular points in mind: that the deduction of expenditure would not be affected, and that the “employer” relationship should not be recategorised. The rule only applies when all of the following criteria are met: • The personal service provider (person C) and the interposed entity (person B) must be associated; and • 80 percent of the gross income from the services of person B must be derived from one source (person A or an associate of person A); and • 80 percent of the gross income from the services of person B must relate to the services personally provided by person C and related persons; and • Substantial business assets are not a necessary part of the business structure used to derive the income from services. Example: Person A Personal Services Requirer (“Employer”) Person B Intermediary (company, partnership, trust) Person C Personal Services Provider (individual) $1,000 expenses $100,000 for the personal services of Person C $99,000 attributed 114 If all four criteria are met, the $99,000 net income of the intermediary will be attributed for tax purposes to Person C, the personal services provider. This attribution is required for tax purposes only. Officials expect that the accounting treatment will frequently follow the tax treatment. In most cases where it could apply, the intermediary’s personal service income will be paid out to the personal services provider as salary, so the rule will not actually apply. This outcome is in accordance with the policy. Submissions received on the proposed attribution rule raised a number of issues. A key issue raised is that of double tax. There are some instances where this could happen. Officials have suggestions as to how this could be addressed. We have also recommended that a number of other submissions be accepted. A number of submissions commented that the current anti-avoidance rules are sufficient to combat the establishment of interposed entities simply to avoid tax. Officials disagree with these submissions in that the current anti-avoidance rule is subjective and can be difficult and time-consuming to apply. The attribution rule offers the certainty that in carefully defined circumstances the income from personal exertion is attributed to the person who provided it. It will also apply to structures to which the anti-avoidance rule will not apply, because it is objective. However, it does no more than allocate income to those whose personal exertions cause it to be derived. Officials have undertaken further consultation with ICANZ, PricewaterhouseCoopers, the New Zealand Employers’ Federation, the Federation of Commercial Fishermen and the Seafood Industry Council to discuss their submissions. As well, we spoke less formally with a number of other groups that made submissions. These discussions and consultations have been very useful in that some of the concerns expressed in submissions have been eased and other concerns will be the subject of specific recommendations. The Committee’s advisor, Therese Turner, has also provided very useful comment and criticism. 115 PURPOSE OF THE ATTRIBUTION RULE Issue: Attribution rule’s impact on structures Submission (1 – C. Smith) The attribution rule should not be adopted because it unnecessarily impinges upon structures set in place for non-tax reasons such as creditor protection. Comment In officials’ view, the rule does not impinge on usual creditor protection arrangements. In any case, the circumstances outlined in the submission make it clear the rule will not apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The need for an attribution rule Submission (17 – New Zealand Employers’ Federation) The attribution rule is not necessary as the current general anti-avoidance rules are sufficient to circumvent the use of interposed entities between an employee and employer to allow the employee to avoid the top personal tax rate. Comment There are many reasons why a taxpayer might enter into the sort of structure targeted by the attribution rule. The general anti-avoidance rule will often not apply to “undo” these. Further, the general anti-avoidance can be difficult and time-consuming to apply. However, the result of these structures is that the 39% tax rate might not apply to the personal services income unless the attribution rule applies. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 116 Issue: Attribution rule wider than just “anti-avoidance” Submission (19W – New Zealand Law Society) The commentary on the bill states that the attribution rule is “a specific anti-avoidance rule to address cases where an employee has structured his or her employment relationship to interpose an entity between themselves and their employer”. The submission suggests that the rule exceeds this purpose and consequently should be limited to a “dominant purpose” test. This test would focus on whether the arrangement has been established with the purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the new top personal tax rate. Adoption of such a test would also avoid any difficulties with the GST implications of the attribution rules. Comment Although the rule is anti-avoidance in nature, it is correct that it will apply to businesses that are genuine. This is necessary to ensure that it is properly targeted. When the attribution rule was being developed there was decisions on whether the rule should be objective or subjective. In the end, officials recommended that the test be objective. This remains our view. The attribution rule is designed to apply in narrow circumstances where there is essentially one stream of personal services income, regardless of the taxpayer's reasons for setting the structure up. Officials have considered the GST issue and do not consider that a problem will arise in practice. This is because the market value and associated persons provisions in the GST law will not cause the personal service provider to be deemed to be GST registered. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 117 APPLICATION DATE Issue: Retrospective application of the proposal Submission (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 17 – Employers’ Federation) The rule is retrospective in that it applies generally from 1 April 2000 (2000-2001 income year). It is submitted that the rule should apply generally from 1 April 2001 (2001-2002 income year). The retrospective application of the rule places taxpayers in the difficult position of having to take into account the proposed rules in the year beginning 1 April 2000, even though they have no certainty as to whether, and to what extent, the rule will apply to them. Furthermore, arrangements that have been in place for a long period of time may well be affected. Particular reference is made to the payment of provisional tax, the first instalment of which was generally due on 7 July 2000, and that in a situation where the interposed entity pays sufficient tax related to the income attributed to the individual, no penalties or use-of-money interest should apply. Comment Under the compliance and penalties legislation it seems clear that, so long as the provisional tax is paid appropriately by either the intermediary or the personal services provider, penalties should not apply. The rule was announced at the end of March 2000 as applying from 1 April 2000. It is officials’ view that some, probably a majority, of taxpayers and their agents will generally have relied upon the rule applying for the 2000 year and paid provisional tax accordingly. Changing the application date to 1 April 2001 would cause confusion. Furthermore, it would provide a window of opportunity for affected taxpayers to avoid the 39% tax rate imposed on 1 April 2000. Use-of-money interest relief is appropriate, however, if the intermediary pays the tax instead of the personal services provider. This is dealt with separately later in this report. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 Issue: Application to entities established before 1 April 2000 Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) The attribution rule should only apply when the structure was put in place at the time of the 1 April 2000 introduction date of the 39% marginal tax rate. This is on the basis that the rule should target those arrangements that were put in place as a consequence of the 39% tax rate (with motivation being important). Comment A number of taxpayers have had arrangements which they could use to avoid the 39% (or even the 33%) tax rate in place for a long time. A number of other taxpayers are reported to have entered into arrangements more recently in express contemplation of the 39% tax rate. Given the objective nature of the rule, there is no reason that it needs to be targeted solely at arrangements put in place around 1 April 2000. Rather, it should apply to all arrangements where the effect (regardless of motivation) is to divert or alienate income that is derived by the personal services provider. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 119 SCOPE OF THE ATTRIBUTION RULE Issue: Proposed threshold Submission (12 – ICANZ) The attribution rule should only apply where the income of the personal services provider exceeds $60,000 (as either monetary remuneration or fringe benefits). In the alternative, where the intermediary is a company, the attribution rule need not apply if the company income before any attribution is less than $60,000. It is suggested that the rule produces compliance problems and that such a limitation will reduce these problems. Comment The attribution rule, as drafted, will apply regardless of whether the personal service provider has income of greater or less than $60,000. Given that the stated intention of the rule is to buttress the 39% tax rate, officials can understand why it is suggested that it might apply only where the provider's income exceeds $60,000. Several issues, however, need to be considered. First, it seems that significant work may be involved in confirming that the personal services provider would not otherwise earn more than $60,000. To do this the attribution rule’s calculation would have to be applied to the intermediary(ies) associated with the personal services provider. Further complexity would be caused by the need to take into account fringe benefits received by the personal services provider. Second, is it appropriate to assume the intermediary(ies) accountant(s) has (have) sufficient knowledge of the personal service provider’s tax affairs? In most cases this should not be an issue, however. Third, although incidental, the attribution rule targets income splitting – for example, between spouses. There is no reason in principal for personal services providers deriving less than $60,000 from services to have opportunities to split income that are denied to those earning more than $60,000. The question is whether the complexities and compliance costs outweigh the gain. On balance, officials recommend the submission be accepted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 120 Issue: Exemption for legitimate business Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 6 – New Zealand Confederation of Commercial Fishermen, 7 – New Zealand Seafood Industry Council) The rule will apply to legitimate business entities that are not established to avoid tax, and therefore will add cost and complexity to their businesses and affect how they distribute their service income. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that such entities should have the ability to apply to Inland Revenue for an exemption from the rules. The onus would be on the entity to prove that it was carrying on a legitimate business, which could include the following: • New businesses building up capital for future investment – Such businesses could be forced to distribute income to the personal services provider, who would then reinvest this income back into the business. The amount of income available for reinvestment could be reduced if the individual was subject to the 39% marginal tax rate rather than the 33% company rate. • Businesses unable to pay out income to avoid the rules – The proposal may be severe on businesses which, owing to insufficient cashflow, cannot pay out income to avoid application of the rules. This could occur where a business incurs expenditure that is not immediately deductible, forcing such a business to be subject to the attribution rules when it is not engaged in tax avoidance. • Businesses with a history of providing services to unrelated clients. • Businesses that contract independently with a number of associated companies. The New Zealand Federation of Commercial Fishermen and the New Zealand Seafood Industry Council also submit that the attribution rule should be substituted with a test of whether the entity in question is carrying on a “legitimate business” or simply acting as a vehicle for an individual to avoid tax. Comment Although the rule is anti-avoidance in nature, it is true that it will apply to businesses that are genuine. This is necessary to ensure that it is properly targeted. The attribution rule is designed to apply in narrow circumstances where there is generally one stream of personal services income (perhaps as well as another, different, business), regardless of the taxpayer's reasons for setting the structure up. The rule is a “hard” rule which has limited targeted application and no discretion. This “no discretion” is an important feature. New Zealand tax practice is moving away from Inland Revenue discretions, which are expensive to administer and often cause anomalies. Further, they can leave the taxpayer uncertain. An advantage of the rule, as proposed, is its certainty. 121 It is also important to remember that, aside from imposing the 39% tax rate, the attribution rule does not inhibit the build-up of capital for future investment (aside from insisting that tax at 39% is paid where appropriate), nor does it require businesses to pay out cash in order to ensure the rule does not apply. This is because, while the amount attributed will usually be recorded as an expense for accounting purposes, it does not need to be paid out in cash. As was pointed out by PricewaterhouseCoopers in its verbal submission, however, where the personal services are an ancillary, but integral part of the provision of a product of the intermediary, it is inappropriate to apply the rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that where the personal services are an ancillary, but integral, part of the provision of a product, the attribution rule should not apply. Issue: Application only when a certain percentage of income is not appropriately distributed Submission (12 – ICANZ) The attribution rule should only apply to the extent the interposed entity does not distribute a certain percentage (say, 70 percent) of its annual earnings to the principal service provider. Comment The bill proposes a minimum threshold of $5,000 for amounts to be attributed. This is for compliance cost reasons. From a policy perspective, where the attribution rule applies, there is no reason the entire amount to be attributed should not be so attributed. Leaving 30 percent of the income in the intermediary could undo the intended effect of the attribution rule. For example: The intermediary’s net income from personal services is $90,000 and this is caused by one personal services provider. If 70 percent ($63,000) is paid to the provider by way of salary, the balance ($27,000) is subject to tax at 33% (or less). This negates the intent of the rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 122 Issue: Application to partnerships Submission (12 – ICANZ) Partnerships should be excluded from the attribution rule as all income is distributed to partners. This is on the basis that the present attribution rule overrides the present fair and reasonable partnership allocation rule. An example is provided as follows: “Assume a family partnership where the work in relation to the service business is structured so that one member actually provides the services while another provides all the administrative support to ensure that the business can operate. Further assume that to recognise the value of the inputs to the partnership, the partnership income is allocated 75/25% to the service provider and to the administrator. As the amount allocated to the administrator is not deductible to the partnership, the total partnership income will be attributed to the service provider even though the administrator is properly entitled to a 25% share.” Comment The application of the attribution rule to partnerships is intended to do little more than buttress the present partnership allocation rule. Specifically, the present partnership profit allocation rule requires profits to be allocated based, among other things, on inputs provided. The example provided by the submission raises a good point. Where the personal service provider and another person provide services to a partnership intermediary, the partnership income to be attributed should be apportioned between the provider and the other persons. This issue should not arise for intermediaries that are companies or trusts, because they can, and almost always will, pay the administrator a salary (so can a partnership, but it is more difficult). Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that a rule allowing for the contribution to a partnership by any person be provided. 123 Issue: Implications for non-residents Submission (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The implications of the attribution rule for non-resident entities contracting in New Zealand should be closely examined with the view to alleviating the double taxation of non-residents. Non-residents can generally claim a tax credit in their resident country for tax paid in New Zealand. However, as the attribution rules apply for the purposes of New Zealand taxation only, a non-resident intermediary may not be able to substantiate in its home country that tax has already been paid on the amount of income attributed under the attribution rule to the personal service provider. Therefore the non-resident may not be able to claim their full tax credits. Further, there appear to be issues with double tax treaties and the application of non-resident contractors withholding tax (NRCWT) and the attribution rule. Comment The issue with NRCWT is particularly valid. NRCWT applies only to non-residents. Accordingly, where both the intermediary and the personal services provider are non- resident, the rule should not apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 124 DERIVING 80 PERCENT OF INCOME FROM ONE SOURCE Issue: Amendment to the income measurement period Submission (12 – ICANZ) The attribution rule can only apply where 80 percent of the services income of the intermediary is from one source. This 80 percent is proposed to be measured on an income year basis. This submission proposes that the income year basis be modified “to allow compliance with any prior continuous 12 month period that includes at least six months of the current income year.” “For instance, that person may be contracting and intend to work on one contract for nine months during an income year. However, that person is not able to be contacted at the end of that time or the contract is extended, then the person would be subject to the attribution rule.” The submission is that if the person can show that they would not have been subject to the 80 percent rule for a continuous 12-month period, including six months of the earlier year, the attribution rule should not apply. Comment This submission also draws attention to the fact that the attribution rule may not apply merely where there was one change of service requirer. For example, suppose a personal service provider had, through her intermediary, contracted with computer company A for five years, and then, at the expiry of the five years, she decided, again through her intermediary, to contract with the completely independent computer company B. If the change takes place in the middle of a tax year the attribution rule will not apply for the year, whereas if it takes place at the beginning or end of a tax year it may easily apply. The point being made is that the timing of the application of the 80 percent of the services income of the intermediary condition is arbitrary. Although this is correct, it also has the merit of being simple to understand and apply. While more complicated variations could be used, it is our judgement that this complication will not yield a sufficient gain to make it worthwhile. The balance of the attribution rule ensures that it applies only to income generated by personal services, and there seems no reason why the personal services provider should not personally pay tax on that. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 125 Issue: Exemption where income is derived independently from associated companies Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Entities may in some cases independently contract with two or more companies that are associated with each other. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that the entity should be able to apply to the Commissioner for exemption from the attribution rules where it can show that the contracts are unrelated. In such cases where this can be proved, these contracts should be treated the same as if they were with unrelated companies (irrespective of the fact they are associated companies). Comment A similar case could also be made for independent contracts with one “employer”. New Zealand tax practice is moving away from Inland Revenue discretions, which are expensive to administer and often cause anomalies. This lack of discretion is a design feature which is part of the targeted application of the rule. Again, officials consider that, from a policy perspective the personal services provider should pay the tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Scope of the 80 percent rule Submission (17 – New Zealand Employers’ Federation) The proposed 80 percent income source rule only focuses on the proportion of income from various sources rather than the effort concerned. While an entity may derive more than 80 percent of its income from one source, it may only spend 40 percent of its time on this contract. The measurement base should be inputs, not outputs. Comment Inputs, (effort put in to the intermediary) are subjective, and in a number of cases they would not be measured. In contrast, outputs (monies earned by the intermediary) are considerably more objective and can be determined directly from the intermediary’s financial records. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 126 DOUBLE TAXATION ISSUES Issue: Implications for companies Submission (12 – ICANZ, 13W – Rudd, Watts and Stone, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 20 – KPMG) Care should be taken that to ensure that double taxation does not arise. The submissions comment that the bill does not provide any relief from double taxation for amounts subject to the attribution rule. ICANZ and PricewaterhouseCoopers suggest that relief could be granted via the Commissioner being given the power to exempt distributions from tax which had already been taxed under the attribution rules. KPMG suggests that the double tax issues that occur when the intermediary is a company be dealt with by providing two tax credits. Comment The amount attributed is expressly provided to be a deductible expense of the intermediary. Where this attribution is included as an expense in the financial statements it is exceedingly unlikely that there will be any double tax. Furthermore, where the intermediary is a partnership or (with one exception) a trust, there is no prospect of double taxation. This trust situation is addressed in the next submission. Double taxation can arise where the intermediary is a company and income is distributed as a dividend. There are two separate circumstances where this could happen: • first, where the income is distributed by way of dividend prior to it being realised that the attribution rule applies; or • second, where, for whatever reason, the accounting treatment of the amount attributed does not follow the taxation treatment (that is, the amount is not shown as an expense in the intermediary company). When double tax could arise, chances are that the company concerned will be a qualifying company and, therefore, it is less likely there will be double taxation. Also, officials note that offering relief may be complex. However, we are persuaded that relief from double tax is desirable. We recommend that, where the attribution rule applies, a credit be added to the imputation credit account, calculated at 33% of the amount attributed. This would allow for both: • any dividend from the income that was attributed to be imputed; and • a transfer to the personal service provider of any tax paid by the intermediary in respect of the amount attributed, at the effective dates it was paid. 127 The extra credit should be dated on 31 March of the income year in which the attribution was made. Several technical issues arise: • If the intermediary is a qualifying company, the credit could be used to shelter its income. However, this is of little concern because dividends from qualifying companies are either fully imputed or exempt. • If the financial statements are then “adjusted” to reflect an amount attributed (say, for the same or another year) there will need to be a reduction in the imputation credit account – again at the rate of 33% of the amount adjusted. This is because there is no need for the extra credit if the financial statements do not reflect the amount attributed as an increase in retained earnings available for dividend. This debit should be on 31 March of the income year for which the financial statements are adjusted. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that relief be offered by way of: • An extra imputation credit account credit dated 31 March of the year in which an amount is attributed, calculated at 33% of the amount attributed. • This credit to reverse if the financial statements are then adjusted to reflect an amount attributed, at the rate of 33% of the amount adjusted. This debit to be dated 31 March of the income year for which the financial statements are adjusted. Issue: Double tax of trusts Submission (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 20 – KPMG) These submissions were concerned about the potential double tax where trusts are intermediaries. ICANZ and KPMG suggested that sections DJ 19 and HH 3(1) should be amended to address this. Comment The submission identifies an important issue. The proposed solution may not be the appropriate one, however, because the problem seems generic to the Income Tax Act 1994. The attribution rule merely highlights existence of the problem. 128 The problem is that the Income Tax Act, because of the way it operates gross and net amounts, does not limit the aggregate amount of income on which the beneficiaries and trustees pay tax to the net income of the trust before distribution to the beneficiaries. Rather, the aggregate amount is limited to the gross income of the trust. The specific attribution problem should be addressed by a rule that applies where the attribution rule causes the trust to be in a net loss position. To the extent of that net loss, any amounts distributed as beneficiary income should be reduced, in proportions specified by the trustees. Failing specification, the reduction should be pro rata over all beneficiary income. This will ensure that there can be no double tax when trusts are intermediaries. Recommendation That the point of the submission be accepted, and future consideration be given to a generic change to the Income Tax Act 1994 to address the wider problem. 129 ASSETS Issue: Substantial assets Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) The substantial assets test should be broader than just depreciable assets. It should be expanded to include other property that is not depreciable property. Often an intermediary will have substantial capital tied up in the development of intangible property, such as plans, formulas, models and methodologies, that are not depreciable. Comment The provision (by sale or licence) of a product does not lead to income from personal services. We recommend, as a result of another submission, excluding from the scope of the attribution rule services that are ancillary to the provision of a product. This would seem to address the concern that arises in this submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Necessary part of the business structure Submission (12 – ICANZ) It should be clarified as to what is meant by “a necessary part of the business structure”. The submission then goes on to discuss assets subject to leases, including premises. Comment Where the tax law regards leases and hire purchases as transferring the ownership obligation to the lessee, officials agree that those assets qualify. This is also the subject of a separate specific submission. However, where the assets (including premises) are subject to an operating lease it is inappropriate to regard them as being assets required to operate the business – the lessee has no ownership interest in these assets and does not carry the ownership obligations. The intermediary is not using any capital to derive the income. 130 Recommendation That the specific submission be declined, but that the finance lease and hire purchase aspects of submission be dealt with separately. Issue: Premises Submission (12 – ICANZ) Where an intermediary leases premises independent from the service requirer the attribution rule should not apply. Comment The fact that the intermediary might operate from independent (presumably leased) premises does not, by itself, suggest that the attribution rule should not apply. The significant assets rule is designed to let out those businesses that use capital and can expect a return on it. No capital is involved in renting premises, in the same way as no capital is involved in being the lessee under an operating lease. Therefore officials consider there is no need to bring leased premises into the “substantial assets” test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Finance leases and hire purchase Submission (12 – ICANZ – 20 – KPMG) The “cost” of the asset should be extended to “cost, acquisition cost and lessees’ acquisition cost”. This is on the technical grounds that the use of “cost” implies that assets subject to financial lease or hire purchase agreement are not to be regarded as “substantial business assets”. Comment On economic terms, because the intermediary suffers the “ownership” risks, these assets should be included within the substantial assets test. The owners of the intermediary can rightly expect to derive a return on these assets. Thus, in our view, they should be included in the “substantial assets” test. 131 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Proportion of private use Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) There should be one threshold for both vehicles and other assets. This threshold should be “not acquired predominantly for private purposes” (or “acquired principally for business purposes”). The point is made that test is going to be performed at the end of the taxpayer’s income year and that more certainty is required. Also, ICANZ suggested that upon IRD audit there might be discussion as to “the practicalities of the situation, the scheme and purpose of the Act and whether care and management provisions should be applied to allow the Commissioner to overlook the transgression”. The suggestion is that rather than an arbitrary fixed threshold, it should be worded in such a way to encourage the rule to achieve its purpose without giving rise to unnecessary compliance costs. In the alternative, ICANZ suggests the proposed 20 percent motor vehicle test should be adopted for all assets. The bill requires that these other assets not be used at all for private use or enjoyment. The point is made there is frequently some private use of things like computers and cell phones and tradesmen’s tools. Comment The care and management provisions would have no relevance to an audit discussion of the application of the attribution rule’s substantial assets test. Any threshold is arbitrary. The 80 percent threshold for motor vehicles recognises that the vehicles may have some aspect of private running, but ensures that their predominant use is substantially business. Officials consider it appropriate to reduce the threshold for assets other than vehicles to the same threshold as vehicles. There is no compelling reason to treat vehicles differently from other business assets. This allows for incidental private use. If this use was measured using the Income Tax Act’s present fringe benefit tax and private use apportionment requirements there would be no additional compliance costs as these calculations have to be done anyway. In our view, it is not appropriate to apply an “at acquisition” test as actual use could, and frequently will change over time. In any case, adopting the FBT or private use approach does not add any extra compliance costs. 132 Recommendation That the first submission regarding “principal use” be declined, but that the alternative submission concerning one 20 percent or less private use test for all assets be accepted, to be based on present taxation apportionment. Issue: Quantum of depreciable assets Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) The gross figure of $75,000 of depreciable assets should be reduced to $50,000. The figure is arbitrary and there will always be boundary issues: ICANZ notes that “it is very difficult to set an exact figure as to the value of equipment that separates a self- employed person from an employee. However, on the context of this provision and considering the types of people the rule is seeking to exclude a figure of $50,000 is more appropriate.” Comment The amount used must be large enough to justify an economic return on the assets. In this context, it can be agreed that both $75,000 and $50,000 are arbitrary. However, the arguments raised do not, by themselves, justify reducing it to $50,000. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: The 25 percent rule Submission (20 – KPMG) The exclusion when assets cost at least 25 percent of gross services income should not be retained because its application is uncertain. This is because the income is not known until year end. Comment Officials agree that there will be some uncertainty generated by this rule. It is designed to exclude from the attribution rule businesses that require in comparison to their income, significant assets. Our judgement is that the advantages of this exclusion outweigh the uncertainty it will create. 133 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Choice of methods of calculating private proportion of vehicle usage Submission (12 – ICANZ) The bill proposes that the private proportion of motor vehicle usage for the significant asset test be either: • based on the days of private use for fringe benefit purpose compared with total potential availability; or • based on the amount of expenditure on the vehicle that is non deductible compared with total expenditure. It should be clarified as to which method is used when. Comment Officials agree the legislation should make it clear that, where the asset is subject to the fringe benefit tax rules, apportionment is to be done using those rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 134 ASSOCIATED PERSONS, RELATION TESTS Issue: Associated persons Submission (12 – ICANZ) The personal services provider is unlikely to have sufficient information to apply the detailed associated persons rule to consider whether the personal service requirers are associated. Comment The associated persons test that determines the relationship between personal services requirers should be removed, or at least, made simpler. The bill proposes the one associated persons rule for all purposes. This submission is valid in circumstances where the personal services provider cannot be expected to be aware of the association of personal service requirers. Recommendation That the associated persons rule, which associates personal services requirers, not apply where it would not be reasonable for the personal services provider to know about the association, other than by having made specific enquiry. Issue: Related persons test Submission (12 – ICANZ) The phrase “a relative of person” should be removed from the test which considers whether the service of income of the intermediary is derived through the effort of one person and his/her relatives. The result is that if a person operates a services business though an interposed entity together with an unrelated person the attribution rule may not apply. However, if that person operates the same services business with the relative, the attribution rule could apply. This would result in taxing family service businesses differently from other businesses. This is contrary to the separate treatment of spouses under the New Zealand tax law. Comment New Zealand tax law explicitly considers the position of spouses in income splitting arrangements – there are specific rules concerning wages paid to spouses. Also, there are detailed tax rules concerning matrimonial property splits. 135 When the attribution rule was being developed it was suggested during consultation that care should be taken to ensure that the rule’s application could not be defeated merely by the insertion of a relative into the intermediary. This is necessary from an anti-avoidance perspective. However, following discussions with Therese Turner, officials agree that the relative test proposed is too wide. The standard relative test brings in relation to the fourth degree. This test will work appropriately with relations to the second degree. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the relationship test be limited to that of second degree. Issue: Clarification that government departments are not deemed to be associated sources of income Submission (14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is uncertainty about whether government departments are deemed to be associated by their relationship with the Crown for the purpose of the 80 percent of income from one source rule. If government departments were deemed to be associated, entities with multi-departmental contracts would be caught. Therefore express clarification is needed that government departments are not associated for the purpose of the attribution rules. Comment Officials agree that government agencies should not treated as being associated for the purposes of the attribution rule merely because of their connection with the Crown. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 136 MECHANICAL CALCULATIONS Issue: Calculation of interposed income Submission (12 – ICANZ) If an intermediary has income other than income from services, the net amount of income from services should be clearly identified. The bill can be read to suggest that all of the intermediary’s income is treated by the rule as if were income derived from services only. Comment Officials agree that clarification would be helpful. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Apportionment of expenses Submission (12 – ICANZ) Rules should be included to apportion the expenses of the intermediary in circumstances where the intermediary has other income, so that the net income from services can be correctly calculated. Comment During the policy development process it was envisaged that, aside from the express apportionment rule provided in sub-section GC 14C(3), and the allocation of “head office” expenses to the income from services, the usual apportionment rules apply. In this respect, the direct expenses associated with deriving the services income and the other income of the intermediary would be so allocated and indirect expenses would be apportioned. While it is not the place of the Income Tax Act to provide these detailed rules, this apportionment should be expressly discussed in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the attribution rule. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the matter be expressly addressed in the Tax Information Bulletin item on the attribution rule. 137 Issue: Concessionary expense allocation rules Submission (12 – ICANZ) The rule that apportions remuneration provided by the intermediary to the personal service provider should be deleted. Comment It appears that this submission is underpinned by the lack of clarity referred to in the submission on the calculation of interposed income, above. Officials believe this rule will be to the benefit of taxpayers. It means that all remuneration paid by the intermediary to the personal services provider will be regarded as being paid in respect of the intermediary’s personal services income. Where not all of the intermediary’s income is in respect of services performed by the personal services provider, apportionment of the remuneration paid as salary is, therefore, not necessary. The uncertainty arises because of the lack of clarity of the intermediary’s “net income from services”. As noted above, we agree this needs further elaboration. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but, as recommended above, the underlying lack of clarity be addressed. Issue: Quantifying the value of services Submission (21W – Denham Martin) Clarification is needed in relation to the 80 percent threshold tests in sections GC 14B(2) and GC 14C(6) regarding how to quantify services where these are performed by more than one person. This allocation could be made based on either the amount of time each person takes in performing the services multiplied by what that person makes, or by the amount of time multiplied by their charge-out rate. The threshold tests can be argued to be “but for” tests. That is, a single person could be responsible for securing all the contracts, but not for performing the work, which would be undertaken by others. The single person would thus be responsible for the income being derived. 138 Comment The use of the words “gross income from services” indicates clearly that it is income that is relevant, not costs or inputs. We doubt the words proposed “services personally performed” can actually be construed as a “but for” test. This is because of the explicit reference to “services personally performed” in the second 80 percent test. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: More than one related personal service provider Submission (21W – Denham Martin) Provision should be made where two (or more) related personal services providers are affected by the attribution rule. Comment This is expressly addressed in the proposed legislation where any amount to be attributed is divided between the service providers depending on their contribution. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 139 OTHER ISSUES Issue: Transfer and utilisation of losses Submission (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Losses transferred from other entities and losses brought forward from earlier years should be able to be utilised against the intermediary’s personal services income, before the attribution rule applies to the reduced net amount. If the other activities of the intermediary cause it to have a loss in any one year, that loss will not be offset against the services income of that intermediary in a future year. The submissions request that all losses (both brought forward and offset from other corporate taxpayers) should be able to be offset against intermediary’s income that would otherwise be attributed. Comment The overall intent of the rule is to attribute that net services income to the service provider. Given this policy intent, it could reasonably be argued that even if the intermediary has other current year losses that do not exceed the amount of the intermediary’s services income, those losses should not be offset against that income before attribution. As a practical measure (and to recognise that in a significant number of cases the losses can be utilised anyway by way of the loss attributing qualifying company rules), the Government agreed that the current year losses of other activities of the intermediary should be allowed as an offset to the intermediary’s services income, to the extent of that income. The submission asks that this be extended to losses transferred from other entities and to losses brought forward. PricewaterhouseCoopers has, during discussions, suggested that where the loss arises from a business of which the personal services income is a part, it should be available for offset. For example, a computer person causes his or her intermediary to derive income from personal services and the intermediary is also developing, say, a website application. The PricewaterhouseCoopers “one business” suggestion assumes that the personal services income relates to a wider business activity of the intermediary, that of developing the web application. Another analogy is that of a farmer who also provides farm advisory services. Except where the personal services are an ancillary, but integral, part of providing product, the “one business” agreement does not hold. This is because there is clearly more than one activity taking place: on one hand, that of providing personal services (mainly to one service requirer) and, on the other hand, the sale or licencing (using the PricewaterhouseCoopers’ example) of a computer-based product. 140 In this case, the provision of the personal services of the sort to which the attribution rule applies is unlikely to cause a problem with losses to carry forward as it is generally unlikely that a loss can be generated from the provision of personal services. We do not believe that the rules need to be generally relaxed further in this respect. Taxpayers have ordered their affairs to allow, amongst a host of other things, their income from personal services to offset current year losses of their intermediary. Wage earners who are subject to the 39% tax rate do not readily have this choice. However, where an intermediary which supplies personal services is going through a start up process it could generate losses. If all of the future income of the intermediary is subject to the attribution rule, these losses may not be utilisable. Therefore we suggest that where: • the intermediary is a company or a trust; and • the only business or trading income of the intermediary is from the provision of personal services; it should be able to carry any loss forward to the next year and use it to reduce any amount to be attributed. Recommendation That the submission be declined, except that where the intermediary is a company or a trust that has had no other business or trading activity, it be allowed to utilise losses brought forward. Issue: Attribution of provisional tax Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) If income is attributed to a personal service provider, any provisional tax paid by the intermediary in respect of the attributed income should also be attributed to the personal service provider. This is because it might be very difficult at the beginning of a year to confirm whether the attribution rule applies or not. If taxpayers do not correctly judge whether the rule will or will not apply to them they could be exposed to use-of-money interest. In the alternative, relief should be provided from penalties/use-of-money interest to the extent that either the intermediary or the personal service provider had paid tax. 141 Comment As previously suggested, officials believe the attribution rule will only apply infrequently because the amount otherwise to be attributed will be paid out to the personal service provider by way of salary. Furthermore, in most cases where it could apply, its application will be clear-cut. However, the rule does have hard boundaries that could cause taxpayers to unexpectedly be subject to the rule. So long as appropriate care is taken administratively to ensure there is no problem with overdrawn imputation credit accounts where the intermediary is a company, the submission should be accepted. The principle of such transfers is already embodied in section MB 9, which deals with transfers of tax between wholly-owned group companies. It also seems appropriate that the transfer should be allowed where the attribution rules would have applied had a salary, from which tax deductions were not required to be made, not been paid. Recommendation That this submission be accepted and extended as suggested. Issue: Source deduction Submission (Matter raised by officials) It needs to be made clear that amounts attributed are not subject to source deduction (such as PAYE) by the intermediary. Comment Amounts attributed cannot be determined until after year end. Therefore, it cannot be expected that intermediaries that are companies or trusts should have to deduct PAYE or other withholding taxes. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 142 Issue: Alignment with new fringe benefit tax rules Submission (12 – ICANZ) The definition of “cash remuneration” that drives the fringe benefit tax rule in the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill should be amended to include “amounts distributed in accordance with section GC 14C”. This is on the basis that the attribution rule could be used to avoid the 64% (or presumably even the 49%) rate of FBT being applied in the circumstances where it clearly should. Comment The point this submission makes is good. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Clarification of the relevant income year Submission (12 – ICANZ) The relevant income year should be clarified. The submission discussed issues concerning the income flowing from the personal service requirer to the intermediary and the income flowing from the intermediary to the personal service provider. Comment The issue concerning income years as between the service requirer and the intermediary is irrelevant. What is relevant is how much income in personal services is derived by the intermediary in an income year and the attribution of that income to the service provider in the same income year. The proposed legislation can be enhanced to make this clearer. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 143 Issue: Clarification of dates for association, etc. Submission (12 – ICANZ, 13W – Rudd, Watts and Stone) At the moment the date of application of the two associated person tests, the relative test and the substantial business assets test are not specified. They should be. Comment Officials agree that some specification is advisable. Recommendation That: • the associated persons tests apply at the time the services are provided; • the relatives test apply at the beginning of the year; • the dollar tests in the substantial assets test apply at balance date for simplicity of compliance. Issue: Alignment of return filing dates Submission (12 – ICANZ, 20 – KPMG) The return filing dates of the intermediary and the personal services provider should be aligned if one of the parties had an earlier filing date than the other. Comment In the majority of circumstances both the intermediary and the personal services provider will be on tax agents’ client lists and will, therefore, automatically be entitled to extension of time of arrangements. However, this submission can and should be accepted by Inland Revenue’s administration to ensure tax return filing alignment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted by Inland Revenue. 144 Issue: Multiple intermediaries Submission (21W – Denham Martin) The opportunity to avoid the attribution rule by using multiple intermediaries should be closed. Comment Officials believe that no such opportunity exists because provision is made to deal with multiple intermediaries where there is one service provider. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 145 MISCELLANEOUS ISSUES Issue: Numbering of sections Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed new section CD 8 should be section CD 7, as there is no current CD 7. Comment This is obviously an oversight. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Use of the term “personal services” Submission (21W – Denham Martin) The bill uses the term “services” when the provisions are intended to apply only to income from “personal services”. Therefore the term “personal services” should be used throughout the bill to ensure it applies as intended. Furthermore, the term “personal services” should be defined in the bill. Comment The term “personal services” should be used as appropriate. Because any definition will introduce doubt about that definition’s boundary, officials believe the term is better left undefined. Recommendation That the submission regarding the use of the term “personal services” be accepted, but that it not be defined. 146 Issue: Nil amounts to be attributed Submission (12 – ICANZ) The attribution rule currently does not apply if the calculation of the amount to be attributed results in a negative number. This is circular. In these circumstances the amount to be attributed should be nil, rather than stating that this section does not apply. Comment Officials consider that adopting this suggestion will add to the clarity of the rule. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Terminology Submission (12 – ICANZ) The phrase “deductible expense” used in the proposed sub section GC 14C(3) should be replaced with the term “allowable deduction”. Comment The use of “allowable deductions” is consistent within the core provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994. However, the objective is not to cause the salary to be deductible, but to apportion the deductible amount. The usual deductibility tests still have to be met. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the sub section be re-examined to see if it can be clarified. Issue: Location of definitions Submission (12 – ICANZ) The definitions for the attribution rule should be in section OB 1. 147 Comment Because the definition is specific to the attribution rule it is not appropriate to relocate it as submitted. However, a cross reference from section OB 1 is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that section OB 1 cross reference the definition. Other policy changes 151 GROUP INVESTMENT FUND MANAGEMENT FEES Submissions (15W – Trustee Corporations Association of New Zealand) A number of minor amendments, already discussed with officials, should be made to ensure that technical issues affecting group investment funds (GIFs) are adequately dealt with. Individual issues are: Issue 1 The deduction provision should be elective. Issue 2The amendment should ensure that management fees paid by GIFs on behalf of investors are not treated as income in investors’ hands. Issue 3The kinds of fees to which the amendment applies should be expanded. Comment Section 32 of the Trustee Companies Act 1967 prohibits the charging of management fees by GIFs. To get around this, GIFs pay management fees on behalf of the investors. The policy intention of the amendment is that, despite the prohibition, a deduction should be allowed for tax purposes to GIFs for management fees paid on behalf of investors. Issue 1 One (and possibly, for a period, two) trustee companies have not been deducting management fees at the GIF level. The suggested change will ensure that those companies are not required to depart from their existing practice. Issue 2 The policy intention of the amendment is that GIFs are treated as if the management fees are paid on their own behalf. It would not be consistent with that policy for any portion of the management fee to be treated as income in the investors’ hands. The suggested change will ensure that this does not occur. Issue 3 Section 32 of the Trustees Act refers to “ a charge for management ... commission or other recompense or remuneration”. The suggested change will ensure that a deduction is allowed in all circumstances contemplated by section 32. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 152 DEDUCTIONS FOR 1998-1999 ACCIDENT INSURANCE BASE PREMIUMS Issue: Year in which ACC base premiums are payable Submission (12 – ICANZ) The Income Tax Act 1994 should specifically allow a deduction in the year in which the due date (as specified in an invoice supplied by ACC) falls. Comment The policy intention of the legislative amendment is to allow a deduction on a “discount date” where a base premium is paid by that date. ICANZ’s concern is that some employers negotiated a new due date for payment which may fall before the discount date. Those employers could be disadvantaged if the deduction was to be allowed on the discount date. Officials agree that this issue needs to be addressed. However, samples of invoices provided to Inland Revenue by ACC include both a discount date and a date by when payment is due. Accordingly, ICANZ’s submission would not solve the difficulty in all cases. Recommendation That the substance of the submission be accepted, but that the deduction be allowed on the discount date if: • payment is made on or before the discount date; and • the discount date is before the date on which the amount is shown as due on the invoice. The definition of “due date” would be omitted. 153 GIFTS OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposed rules which deem financial arrangements which have been transferred for nil or inadequate consideration to have been transferred at market value should clearly provide that the transferee acquires the financial arrangement at market value. Comment The policy intent of the amendment is that when a financial arrangement is transferred for nil or inadequate consideration, the financial arrangement should be deemed to be sold by the transferor, and acquired by the transferee, for market value. Acquisition by the transferee at market value ensures that when the base price adjustment is performed for the transferee at the time the transferee ultimately comes to dispose of the financial arrangement, it will not result in double taxation of the difference between the market price and the actual consideration paid. Officials consider that this policy intent is achieved by the proposed new sections EH 16(5) and EH 49(2A), which provide that where the market price of a financial arrangement is treated as being the consideration on sale, this applies for both seller and purchaser or transferor and transferee. The submission acknowledges these provisions but is concerned that the operative sections EH 16(3) and EH 49(1) refer only to a financial arrangement that is sold or transferred and realised. The sections do not make it clear that they also apply to the party acquiring the financial arrangement. Officials consider that the policy intent can be made clearer by adding a reference in the proposed sections EH 16(3) and EH 49(1) to the purchase of the financial arrangement by the transferee. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 154 FOREIGN TAX CREDITS Issue: Prevention of abuse of foreign tax credit rules Submission (3 – Michael Scott) The proposed amendments to deny a credit for foreign tax when, in substance, the tax has not been paid are unnecessary and should not proceed. If, however, they do proceed, their application date should be retrospective. Comment The anti-avoidance measures to prevent the abuse of foreign tax credits were first included in the Taxation Reform (Companies and Other Matters) Bill, introduced on 2 June 1994. The tax credit measures were divided from the bill to form the separate Income Tax Amendment Bill 1994. Consideration of the provisions was deferred by the Finance and Expenditure Committee until the Commission of Inquiry into Certain Matters Relating to Taxation (commonly referred to as the “wine-box inquiry”) had reported. The bill remains under consideration. The original provisions have been redrafted and included in the current bill. In the 1994 bill, the amendments were to apply from 2 June 1994. Under the current bill, they will apply only from 5 April 2000, the date they were announced by the Minister of Revenue. This later application date avoids the need to make complicated retrospective amendments to the now repealed Income Tax Act 1976. The bill proposes that a foreign tax credit be denied when a corresponding benefit is provided to a taxpayer or associate and requires disclosure of this. It also proposes for countries for which no tax credits are allowed to be determined by Order in Council rather than amending legislation. The bill also puts beyond doubt that a tax avoidance arrangement involving foreign tax credits is void under the general anti-avoidance provisions and can be reconstructed under the Income Tax Act. The submission suggests that amendments to deny a credit for foreign tax are unnecessary. Although, as noted in the Commentary to the bill, it was always the Government’s view that current anti-avoidance provisions would apply to tax avoidance schemes, the bill goes beyond this. The amendments are modelled on provisions in the United States Tax Code that the United States considered necessary to reverse the result of a number of United States court decisions. Such legislation also seems desirable for New Zealand. 155 This issue of whether a tax avoidance arrangement involving foreign tax credits is void and can be reconstructed under the Income Tax Act has not been determined by our courts. Given this, it seems useful that the amendments proceed to ensure there is no ambiguity in the application of the Act. Progressing the amendments is also consistent with the recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry that it remains desirable for the foreign tax credit anti-avoidance measures to be enacted. The submission suggests that if the amendments to deny a foreign tax credit do proceed, they should still apply retrospectively, rather than from 5 April 2000 as currently provided in the bill. The submitter’s concern is that non-retrospectivity may prejudice the Commissioner’s ability to apply the existing anti-avoidance provisions to any tax credit abuse pre-dating the application date of the amendment. Officials do not consider this would be the case. The Privy Council in CIR v Databank Systems Limited (1990) 12 NZTC 7,227 has held that a subsequent amendment to a provision being interpreted by the court cannot be used as an argument in interpreting the provision before its amendment. Officials are not aware of any transaction that would be covered by retrospective legislation, but cannot guarantee that this is the case. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Drafting issues in rules to prevent abuse of foreign tax credit Submission (12 – ICANZ) A number of minor drafting amendments are proposed to the rules to prevent the abuse of foreign tax credits: Comment The submission contains seven pages of suggested minor drafting changes. The submission suggests that section LC 3(1)(a)(i) should state the sections under which a foreign tax credit arises, consistent with the reference to the section under which the amount of dividend withholding payment on a foreign dividend is calculated. Officials agree with this submission. The submission also suggests that, in a couple of places in section LC 1, commas be replaced with parentheses to aid readability. Officials note that the use of parentheses is determined by drafting style – they are used to enclose explanations and digressions, not to enhance readability. On review, however, officials agree that parentheses could be used in section LC 1(3A), as suggested in the submission, but not in section LC 1(3B). 156 A number of suggestions were made that are inconsistent with the current drafting style for tax bills: • Clarification is needed that “this section” in section GB 1(2A) refers to section GB 1, and not to another section referred to in the subsection. • The words “credit of tax” should be included in quote marks in section GB 1(2B), as it is a defined term. • In section LC 13(2), “their” should be changed to “the taxpayer’s”. • In section LC 3(1), references to “that subsection” should be changed to “section LC 1(3A)” for clarity. • In section LC 3, it should be made explicit that: -Subsection (2) is subject to subsection (3) and applies to amounts calculated under subsection (1); and -Subsection (3) does not apply to itself. • In section LC 1A(2), “31 December in the year following” should be changed to “31 December of the subsequent year”. Similarly “following year” should be changed to “that subsequent year”. • In section LC 1A(3), a cross-reference should be added to state that the Order in Council referred to is “made under subsection (1)(a). The submission also suggested that there were a number of places where technical amendment is required to make the legislation operate correctly. Officials consider, however, that the legislation does operate correctly, and that changes are not necessary. A brief summary of the submission’s points, and officials’ views, are set out below. 1.References in the amendments to section LC 4 should also refer to section LC 5, as the rules for group companies complement the ordinary rules for controlled foreign company tax credits. Section LC 5 can only apply to the extent that a credit arises under section LC 4. If a credit is denied under section LC 4, as the amendment effects, section LC 5 will have no relevance, hence an additional cross-reference would be unnecessary. 2.Section LC 1(3A) requires clarification that a credit for foreign tax will be denied only to the extent it is effectively refunded. The subsection already has this effect. It reads, “if and to the extent that a taxpayer ... pays foreign tax, and the taxpayer ... receives a refund, ... the taxpayer is not allowed a credit for income tax paid in a country or territory outside New Zealand against income tax payable in New Zealand” (emphasis added). 3.References in the amendments to section LC 1(3A) should also refer to section LC 1(3B), as they operate in tandem. 157 Section LC 1(3A) deals with the substantive question of whether a credit for foreign tax should be denied. Section LC 1(3B) deals only with the consequences if section LC 1(3A) applies. Consequently, it is unnecessary to also cross-reference section LC 1(3B) when references to section LC 1(3A) are made. 4.The heading in the new section LC 1A(1) should be in bold face. There is no heading in a subsection to be bold faced. Recommendation That section LC 3(1)(a)(i) be amended to state the sections under which a foreign tax credit arises, and that section LC 1(3A) be amended to replace commas with parentheses as suggested in the submission, but that the remainder of the submission be declined. 158 TAX SIMPLIFICATION FOR WAGE AND SALARY EARNERS Issue: Amendments to the income statement process Submission 1 (12 – ICANZ) The amendment should be described as making the return filing period for income statements consistent with other returns by agents. Comment The amendment extends the time that tax agents have to return income statements. Such extensions exist for income tax returns prepared by agents. Once the amendment is enacted, Inland Revenue will explain the measure in its Tax Information Bulletin. The proposal can be described in the manner suggested in that publication. The description to which the submission objects does not appear in the bill, but in the commentary on the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission 2 (12 – ICANZ) The term “income statement” should be defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 and the term “personal tax summary” should be defined in the same section as having the same meaning as “income statement”. Comment Income statements are provided to taxpayers to confirm the amount of income earned and the amount of tax paid in respect of that income. “Income statement” is defined in the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the purposes of that act. Although in practice the income statement is referred to as a personal tax summary, it retains its original title in the legislation, and the term “personal tax summary” is not used. ICANZ points out that having two names for this document causes confusion. Officials consider that it would be inappropriate to define a term that is not used in the legislation. The issue identified in the submission would be better addressed by replacing every incidence of the term “income statement” with the term “personal tax summary”. However, given that “income statement” is used frequently in the legislation, this would necessitate a large number of legislative amendments and would, therefore, be more appropriately undertaken as part of a post-implementation review once the reforms have been fully implemented. 159 The term “income statement” is used in the Income Tax Act, and officials agree that “income statement” should be defined in that act. Recommendation That: • an amendment be made to define “income statement” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994; • the submission that the definition of “income statement” include a reference to the term “personal tax summary” be declined; and • officials be asked to consider this matter as part of the post-implementation review of the tax simplification reforms for wage and salary earners. Submission 3 (12 – ICANZ) ICANZ agrees with the proposal and suggests that the legislation could be drafted in a simpler manner. Comment The submission supports the proposal and suggests that the concept of terminal tax date be used in the new subsections of section 80H to draft them more simply. It would not be a simplification to use the phrase “terminal tax date” because that date does not apply to wage and salary earners, who instead have a due date for the payment of tax. However, it is possible to make a number of minor drafting changes that would render the provision easier to read. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and that minor drafting amendments be made to clauses 50, 51, 53 and 54 to simplify their construction. Issue: Increasing the flexibility of the rebate claim process Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made to allow rebates for childcare and housekeeper expenses or donations to be claimed late in specified circumstances. 160 Comment A new process to claim rebates for donations and payments for housekeeping or childcare expenditure was introduced as part of the reforms that removed the need to for wage and salary taxpayers to file income tax returns. Under the new process, taxpayers with standard or early balance dates must claim their rebates between 1 April and 30 September after the end of the income year in which the donation or payment was made. The bill contains an amendment to section 41A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 that allows rebates to be claimed early in circumstances where it would cause difficulties to delay making a claim until the claim period begins. Some taxpayers will face similar difficulties in meeting the deadline for claiming their rebate. Such circumstances include being out of the country during the period in which rebates should be claimed. The suggested amendment ensures that these taxpayers will not be disadvantaged and increases the flexibility of the new rebate claim process. To ensure consistency with other provisions that support that process, this change should apply from the implementation of that new procedure, 1 April 2000. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Submission (Matter raised by officials) An amendment should be made so that the provisions that require taxpayers to provide Inland Revenue with receipts evidencing that donations do not apply to rebate claims made by tax agents on behalf of their clients. Comment The law requires anyone claiming a rebate for a donation to provide receipt evidence of the payment to Inland Revenue. This also applies to tax agents who claim rebates on behalf of their clients. Officials consider that exempting tax agents from this requirement would reduce the compliance costs. In order to prevent false claims, agents would, however, be required to sight the receipts before a claim is made, and the receipts would need to be retained by taxpayers for audit purposes. To ensure consistency with the new rebate claim process, this change should apply from 1 April 2000, when the process was implemented. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 161 Submission (12 – ICANZ) The deadline for claiming rebates should be extended to 31 March following the end of the income year to which the rebate relates. Comment ICANZ made the same submission last year to the Finance and Expenditure Committee as part of the committee’s deliberations over the Taxation (Simplification and Other Remedial Matters) Bill. Officials consider that, except in special cases, six months should be adequate to claim a rebate, given the simplicity of the new process. Difficulties caused by special circumstances are best addressed by allowing exceptions to the deadline, rather than extending the deadline in all cases. Officials also consider that extending the deadline to claim rebates to 31 March following the end of the year to which the rebate relates has the potential to reduce some of the benefits of the new process by separating it from the process of preparing income tax returns. ICANZ has also expressed concern that Inland Revenue staff have stated that taxpayers will be able to claim rebates immediately after they incur the expenditure or make the donation. Such a statement would be completely contradictory to all statements of government policy and publicity material from Inland Revenue about the new rebate claim process. Officials also consider that any confusion the statements may have caused about the earliest time in which rebates can be claimed would not be addressed by extending the deadline for claiming them. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Income statements and student loan borrowers Submission (Matter raised by officials) The criteria for issuing income statements should be amended to reflect that student loan borrowers who are eligible to receive base interest write-offs should be issued with an income statement. Comment Section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that all student loan borrowers who earn less than the student loan repayment threshold are to receive an income statement. This is an attempt to ensure that all those who are eligible for a base interest write-off have their tax affairs squared-up so that they can receive their write- off. However, officials recognise that some borrowers who earn less than the 162 threshold are not eligible for a base interest write-off and, therefore, do not require a square-up of their tax affairs. Officials also note that a small number of taxpayers who earn over the threshold may be eligible for a partial base interest write-off but are not currently required to receive an income statement. Likewise, borrowers who pay off their loan during an income year and have a nil balance at the year end may also be eligible for a base interest write-off. Therefore officials consider that section 33A(1) should be amended to specify those borrowers who require a square-up in order to receive a full or partial base interest write-off. To ensure consistency in the legislation, this amendment should apply from the date of application of the tax simplification initiatives, the 1999-2000 income year. Recommendation That an amendment be made to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 so that student loan borrowers who meet all other non-filing criteria are not required to receive an income statement unless they are eligible for a base interest write-off. Issue: Income statements for casual agricultural employees Submission (Matter raised by officials) A reference to the casual agricultural employee, CAE, tax code should be added to the provisions that determine which taxpayers are to be issued with an income statement. Comment As part of the simplification initiatives, a new tax code for casual agricultural employees was created. This tax code replaced the shearing shed hand (SSH), casual agricultural worker (CAW) and shearer (SHR) tax codes and has a rate of 21%. It was intended that taxpayers who use this code in certain circumstances should receive an income statement. For example, if a taxpayer earns over $38,000 in an income year and uses the CAE code the taxpayer should receive an income statement to ensure that the correct amount of tax has been deducted. Because of a drafting omission this code was not referred to in section 33A(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. To correct this omission officials consider that a reference to the CAE tax code should be added to the Tax Administration Act 1994 so that taxpayers who earn over $200 of income using the CAE code are issued with an income statement. 163 Recommendation That an amendment to section 33A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be made to include a reference to the CAE tax code, and that the amendment apply from 1 April 1999, to be consistent with the introduction of the simplification legislation. 164 RWT ON INTEREST PAID BY INLAND REVENUE Submission (12 – ICANZ) The legislation should be amended so that Inland Revenue is not required to deduct resident withholding (RWT) tax on interest paid by it. Should the first suggestion not be accepted, ICANZ supports the proposal. Comment Officials do not consider that exempting Inland Revenue in this way from deducting RWT would solve the underlying concern in the submission about the inherent complexity of administering use-of-money interest. As the submission points out, Inland Revenue makes a large number of interest payments and consequential adjustments on those payments, and frequently these are retrospective adjustments. The complexities arise from the need to determine accurately the amount of interest income earned. Therefore that complexity would not diminish unless Inland Revenue were also exempt from providing taxpayers with information about the interest they have earned. The effort required to deduct RWT is relatively minor once interest income has been quantified. The simplification reforms that removed the need for wage and salary earners to file income tax returns rely on the application of the RWT rules by those who pay interest. Exempting Inland Revenue from the rules would create a group of taxpayers who do not pay the correct amount of tax on their interest as they earn it. As well as creating an inequity between different sources of interest, this would also create an obligation for some taxpayers to complete and return income tax returns where they would otherwise not have been required to do so. Inland Revenue has allocated significant resources to modify its systems so that the RWT rules are applied correctly. Recommendation That the recommendation be declined. Issue: Application of the RWT rules Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed amendment to the RWT rules can be improved by changing the wording. 165 Comment In general, when a taxpayer overpays an amount of tax, that taxpayer is eligible to receive use-of-money interest. According to the RWT rules, payments of use-of- money interest must have RWT deducted. If the amount of overpaid tax is recalculated, the amount of interest the taxpayer is to receive and the amount of RWT to be deducted must be recalculated. The proposed amendment attempts to clarify the process that Inland Revenue should follow when recalculating RWT to be deducted from updated payments of interest. Officials consider that this amendment can be improved by making a minor change to the wording and inserting an explicit reference to RWT that is to be deducted. Recommendation That a change be made to the proposed amendment to clarify how the RWT rules apply if interest paid to a taxpayer relates to an amount of overpaid tax that has been recalculated. 166 INCOME TAX RATES Submission (12 – ICANZ) The submission raises concerns about the compliance costs and administrative costs of the implementation of policy proposals to support or buttress the increase in the top personal tax rate to 39%. Comment The Government’s revenue strategy, as announced in this year’s Budget, is “to generate the Government’s revenue requirements at least possible economic cost, whilst supporting the Government’s equity objectives.” The increase in the top personal tax rate was to generate additional revenue to meet the Government’s social policy commitments. The Government is aware that the policy proposals to support the tax rate increase have compliance and administrative costs and has been mindful that these costs should be kept to a minimum. 167 INCREMENTAL PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT OF TAX Issue: Application date Submission (12 – ICANZ) The application date should be brought forward to apply to tax payments due on or after 1 April 2001. Comment The proposal, as currently drafted, will apply from 1 April 2001. This means that payments that are due after this date but have not been made within a month of the due date will incur the reduced penalty. For example, if terminal tax that is due on 7 April 2001 has not been paid by 7 May 2001, the incremental penalty will be applied at 1% rather than 2% of the outstanding amount. Officials have discussed the submission with ICANZ, which agrees that no change is required to the proposed provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Submission (Matter raised by officials) If the incremental late payment penalty is applied after 1 April 2001, it should apply at the rate of 1% per month of the outstanding tax. Comment The proposal, as currently drafted, precludes reducing the penalty in relation to tax that is due before 1 April 2001. Failure to pay that tax liability would continue to incur a 2% penalty each month of the outstanding amount, whereas the failure to pay a tax liability that arises after 1 April 2001 would be penalised at 1% each month of the outstanding amount. This outcome is contrary to the policy intent of the proposal, which is to reduce the level of the incremental late payment penalty for debt outstanding after 1 April 2001. Recommendation That the recommendation be accepted. 168 Issue: Cancellation of incremental penalties where instalment arrangements are being met Submission (12 – ICANZ) Section 183B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 should be replaced to provide remission of incremental penalties each month as taxpayers comply with their instalment arrangements. Comment The Less Taxing Tax discussion document proposed to cancel incremental late payment penalties each month that taxpayers complied with the terms of their instalment arrangements. This proposal had not been developed sufficiently to be included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. Its implementation raises a number of significant administrative issues. Until those issues have been resolved the proposal cannot be introduced into legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 169 GRACE PERIOD FROM USE-OF-MONEY INTEREST Submission (12 – ICANZ) The application date should be brought forward to apply to statements issued on or after 1 April 2001. Comment The proposal, as currently drafted, will apply from 1 April 2001. This means that debts specified in statements of account issued after 1 April 2001 will not attract any further interest if they are paid within thirty days of the statement being issued. Officials have discussed the submission with ICANZ, which agrees that no change is required to the proposed provision. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 170 SERIOUS HARDSHIP AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY Issue: Date of effect Submission (12 – ICANZ) The proposal is strongly supported, but it should be immediately effective. Comment The proposal to extend the relief provisions to all tax types applies to tax liabilities that arise on or after 1 April 2001. In order to bring the implementation date forward for this proposal, it would be necessary to reprioritise Inland Revenue’s existing commitments to implement other proposals considered more urgent, such as the changes for student loan borrowers and the Government’s operational priorities for the department. It is, however, feasible to increase the scope of tax payments eligible for relief by applying the amendment to applications for relief made after 1 April 2001. This would mean that applications for relief could be made in relation to tax payments that are due before 1 April 2001. Recommendation That the submission be declined and instead an amendment be made so that the proposal applies to applications for relief that are made on or after 1 April 2001. Issue: Applications in writing Submission (Matter raised by officials) Applications for relief by way of remission in cases of financial difficulty should continue to be in writing. Comment The bill proposes a new section 177 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The current formulation of section 177 requires applications for relief in the form of remission to be in writing. That requirement was inadvertently omitted when the new section 177 was drafted, and a new provision is required to reinstate the requirement that applications for relief in the form of remission be in writing. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 171 Issue: Applications in writing – date of effect Submission (Matter raised by officials) The proposed provision removing the requirement for applications to pay overdue tax by instalments to be in writing should apply from the date of enactment. Comment If enacted in its current form, this provision will apply for the 2000-2001 income year. The provision is intended to apply from the date of enactment. As currently drafted, the proposed provision will create an unintended retrospective application. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 172 ALIGNMENT OF PAYMENT DATES Submission (4 – Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand Inc) Tax payment dates should be aligned with normal commercial payment practices to the 20 th of each month. Comment Less Taxing Tax discussed aligning payment dates. The 20 th of the month was one of the suggestions for alignment. The response to the proposal was mixed. The proposal was not included in the Taxation (Annual Rates, GST and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill because it requires further development if it is to serve as a simplification measure. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Remedial amendments 175 FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT TERMINOLOGY Submission (12 – ICANZ) Clause 14 should be struck out and the underlying section EH 18 should be repealed. The provisions of the Income Tax Act 1994 which were amended to reflect the change in terminology in the accrual rules brought about by the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999 should be made readily accessible to the taxpayer, rather than requiring the taxpayer to refer to repealed legislation. Comment With the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999, it was intended that the other provisions of the Act which were amended to reflect the change in terminology in the accrual rules would continue to apply to Division 1 financial arrangements as they were immediately before the enactment of the 1999 Act. There are two ways in which this can be achieved. One is to include a provision like section EH 18, to provide that the provisions continue to apply to Division 1 financial arrangements as if the 1999 Act had not been enacted. The other is to include in the legislation the provision as it applied to Division 1 and as it applied to Division 2. For example, section CE 1(1)(c) would provide: “(c) For the purposes of Division 1 financial arrangements, income derived under the qualified accruals rules. For the purposes of Division 2 financial arrangements, income derived under the accrual rules.” The Act adopts the first approach. Whilst the first option does require a taxpayer with a Division 1 financial arrangement to refer to the legislation as it was immediately before the 1999 Act, officials consider this is to be preferred to the second option, which makes the legislation significantly longer and more cumbersome. A further disadvantage of the second option is the difficulty of knowing when the provisions in relation to Division 1 can be repealed. The issue will be considered as part of the rewrite bill (due for introduction in 2001), which will include the accrual rules. Officials acknowledge, however, that there is a problem where the previous provision refers to a section which no longer exists. For example, the former section FF 2 refers to a provision which is no longer contained in section EH 9(c) but, rather, is now in section EH 11(c). Consequently, officials consider that the proposed new section EH 18 should be amended to ensure that both the provisions and the sections referred to in those provisions are applied as they were before the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. 176 Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, the proposed new section EH 18 should be amended to provide that in relation to financial arrangements subject to Division 1, provisions in other parts of the Act, and sections referred to in those provisions, must be applied as they were before the enactment of the Taxation (Accrual Rules and Other Remedial Matters) Act 1999. 177 FOREIGN INVESTOR TAX CREDIT RULES Submission (19W – New Zealand Law Society) Although the Law Society does not normally support retrospective legislation, it does support this amendment, which is to the benefit of those affected and corrects an unintended consequence of an earlier amendment. Comment The amendment rectifies an inadvertent outcome of a 1998 amendment. It clarifies that section LE 3 can apply to a holding company that is a member of a consolidated group, but not in the case of dividends received by an LE 3 holding company from a member of the same consolidated group. The amendment is to be retrospective to the date of the 1998 amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 178 DEFINITION OF “TAX” Submission (12 – ICANZ) 1.The proposed change is strongly supported. 2.The Committee should review the Commissioner’s approach to the application of section 6A to determine the appropriateness of that approach. 3.IRD should be encouraged to apply an appropriate “care and management” approach to interpreting tax law (with specific reference to section 6A), particularly where the underlying legislation is impractical or unworkable and it takes too long to achieve necessary changes. Comment ICANZ made a similar submission to the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department. The Government agreed in response to the Committee’s recommendations that the Commissioner should exercise discretion on a case by case basis within the care and management provisions. The Committee did note in its report that it did not consider it necessary to amend the Tax Administration Act 1994 to deal with the issue. Work is continuing on the development of a standard practice statement for the interpretation of section 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 as a result of feedback received on the draft policy statements issued in October last year. ICANZ has been involved in the development and currently has the latest draft for consideration. The proposed amendment is to ensure that the definition of tax for the purposes of section 6A reflects the original policy intent. Its purpose is not to clarify the intention or application of section 6A. Recommendation That parts two and three of the submission be declined. 179 PROVISIONAL TAX FOR THOSE CHANGING BALANCE DATES Issue: Provisional tax due dates and taxpayers commencing business Submission (14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment to Schedule 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994 should be changed so that taxpayers with a preceding income year are not liable for provisional tax before they commence business. Comment The proposed amendment to Schedule 13 is designed to ensure that taxpayers who commence business in a transitional year (that is, a year in which they change their balance date) are not liable for instalments of provisional tax before they commence business. However, the proposed amendment would not provide for taxpayers who commence business during a transitional year and have a preceding income year, such as wage and salary earners. Officials agree with this submission and consider that the proposed amendment should be changed so that taxpayers who have a preceding income year but are not provisional taxpayers are not liable to pay provisional tax before they commence business. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisional tax due dates and new provisional taxpayers Submission (14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendments to section 120K(3) of the Tax Administration Act (TAA) 1994 should be changed to take into account that: • Both natural and non-natural provisional taxpayers should not be liable for provisional tax payments, and therefore should not be charged use-of-money interest, for any provision tax due dates that were before the taxpayer began business. • In redrafting this section care is taken not to exclude non-natural taxpayers whose residual income tax is less than $30,000. • This section should not apply in a transitional year. 180 Comment Section 120K(3) sets out certain taxpayers’ income tax liability for use-of-money interest purposes. The proposed amendment to this section is intended to ensure that this section applies to both natural and non-natural persons. However, as currently drafted, the amendment would not ensure that this section applies to natural persons. Officials agree that this section should apply to both natural and non-natural persons, including non-natural persons whose residual income tax does not exceed $30,000. Therefore officials agree that this proposed amendment should be redrafted to apply to these taxpayers. As indicated in the submission, section 120K(4A) is designed to apply to taxpayers who are in a transitional year, whereas section 120K(3) is intended to relate to taxpayers who are not in a transitional year. Officials agree, therefore, with this submission and recommend that the words “other than in a transitional year” be added to this proposed amendment. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Provisional tax instalment dates and transitional income years Submission (14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The following changes should be made to the proposed amendment to section 120K(4A), which relates to the application of use-of-money interest to taxpayers in a transitional year: • The singular reference to instalment date should be changed to reflect the fact that taxpayers in a transitional year may have a number of instalment dates; and • The transitional year provision, section 120K(4A), should apply to both new provisional taxpayers and existing provisional taxpayers; and • An explicit reference is made to the fact that use-of-money interest will not be applied to an instalment date that occurs within 30 days of that taxpayer’s first day of business. Comment This submission suggests that the reference to a single instalment date in the proposed amendment to section 120K(4A)(a) could be interpreted as implying that all income tax is due on one date for use-of-money interest purposes. This is not the case. Officials agree that including a reference to “instalment date or dates” will avoid any potential uncertainty. 181 The existing section 120K(4A) applies to all provisional taxpayers in a transitional year and does not expressly allow for new provisional taxpayers who commence business part way through that year. To resolve this issue, a reference to new provisional taxpayers was included. However, a reference to existing taxpayers was omitted. Officials agree with the submission that this section should apply to both new provisional taxpayers and existing provisional taxpayers. The proposed new section 120K(4A) sets out the due dates for provisional tax instalments for use-of-money interest purposes. The submission raises an issue of whether sections MB 5A and MB 4 would apply to this provision. The submission argues that if these sections did not apply, use-of-money interest could potentially be applied to an instalment date even though no provisional tax was due on that date. Officials consider that to remove all possible doubt as to the application of use-of- money interest the suggested amendment to section 120K(4A) be redrafted to make it explicit that no interest is be applied to instalment dates for which no provisional is payable. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Instalments of provisional tax for use-of-money interest purposes Submission (14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The term “income tax liability” used in section 120K of the TAA to calculate a taxpayer’s provisional tax instalment for use-of-money interest purposes should be defined to allow for credits of tax. Comment To calculate the amount of provisional tax due on each instalment date, a taxpayer’s income tax liability for the year is spread over the provisional tax instalment dates. Use-of-money interest is then applied to any unpaid or overpaid tax. Before the enactment of the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 the use-of-money interest rules applied to “income tax payable”. This was defined as a person’s residual income tax liability, that is, their income tax liability less credits for tax already paid. The Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996 repealed the term “income tax payable” and replaced it with “income tax liability”. However, income tax liability is not defined in the TAA, but is defined in the Income Tax Act 1994 as the product of the applicable tax rate and a taxpayer’s taxable income, before the application of tax credits. That this definition apply to section 120K of the TAA was not intended. Therefore officials consider that an amendment should be made to ensure that “income tax liability” is correctly defined for the purposes of section 120K of the TAA to include credits for tax already paid. 182 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Late payment penalties for provisional tax Submission (12 – ICANZ, 14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment to section 139C(2) be changed to take into account: • Provisional tax payable should be the lesser of the provisional tax the taxpayer was obliged to pay under section MB 5 or section MB 5A and the taxpayer’s actual residual income tax apportioned to each instalment date on and appropriate basis. • The appropriate basis of apportionment of each instalment should be consistent with the rules in sections MB 5 and MB 5A. • New provisional taxpayers have no provisional tax payable on some instalments. Comment Officials agree with these submissions that for the purposes of the late payment penalty the provisional tax payable should be the lesser of the amount calculated under section MB 5 or MB 5A and the taxpayers actual residual income tax apportioned on an appropriate basis. The proposed amendment does not allow for this, and therefore officials consider that changes of the nature suggested in submissions should be made. These changes would ensure that taxpayers could not be potentially liable for a late payment penalty in the event they adhered to the provisional tax rules in section MB 5 or MB 5A and their actual tax liability is larger than the amounts estimated under these sections. Officials also agree that the proposed amendment is not consistent with the basis of apportionment used in sections MB 5 and MB 5A. Officials consider that a change to the proposed amendment is necessary to rectify this. A further issue raised by submissions is that, as currently worded, it is not clear that for the purposes of the late payment penalty no provisional tax is due on an instalment date if that instalment date if within 30 days of the taxpayer’s first day of business. Officials agree that a change is required to clarify that no penalty should be applied in this situation. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. 183 Issue: Provisional tax instalments using the uplift method Submission (14 – PriceWaterhouseCoopers) The proposed amendment to the definition of “p” for the formulae used in section MB 5A needs to be changed to account for the enactment of sections MB 2AA and MB 2AB. Comment The definition of “p” for the formulae for calculating provisional tax instalments in transitional years has been redefined in order to clarify that “p” does not necessarily represent the amount of provisional tax payable in a transitional year. However, the proposed new definition of “p” does not take into account the fact that because of the new top marginal tax rate, transitional year rules are required for the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 income years. Officials agree with the submission that the definition of “p” should relate to section MB 1A. This section indicates the appropriate provisions in the provisional tax rules that apply for each income year. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “provisional taxpayer” Submission (12 – ICANZ) The change to the definition of “provisional taxpayer” should be made retrospective. Comment The definition of “provisional taxpayer” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 is being amended to exclude taxpayers from the application of the provisional tax rules. The submission supports this change but questions why this amendment is not effective from the last date at which the provisional tax rules were changed. Officials consider that there is no benefit to making this amendment retrospective and that doing so would create unnecessary uncertainty for taxpayers as to the meaning of this term in the retrospective period. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 184 Issue: Use of the term “provisional tax payable” Submission (Matter raised by officials) A consequential amendment relating to the use of a definition for “p” in section MB 5A is required. Comment Officials have identified that the reference to “provisional tax payable” in section MB 5A(8) relies on the existing definition of “p” in the formulae used in sections MB 5A(5), (6), and (7). To ensure consistency in the legislation, officials consider that section MB 5A(8) should instead refer to the amount of tax payable according to the appropriate provision. Recommendation That an amendment be made to section MB 5A(8) so that it refers to the appropriate provisional tax calculation and not provisional tax payable. 185 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS Issue: Amendment to section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 90 should be amended to correct cross-references to section EH 1. Comment Section 90 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 contains incorrect cross-references to section EH 1. Section 90(1)(c), 90(1)(d) and the proviso to subsection (1) refer to section EH 1(5). The reference should be to section EH 1(6). Paragraphs (e) and (f) refer to section EH 1(6) and EH 1(7) respectively. These references should be to section EH 1(7) and EH 1(8). Officials consider that the cross-references should be corrected with effect from 20 May 1999, the date from which they became incorrect. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendment to section 124A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 124A(3) should be amended to correctly refer to Part III of the Income Tax Act 1976. Comment Section 124A(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 incorrectly refers to Part IIIA of the Income Tax Act 1994. The reference should be to Part III. Officials consider that the correction should apply from 20 May 1999, the date from which section 124A(3) was effective. Recommendation That section 124A(3) be corrected to refer to Part III of the Income Tax Act 1976 from 20 May 1999. 186 Issue: Amendment to Income Tax Act 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) The definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” should be amended to correctly refer to a close company. Comment In section OB 1, paragraph (b) of the definition of “expenditure on account of an employee” incorrectly refers to a “proprietary company”. This definition was repealed in 1994 and replaced by the definition of “close company”. Officials consider that the reference should be corrected with effect from the 1995-96 income year, the time from when the reference became incorrect. Recommendation That the definition of “expenditure on account of any employee” be amended to correctly refer to a close company from the 1995-96 income year.

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu (29W) General comment The bulk of the submissions on this bill were devoted to the proposed superannuation fund withdrawal tax. Most expressed concern about the application of the withdrawal tax to people on incomes below $60,000. Specific concerns were that the SSCWT rate was not being reduced for people on incomes lower than $38,000, and that the proposed application date for the changes, 1 April 2000, was too early. Other concerns expressed in submissions related to the lack of consultation in developing the policy, and the choice of an income tax mechanism over a withholding tax mechanism, with its resulting problems associated with the provisional tax and use of money interest rules. Officials consulted with the authors of two of the most substantial submissions on the proposals, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) and the Investment Savings and Insurance Association of New Zealand (ISI), to discuss their concerns. Our aim was to identify ways to achieve the anti-avoidance objective of the measure at a lower compliance cost than that imposed by the bill as introduced. For example, compliance costs will be lowered by deferring payment of the withdrawal tax one year to address the provisional tax and use of money interest concerns. 5 We also held a number of discussions with the Committee's adviser, Therese Turner, on the key issues raised in submissions. These meetings were helpful and constructive, especially in relation to the major issues raised in submissions on the fund withdrawal tax. As a result of these and similar discussions, and further consideration of the proposals, officials have recommended changes to the draft legislation as it relates to the fund withdrawal tax. They are outlined in this report. Our main recommendations are to remove: • the liability for the tax in relation to withdrawals by those on incomes of less than $60,000; • liability for the tax in relation to withdrawals made up to the date the bill is reported back to Parliament; and • the problems associated with provisional tax and use of money interest by deferring the income arising from a withdrawal until the following year. We believe that with these changes the proposed legislation will still achieve the Government's objectives while being more acceptable to taxpayers. Superannuation funds which do not allow in-service withdrawals and lock in those withdrawals for two years, when subject to the two-year rule, will bear minimal, if any, increase in compliance costs. The fund withdrawal tax is a key measure in the Government’s programme to ensure that those earning over $60,000 do not avoid the new 39% marginal tax rate. The measure is not intended to raise revenue but to prevent avoidance. As such, the measure will be monitored. If it proves that significant levels of the fund withdrawal tax are being paid the Government will analyse the reasons for this and will increase the rate if necessary. 6 PURPOSE OF LEGISLATION Issue: Statement of purpose of legislation Submission (19 – ICANZ) It should be clearly stated by the Minister at the second reading of the bill, and in the Tax Information Bulletin which explains the legislation, that one of the purposes of the legislation is to provide taxpayers who receive income of more than $60,000 a year with an incentive to invest in a superannuation fund. This will alleviate a concern that Inland Revenue may seek to apply the general anti-avoidance rule to people who take up the incentive. Comment The measures are not intended as an incentive for saving for retirement, but are anti- avoidance in nature. The Government considers that its avoidance concerns can be addressed without the need for the 33 percent SSCWT rate to be increased. While these measures are not intended as an incentive, they represent an approach which does not increase the barriers to people saving for their retirement. Other approaches to preventing avoidance by those earning over $60,000 would have placed an increased tax liability in some form on employer contributions, reducing incentives for long-term saving. The withdrawal tax only taxes employer contributions in cases where they are not used for long-term retirement savings. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 7 POLICY PROCESS Issue: Generic tax policy process should be followed Clauses 6, 10-14, 19 Submission (14 – ASFONZ) The proposed amendments should be removed from the bill and should go through the generic tax policy process. The withdrawal tax concept introduces an unnecessary compliance burden on trustees of superannuation funds. Comment The Government decided on the fund withdrawal tax after consultation with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association, the New Zealand Employers’ Federation and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. While this consultation was undertaken in a short period of time, this restriction on consultation reflected the need for these measures to be in place from 1 April 2000. Without this measure, high-income earners could divert part of their salary through a superannuation fund, paying tax at 33% on income which should have been taxed at 39%. Significant delay in enactment of these measures is likely to lead to significant use of superannuation funds in the interim to avoid the 39% tax rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 8 OPTIONS OTHER THAN WITHDRAWAL TAX Issue: “Cap” instead of withdrawal tax Submission (15 – Employers Federation) The Government should consider “capping” employer contributions to superannuation schemes at, say, 10 percent of an employee’s salary, with SSCWT remaining at 33%. Any contributions above this rate could be subject to a higher SSCWT rate, thus reducing incentives for employees to encourage their employers to substitute large superannuation contributions for salary and wages. Comment There are a number of potential approaches to preventing high-income earners from diverting part of their salary through a superannuation fund – for example, use of the fringe benefit tax rules, reliance on the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989, and a “cap” on employer contributions. Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages. As these options were theoretically feasible, they were discussed with the industry and employer representatives. The current option was chosen as it was effective and supported by the superannuation industry during consultation. Its principal advantage over the cap approach, from the point of view of the Investment Savings and Insurance Association, is that no percentage limit is placed on those wanting to save for their retirement. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 9 INCOME TAX vs WITHHOLDING TAX MODEL Issue: Withdrawal tax as a withholding tax rather than an income tax Submission 1 (4 – NPF, 6 – NZLS, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers; 13 – ISI, 19 – ICANZ) The withdrawal tax should be imposed as a withholding tax rather than an income tax. An income tax model results in the fund coming under the provisional tax rules, use of money interest applying, greater delay in remittance of the withdrawal tax to Inland Revenue, and the possibility of non-resident fund members being subject to double taxation. A withholding tax is a more appropriate basis for the withdrawal tax as it would ensure liability fell with the fund members and not the trustees. Submission 2 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 16 - Tower) If the income tax model is adopted, there should be no provisional tax or use of money interest liability. Amounts recovered from members making withdrawals could be deemed to be provisional tax payments and be allocated proportionately across the year to remove use of money interest liability (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Alternatively, the withdrawal tax could be removed from the definition of “residual income tax” (Tower). Submission 3 (19 – ICANZ) Alternatively, superannuation funds should be allowed a deduction for the amount of the withdrawal tax recovered from the withdrawing member. Comment The measures in the bill are intended to prevent avoidance of the 39% marginal tax rate by routing remuneration through a superannuation fund with a resulting tax liability of 33% on that remuneration. Officials consider the most appropriate approach to addressing this concern is the one which imposes least cost overall. A withholding tax approach, while feasible, would have higher aggregate compliance and administrative costs than the current proposal in the bill. For example, new due dates for payment of the tax would have to be established and returns required to ensure correct payment. Alternatively, if the withholding tax was integrated into another existing withholding tax, such as PAYE, to minimise compliance costs on taxpayers, significant administrative costs would be imposed on Inland Revenue. There would also be a significant delay in the application of the withholding tax approach as Inland Revenue systems were amended. Given the anti-avoidance nature of the provision, this delay could have a significant revenue impact. 10 However, officials consider the concerns underlying the submissions for the introduction of a withholding tax are significant and need consideration. These concerns generally relate to liability for provisional tax and use of money interest on underpayments of provisional tax. Provisional tax and use of money interest Officials consider that the provisional tax and use of money interest concerns can be addressed by providing that a withdrawal is gross income in the income year following the year of withdrawal (except in the year the fund winds up). This measure addresses the concerns raised. In the case of provisional tax payable, the concern that a shortfall penalty may apply to any estimate of provisional tax due in relation to a withdrawal is removed. The year delay allows quantification of the actual amount having to be paid by way of provisional tax in the subsequent year. Similarly, with use of money interest, any concern regarding an interest charge on a withdrawal late in an income year is removed as the withdrawal tax is not due until the subsequent year. Double taxation of non-resident member The submission from PricewaterhouseCoopers argues that a withholding tax would avoid the possibility of non-resident fund members being subject to double tax. The double tax will arise when a withdrawal from a superannuation fund by a non-resident member is income, and therefore subject to tax, in the foreign jurisdiction, and the member in effect pays the 5% tax on the withdrawal in New Zealand. The argument is that if the tax were a withholding tax, the member may be able to get a credit for it in the foreign jurisdiction. It is not clear that, if the withdrawal tax were imposed as a withholding tax, it would be creditable overseas. Generally, only income tax paid in the home jurisdiction is creditable overseas, and in New Zealand it is clear that superannuation fund withdrawals are not income to the member. Therefore it seems unlikely that any tax paid in relation to the withdrawal would be classified as income tax. As a withdrawal from a superannuation fund is exempt from tax in New Zealand, it is likely that, if a withholding tax model were imposed, it would be by way of a final withholding tax paid by the fund – similar to FBT and SSCWT. A credit for these taxes is not available in overseas jurisdictions. Recommendation That, except in the year a superannuation fund winds up, a withdrawal is gross income of a fund in the income year following the year of withdrawal. That a withholding tax not be introduced as an alternative to the approach currently in the bill. 11 EFFECT ON LOW AND MIDDLE-INCOME EMPLOYEES Issue: Taxing savings of low and middle income employees at correct rate Submission 1 (2 – Seafarers Union, 14 – ASFONZ) The proposed amendments relating to the fund withdrawal tax and SSCWT should be struck out of the bill, pending work on a proposal which taxes employees at their appropriate rate. Submission 2 (15 – Employers Federation) The Government should examine options targeted at overcoming the long-standing problem of the SSCWT rate of 33% applying in relation to people who earn less than $38,000. Comment The purpose of the proposed changes is to protect the revenue base by limiting the ability of high-income earners to plan around the new top personal tax rate of 39%. The proposal is, therefore, a high priority, with the new top personal tax rate having applied since 1 April 2000. Officials recommend that the measures in the bill proceed. Further work is being carried out by officials on options for low and middle-income employees. The Minister of Finance has stated that he agrees with the concern that those earning under $38,000 are subject to a 33% SSCWT rate. Officials have been directed to consider solutions to this matter for inclusion in a bill early next year. As this is a long-standing issue which is being considered, the matter can be progressed in a way which allows significant time for consultation. Recommendation That: • the submission proposing the removal of amendments relating to the fund withdrawal tax be declined; • the submission proposing that the government examine options in relation to the treatment of those earning under $38,000 be accepted. 12 Issue: Application of withdrawal tax to low and middle-income employees Submission 1 (3 – Seafarers Retirement Fund, 4 – NPF, 6 – NZLS, 11 – Westpac, 15 – Employers Federation, 13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 16 – Tower, 17 – Dairy Group, 19 – ICANZ, 20 – Phillips Fox, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The withdrawal tax should only apply to employees subject to the 39% marginal tax rate (incomes over $60,000): • at the time the employer’s contribution is made (ASFONZ); • in either of the two years immediately before withdrawal (ISI, Employers Federation, Phillips Fox). Submission 2 (18 – NZSA) Low and middle-income employees earning less than $60,000 can be liable for the withdrawal tax and consequently pay the same amount of tax as high-income employees. This is especially so for new members who join after the grandparenting cut off date. This problem could be alleviated by an exemption for all members from the withdrawal tax for contributions up to a certain monetary or percentage ceiling each year ($10,000 or 10% net of tax). This exemption would result in most employer contributions for low and middle-income earners being “ring-fenced” from the withdrawal tax, while still making the withdrawal tax apply to contributions over and above this level to limit the ability of high-income employees to plan around the 39% personal tax rate. Comment Officials consider that it is feasible to address the concerns expressed in submissions about the withdrawal tax applying to those earning under $60,000 through a certification process. This could be done by allowing members making withdrawals to state whether the combination of their taxable income and any gross superannuation contributions made on their behalf exceed $60,000 for each of the last four years. For each year this total exceeds $60,000, 25% of the withdrawal would be subject to withdrawal tax. For example, if for two of the last four years an employee had taxable income over $60,000, 50% of the amount withdrawn would potentially be subject to withdrawal tax. If in any year a withdrawing member is non resident, the taxable income may be nil. Considering the last four years of an employee’s income to determine application of the withdrawal tax is proposed as this is the normal period for which information is stored before being archived by Inland Revenue. Thus the required information should be available at low compliance costs to a member making a withdrawal. An 13 advantage of a longer income measurement period, such as four years, over a shorter measurement period, is that the effects of one-off fluctuations are mitigated slightly. Officials consider that it is necessary to exclude the year of withdrawal from the four-year test as this reduces the potential for considerable complexity associated with determining annual income part-way through an income year. It also removes issues such as the treatment of redundancy payments from the calculations. However, it does provide some room to manipulate the concession. Again, this benefit is reduced by the use of a four-year measurement period. As outlined earlier, officials consider that, in relation to withdrawals from defined contribution funds, the under-$60,000 exemption should include any employer superannuation contributions. This reduces the risk of employers and employees structuring the employee’s remuneration as just less than $60,000 of salary with the remainder by way of superannuation contribution. In relation to withdrawals from defined benefit funds, the $60,000 exemption will include only the taxable income of the member. The employer’s superannuation contribution in relation to a particular employee will not be known. The outlined approach minimises compliance costs, although these costs will still increase as those earning under $60,000 must collect the information required for the exemption to apply. To ensure a withdrawing member can get the required information, officials recommend an amendment requiring employers to provide on request by a person making a withdrawal a record of the employer’s contributions to a superannuation fund on their behalf over the last four years. The proposals will deal with the bulk of likely cases that may arise and is supported by the ISI. However, there will be exceptions not catered for, principally those with income which is generally below $60,000 but fluctuates regularly over $60,000. Nor do they cater for, without an increase in complexity, people earning over $60,000 for most of their working life but who reduce their work load before retirement and thus meet the proposed test for withdrawal free of the withdrawal tax. Recommendation That: • the withdrawal tax be reduced by 25% for each year a person has a combined taxable income and employer contributions to a superannuation fund on their behalf of less than $60,000; and • that measurement of the last four years’ taxable income and employer contributions to a superannuation fund not include the income year in which the withdrawal is made; and 14 • employers be required to provide on request by a person making a withdrawal a record of the employer contributions to a superannuation fund on their behalf over the last four years. 15 APPLICATION DATE Issue: Retrospective application date Submission 1 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – ISI, 16 – Tower, 19 – ICANZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The application date of 1 April 2000 is retrospective and places new obligations on trustees. Under the bill, trustees will be obliged to recover the withdrawal tax from members. The difficulties involved in recovering from past members may result in remaining members being penalised by having to fund the tax liability. A 1 October 2000 application date would mean trustees could meet their obligations. Submission 2 (14 – ASFONZ) The withdrawal tax should be introduced in relation to increases in employer superannuation contributions from 1 April 2001. Submission 3 (4 – NPF, 13 - ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 20 – Phillips Fox) The withdrawal tax should not apply to members who leave schemes between 1 April and the time of enactment. Submission 4 (19 – ICANZ) If the application date of the bill is not deferred, the tax liability should be relieved to the extent the trustee is unable to recover the money. Submission 5 (16 – Tower) There should be transitional provisions in addition to those covering the period from 1 April to 1 October. These need to protect trustees who act in good faith until the final form of the legislation is known. It is also necessary to provide for adequate timing for scheme administrators to set up systems for compliance. Comment The withdrawal tax measures currently apply from 1 April 2000. The concerns expressed in submissions are that this will result in trustees having to recover withdrawal tax liabilities, incurred in respect of members who have quit a superannuation fund, from the remaining members of the superannuation fund. The probability of recovering the tax from the departing member, while theoretically feasible, may be extremely difficult in practice. 16 However, this concern has to be balanced against the anti-avoidance nature of the provisions and the risk that any deferral in application date may allow higher income earners to avoid the 39% tax rate. The principal risk with any deferral is in relation to the grandparenting provisions. These provide that employer contributions at levels agreed on or before 1 April can be withdrawn without the withholding tax applying. A delayed date may result in some employees using the delay to negotiate large increases in their employer superannuation contribution to avoid the 39% top marginal tax rate on their salary income. A potential solution is to continue with the 1 April 2000 application date, ensuring that there is no scope for re-negotiation of employment contracts, but to remove any liability in relation to withdrawals made before the date the bill is reported back to the House. Officials recommend removal of any liability up to the date of report-back of the bill as any later date may allow scope for one-off lump sum employer contributions to be routed through a superannuation fund and back to high-income employees, with the trustee being relieved of the withdrawal tax on that sum. Officials do not support the proposal that the withdrawal tax should be introduced in relation to increases in employer superannuation contributions from 1 April 2001. The measure needs to apply before that time to prevent avoidance of the 39% tax rate. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that a provision removing any liability to pay withdrawal tax from 1 April 2000 to the date of the report-back of the bill be introduced. Issue: Transitional period to allow for changes to prospectuses and investment statements and to amend required systems Submission (13 – ISI, 14 - ASFONZ) A transitional period to, say, 31 December 2000 should be included in the bill to allow superannuation funds to update their prospectuses and investment statements. Comment The concern raised is that enactment of the withdrawal tax provisions may make investment statements and prospectuses misleading as they will not refer to the withdrawal tax. If this is the case, any contract entered into by a member to participate in a superannuation fund would be voidable. To remove this risk, on enactment of the legislation, superannuation funds would have to amend their prospectuses and their investment statements immediately to refer to the withdrawal tax. This will impose significant compliance costs on superannuation funds and administrative costs on the Companies Office. 17 Given the grandparenting provisions and the proposals to address the concerns expressed in relation to those earning under $60,000 in income, the number of fund members potentially affected by the tax who will benefit from this work will be small. Officials conclude that the compliance costs incurred by the funds in amending investments statements will be out of proportion to any resulting informational benefits provided to members. We have discussed industry concerns with the Securities Commission, as well as options for minimising compliance costs. The Commission has indicated that it has the power, by Order-in-Council, to exempt temporarily superannuation funds from any requirement to refer to the withdrawal tax in an investment statement. The exemption is likely to be subject to a requirement that members are notified of the effect of the withdrawal tax, and a statement of its effect is attached to investment statements. This is likely to be acceptable to the industry. The Commission will charge for dealing with an exemption application in accordance with the Securities (Fees) Regulations 1998. The Commission is funded by the Government on the basis that it will and should charge for this service. The fee will be approximately $2,000. This should need to be incurred only once in relation to an application on behalf of the entire superannuation industry. Recommendation That the submission be declined. However, officials propose an alternative approach which is likely to be acceptable to the industry. The Securities Commission has indicated that it has the power, by Order-in-Council, to exempt temporarily superannuation funds from any requirement to refer to the withdrawal tax in an investment statement. The exemption is likely to be subject to a requirement that members are notified of the effect of the withdrawal tax, and a statement of its effect is attached to investment statements. 18 GRANDPARENTING Issue: Grandparenting of current levels of employer contributions Submission (4 – NPF, 6 – NZLS, 13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 16 – Tower, 17 – Dairy Group, 19 – ICANZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The legislation should be amended to reflect the policy intent of exempting current levels of employer contributions from the withdrawal tax (including increases that were set under superannuation trust deeds or employment contracts before 1 April 2000). Comment The policy goal was to exempt from the withdrawal tax any employer contributions made on or after 1 April 2000 if the level of contributions was not increased or the increase was already agreed under a superannuation trust deed or employment contract in place before 1 April 2000. The submission that the bill does not reflect this position is correct. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Treatment of pre-1 April 2000 amounts Submission 1 (13 – ISI) Section CL 3(3) provides an exemption for an amount that existed in a superannuation fund before 1 April 2000. This allows picking a balance before a substantial withdrawal is made. Also, the amount in a market-linked fund will fluctuate with the market. The rule needs more precise definition. Submission 2 (16 – Tower) It is unclear from section CL 3 if the withdrawal tax applies to subsequent investment earnings of funds that existed before 1 April 2000. Submission 3 (13 – ISI, 20 - Phillips Fox) There should be no liability for fund withdrawal tax in respect of members of a scheme in existence before 1 April 2000 unless employer contributions on behalf of employees earning more than $60,000 per annum increase by more than 50% in either 19 of the two years prior to withdrawal, other than in accordance with a trust deed or employment contract that was in existence before 1 April 2000. Comment Officials agree with submission 1 from the ISI. Section CL 3(3) provides that the tax does not apply to a withdrawal of an amount that existed in a superannuation fund before 1 April 2000. Officials recommend that the section be amended to refer to an amount that existed in a superannuation fund as at 31 March 2000. In relation to the submission from Tower, the intention of the bill is that reserves in existence before 1 April 2000 would not be subject to the withdrawal tax when withdrawn. This position holds also for any return on those reserves. Officials agree that section CL 3 could be clearer on this issue. We recommend a further amendment to this section to include reference to any earnings on or after 1 April 2000 on amounts that existed in a superannuation fund as at 31 March 2000. For funds that have a balance date other than 31 March, we propose later in this report that the trustee have the option to adopt the immediately preceding balance date of the fund instead of 31 March. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Ordering rules for withdrawals Submission 1 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – ISI, 19 - ICANZ) Members should be able to withdraw exempt contributions first. Submission 2 (4 – NPF) The legislation should specify ordering rules (FIFO or LIFO) in order to provide certainty to trustees in dealing with the components of a withdrawal that may be subject to the rule. Comment The withdrawal tax provisions in the bill are silent on the source of any withdrawal, leaving it to the discretion of the trustee. Trustees may choose to pay out exempt contributions first. It is not the policy intent to require taxable reserves to be paid out first. While it would be possible to provide rules on the source of a withdrawal, this would act to reduce the flexibility available to trustees. It could result in the withdrawal tax 20 applying in cases where the trustee could have chosen an alternative which would not have resulted in the withdrawal tax applying. Recommendation That the submission to introduce ordering rules be declined. Issue: Proposal should not apply to established schemes that have not changed their manner of operation Submission (18 - NZSA) Most employer-based schemes do not currently allow members to make “in service withdrawals.” Therefore, the bill should not apply to established schemes provided that they do not change their method of operation. Comment Officials do not support the proposal that withdrawals from established schemes be exempt. This provides established schemes with an advantage relative to new schemes and may distort the investment decision of prospective members. The withdrawal tax will not have a significant impact on employer-based schemes that do not allow “in service” withdrawals. The withdrawal tax will only apply in relation to members earning over $60,000 who have a 50 percent increase in employer contributions in the two years prior to cessation of employment or who are employed for less than two years. In such circumstances, the tax will not apply if the member chooses to lock-in the withdrawal for two years. If the tax does apply, it is only in relation to contributions over those two years. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Increased employer contributions Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) To the extent that employer contributions have increased and exceed current contribution levels, only withdrawals of the excess contributions should be liable to tax. 21 Comment The objective of the withdrawal tax is anti-avoidance in nature. This proposal would increase the complexity of the legislation. At the time of a withdrawal, the trustee would require information on the amount contributed by the employer that represented an increase in employer contributions above the grandfathered level. The trustee would also need to determine to what extent the amount withdrawn came from such increases. Given this, and the fact that savings in superannuation funds are principally for retirement and are not intended to meet day-to-day expenses, officials consider that a potential liability for withdrawal tax on the full sum withdrawn is appropriate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 22 EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS FROM THE TAX Issue: Exclusion of certain payments from the withdrawal tax Submission (4 – NPF, 13 – ICI, 18 – NZSA, 19 – ICANZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The following should not be subject to the tax: • withdrawals in the nature of pensions (typically for retirement or disability); • withdrawals such as a retirement benefit without the member ceasing employment; • withdrawals that are payments as a result of insurance claims; • withdrawals to meet fund expenses, trustee and management fees; and • provisions of group benefits (such as life and health insurance benefits). Comment Officials understand that trustees may make withdrawals from a member’s fund to meet costs associated with administering the fund. They also make withdrawals to meet certain benefits provided by the fund, such as life insurance. These withdrawals will, without amendment to the bill, trigger a withdrawal tax liability. The intention of the withdrawal tax is to prevent avoidance, which does not arise in these instances. Further, if no amendment were made to address this matter, the tax would substantially impact on current industry practice. However, a blanket exemption for all expenses would provide scope for funds to increase the types of benefits they provide to members, who would otherwise buy these benefits out of income subject to tax at 39%. Officials therefore recommend an exemption which covers benefits generally provided by superannuation funds currently, and fund administration costs. These are: • any expenses associated with the maintenance of the superannuation fund; • any administrative, consulting, statutory compliance, auditing, legal or investment management fees; • any fees or charges imposed by the trustee; and • any group or individual life health, sickness and accident insurance held by the superannuation fund. In the case of pensions, most will be paid on retirement and therefore fall under the cessation of employment exemption. Pensions paid on partial retirement should also 23 be exempt as officials have proposed that cessation of employment include partial retirement. Pensions paid as an annuity of more than five years will also be exempt. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Indirect benefit test Submission (19 – ICANZ) The withdrawal test applies where a benefit is provided, either directly or indirectly, to a member. The trustee of a fund will not provide all indirect benefits, as the provision seems to imply. The indirect benefit test should apply only if there is an arrangement between the superannuation fund trustees and a member. Comment ICANZ provides an example of two members of a fund, mother and daughter. The mother withdraws contributions on cessation of employment, so these are exempt. However, she uses the funds to provide a benefit to her daughter. These funds, therefore, have indirectly provided a benefit to the daughter member. The trustee cannot know this. The policy intent is that whenever the employer’s contribution in relation to a member is withdrawn by anyone (that member or another), the tax potentially applies. In the example above, there should be no liability in relation to the daughter. The legislation should be reworded to achieve the policy intent and address the concern of the submission. This could be achieved by deleting the reference to provision of a direct or indirect benefit to a member. Recommendation That the legislation be redrafted to avoid reference to the provision of a direct or indirect benefit to a member. 24 MEMBERS BEGINNING EMPLOYMENT AFTER 1 APRIL 2000 Issue: Tax applying to new employees after 1 April 2000 Submission 1 (17 – Dairy Group) Employers’ contributions for employees employed after 1 April 2000 who have exactly the same employment contracts as those employed as at 31 March will have a different superannuation fund tax profile. This should be corrected. Submission 2 (13 – ISI, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The tax should not apply to members who join a fund on or after 1 April 2000 in respect of whom the employer contribution at commencement is less than 20 percent of salary. Comment Employees with same employment contracts The Dairy Group’s submission highlights the difference between the treatment of employer contributions for members beginning employment after 1 April 2000 and employer contributions for members who are employed on the same terms as at 31 March. Up to 31 March 2000, it can be assumed that employer contributions to superannuation savings were not driven by the tax advantage provided by the 33% SSCWT rate over a 39% top marginal tax rate. This assumption cannot be made in relation to employer contributions after 1 April. Our concerns with the Dairy Group proposal are that: • New employees earning over $60,000 will be moved to the most advantageous existing employee contract, with existing employees being moved to that contract when opportunities arise. Tax-driven behaviour will not be prevented but will occur within the range of contracts available to an employer. • Employers who compete for staff will have that competition distorted by the level of superannuation contribution available under contracts in place as at 31 March 2000. Officials also consider that the proposals to remove the withdrawal tax on those earning less than $60,000 substantially reduces the impact of the withdrawal tax on those starting employment after 1 April 2000. 25 Employer contribution under 20 percent of salary In relation to the ISI submission that the tax should not apply to members who join a fund on or after 1 April 2000 in respect of whom the employer contribution at commencement is less than 20 percent of salary, the issue of a percentage cap was considered and not progressed as an alternative approach. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 26 LIABILITY FOR WITHDRAWAL TAX Issue: Amount subject to withdrawal tax Submission 1 (4 – NPF, 18 - NZSA) Only contributions made in the two years before the event giving rise to the tax liability should be subject to the tax. Submission 2 (13 – ISI) There should be an option for the member to choose to either: • pay the tax at the time of withdrawal • defer receipt of the employer contributions liable for the withdrawal tax for the balance of the two-year period • take the withdrawal in the form of an annuity or any other income stream which provides a payment over not less than five years. Submission 3 (17 – Dairy Group) Ex-employees should be able to leave the employer’s contribution in the fund for two years from leaving employment to gain exemption from the withdrawal tax. Submission 4 (17 – Dairy Group) If a trust deed has a minimum two year period before 100 percent of the employer’s contribution vests to the employee, withdrawals from the fund should be exempt from the withdrawal tax. Comment Only last two years’ contributions liable A number of concerns are raised by the first submission that only contributions made in the two years before withdrawal should be subject to the withdrawal tax. It would be simple for a member to source withdrawals from employer contributions outside the two-year period. The superannuation fund could therefore be used as a cash-box, which is the mischief the withdrawal tax aims to prevent. Officials therefore recommend that this submission be declined. However, such a restriction is recommended in the case of withdrawals on cessation of employment, which are subject to the withdrawal tax because the employer’s contribution increased by more than 50 percent in either of the two years before cessation of employment. 27 Deferral of receipt of withdrawal The proposal from the Dairy Group is that if a trust deed has a minimum two-year period before 100 percent of the employer’s contribution vests to the employee, withdrawals from the fund should be exempt from the withdrawal tax. This does not represent a sufficient lock-in. Employer contributions would simply be withdrawn from amounts that are not locked in. The extent of this behaviour would be limited only by the total amount of employer contributions in the fund not subject to the lock- in period. For example, in 2003 an employee with $50,000 employer contributions in the 2000- 2001 income year could simply withdraw this sum as salary, with the employer making a compensating $50,000 contribution to the superannuation fund. Effectively, the employer is paying $50,000 a year to the employee, with tax being paid at only 33%. In two years’ time the $50,000 in the 2002-2003 year would become available to the employee as salary. To address these avoidance opportunities results in significantly increased complexity. Officials recommend the submission be declined. Receipt withdrawn as annuity Officials consider that withdrawal in the form of an annuity which provides a payment over not less than five years, as proposed by the ISI, does not raise avoidance concerns and recommend that this submission be accepted. Recommendation That: • submissions 1, 3 and 4 be declined. • submission 2 be accepted in relation to the proposal that withdrawal in the form of an annuity which provides for a payment over not less than five years or life not be subject to the withdrawal tax. Issue: Non-monetary amounts withdrawn Submission 1 (14 - ASFONZ) The legislation provides that an amount withdrawn means “money withdrawn, or, if money is not withdrawn, the market value of the withdrawal”. It should be clear that the market value is determined at the time of withdrawal. 28 Submission 2 (19 – ICANZ) Only non-monetary benefits that are capable of being converted into cash should be subject to the tax. What if a superannuation fund owns assets available for employees to use? For example, a superannuation fund may own the business premises in which employees work. These premises may provide car parking, a cafeteria, morning and afternoon tea and so on. Comment In relation to submission 1, the policy intent is that where a withdrawal is not in a monetary form, the market value of the withdrawal should be determined at the time of the withdrawal. In relation to submission 2, there must a withdrawal from a fund in order to trigger a tax liability. This includes monetary and non-monetary withdrawals. In the example above, there appears to be no withdrawal. Recommendation That submission 1 be accepted and submission 2 be declined. Issue: Employers can pay the withdrawal tax Submission (17 – Dairy Group) Provision should be made for an employer to pay the withdrawal tax as an alternative to the superannuation fund. Comment Officials consider that the liability should not be placed on an employer because the employer will not know when a withdrawal occurs and will be unable to deduct the tax from the withdrawal. There is also the risk that the employer may have ceased business. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 29 TRACKING EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS Issue: Certification by employers Submission (4 – NPF, 11 – Westpac, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 15 – Employers Federation, 18 – NZSA, 19 – ICANZ, 20 – Phillips Fox) A mechanism is needed whereby employers are required to provide sufficient details to trustees so that the tax status of contributions can be determined. Trustees should be able to rely on this information. If the information is not correct, the liability should fall on the employer. There should be protection for trustees from incurring a liability when it cannot be recovered from the withdrawing member, provided the trustees have acted in good faith and in reliance upon information received from the employer, or the member in the case of a fund in which the primary relationship is not through an employer. Comment Officials agree with this submission. We recommend a certification approach under which a superannuation fund can request information from a member making a withdrawal and from any employer who has made a contribution to that member’s superannuation savings. A superannuation fund would be able to rely on the information it received provided it did not have grounds for believing the information to be incorrect. Where inaccurate information is supplied, we recommend that the withdrawal tax not be re-calculated but that the Commissioner consider applying criminal penalties in relation to the supply of false information. Potentially, a taxpayer knowingly providing false information could be liable for a fine of $25,000 for a first offence and $50,000 for a subsequent offence. We consider a superannuation fund should be able to request the following information: From employers • the extent to which any employer contributions have been treated as salary and wages under section NE 2A; • the extent to which any employer contributions are subject to SSCWT at 39%; • the extent of any employer contribution to superannuation by an employer; • whether an employer has increased their contributions in accordance with a contract in effect before 1 April 2000; • whether an employer has increased their contributions by more than 50 percent in either of the two years before a member ceases employment with that employer; 30 • whether a member has ceased employment, and if so, whether this is within two years of starting. From other superannuation funds and schemes • the extent to which any transfer of funds represents employer contributions, employee contributions or any amount in a superannuation fund as at 31 March 2000 (or earlier balance date if elected by the transferor superannuation fund); • any information previously provided by an employer or member to a superannuation fund from which a member is transferring. From members • information on the last four years’ income of that member, and any employer superannuation contributions made on behalf of that member over the same period; • whether the member has ceased employment, and if so, whether this is within two years of starting; • any information a superannuation fund may require to determine whether a withdrawal is being made to alleviate significant hardship. Officials also recommend including a catch-all provision to allow any person to request information required to ensure an accurate calculation of the withdrawal tax. A person receiving a request for information should be required to provide the information within 20 working days of the request. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Inability to identify employer contributions Submission (13 – ISI) If the amount of employer contributions cannot be separately identified, the trustee should be able to calculate a fair and reasonable amount of employer contributions, rather than making withdrawals of all contributions subject to the tax. Comment Officials do not support this submission. Government policy is that if the amount of employer contributions cannot be identified, the entire withdrawal is subject to the 31 tax. In addition, it is not clear what constitutes a “fair and reasonable” amount, and this would give rise to disputes. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Measurement of amounts in funds at 1 April 2000 Submission 1 (14 - ASFONZ) There should be clarification of how the amount that existed in a superannuation fund before 1 April 2000 should be calculated. Market values should be used to determine those amounts. Submission 2 (13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 18 - NZSA) Trustees should be allowed to determine the balance in member accounts at the balance date nearest to 1 April 2000, rather than having to do a one-off balance as at 1 April 2000. Comment Officials agree with the ASFONZ submission that market values should be used to determine amounts in funds at 1 April 2000. In relation to the second submission, in order to reduce compliance costs, we propose that a superannuation fund may calculate grandparented reserves and the balance in member accounts as at its last balance date before 1 April 2000. We do not support allowing funds to use a balance date after that because it would allow an opportunity for members to avoid the 39% income tax rate applying from 1 April 2000. Officials also received an oral submission on the treatment of late balance date funds. The concern was that if a fund has a late balance date, a withdrawal after 1 April but before their balance date would be income in the 1999-2000 year. This would be before the tax is intended to apply and after provisional tax payments for that year have been made. Officials propose that withdrawals in the 1999-2000 income year give rise to a withdrawal tax liability in the 2001/02 income year. We do not propose that withdrawals give rise to a tax liability in the 2000/01 year because there may be insufficient time for a fund to put in place systems before the first provisional tax payment for that year falls due. Further, the 2000/01 income year is the same year that standard balance date funds will commence paying withdrawal tax if the proposal by officials to defer payment of the tax on any withdrawal to the next year is adopted. (This proposal addresses provisional tax and use of money interest problems). 32 Officials recommend that a withdrawal from a fund in the 1999-2000 income year give rise to a withdrawal tax liability in the 2001/2002 income year. Recommendation That: • submission 1 be accepted and that submission 2 be accepted in part. Superannuation funds should be permitted to calculate reserves as at their latest balance date before 1 April 2000; • a withdrawal from a fund in the 1999-2000 income year give rise to a withdrawal tax liability in the 2001/2002 income year. 33 WITHDRAWALS ON CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT Issue: What constitutes cessation of employment Submission 1 (13 – ISI, 20 - Phillips Fox) Cessation of employment should be defined to include a reduction of hours worked over all employment to a maximum of 30 hours per week, or a reduction by at least 25 percent of total hours worked over all employment. Submission 2 (11 - Westpac, 13 – ISI, 18 – NZSA, 19 – ICANZ, 20 - Phillips Fox) Cessation of employment should be defined to mean: • a change in employers (including redundancy); • the terms and conditions of employment have materially changed in such a way that the employee cannot be regarded as performing the same employment that they carried on prior to the changes; and • death and total or permanent disablement. Comment Partial retirement A concern expressed in submissions is that those who are nearing retirement may wish to partially retire, and make withdrawals to fund that partial retirement. Officials consider that the concern underlying the submissions should be addressed, but that the criteria for determining partial retirement be tighter than those proposed in submissions. Officials consider the criteria should be that: • A member is employed for a maximum of 30 hours per week; • The reduction in hours worked is a consequence of the member leading up to full retirement. • The member has no intention of increasing hours in paid employment in the future. This is an intention test, so it does provide scope for members to increase their hours worked at a later date. It does not lock a member into a fixed reduced number of working hours a week but does provide some scope for avoidance behaviour. • All employer and employee contributions to any superannuation fund cease. If a member is both contributing and withdrawing, there is a risk that the fund is being used for avoidance purposes. 34 General definition of cessation of employment Officials recommend against defining the term “cessation of employment” to include the events proposed in submissions. The concern that changing employers may not be a cessation of employment is addressed in the submission immediately below. Officials consider that death is clearly a cessation of employment. However, this could be clarified in the Tax Information Bulletin released after enactment of the bill. A material change in the terms and conditions of employment, and a disablement, should not automatically constitute a cessation. Recommendation That the bill be amended to allow withdrawal without imposition of the withdrawal tax if: • a member is employed for a maximum of 30 hours per week; • the reduction in hours worked is a consequence of the member leading up to full retirement; • the member has no intention of increasing hours in paid employment in the future; and • all employer and employee contribution to any superannuation fund cease. That the submission that cessation of employment be defined be declined. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Cessation of employment with a particular employer Submission 1 (14 - ASFONZ) An amendment is needed to make it clearer that the date the employee ceases employment is the date the employee ceases employment with the employer sponsoring the member’s scheme. Otherwise the exclusion could be interpreted as only applying on the cessation from all employment. Submission 2 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A number of larger corporate groups operate through a variety of group company structures, generally to separate different aspects of their overall business. The proposed legislation does not include any employer-associated person provisions. Therefore employees who may be moved around a group of companies to provide services to those companies, hence being employed by each group company for a period of less than two years, will have their employer contributions ‘tagged’, and on ultimate retirement/cessation of employment will suffer withdrawal tax with respect 35 to the tagged employer contributions. Associated person employer provisions should be included. Comment Cessation of all employment It is not intended that the exemption on cessation of employment apply only when there is a cessation of all employment. We therefore propose that the legislation be clarified to reflect the policy intent and address the concerns expressed in the ASFONZ submission. Employees transferring between associated employers Officials agree with the submission from PricewaterhouseCoopers in relation to employees transferring between associated corporate employers. Associated employers should be deemed to be one employer for the purposes of the cessation of employment rule generally. This addresses the concern raised in the submission. It also ensures that the transfer of employees between associates does not constitute a cessation of employment for the purpose of the exemption. Withdrawals on such a transfer will be subject to the tax. Withdrawals before cessation of employment Those with whom we have consulted on the bill have raised an additional issue related to withdrawals on cessation of employment. A withdrawal can be made shortly before, but in relation to, a cessation of employment. The current exemption in the bill only applies to withdrawals made on or after cessation of employment. We therefore propose that the legislation be amended to provide that a withdrawal made before, but in relation to, a cessation of employment does not attract the withdrawal tax. Recommendation That: • the ASFONZ submission be accepted; • associated employers should be deemed to be one employer for the purposes of the cessation of employment rules; • a withdrawal made shortly before, but in relation to, a cessation of employment should not be subject to the withdrawal tax. 36 CESSATION OF EMPLOYMENT– TWO-YEAR RULE Issue: Increase in employer contributions over previous two years Submission 1 (16 – Tower, 17 – Dairy Group) This provision should be deleted as it imposes significant compliance costs on scheme administrators and requires them to be vigilant about individual employment contracts. Submission 2 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 16 – Tower, 19 – ICANZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The test for employer contributions made in the final two years of employment should be 150 percent, not 50 percent, of the previous year’s superannuation contributions. Submission 3 (19 – ICANZ) The reference to the 50 percent increase in contributions should exclude any increase when the percentage of contributions has not changed as a percentage of salary. Submission 4 (4 – NPF) Where the increase in the two years before cessation of employment is 50 percent or more, the tax should apply only if employer contributions are in excess of an acceptable range when compared to salary (say 1 – 10 percent). Submission 5 (19 – ICANZ, 20 – Phillips Fox) Employees who are employed for less than two years should be allowed a safe harbour option. A deemed contribution level of 10 percent (ICANZ) or 20% (Phillips Fox) is appropriate. Submission 6 (12 – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 - ICANZ) Only that part of the contribution which is an increase greater than the threshold should be liable for the withdrawal tax, not the entire contribution. This would be consistent with the grandparenting provisions in the bill, which preserve the tax status of existing levels of contributions. 37 Submission 7 (19 – ICANZ) If submission 5 is not accepted, the withdrawal tax should apply only to employer contributions made during the last two years. Submission 8 (13 – ISI) An additional amount of contributions made in the last two years before withdrawal to make up for a mistaken underpayment of employer contributions should not be included for the purposes of calculating the increase over the last two years. Submission 9 (11W – Westpac Trust) Employees who have been employed for less than two years should be allowed to agree to such benefits being locked in until they leave the employer’s service, but with a minimum period of two years applied. This agreement could be made at the time when the contributions begin, subject to the terms of the trust deed. Comment Removal of provision The submission from Tower and the Dairy Group argues for the removal of the provision which triggers the tax if there is an increase in contributions in the last two years of employment. If this were to be removed, there would be significant scope for employees close to retirement to avoid the top marginal tax rate by negotiating an increase in employer contributions to a superannuation fund, knowing that they will be accessible in a short period of time when the employee retires. 150 percent of employer contributions in previous years Officials agree that the test for employer contributions made in the final two years of employment should be 150 percent, and not 50 percent, of the previous year’s superannuation contributions. This is a drafting error which requires correction. No liability where contributions as percentage of salary remains same We agree with the ICANZ submission that the reference to the 50 percent increase in contributions should exclude any increase when the percentage of contributions has not changed as a percentage of salary. We recommend that the current provision to this effect in section CL 6 also apply in this case. Application of tax only where employer contributions exceed percentage of salary The submissions from the National Provident Fund, ICANZ and Phillips Fox propose that the withdrawal tax apply only where the increase in employer contributions in the 38 two years before cessation of employment exceeds an acceptable percentage of salary. They suggests a level of 10 percent or 20 percent of salary is appropriate. This would reduce compliance costs on superannuation funds because they would not have to calculate a liability for most withdrawals. However, the proposal also has a number of costs. It would allow those on incomes greater than $60,000 to increase employer contributions before retirement, knowing that they will have access to those funds in a short time. Further, this proposal relies on new information being provided by employers, which increases their compliance costs. Officials recommend that this submission be declined. Application of tax only to employer contributions in excess of threshold Officials do not agree with the submission that the tax should only apply in relation to that part of the employer’s contribution which is greater than the 150 percent threshold. The objective of the measure is to prevent avoidance by those close to retirement. If the submission were to be accepted, the effectiveness of the measure would decrease and the compliance costs on employers would increase. Liability only for employer contributions in previous two years Officials agree that where there is a liability for the tax on cessation of employment, the tax should only apply to employer contributions made during the two years prior to cessation. This reduces compliance costs and does not present a significant avoidance risk. Additional employer contributions to correct previous underpayment We agree with the submission from the ISI that additional employer contributions made in the two years before withdrawal, to make up for an earlier underpayment of employer contributions, should not be included for the purposes of calculating the increase in those years. Lock-in of employer contributions Officials agree with the thrust of the Westpac Trust submission that employees who have been employed for less than two years should be allowed to lock in contributions as an alternative to the withdrawal tax applying. However, officials consider that a withdrawal should have to be locked-in for two years from cessation of employment before the withdrawal tax not apply. The avoidance risk which underlies the two-year rule is reduced substantially where there is a lock-in for two years. The increased employer contributions will not be able to be drawn down immediately after retirement. On this basis officials consider the withdrawal tax should not apply to contributions that would have been liable under the two-year rule if they are locked in for two years following cessation of employment. 39 Recommendation That: • Submissions 1, 4, 5 and 6 be declined. • Submissions 2, 3, 7 and 8 be accepted. • Submission 9 be declined but that there be no tax payable in relation to a withdrawal made at least two years after cessation of employment as a result of an election to lock in those funds. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Employment for less than two years Submission 1 (14 – ASFONZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The tax should not apply to all withdrawals by employees who have been employed for less than two years. Submission 2 (17 – Dairy Group) Bona fide retirements within two years of employment should not be subject to the tax. Submission 3 (19 – ICANZ) If an employee ceases employment before two years, only those contributions made to the employee’s superannuation fund by that employer should be subject to the withdrawal tax. The withdrawal tax should not apply to a previous employer’s contributions that were entitled to be withdrawn free of tax – for example, employer contributions from a previous employer that could have been withdrawn when the employee ceased work for that employer, but instead were left in the fund. Comment No tax liability where person employed for less than two years Section CL 4(3)(b) provides that the tax applies to a withdrawal by a person who is ceasing employment within two years of starting. That rule is a consequence of the rule in section CL 4(3)(a) which triggers the tax where there has been a 50 percent increase in employer contributions in the two years before cessation of employment. If the period of employment is under two years, employer contributions from that employer will always have increased by 50 percent or more in the two years before cessation of employment. Paragraph (b) is inserted to alert members, funds and employers to the consequence of the 50 percent increase rule. It should be retained. 40 Bona fide retirements In relation to submission 2, officials point out that both the two-year rules are intended to catch bona fide retirements. In the absence of the two-year rules, it would be possible for employees to substitute high levels of employer superannuation contributions for salary, and to access those contributions on leaving the employment, shortly after. Withdrawal of previous employer’s contributions ICANZ argues that, when an employee ceases employment, the tax should not apply to the withdrawal of contributions made by a previous employer that were eligible for tax-free withdrawal but left in the fund on cessation of the previous employment. This is the policy intent. Section CL 4(3) provides that the tax does not apply to withdrawals made on or after cessation of employment (except where the two-year rules are triggered). A previous employer’s contributions can therefore probably be withdrawn tax-free when a member subsequently ceases employment. However, we recommend that the legislation be clarified to reflect the policy intent. Recommendation That: • Submissions 1 and 2 be declined. • Submission 3 be accepted. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue: Redundancy within two years Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 17 – Dairy Group) Pay-outs to employees who are made redundant from their employment should not be liable to withdrawal tax. The two-year employment rule could result in unduly harsh implications in such circumstances. Comment The concern expressed in submissions is that, in cases of redundancy within two years of employment, members may suffer financial hardship, and so no withdrawal tax liability should apply. However, if the redundancy has caused significant hardship, the member will already be able to withdraw funds tax-free on that basis. 41 Officials do not support the submission to exempt redundancies because, in some cases, redundancy may be within the control of the employee, raising an avoidance concern. However, officials consider that the tax should not apply where a member has ceased employment owing to circumstances outside their control. We therefore propose that, in cases of cessation of employment on the grounds of injury, disablement or death, withdrawals should not be subject to the tax, even if the two-year rule would otherwise apply. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that withdrawals on cessation of employment, which would otherwise be subject to the two-year rule, be exempted if the reason for cessation of employment was injury, disablement or death. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Issue:Trigger for liability – within two years of joining fund Submission (13 – ISI) Liability for withdrawal tax should be triggered by withdrawal within two years of joining the fund, rather than within two years of starting employment with that employer. Comment As noted earlier, the two-year rule in section CL 4(3)(b) is a consequence of the rule which targets increases in employer contributions in the two years before cessation of employment. The basis of the latter rule is employment, not membership of a fund. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 42 SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP Issue: Withdrawals to alleviate significant hardship Submission 1 (4 – NPF, 11 – Westpac, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 16 – Tower, 18 – NZSA, 20 – Phillips Fox, 22 - Watson Wyatt) The definition should be extended from including permanent physical or mental incapacity affecting the member’s ability to earn income to other circumstances of financial distress or hardship to members and their families. It should include a withdrawal to make a payment in respect of the division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976, temporary disablement benefits, children’s education, and unemployment of spouse or family members. Guidelines should be issued. Submission 2 (19- ICANZ) “Hardship” should be better defined to include those things that give rise to financial difficulties, which in turn require access to superannuation savings, rather than the actual event that may or may not give rise to hardship. Submission 3 (19 – ICANZ) That an alternative way of defining “hardship” would be to define it in the negative. Submission 4 (14 – ASFONZ, 16 – Tower, 19 - ICANZ) The reference to “significant” should be removed. Submission 5 (4 – NPF, 14 – ASFONZ) The responsibility for determining whether hardship applies to each case should be given to the trustee but: • this should be subject to challenge by the Commissioner (ASFONZ) • this should not be subject to challenge by the Commissioner (NPF). Submission 6 (16 – Tower) Scheme administrators should be able to rely on an employer’s certification or a statutory declaration by the employee that the withdrawal is due to genuine hardship as defined under legislation and guidelines. 43 Submission 7 (19 – ICANZ) The bill should be changed to ensure the hardship provisions apply notwithstanding any other withdrawal tax rule. Comment Officials agree with the submission of ICANZ that hardship should be defined to include financial difficulties arising from certain events, rather than the events themselves that may or may not give rise to hardship. We do not consider that the term “significant” should be removed. Doing so would raise the risk that requests for hardship will become a way to withdraw funds from a superannuation fund without the application of the withdrawal tax. Also, the lower the threshold the more pressure placed on trustees in determining whether withdrawals qualify for hardship. On this basis officials recommend that the withdrawal tax not apply if the withdrawal is required to alleviate significant financial hardship arising from: • the inability of a member to carry out his or her normal occupation as a result of illness or injury, either temporarily or permanently; • the inability of a member to meet minimum living expenses or to meet payments on a loan which will lead to foreclosure of a mortgage on the member’s principal place of residence; • modification of the member’s principal place of residence to accommodate special needs arising from the disability to the member or member’s dependants; • the member having medical treatment to treat illness, injury or rehabilitation of the member or the dependant of the member; • the need to meet palliative care for the member and any dependants and funeral or burial expenses for the dependants. Those making submissions argue that the responsibility for determining whether hardship applies to each case should be given to the trustee, but there is disagreement about whether this should be subject to challenge by the Commissioner. Officials consider the current approach of the bill is appropriate. It provides that the test is an objective one – whether the taxpayer has suffered significant hardship. This approach allows both the Commissioner and the member making the withdrawal to dispute whether significant financial hardship had occurred in a particular case. It would be inequitable to deny the member making a withdrawal this right. Further, without the Commissioner having such a right, a trustee may be inclined towards accepting a taxpayer’s argument for significant financial hardship rather than risking a dispute knowing that the Commissioner could not challenge that decision. 44 Officials consider a provision, although not one relating to significant financial hardship, should be included to provide for funds required to settle an agreement for division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. It should include a withdrawal to make a payment in respect of the division of assets under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976 (but not a matrimonial property agreement). Officials note that this provision may require amendment to address issues raised by the Matrimonial Property Amendment Bill 2000. Finally, officials agree with the ICANZ submission that the hardship provisions apply notwithstanding any other withdrawal tax rule. Recommendation That: • submissions 2 and 7 be accepted; • “hardship” be defined to include financial difficulties arising from the following events - -the inability of a member to carry out his or her normal occupation as a result of illness or injury, either temporarily or permanently; -the inability of a member to meet minimum living expenses or to meet payments on a loan to prevent foreclosure of a mortgage on the member’s principal place of residence; -modification of the member’s principal place of residence to accommodate special needs arising from the disability to the member or member’s dependants; -the member having medical treatment to treat illness or injury to the member or the dependant of the member; and -the need to meet palliative care for the member and any dependants and funeral or burial expenses for the dependants. • the test remain one of significant hardship; • the hardship test remain an objective one; • a provision, although not one relating to significant financial hardship, be included to provide for the tax-free withdrawal of funds required to settle an agreement for the division of assets (but not a matrimonial property agreement) under the Matrimonial Property Act 1976. 45 DEFINITION OF “MEMBER” Issue: Narrowing the definition of “member” Submission 1 (22 – Watson Wyatt) The definition of “member” is the same as that used in the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. In that Act, the definition includes as a member trustees of a scheme which invests in another scheme. For the purposes of this bill, this wider definition could accidentally trigger unintended tax liabilities when a scheme trustee requests money from the master trustee to pay legitimate benefits. A better definition of “member”, for the purposes of the bill, is “an employee or former employee”. Submission 2 (18 – NZSA) The bill should be amended in line with the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 to limit the definition of “member” to natural persons. Comment Officials agree that the tax should not apply when a fund that has invested in another fund withdraws that investment. The withdrawal tax should potentially apply only in cases where a natural person is withdrawing a sum from a superannuation fund. We have a concern, however, about the suggestion that the definition of a member be restricted to a natural person or an employee. The risk is that a withdrawal from a superannuation fund by another superannuation fund would lose its nature as employer or employee contributions, allowing a withdrawal from the second fund by a natural person to be free of withdrawal tax. Officials recommend the following solution to the problem. A withdrawal by a superannuation fund from another superannuation fund is not subject to withdrawal tax, and the amount withdrawn retains its nature. That is, the amount which represents employer contributions remains as such or, if that amount is not known, the entire withdrawal will be employer contributions. This allows the superannuation fund making the withdrawal to determine whether the withdrawal tax should apply, and to what extent, if it subsequently pays that amount out as an in-service withdrawal. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that: • a withdrawal by a superannuation fund from another superannuation fund is not subject to withdrawal tax; • that the amount withdrawn retain its nature as employer or employee contributions. 46 TRANSFERS BETWEEN FUNDS Issue: Responsibility for establishing the extent to which transfers are composed of employer contributions Submission 1 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 - ICANZ) On the transfer of amounts from one fund to another, there should be some form of declaration by the transferor regarding the status of the amount transferred which the transferee fund can rely on. Submission 2 (13 – ISI, 19 – ICANZ) If the transferee fund is not able to obtain the relevant information from the transferor fund, • it should be able to assume that all amounts transferred are employee contributions (ICANZ) • there should be some form of apportionment between employer/employee contributions (ISI). Submission 3 (13 – ISI) A retail fund may not know until after a member has withdrawn that an amount which had been transferred into the fund included employer contributions. The tax should not apply in this situation as the fund would not be able to recover the tax from the member. Comment Officials agree that on the transfer of amounts from one superannuation fund to another, there should be some form of declaration by the transferor regarding the status of the amount transferred which the transferee fund can rely on. Officials recommend an amendment to require a transferor fund to provide to the transferee such information as it has available for determining the application of withdrawal tax. This should be calculated as if the transferred sum been withdrawn rather than transferred. If the transferee fund is not able to obtain the relevant information from the transferor, the amounts transferred should be classified as employer contributions, which are potentially liable to the tax on withdrawal by a member. Officials do not support submission 3 from the ISI. A fund should determine at the time of withdrawal whether amounts transferred from other funds include employer contributions. If this information is not available, the withdrawal should be subject to the tax. 47 Recommendation That submission 1 be accepted and submissions 2 and 3 be declined. Issue: Withdrawal and re-investment in another superannuation fund Submission (14 - ASFONZ) No tax should be payable when an employee makes a withdrawal and immediately invests that amount in another superannuation fund. This should be treated as a transfer between superannuation funds. Comment In principle this approach is correct in that a withdrawal followed by immediate investment in another superannuation fund by a member is, in substance, the same as a direct transfer. However, officials are concerned about the lack of guarantee that any amount withdrawn is in fact immediately reinvested. The exemption from withdrawal tax on a direct transfer is appropriate only because receipt of the savings by the transferee is guaranteed. Officials understand that some trust deeds prevent payment being made to a person other than the member. In these cases, if the trustee acts as an agent of the member and transfers payment on the member’s behalf to another superannuation fund, officials consider the withdrawal tax would not apply. This would be treated as a direct transfer. We propose that this be stated in the Tax Information Bulletin released after enactment of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Transfers from defined benefit to defined contribution funds Submission 1 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 - ISI) A portion of the amount transferred from a defined benefit to a defined contribution fund should retain its exempt status to avoid difficulties when rationalising schemes. This could be agreed with the Government Actuary or be determined by an actuary. 48 Submission 2 (13 – ISI) In a transfer from a defined benefit fund, where the amount of employer contributions is not readily identifiable, it may be determined by deducting employee contributions from the total transfer amount. Comment Officials are proposing changes in relation to the treatment of withdrawals from defined benefit funds. The bill proposes that withdrawals from a defined benefit fund be exempt from the withdrawal tax. However, in the light of submissions, officials now consider that a withdrawal from a defined benefit fund should be subject to the tax except where the withdrawal: • is sourced from employee contributions, or the return on employee contributions; or • is sourced from pre-1 April 2000 reserves; or • is on cessation of employment; or • is to alleviate significant hardship. This means that when an amount that would be exempt on withdrawal from a defined benefit fund is transferred to a defined contribution fund, it should retain its exempt status in the transferee fund. Recommendation That the submissions be declined but that amounts that would be exempt if withdrawn from a defined benefit fund should retain that status if they are transferred to a defined contribution fund. Issue: Continuity of exemption if a member transfers from one scheme to another Submission 1 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 22 – Watson Wyatt) Proposed section CL 5(4) treats the entire transfer as liable to tax where the transferring fund is unable to split the transfer between employer and employee contributions. To the extent that pre-1 April 2000 amounts can be identified in the transferor fund, their tax-free status should be preserved in the transferee fund. 49 Submission 2 (18 – NZSA) When a member transfers from one scheme to another, any employer contributions that were exempt from the withdrawal tax should continue to be exempt in the receiving scheme. This is necessary to maintain employment conditions where a merger or acquisition takes place, and makes it easier to make revisions to schemes. Comment The policy intent is that amounts that are grandparented in a superannuation fund retain that status on transfer to another superannuation fund. Similarly, other amounts that would not be subject to the tax on withdrawal, such as employee contributions, should retain their status when transferred between funds. In both cases, this is subject to the transferor fund being able to identify, and notify the transferee of, those amounts. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Employer contributions not transferred Submission (16 – Tower) Section CL 5 exempts the application of withdrawal tax to employer contributions transferred to another superannuation scheme on ceasing employment. The same exemption should apply to employer contributions remaining in a retail scheme. Upon ceasing employment the member should be able to continue in the same retail superannuation scheme, and any employer contributions already made should not be subject to the withdrawal tax when they are accessed. Comment Section CL 4(3) already provide that the withdrawal tax does not apply to withdrawals made on or after cessation of employment. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 50 Issue: Exemption from withdrawal tax for funds investing in other funds Submission (4 – NPF, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 13 - ISI) A specific exemption is needed to ensure that the practice of one superannuation fund investing in another superannuation fund does not result in the withdrawal tax applying. As any withdrawals made are in the nature of an investment and are not received by members, not having an exemption could see the withdrawal tax apply in circumstances that were not intended. Comment Officials have proposed that a withdrawal by a fund of an amount invested in another fund should not cause a withdrawal tax liability. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfers between superannuation schemes and superannuation funds Submission 1 (13 – ISI, 19 – ICANZ) Amounts transferred from a foreign superannuation scheme, and from a superannuation scheme to a superannuation fund, should be considered employee contributions because they will have been subject to fringe benefit tax. They should therefore be excluded from the withdrawal tax provisions. Submission 2 (19 – ICANZ) When a transfer is made from a superannuation fund to a superannuation scheme, such amounts should not be subject to withdrawal tax. This situation is likely to be limited to those cases when a superannuation fund is deregistered from the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Comment The bill is silent on transfers from a superannuation fund to a superannuation scheme or foreign superannuation scheme and vice versa. Officials recommend that: • Any amount transferred from a resident or non-resident superannuation scheme to a superannuation fund be treated as an employee contribution as any New Zealand employer contribution will have been subject to FBT. Further, if the member had withdrawn the funds from a superannuation scheme and then 51 deposited them into a superannuation fund, the alternative to direct transfer, that amount would have been treated as an employee contribution. • Any amount transferred from a superannuation fund to a superannuation scheme is a withdrawal from the superannuation fund subject to the normal exemptions. The approach to transfers from a superannuation fund to a superannuation scheme differs from that proposed in submission 2, which argues that the amounts transferred should not be subject to withdrawal tax. The reason for treating transferred amounts as withdrawals is that the withdrawal tax does not apply to withdrawals from superannuation schemes because employer contributions to superannuation schemes are subject to fringe benefit tax rather than SSCWT. To extend the application of the tax to superannuation schemes would broaden substantially the coverage of the withdrawal tax and thus increase the compliance costs imposed. Recommendation We recommend that • any amount transferred from a resident or non-resident superannuation scheme to a superannuation fund be treated as an employee contribution; • any amount transferred from a superannuation fund to a superannuation scheme is a withdrawal from the superannuation fund and, if the usual exemptions do not apply, will be subject to the withdrawal tax. Issue: Transfer to defined benefit scheme Submission (22 – Watson Wyatt) Defined benefit schemes should be permitted to receive transfers without the tax applying provided that the component of the transfer which would have been subject to the tax on payment is identified throughout the subsequent membership of the member and is subject to tax notwithstanding that it would be a withdrawal from a defined benefit scheme. Comment Officials have proposed significant changes in relation to the treatment of withdrawals from defined benefit funds. The bill currently proposes that withdrawals from a defined benefit fund be exempt from the withdrawal tax. However, in the light of submissions, officials now consider that a withdrawal from a defined benefit fund should be subject to the tax except where the withdrawal: • is sourced from employee contributions, or the return on employee contributions; or 52 • is sourced from pre-1 April 2000 reserves; or • is on cessation of employment; or • is to alleviate significant hardship. Because it is now proposed that withdrawals from defined benefit funds be subject to the tax, on the transfer of an amount from a defined contribution to a defined benefit fund, amounts which would be tax-free if the member were to withdraw from the defined contribution fund at the time of transfer should be deemed to be employee contributions in the defined benefit fund. This means that they could be withdrawn tax free from the defined benefit fund. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Deducting and accounting for withdrawal tax at time of transfer Submission (19 – ICANZ) A superannuation fund to which contributions are transferred should be able to elect to deduct and account for the withdrawal tax at the time of receipt of the funds. This would be beneficial to employers that have over-funded superannuation funds that do not require employer contributions. By deducting the tax on entry, the superannuation fund need not be concerned about keeping systems in place to monitor those employees affected and may thereafter disregard any obligations related to this tax. Comment Making provision for transferee funds to deduct the withdrawal tax on receipt of the transferred funds would penalise members who may ultimately be able to withdraw from the transferee fund without payment of tax (for example, significant hardship, cessation). Officials therefore oppose the submission. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 53 BORROWING AGAINST A FUND Issue: Application of tax to borrowing against the superannuation fund Submission 1 (13 – ISI, 19 – ICANZ) Borrowing from, or against an interest in, a superannuation fund should not constitute a withdrawal. Such a loan would already be subject to tax under section GD 6 in respect of any concessional interest component. In the vast majority of cases superannuation fund trustees would not simply give the money away as this would be a breach of their obligations to act fairly in all members’ interests. In any case, the accrual rules would apply to deem a base price adjustment to any amount of the loan that is not repaid. Submission 2 (14-ASFONZ) It is inequitable that an amount borrowed from a superannuation fund should be treated as a “withdrawal” when by its nature a loan will be repaid. The only “withdrawal” as such is the difference between the FBT rate of interest and the interest paid, if the interest paid is lower than the FBT rate. If the amount borrowed is not repaid but is forgiven by the trustees, the amount forgiven would become a “withdrawal” and subject to the provisions at the date of forgiveness. The amount of a withdrawal should be the prescribed FBT rate less the rate being charged, applied to the amount of employer contributions to superannuation savings. Submission 3 (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 - ICANZ) The provision should be limited to situations where a member borrows directly from the fund. The legislation is too wide in that it covers instances where a member uses their interest in the fund to borrow money. Comment Under the bill the withdrawal tax applies when a member borrows against an interest in a superannuation fund and the interest rate on the loan is less than the market rate. The concern underlying this measure is that one way to avoid the withdrawal tax is simply to borrow from a fund rather than make a withdrawal. If the member is charged no interest and the loan is for a long period, there is little difference in monetary terms between the loan and a withdrawal. While the fund will pay income tax at 33% on the concessional interest element, no withdrawal tax is paid. The submissions argue that the withdrawal tax may simply be triggered by a movement in interest rates which has the unintended affect of making a loan concessional at a point in time. 54 Officials consider there are three potential solutions to the problem of members making withdrawals via a loan rather than directly: • The proposal in the bill that if at any time a loan becomes concessional the fund withdrawal tax applies. To prevent this rule applying superannuation funds would have to ensure that the loans they provide are never concessional. This would be a matter of ensuring that the interest rate charged by the fund remains above the rate applying under the FBT rules. This measure imposes significant compliance costs on funds on monitoring loans to ensure this does not happen. Also, it may not actually be possible for a trustee to prevent this rule applying given the trustee has to abide by the loan agreement which may not allow an interest rate review. • That the withdrawal tax be incorporated into an existing provision which states that the difference between the amount of interest that would be charged on a loan at a market rate and the interest actually charged is gross income to the superannuation fund. While theoretically feasible this measure would have significant compliance costs and would also require a trustee to continually track the income of a borrower to determine if they earn over $60,000. • That the fund withdrawal tax only apply if, at the date of the loan, the interest rate is set at a rate that is less than the market rate. The concern with this approach is that those who wished to provide a concessional loan would ensure that it was not concessional initially making the measure ineffective. Given the significant concerns expressed in submissions with the current approach and the costs associated with the alternative measures identified, officials have re- considered the extent of the avoidance risk. The issue is whether the benefits of reducing this avoidance opportunity exceed the costs that would be imposed in preventing this type of avoidance. On the basis that a superannuation fund is currently charged income tax at 33% on the concessional interest element of a loan to a member, that the avoidance concern is probably only an issue with closely held funds and that the compliance costs the solutions would impose on all funds are significant, officials recommend that the current provision be removed. Recommendation Officials recommend the removal of section CL 4(1) and (2) which provides that a low interest loan to a member is a withdrawal. 55 WITHDRAWALS ON WINDING-UP OF FUND Issue: No withdrawal tax on winding up Submission 1 (16 – Tower) Applying a withdrawal tax to a member when the withdrawal is literally imposed by the scheme trustee would be against public policy and the spirit of the establishment and wind-up rules of any trust deed establishing a superannuation trust. On a wind-up, scheme assets should be equitably distributed to members and not subjected to the withdrawal tax. A winding up of a scheme is a process and it should not be treated as an event for tax purposes. Submission 2 (14 - ASFONZ) There should be no tax payable in relation to a withdrawal when a superannuation fund is wound up by reason of the employer going into receivership or liquidation or otherwise ceasing to operate. Submission 3 (16 – Tower) The deregistration of a scheme should be excluded from a “winding up” process and any distribution of funds should not be subject to the withdrawal tax. Submission 4 (13 – ISI) There should be no tax payable in relation to a withdrawal made by a member who is made redundant as a result of the circumstances that have lead to the wind-up of the fund. Comment Whether an employer contribution is received by a member choosing to make a withdrawal or on the wind-up of a fund, the consequence is identical in that an employer contribution is received. If employer contributions were free on the wind- up of a fund there would be an incentive for superannuation funds to wind up as a way of distributing money to members. While this would not be an issue with larger schemes, it is quite feasible for this to occur with smaller numbers of members, or funds where members are related. In the case of deregistration of a scheme, officials recommend that the withdrawal tax continue to apply to any withdrawal of employer contributions made during the period the superannuation scheme was a superannuation fund. However, if the superannuation scheme becomes a foreign superannuation scheme, the withdrawal tax should apply immediately to all liable employer contributions. 56 Recommendation That: • the submissions be declined and that withdrawal tax continue to apply to withdrawals on the wind-up of a fund • in the case of deregistration, the withdrawal tax continue to apply to any withdrawal of employer contributions made during the period the superannuation scheme was a superannuation fund. However, if either a superannuation fund or an ex-superannuation fund becomes a foreign superannuation scheme the withdrawal tax apply immediately on deregistration to all liable employer contributions. Issue: Exemption from tax Submission 1 (19 – ICANZ) It should be clear that only contributions that exceed the threshold levels and are not grandparented should be subject to tax if a superannuation fund is wound up. Submission 2 (19 – ICANZ) Section CL 9 needs to be clarified to cater for the situations when a wind-up and a withdrawal that qualifies as an exclusion from section CL 3 occur at the same time – for example, what if the fund winds up at the same time as employment ceases? Comment The policy intent of the bill is that grandparented amounts are not subject to tax when withdrawn, whether on winding up of a fund or otherwise. Similarly, whenever an exclusion from section CL 3 applies – for example when a member withdraws an amount on ceasing employment – the exclusion should apply regardless of whether the withdrawal is from a fund that continues to exist or one that is winding up. We agree that the legislation should be clarified to reflect the policy intent. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 57 Issue: Withdrawals on wind-up of fund transferred to another fund Submission (13 – ISI) There should be no tax payable in relation to a withdrawal from a fund that is wound up where the withdrawal is transferred to another fund. Comment There should be no liability for withdrawal tax when the amount withdrawn is transferred direct from the fund that is winding up to the transferee fund. In other circumstances the tax should apply. Recommendation That the submission be accepted where amounts are transferred direct from a superannuation fund that is winding up to another superannuation fund. 58 OPTION TO ELECT 39% SSCWT RATE Issue: Election on a per employee basis Submission 1 (4 – NPF, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 14 – ASFONZ, 19 - ICANZ) The election by employers to pay SSCWT at 39% on the contributions they make should be made on a per employee basis and not for all employees. Submission 2 (14 – ASFONZ) The election to withhold SSCWT at the 39% rate should be by agreement between the employer and employee rather than a unilateral decision of the employer. Comment Section CL 6 provides that the withdrawal tax will not apply to any contributions subject to the 39% SSCWT rate. This election is currently made by an employer, and if made, it applies to all SSCWT contributions made by that employer. Given the proposals to prevent application of the withdrawal tax to those earning, in total, less than $60,000, the generic application of the measure is inappropriate. Officials therefore agree with the submission that the election by employers to pay SSCWT at 39% on the contributions they make should be made on a per employee basis and not for all employees. Officials also agree that an election should take place with the agreement of the affected employee. Recommendation That the submission be accepted Issue: Return on employee contributions Submission (14 - ASFONZ) The tax should not apply in relation to the return on contributions subject to the higher 39% rate of SSCWT. Comment Officials agree that this is the correct approach. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 59 Issue: Person determining composition of withdrawals Submission (19 – ICANZ) Section CL 7(2) refers to an employer establishing the extent to which employer contributions have been subject to the 39% rate. This should refer to the trustee (with information provided to the trustee by the employer). Comment Officials agree that the trustee of a superannuation fund, rather than an employer, calculates the tax liability on withdrawals, including the extent to which employer contributions have been subject to the 39% SSCWT rate. Section CL 7(2) should therefore refer to the trustee. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 60 DEFINED BENEFIT FUNDS Issue: Exemption for defined benefit funds Submission 1 (13 – ISI) There appears to be little scope under a defined benefit fund for the avoidance the bill is directed at stopping, unless the trust deed is amended to allocate employer contributions to members. The bill should be amended to introduce the concept of employer contributions allocated to members rather than simply referring to employer contributions. Consequently, the exemption for defined benefit funds can be removed as it becomes unnecessary. Submission 2 (4 – NPF, 8 – Mobil, 11 – Westpac, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 14 – ASFONZ, 18 – NZSA, 19 – ICANZ, 22 – Watson Wyatt) The definition of “defined benefit fund” is too limited in that it applies only to superannuation paid in the form of a pension. This requirement should be deleted. The definition could be changed to “A scheme registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 which operates on the principle of unallocated funding and requires a periodic actuarial valuation as required under section 15 of the Act” (PricewaterhouseCoopers). Alternatively, the definition could be omitted and reliance be placed on the common law meaning. Submission 3 (4 – NPF) If the requirement that superannuation be paid in the form of a pension is retained, the DBP Contributors Scheme and Aircrew Superannuation Scheme, governed by the National Provident Fund Restructuring Act 1990, should be specifically exempted from the tax. This is justified because the Contributors Scheme is comparable only with the Government Superannuation Fund, which is specifically exempted. Submission 4 (4 – NPF, 14 – ASFONZ) The term “defined benefit fund” should be redefined so that the fact that an employer may temporarily cease to make contributions will not affect the status of the fund. Submission 5 (4 – NPF, 14 - ASFONZ) The definition of defined benefit fund should refer, in paragraph (b), to the member’s benefit (rather than “return”) being based on a formula that relates the benefit to the length of time an employer has been a member of the fund, and not the length of time in employment. 61 Comment Submissions point out that very few defined benefit schemes come within the definition in section CL 8(2) because members can generally withdraw part of their entitlement by way of a lump sum. It appears that they can do this on retirement or while in employment. Because of this, officials are concerned that there may be opportunities to route remuneration through a defined benefit scheme – most likely one with few members. However, as employer contributions are not attributable to particular members, the general rule applying to defined contribution funds cannot apply to defined benefit funds. We therefore recommend that the proposed exemption in section CL 8(1) for withdrawals from a defined benefit fund be deleted. Instead, withdrawals from a defined benefit fund would be subject to the withdrawal tax except to the extent that the withdrawal: • is sourced from employee contributions, or the return on employee contributions; or • is sourced from pre-1 April 2000 reserves; or • is on cessation of employment (the two-year exceptions to this exemption will not apply); or • is to alleviate significant hardship. Officials understand that some trust deeds provide that employer contributions are deemed to be member contributions. Only contributions that are actually made by employees should be withdrawn tax free. Definition of defined benefit fund The definition of “defined benefit fund” in section CL 8(2) will still be required. We accept the point raised in submissions that most funds are excluded by the requirement in paragraph (c) that a member’s benefit is payable only as a pension, and propose that the current definition be deleted and replaced with that suggested in submission 2. The changes suggested in submissions 3, 4 and 5 are, therefore, no longer relevant. Recommendation That: • a withdrawal from a defined benefit scheme be subject to the tax except where the withdrawal: 62 -is sourced from employee contributions, or the return on employee contributions; or -is sourced from pre-1 April 2000 reserves; or -is on cessation of employment; or • is to alleviate significant hardship. • the definition of defined benefit fund proposed in submission 2 be accepted. • submissions 3, 4 and 5 be declined as they no longer apply. Issue: Withdrawal tax in relation to defined benefit schemes Submission (18 - NZSA) For defined benefit schemes, the whole benefit arising from the past two years worth of membership, less the total of the accumulated member’s own contributions in the last two years, should be subject to the withdrawal tax with the same exclusions as employer contributions to defined contribution funds. However, the same level of contributions before and after April 2000 would be replaced by the same level of benefits. Comment If the Committee agrees with officials’ earlier recommendations in relation to the treatment of defined benefit schemes, this submission is no longer relevant. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Conversion from defined benefit scheme to defined contribution scheme Submission (18 – NZSA) When a fund converts from defined benefit to defined contribution, a level of employer contributions to which the general exemption will apply needs to be provided for. The bill should be amended to set this level through discussions with the Government Actuary. 63 Comment The proposed new treatment of defined benefit funds is discussed earlier in this report. Where a scheme converts from defined benefit to defined contribution, employee contributions and the return on those (together with any pre-1 April 2000 reserves) should be tagged. Withdrawals up to that amount should not be subject to the withdrawal tax. Recommendation That the submission be declined but that on conversion of a scheme from defined benefit to defined contribution, employee contributions and the return on those should be tagged as they should not be subject to the withdrawal tax on a subsequent withdrawal. 64 DEFINITION OF “EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS” Issue: Definition of employer contributions to superannuation savings Submission 1 (13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 17 – Dairy Group, 18 – NZSA) Paragraph (b) of the definition of “employer contributions to superannuation savings”, which refers to any return on employer superannuation contributions, should be removed or amended to include only amounts of gross income derived from the investment of certain employer contributions. Submission 2 (19 – ICANZ) The definition of “employer contributions” includes any return on employer contributions. The amount of the return should be set by reference to the actual fund earnings for the previous income year of the find. Also, a simple formula should be available to be used to determine the return. Submission 3 (13 – ISI, 12 – NZSA, 14 – ASFONZ, 17 – Dairy Group, 20 – Phillips Fox, 22 - Watson Wyatt) Paragraph (c) of the definition, which refers to reserves, also should be removed or amended to refer only to amounts of gross income derived from the investment of those reserves. Submission 4 (17 – Dairy Group) If funds are required to track returns on employer contributions and reserves, the Commissioner should be given discretion to accept alternative methods that approximate tracking or produce materially similar results. This would provide superannuation funds with an ability to reduce compliance costs should acceptable methods be developed and endorsed by the Commissioner. Comment Returns on employer contributions, and reserves Submissions recommend that paragraphs (b) and (c) of the definition of “employer contributions to superannuation savings” be deleted or include only amounts of gross income derived from the investment of employer contributions. Those paragraphs respectively include in the definition any return on employer superannuation contributions, and reserves (defined as employer contributions which do not vest in a member, and any return on those contributions). Officials do not support the deletion of paragraph (b). All returns to employer contributions are subject to the withdrawal tax in order to minimise avoidance 65 opportunities. Employers could make a large contribution to a superannuation fund, with the return on that contribution being taxed at 33% and subsequently withdrawn by employees earning over $60,000. Officials also oppose the deletion of paragraph (c), which is designed to counter avoidance schemes based on the creation of reserves which can be allocated to members earning over $60,000. Narrowing the definition of “return” or “reserves” to include only amounts of gross income derived from the investment of employer contributions would provide scope for funds to allocate non-taxable investment returns to employer contributions, and taxable returns to employee contributions. Officials recommend the submissions be declined. Calculating return on employer contributions ICANZ suggests that the amount of the return on employer contributions should be set by reference to the actual fund earnings for the previous income year, or on the basis of a simple formula. The Dairy Group suggests that the Commissioner accept alternative methods that approximate tracking. Officials understand that returns to members have to be calculated for the purposes of the superannuation fund. Whatever method is chosen for this purpose should be adopted in calculating the return for withdrawal tax purposes. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 66 RECOVERING TAX FROM MEMBERS Issue: Deduction of tax from amount withdrawn Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 - ICANZ) If the form of the tax remains as an income tax, the legislation should be amended to allow trustees to withhold the tax from the withdrawal rather than recover it from the member subsequently. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The intention is that trustees have the ability to withhold or recover any tax liability arising from a withdrawal from the member making that withdrawal. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Recovery of trustee expenses Submission (13 – ISI, 20 – Phillips Fox) Proposed section 165AA should be amended to allow a trustee of a superannuation fund the option also to recover from the member any necessary expenses incurred in calculating the withdrawal and the amount of tax liability, and in notifying other trustees and the member in relation to transferred benefits. Comment Officials agree that trustees should be able to recover from a member making a withdrawal reasonable costs associated with processing a withdrawal request. If this were not the case, members remaining in the superannuation fund would be required to a bear that cost. This would be inequitable on those members. Giving effect to this amendment will require an amendment to the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 67 MISCELLANEOUS DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Application dates Submission (19 – ICANZ) A central application date provision should be inserted in the bill to clarify application. Currently the application dates are spread throughout the various withdrawal tax provisions. Comment To the extent that application dates can be amalgamated, officials consider that this is desirable. However, if an application date is specific to a particular section, it should be retained in that section. Recommendation That the submission be accepted in part. Issue: Priority of provisions Submission (13 – ISI) Section CL 3 needs to be redrafted to make it clear that the exemption for pre-1 April 2000 amounts takes precedence over all other clauses. Comment Officials agree that a section should be inserted at the beginning of the withdrawal tax provisions that makes it clear that the tax does not apply in relation to grandfathered amounts, such as pre-1 April reserves. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 68 Issue: Separation of employer and employee contributions Submission (13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 19 - ICANZ) Section CL 3(1)(a) should be amended to provide that the withdrawal tax applies only if a member withdraws from a superannuation fund to which an employer of the member has made contributions on behalf of the member. Comment Officials agree with the submission. The withdrawal tax should potentially apply only if the withdrawal by a member is from a superannuation fund to which an employer has contributed on behalf of that member. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Application of CL 5 Submission (14 – ASFONZ, 16 - Tower) Section CL 3(1)(b) is drafted in such a way that no amounts will ever fall within it. The section should be removed, or re-worded to give effect to the policy behind the section. It should be amended to read: “one that has received a transfer from another superannuation fund in respect of the member withdrawing, not being a transfer to which section CL 5 applies.” Comment Section CL 5 exempts transfers between funds from the withdrawal tax, but this excludes transfers to a defined benefit fund. In the discussion on defined benefit funds officials have recommended that these be subject to the tax. As a result, the provisions to which the submissions refer have been redrafted and the point made in them is no longer relevant. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. 69 Issue: Section placement Submission (19 – ICANZ) Section CL 4(3), (4) and (5) should be located in a more appropriate section, because section CL 4 deals with the extended meaning of “withdrawal”. These subsections state when section CL 3 does not apply. They should be drafted either as an exception to section CL 3 or put into a separate section. Section CL 7(1) is an exclusion to section CL 3 and should be put into that section. Section CL 8(1) is an exclusion to section CL 3 and should be put into that section. Section CL 9 should be incorporated in the principal charging provision section CL 3. Comment Officials agree that the exceptions to section CL 3 should be placed together, in a separate section. We also agree that section CL 9 should be incorporated into the principal charging provision. Recommendation That the submissions be accepted. Issue: Withdrawal tax should not apply where only employee contributions withdrawn Submission (13 – ISI, 14 – ASFONZ, 29W – Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu) Section CL 3 should not apply when the trustee can show that no part of the amount withdrawn was contributed by the employer. The effect of section CL 3(4) as drafted now is not to allow the exemption if only employee contributions are withdrawn. Comment Section CL 3 currently provides that amounts withdrawn will be subject to the withdrawal tax unless the trustee can establish the employer contribution component withdrawn, in which case the tax is limited to that component. The submission is that the withdrawal tax not apply to the tax to the extent the trustee knows the amount withdrawn is from employee contributions. This approach gives a trustee the option of tracking the employee rather than employer contribution, which in some cases may be easier. If any withdrawal does not exceed the amount of any employee contributions, no withdrawal tax will apply. 70 Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Transfers between superannuation funds Submission (14 - ASFONZ) Section CL 5(1) should state that section CL 3 does not apply to an “amount” that is transferred to another superannuation fund. It currently refers to a “withdrawal” that is transferred. Comment The submission is accepted. It would be clearer if the provision referred to an “amount”. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Trustee of transferor fund Submission 2 (14 - ASFONZ) Section CL 5(4) should refer to the trustee of the transferor fund, rather than the fund itself, as having responsibility for determining the degree to which the transfer is composed of employer contributions. Comment Officials agree that the section should refer to the trustee of the fund. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 71 Issue: Treatment of withdrawal if employer elects higher rate of SSCWT Submission (13 – ISI, 14 - ASFONZ) As section CL 7(2) is currently drafted, it would not allow an exemption for “grandparented” amounts or member contributions. Section CL 7(2) should be amended to limit the application of section CL 3 to the amount that would otherwise be subject to the withdrawal tax. Comment The concerns expressed in this submission will be addressed by the proposed insertion of a section at the beginning of the provisions that makes it clear that the tax does not apply to grandparented amounts or member contributions. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Minor drafting error Submission (22 – Watson Wyatt) The first paragraph under section CL 9 should be annotated (1). Comment This submission reflects confusion between the numbering of the proposed sections for the Income Tax Act 1994 and the clause numbering of the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Section numbering Submission (19 - ICANZ) The amendment proposed in section NE 2AA should be included by way of amendment to section NE 2, which already contains an exemption to the standard SSCWT rate. 72 There is also an internal inconsistency. Section NE 3 requires the employer to deduct the amount of SSCWT specified in section NE 2(which is either 33% or nil if section NE 2A applies). Under the proposed section NE 2AA, the employer may elect to “pay” SSCWT at 39%. Which section is right? Therefore, ICANZ recommends that the following amendments be made to section NE 2A: (1) A specified superannuation contribution made to a superannuation fund is subject to specified superannuation contribution withholding tax at the rate specified in Schedule 1, Part A, clause 10, unless either section NE 2A(2) or subsection (3) of this section applies. (2) For the purposes of the SSCWT rules, unless the context otherwise requires, the amount of a specified superannuation contribution shall be deemed to be the aggregate of- (a) the amount of the specified superannuation contribution received by the superannuation fund; and (b) the amount of any specified superannuation contribution withholding tax payable under the SSCWT rules in respect of the contribution. (3) An employer may elect to deduct specified superannuation contribution withholding tax on specified superannuation contributions made to a superannuation fund on or after 1 October 2000 at the rate specified in Schedule 1, Part A, clause 10(a) (4) An employer makes an election under subsection (3) by paying specified superannuation contribution withholding tax at the rate specified in Schedule 1, Part A, clause 10(a). Comment Officials agree with the intention of the suggested provisions, although there may be a better approach to the drafting than that proposed in the submission. Officials therefore recommend: • an amendment to section NE 2 to refer to section NE 2AA; and • an amendment to section NE 3 to refer to either a 33% or 39% deduction rate. This would be specified in either section NE 2 or NE 2AA accordingly. Recommendation That the submission be accepted but that the drafting recommendations to address the concerns raised not be accepted. 73 Issue: Tax recovered from member Submission (22 – Watson Wyatt) Section 165AA(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is to have a formula “tax rate x gross income” with the tax rate defined by reference to Schedule 1, Part A, clause 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. For consistency, section CL 3(1) should be constructed in a similar fashion. That is, instead of stating 15.15%, it should be 5.0% divided by the tax rate stated in Schedule 1, Part A, clause 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Officials consider the submission has merit and agree with the recommendation. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 74 M M U U L L T T I I - - R R A A T T E E F F R R I I N N G G E E B B E E N N E E F F I I T T T T A A X X 75 OVERVIEW OF SUBMISSIONS Submissions received Retail Merchants Association of New Zealand (1) Air New Zealand (5) New Zealand Law Society (6W) Health Funds Association of New Zealand (HFANZ) (10) PricewaterhouseCoopers (12, 12A) New Zealand Employers’ Federation (15) Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand (ICANZ) (19) Corporate Taxpayers Group (21W) General comment Submissions received on the FBT changes have been generally supportive of the proposal to create more equitable FBT rules. More specifically, submitters have noted that the proposal alleviates the long-standing problem of fringe benefits received by low-income employees being overtaxed, while limiting the opportunity for fringe benefits to be used to plan around the 39% top personal tax rate. Although the benefits of the proposal are generally supported, most submissions point out that the multi-rate rules will result in some increase in compliance costs. Under the current rules, employers simply apply a flat rate to the value of fringe benefits they provide. The proposal will require employers to identify the fringe benefits individually received by employees and to calculate the FBT payable, while pooled benefits, in general, will be subject to a flat 49% rate. This issue can be seen solely as a trade-off between equity and compliance costs, and submissions generally recognise that the benefits of accuracy (equity) far outweigh the increased complexity of the calculation involved. In general, officials have supported submissions which presented amendments to improve the clarity of the legislation or indicated changes that reduced compliance costs without a corresponding loss of equity or increase in administration costs. The bill, as introduced, requires the FBT payable to be calculated by using FBT rates equivalent to the total cash remuneration received from the employer providing the fringe benefits. For example, if the employee’s cash remuneration is $55,000, any attributable fringe benefits received by that employee are taxed at the flat rate of 49%, notwithstanding that the value of the fringe benefits may mean that the employee’s marginal tax rate is 39% (an equivalent FBT rate of 64%). Officials propose that the bill be amended so that the value of the attributed benefits is taken into account in calculating the FBT payable on those benefits. Such a change will require substantial drafting changes to the FBT provisions in the bill, and officials seek the Committee’s approval to consult with interested parties such as ICANZ on these proposed changes. 76 INCLUSION OF VALUE OF ATTRIBUTED BENEFITS IN CALCULATION OF FBT PAYABLE Submission (Matter raised by officials) Officials propose that the bill be amended so that the value of the attributed benefits is calculating FBT payable on those benefits. Comment Under the proposed legislation, the FBT liability for attributable benefits is calculated by determining the level of cash remuneration received by the employee concerned and applying the appropriate flat rate (as shown in the table below). Cash remuneration is defined in the bill as salary and wages, extra emoluments, withholding payments, and payments to a specified office holder. All pooled benefits are subject to the flat 49% rate. Table 1 – Method under the proposed legislation Cash remunerationFBT rate to apply Less than $38,00027% $38,000 to $60,00049% Over $60,00064% Officials have identified two problems with this approach: • The major consequence identified is that because the FBT rate applied is a flat rate, a $1 increase in remuneration could result in employers having to pay an increased rate of FBT on all the fringe benefits they provided. This creates inefficiencies in remuneration decisions in that a $1 pay increase could cost an employer more than $1 in increased FBT liability. • A secondary consequence of this approach is that it may result in some level of tax avoidance by employers and employees negotiating to cap cash remuneration below a tax threshold (such as $37,999 or $59,999). By structuring remuneration packages in this way, employers would be liable for payment of FBT at a lower rate. Officials have identified an alternative approach called the “net remuneration” method whereby the value of attributed benefits is taken into account in calculating the FBT payable on those benefits. The calculation proposed results in fringe benefits passing through progressive tax bands (akin to income subject to PAYE), and thus the problems of applying flat FBT rates are avoided. Put another way, the proposed calculation results in the same amount of tax being paid as if the entire remuneration package was cash, irrespective of the proportion of fringe benefits in the package. This method, therefore, has the advantage of not impacting on employment package decisions. 77 The steps involved in the net remuneration method are explained in table 2. Table 2 – Net remuneration method The following steps summarise the method: 1. Take the net cash remuneration of an employee (after the PAYE assessed is deducted). 2. Add the taxable value of all attributable fringe benefits to this amount. 3. Use the “tax exclusive” scale to calculate the total tax payable on this amount. 4. Subtract from the total tax payable amount the PAYE assessed – the difference being the FBT due for that employee. Table 3 – Tax rates and tax payable under the method “Net” income including fringe benefits (statutory tax bands in brackets) Grossed-up tax rate (statutory rate in brackets) Tax payable (cumulative) 00 18% (15) 8,075 (9,500)1,425 27% (21) 30,590 (38,000)7,410 49% (33) 45,330 (60,000)14,670 64% (39) The calculation would apply as follows: Salary$55,000 Less PAYE13,020 Net salary 41,980 Plus value of attributed fringe benefits7,000 Net value of salary 48,980 Tax payable17,006 Less PAYE13,020 FBT payable $3,986 78 This proposal will increase compliance costs for employers as they will be required to undertake the calculation for each employee who receives attributed benefits rather than determine for each employee the flat FBT rate to apply to the value of attributed benefits based on their cash remuneration. Officials consider that the increase in compliance costs is offset by the increased accuracy and by eliminating the significant FBT liability that may arise where an employee’s remuneration crosses a threshold owing to overtime or a salary adjustment. We have discussed this proposal with ICANZ, the Employers’ Federation and the tax adviser to the Committee. They have indicated their support for this change. Inland Revenue is looking at ways of providing employers with the necessary information (such as tax tables) to undertake this calculation and thereby reduce compliance costs. Recommendation That a fringe benefit inclusive definition of cash remuneration be used to calculate FBT liability as outlined in the net remuneration method above. 79 CHANGING FBT TO AN EMPLOYEE-BASED TAX Submission (15 – New Zealand Employers’ Federation – issue not in bill) The employees receiving the fringe benefits and not the employers providing them should be liable for FBT. It is “quite bizarre” that employers are liable for the tax impost on a form of remuneration to employees, and as such the FBT rules are inconsistent with the PAYE rules, where employees are taxed on their gross income. Therefore FBT should be taxed in the hands of employees so that the fringe benefits received are taxed at the appropriate rate. Comment There are difficult and substantial issues to consider when a tax liability is moved from the employer to the employee. Fringe benefits are a different form of remuneration from income subject to PAYE, in that many benefits are not readily substitutable for cash as the benefit that an employee receives may be at best, an indirect form of remuneration. For example, an employee may not want use of the company car over the weekend, but may under the terms of his or her employment be required to take the car home because of a lack of parking at work. The taxable value of a fringe benefit may not represent the actual worth of the benefit to the employee. Furthermore, as fringe benefits necessarily have to be grossed up to be taxed (unlike cash, where tax can be withheld), subjecting employees to FBT would see their net cash incomes decrease to pay their FBT liability. This change would also have significant consequential effects on social policy entitlements. The multi-rate proposal in this bill reflects Government policy of retaining FBT as an employer-based tax, but in doing so, taking account the remuneration derived by employees receiving the benefits. Under the proposal, the benefits that can be attributed to individual employees are taxed at a more appropriate rate than had been the case with the previous flat FBT rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 80 TRANSITIONAL PERIOD Submission (10 – HFANZ, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) Both submissions question the need for a compulsory 64% rate in the transitional first quarter of the 2000-2001 year. HFANZ argues that this transitional quarter will add to the complexity of the changes and compliance costs for employers, who will have to apply the 64% rate in the first quarter and then have a choice of rates from the second quarter onwards. PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that the compulsory application of the 64% in the transitional quarter (April to June 2000) is unfair and should not proceed. It argues that while some employers will overpay relative to the new rules in the bill, they will not receive use of money interest. Comment The Taxation (Tax Rate Increase) Act 1999 increased the FBT rate from 49% to 64% with application to fringe benefits provided or granted on or after 1 April 2000. The bill proposes that there be a transitional period for the first quarter of the 2000- 2001 year where the flat 64% rate would apply. This was necessary as employers are required to file a return for the first quarter before the bill is enacted. The transitional period allows Inland Revenue time to redesign returns, make system changes, and inform employers of their new FBT obligations, which contain significant changes from the current FBT rules. This implementation is contingent on the legislation being in place before a return is due. The expected date of enactment of the legislation will be delayed to such an extent that the option of applying 49% or 64% for a quarterly return cannot be implemented for the second quarter. (Note that the expected enactment date is now late August – early September.) This is because any delay in enactment impacts on the ability to implement the changes in terms of completing the necessary technical checking, testing system changes, and the printing and distribution of information to employers. Therefore officials recommend that the transitional period apply to both the first (April to June) and second quarter (July to September) returns for the 2000-2001 year. Any overpayments resulting from the transitional period can be adjusted in the end of year square-up. Recommendation That the submission be declined, and that the application of the compulsory 64% rate be extended to the second quarter of the 2000-2001 year. 81 ATTRIBUTABLE FRINGE BENEFITS Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – ICANZ) Further guidance is required to determine the principle recipient or user of fringe benefits. Currently the bill requires employers to attribute certain benefits to the employee who “principally uses, enjoys or receives the benefit” or to whom the fringe benefit is “principally available.” Further clarification is needed in the legislation to guide employers in how to treat certain scenarios. For example, there is ambiguity in how to treat the situation of two employees having exclusive use of a motor vehicle for half a quarter each. Comment Officials agree that the bill should be clarified to provide guidance to employers. Therefore we recommend clarifying that the principal user is the employee to whom the fringe benefit is used, enjoyed, or available to (against any other employee or employees using, enjoying or having that same benefit available to them in that quarter). In other words, the employer will be required to determine the principle user on a quarterly basis. By requiring employers to attribute the benefit only to the one employee who benefited most from it during the quarter concerned, employers can avoid complicated apportionment calculations to different employees within a quarter. The principal user rule outlined above works in all but one situation, in which some apportionment will be required − where two employees have exclusive use of the same fringe benefit for the same amount of time within the same quarter. In this specific situation, employers should be required to split the value of the fringe benefit equally between the two employees. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and the bill be amended as outlined above. 82 ATTRIBUTION CATEGORIES Issue: Section CI 1(h) benefits Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The “catch-all” category, section CI 1(h) should be able to be broken down into further categories to allow the $1,000 threshold to apply more sensibly. Currently the bill as written will result in employers having to track low-value benefits they provide that fall into category (h) as over a year a number of these low- value fringe benefits could breach the threshold. This is a result of category (h) being a “catch-all” category which can include fringe benefits ranging from inexpensive flowers to more substantial benefits such as car-parks. The alternative approach would therefore be to grant employers the option of breaking-down category (h) benefits into further sub-categories to which the $1,000 threshold would then apply. Comment Officials agree that the proposed threshold of $1,000 could be breached as a result of the accumulation effect of a number of low-value benefits and therefore has the potential to impose compliance costs on employers in tracking low-value benefits. However, breaking-down category (h) benefits into further sub-categories does cause definitional problems in ensuring that all benefits are covered. Furthermore, it would create an opportunity for employees to substitute a wider range of fringe benefits for salary, if the value of those fringe benefits is under the attribution threshold and taxed at the non-attribution rate of 49%. Officials consider that the attribution threshold for category (h) benefits should be increased to $1,500. We have discussed this with the Committee’s tax adviser, who supports an increase. Recommendation That the attribution threshold for category (h) benefits be increased to $1500. Issue: $1,000 threshold for fringe benefit categories Submission (10 – HFANZ) The use of a category threshold of $1,000 is supported but this level should be indexed to account for increases in insurance premiums over time. 83 Comment The Income Tax Act 1994 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 contain numerous thresholds, and none of these thresholds are automatically adjusted each year by an index (such as the CPI). However, a number of thresholds in the Income Tax Act 1994 can be adjusted by Order in Council. This provides some flexibility in increasing such thresholds without the need to amend the legislation. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but the attribution threshold be able to be altered by Order in Council. 84 TAX RETURN FILING Issue: Availability of the 27% filing rate for quarters 1-3 Submission (10 – HFANZ) Under the proposed legislation, employers can choose to apply either the 49% or 64% FBT rate to the taxable value of fringe benefits they provide in the first, second and third quarter returns they make during the year. The 27% rate for attributable fringe benefits can only be applied in the final quarter and yearly square-up. Employers should have the option of using the 27% for their quarterly returns during the year. This option would avoid making employers overpay their FBT during the year and in doing so require them to claim a refund under the square-up at year’s end. Comment Officials recognise that there will be a group of employers who will overpay their FBT liability in the first three quarters. This will occur if a significant number of low- income employees (earning under $38,000) have received attributable fringe benefits. However, allowing all employers to be able to elect a 27% rate will have significant cash-flow implications for the Government. As a result, the Government would need to consider whether it should implement use of money interest rules to minimise this effect. Such rules would increase both compliance costs on employers and administrative costs on Inland Revenue. Currently a significant majority of employers would have an average tax rate closer to 49%. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Option in the final quarter to pay retrospectively the flat 64% rate for prior quarters Submission (6W – New Zealand Law Society) The bill provides employers with three options. If they pay 49% in any quarter they must undertake the end of year square-up, or if they pay 64% in every quarter they can choose either to undertake the square-up or avoid the calculation and pay a flat 64% rate (that is, pay 64% in every return period). At the very least in the first year of the new rules, employers should be able to have the option of paying a flat 64% in the final quarter irrespective of the FBT rate used in prior quarters. In other words, employers should be able to pay 49% in the first three quarters and be able to “top up” these payments to 64%, should they decide by the final quarter, to pay the flat 64% rate. 85 Comment The intention of the bill is to give employers the choice of either opting into the square-up by paying 49% in earlier quarters, or avoiding the square-up altogether but paying 64%. Allowing employers to “top up” payments to 64% at the end of the year would cause significant revenue loss in terms of use of money. Any employer who would have otherwise opted out of the square-up and chosen to use the 64% rate in every quarter would simply use the 49% rate and retain the difference for payment in the final quarter. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Widening the eligibility for annual filing Submission (10 – HFANZ – issue not in bill) FBT is filed quarterly (the most common method), annually, or by income year. The eligibility for employers to move from being quarterly to annual filers should be widened. Such a move would reduce compliance costs for many employers, who would no longer be required to file returns every quarter. Under the changes, annual filers will simply have to decide either to apply the flat 64% rate or undertake the square-up at year’s end. Comment Approximately 18,000 employers are eligible to file annually as their gross PAYE and SSCWT deductions are less than $100,000 per annum. However, only about 2,000 of these employers choose to file annually. We understand that one of the main reasons for this is the imposition of use of money interest charged on FBT returned annually. As part of the changes proposed in the discussion document Less Taxing Tax, this bill removes the imposition of use of money interest from 1 April 2001. Therefore the major barrier preventing more eligible employers moving to annual filing will be removed. Consequently, it is likely that there will be a significant movement by eligible employers from filing quarterly to annually. Furthermore, an increase in the eligibility threshold from $100,000 to $125,000 would only result in a 5 percent increase in the number of employers eligible for annual filing, while an increase to $150,000 would result in a 9 percent increase. Officials consider, therefore, that the removal of the current use on money interest rules will enable a significant number of employers who pay FBT to adopt an annual return. 86 Recommendation That the submission be declined. 87 FINAL QUARTER AS A FINAL TAX Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The legislation lacks explicit guidance that the election either to pay 64% in all quarters or elect into the square-up is irrevocable, with the tax paid in the fourth quarter a “final tax”. An amendment should be made to state explicitly that the election is irrevocable. There are examples of this in other areas of the Income Tax Act 1994. Comment Officials accept that legislation should be clarified to ensure that an employer who elects to pay FBT at the 64% rate in relation to the final quarter could not at a later date seek to undertake a square-up for that year. An employer makes an election by filing and paying FBT at the elected rate. A similar provision is required for employers who file annually and elect the 64% rate. Recommendation That the legislation be clarified to ensure that elections are irrevocable. 88 MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS Submission (19 – ICANZ) Under the proposed legislation, if a major shareholder-employee is a recipient of a pooled fringe benefit, a higher pooled flat rate of 64% will apply, rather than the flat 49% rate for other pooled benefits. From a compliance point-of-view it is more appropriate to have just the 49% rate. Furthermore, the bill assumes that all major shareholder-employees are high-income earners so should be subject to the 64% rate. Comment Major shareholder-employees are different from other employees in that they either have or appear to have some control over remuneration decisions. Therefore major shareholder-employees not only have the incentive but can also have the ability to structure remuneration packages in the most tax-advantageous way. Officials recommend an amendment be made to the bill to allow employers to use two separate pools. Employers could use one pool subject to the 64% rate for any pooled fringe benefits received by a major shareholder-employee, and an optional second pool at the 49% for pooled fringe benefits not received by a major shareholder- employee. Note that a particular pooled benefit could be placed in only one of these pools. For example, if a pooled vehicle was shared by several non-major shareholder- employees it could be placed in the 49% pool. However, that same car used by several employees including a major shareholder-employee would be subject to the 64% rate. All employers under the bill have the option to attribute low-value benefits (that is, below the attribution threshold). Therefore a major shareholder employee with a low or middle income could attribute all the low-value benefits provided, leaving only shared benefits at the 64% rate. Recommendation That the submission be declined, but that the legislation be amended to allow for two pools for pooled benefits as outlined above. 89 SUBSIDISED TRANSPORT CATEGORY Issue: Treatment of subsidised transport Submission (5 – Air New Zealand) Employers are required to attribute subsidised transport provided to employees where the value of the transport is $1,000 or more. Under the fringe benefit tax rules, the value of subsidised transport is calculated as 25 percent of the market value of the travel. Therefore the market value would have to exceed $4,000 per employee per year before the employer would be required to attribute that travel to a particular employee. Air New Zealand submits that fringe benefits in the subsidised transport category should be pooled and taxed at the 49% pooled rate. Furthermore, Air New Zealand submits that the proposed exclusion should apply only where all staff are entitled to the same or similar subsidised travel entitlement. (In their case travel is tied to length of service, not position in the organisation.) This is to prevent subsidised travel being substitutable for salary or wages. The justification made for the submission is that by including subsidised transport as a category where benefits with a value of $1,000 or more have to be attributed, Air New Zealand will incur significant compliance costs in tracking travel provided to staff when in only a minority of situations would the threshold be breached. Furthermore, any employees receiving travel over the threshold could well be subject to the 49% rate (the same as the pooled rate anyway) or the 27% rate (employees earning $38,000 or less). Air New Zealand has advised officials that the compliance costs of changing their systems to identified subsidised travel that should be attributed to employees is: One-off system changes - $22,000 Ongoing staff costs - $17,000 per annum. (This cost is to ensure that the data entered into the system is accurate.) Similar issues arise for Tranz Rail and other airlines. Comment Officials recognise Air New Zealand’s concern about the compliance costs associated with initial systems costs and the ongoing costs of tracking and correlating subsidised travel provided against employee remuneration information. Furthermore, officials note their evidence that owing to the universal nature of their travel entitlement and the employee data provided, there would be no significant difference in revenue from either requiring attribution or exempting this category from attribution and allowing the flat 49% pooled rate to be applied. The analysis provided by Air New Zealand indicates that the additional revenue could be somewhere between $3,172 (10 percent of subsidised travel attributed) and $15, 858 (50 percent of subsidised travel attributed). 90 Against these arguments is the concern that granting an exemption from attribution for the category of subsidised transport could set a precedent for other taxpayers to seek similar exclusions based on compliance cost concerns. Officials recognise that the subsidised transport category is unique in terms of the small number of taxpayers involved as it applies only to employers who are in the business of providing transport. Recommendation That, on balance, an option be granted for fringe benefits in the subsidised transport category to be pooled at 49%. However, this option will be conditional on the entitlement to the benefit being open to all employees on the same terms (including length of service), but cannot be based upon position or rank in the organisation. Any benefits restricted to certain positions, such as managers, will be required to be attributed where the value of the benefit is $1,000 or more. 91 DEDUCTIBILITY OF FRINGE BENEFIT TAX Submission (21W – Corporate Taxpayers Group – issue not in bill) Employers are able to deduct 33 percent of the grossed-up value of the fringe benefits they provide from their income tax. This deduction will not be affected by any changes in the bill. Employers should be able to elect to forgo the deductibility of FBT, however, and in exchange use a reduced FBT rate. The deduction is of little use to employers who are in a tax loss position, and the new 64% rate for benefits attributable to employees earning over $60,000 will simply result in their cashflow being reduced to pay their FBT liability. The deduction they receive will be of little use to them. Comment The issue of forgoing the deductibility of FBT in exchange for a reduced FBT rate is outside the scope of the bill. Furthermore, any move towards this suggestion would be inconsistent with general tax policy of not allowing taxpayers to cash up losses. The Income Tax Act 1994 allows the cashing-up of losses only to offset tax penalties that have been imposed. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 92 RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CALCULATION Submission (19 – ICANZ) Inland Revenue is better placed than employers to undertake the end of year square- up calculation. This would reduce compliance costs on employers by allowing Inland Revenue to use information already provided by employers to determine each employer’s FBT liability and to send out a notice of assessment. Comment Inland Revenue receives monthly schedules setting out the salary and wages employers have provided to their employees. Therefore Inland Revenue has some ability (dependent on each employer filing on time) to determine the level of remuneration each employee is receiving and, by implication, the FBT rate that an employer should apply for the attributable benefits received by each employee. The crucial information that Inland Revenue lacks is which employees received which benefits, and the taxable value of those benefits. Inland Revenue receives from employers the total taxable value of four categories of fringe benefits. Under the proposed changes, employers will be required to file this information, along with their final adjusted assessment, only after the square-up. For Inland Revenue to undertake the calculation on behalf of employers, it would require employers to undertake most of the calculation first, eliminating any compliance and administrative savings. This means employers would be the only body able to value and attribute fringe benefits to the employees concerned and to calculate the total value of pooled benefits. They would then have to file the calculation sheets along with the return to Inland Revenue for processing, which in turn would delay the issuing of assessment notices and the date by which the FBT would have to be paid. Implementing the suggestion would simply result in employers and Inland Revenue doubling up on calculations and would not result in the compliance savings to employers envisaged under the proposal. Therefore officials recommend the submission be declined. Recommendation That the submission be declined 93 CALCULATION OF FBT ON MOTOR VEHICLES Submission (1 – Retail Merchants Association, 15 – New Zealand Employers’ Federation – issue not in bill) The calculation of FBT liability on motor vehicles should be based on depreciated book value, not on a formula based upon original cost price as at present. Comment Original cost price was selected as the basis for the formula to bring certainty, limit compliance costs and avoid the need for ongoing valuations. This decision was based on the 1982 report of the Task Force on Tax Reform and was subsequently endorsed by the 1998 report of the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance. Recommendation That the submission be declined 94 MISCELLANEOUS DRAFTING ISSUES Issue: Multi-rate calculation for attributed fringe benefits Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 19 – ICANZ) Clarification is needed for section ND 1C(1). The section currently states, “An employer who must attribute a fringe benefit must....” PricewaterhouseCoopers submits that this wording should be amended to clarify that employers who elect to attribute must follow the multi-rate rules. Similarly, ICANZ submits that the wording be amended to read “An employer who attributes fringe benefits (either by election or otherwise) must –.“ Comment Officials agree that an amendment is needed to clarify section ND 1C(1) to state that an employer who elects to attribute must follow the multi-rate rules. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Definition of “annual taxable value” Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers – 19 – ICANZ) The term “annual taxable value” should be defined in the bill. Comment Officials believe that the term “annual taxable value” is such a basic concept for employers to work with that it is unnecessary to use an explicit definition in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 95 Issue: Pooling of fringe benefits Submission (19 – ICANZ) Section ND 1B(4) should be amended to make it clear that only benefits in categories outlined in section CI 1(d)-(h) can be pooled. Comment Officials consider that the bill is already clear about which fringe benefit categories must be attributed and, by implication, which can either be attributed or pooled depending on the employer. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Amendment to the requirement to calculate employee cash remuneration Submission (19 – ICANZ) Section ND 1C(1)(a) currently reads that employers attributing fringe benefits must “calculate the cash remuneration the employer pays to the employee to whom the fringe benefit is provided.” The word “pays” should be substituted with “provided” to ensure the paragraph is consistent with the definition of “cash remuneration” in the bill. Comment Officials agree that this change should be made to ensure clarity and consistency in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 96 Issue: Definition of “cash remuneration” for major shareholders Submission (19 – ICANZ) The bill provides a specific definition for “cash remuneration” derived by major shareholder-employees. This definition is wider than for other employees as it includes dividends and interest. An amendment is needed to change the paragraph from reading “cash remuneration.... including dividends and interest” to read cash remuneration plus dividends and interest. As currently drafted, the paragraph implies that dividends and rent are ordinarily seen as being within the term cash remuneration. Comment Officials agree that this amendment should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Annualisation of part-year employees Submission (19 – ICANZ) Employers should not be required to annualise an employee’s remuneration as this calculation may well not equate to an employee’s actual income for the year. If, however, annualisation is required, a minor amendment is needed to section ND 1E(5)(b), which currently reads: ...an employer must – (a) annualise the cash remuneration, excluding an extra emolument; and (b) add to the annualised cash remuneration an extra emolument paid to, credited to or applied on account of the employee in that part of the income year. The references to “an extra emolument” should be changed to “any” extra emolument in both paragraph (a) and (b). Comment Under the proposal, employers are required to annualise the remuneration they provide to employees to ensure that an appropriate FBT rate is applied. For example, if an employee earned $70,000 per annum but ceased employment in that tax year after six months, his or her benefits would be undertaxed, as the 49% FBT rate rather than the 64% rate would apply. 97 Officials recommend that if the fringe benefit inclusive definition of “cash remuneration” is adopted that there is no need to require employers to annualise remuneration as the proposed method in itself increases the accuracy of the calculation. Furthermore, this amendment will reduce compliance costs associated with the calculation. Note, however, that if the definition of cash remuneration remains as under the bill, officials recommend that annualisation is necessary. Officials agree with the proposed drafting changes to section ND 1E(5)(b) that “an extra-emolument” should be replaced with “any extra emolument”. Recommendation That, subject to the fringe benefit inclusive definition of cash remuneration being adopted, employers should not be required to annualise employee remuneration. Officials also recommend that the proposed amendment to section ND 1E(5)(b) be made as outlined above. Issue: Clarification of the threshold Submission (6W – New Zealand Law Society) Clarification is needed in the bill regarding the $1,000 threshold. Section ND 1B(1) requires employers to attribute fringe benefits with a taxable value of more than $1,000, while section ND 1B(4) is concerned with fringe benefits with a taxable value of less than $1,000. Therefore some clarification is needed to guide employers as to how they should deal with fringe benefits of exactly $1,000. Comment Officials agree that clarification is needed and recommend that this is best achieved by amending the bill to state that fringe benefits with a taxable value of $1,000 or more must be attributed. Recommendation That the amendment be made to require attribution if the category has a taxable value of $1,000 or more. 98 Issue: Definition of “cash remuneration” Submission (19 – ICANZ) Currently the definition of “cash remuneration” is contained in section ND 1E(1), which states cash remuneration is “....the cash remuneration paid to, credited to or applied on account of the employee by the employer (employer A) or a related employer....”. This definition is also supplemented by section ND 1E(6), which explicitly lists forms of cash remuneration. For simplicity, the two paragraphs should be incorporated into one definition of cash remuneration. Furthermore, they state that section ND 1E(1) is circular in its use of the phrase “is the cash remuneration...” to define cash remuneration. Comment Officials accept that as currently drafted, the proposed section ND 1E contains two definitions of cash remuneration and therefore should be redrafted. Recommendation: That section ND 1E be redrafted. Issue: Definition of “cash remuneration” and use of the phrase “employer A” Submission (12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) A minor drafting change is needed to subsections ND 1E(2) and ND 1E(3) to reword the phrase “employer A” to avoid any confusion. Comment Officials accept that these provisions as currently drafted do create some confusion and recommend that they be redrafted for clarity. Recommendation That the relevant provisions be redrafted to provide clarity. 99 Issue: Payment of FBT every quarter Submission (19 – ICANZ) A minor amendment is needed to section ND 2(2) to replace the conjunction “and” between paragraphs (a) and (b) with “or” so that only one of the paragraphs needs to be met before the section does not apply. Comment Officials agree that this amendment should be made. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Section numbering Submission (19 – ICANZ) Sections ND 1 and ND 2 should be renumbered in line with Rewriting the Income Tax Act: Objectives, Process, Guidelines as set out by the Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976. The approach in the bill of using alphabet suffixes for new sections is contrary to these drafting guidelines. Therefore the entire subpart should be renumbered from ND 1 to ND 12. Comment Officials agree that in this instance, it is practical and user-friendly to renumber Subpart ND. However, sections in Subpart ND that were not amended by the bill cannot simply be renumbered here. These sections must be re-enacted, and the other sections in other Parts of the Act require amendment to refer to the new section numbers proposed. We note that in cases where one or two sections are being inserted, alphabet suffixes are the only way to insert new sections, irrespective of whether this is contrary to drafting guidelines. This approach is used in all statutes. The only difference with the Income Tax Act 1994 is that the alpha prefix in the alpha-numeric numbering system compounds the problem. Recommendation That the submission be accepted and Subpart ND and its references be renumbered. 100 Issue: Use of money interest on FBT Submission (Raised by ICANZ with officials ) The bill provides special rules for determining the commencement date of any use of money interest payment on overpayments of FBT under the multi-rate proposal. As the provision is currently drafted, an employer is not entitled to any interest if an overpayment is made during the first three quarters. Comment Officials agree that if an employer overpays FBT for any of the first three quarters, interest will not be payable by the Commissioner on that overpaid tax. The policy intention was that use of money interest would not apply if employers overpaid their FBT in the first three quarters if they were entitled to a refund in the last quarter as a result of the square-up. Likewise, no interest is payable on any underpayment on the first three quarters because of the square-up. However, an employer should be entitled to use of money interest on any overpayment of tax for any of the first three quarters if the overpayment was due, for example, to a calculation error. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. Issue: Amendment to section ND 2 Submission (Raised by ICANZ with officials ) A drafting amendment is required for section ND 2. Subsection 2 states that the section as a whole does not apply to an employer who elects to undertake the square- up, but subsection 2(A) goes on to outline the requirements for forwarding a return to the Commissioner for those employers who do undertake the square-up. Comment Officials agree that an amendment is required to section ND 2(2) to state that only subsection (1), not the entire section, does not apply to employers who pay fringe benefits tax in accordance with sections ND 1C and ND 1D. Recommendation That the submission be accepted. 101 ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY OFFICIALS Issue: Two due-dates Submission (Matter raised by officials) The bill should be amended so that all returns for the final quarter are due on 31 May, irrespective of whether an employer opts to pay the flat 64% rate or undertakes the square-up. Comment As drafted, the bill provides two due dates for the final quarter. Employers who choose to apply the 64% flat rate are required to file, in line with the three earlier quarters, by the 20 th day of the month following the end of the quarter (20 April). Employers who undertake the square-up have until 31 May to file their return. The purpose of allowing employers an extension to 31 May is to recognise that some employers may require more time to complete the new calculation. Administratively, it is unworkable to have two due dates for the end-of-year return, and as such officials recommend all employers have until 31 May to file their return (irrespective of whether they choose to undertake the square-up). Recommendation That all fourth quarter returns be due on 31 May. Issue: Rate for fringe benefits received by associates of a major shareholder employee Submission (Matter raised by officials) The FBT payable on any fringe benefits received by associates of major shareholder- employees who do not themselves have an employment relationship with the employer concerned should be calculated on the same basis used for the major shareholder-employee. Comment Under the proposed legislation, any attributable fringe benefits received by an associate of a major shareholder-employee, where the associate is not themselves an employee, are taxed at the same FBT rate (27%, 49% or 64%) as had the benefit been received by the major shareholder employee. 102 Officials recommend that if the fringe benefit inclusive definition of cash remuneration is adopted, employers add the fringe benefits received by the associate to the cash remuneration of the major shareholder-employee to calculate the FBT payable. Example Major shareholder-employee and their associate Net cash (such as salary, extra-emoluments, dividends)$50,000 Taxable value of fringe benefits of major shareholder-employee$20,000 Taxable value of fringe benefits of the associate $ 5,000 Total remuneration to calculate FBT liability from$75,000 A further issue is that pooled benefits received by non-employed associates are currently proposed to be taxed at the general pooled rate of 49% where the major shareholder-employee does not receive the pooled benefit. Officials recommend that pooled benefits received by an associate (without their own employment relationship) be subject to the same rules as if the pooled benefit had been received by the major shareholder-employee and therefore should be taxed at 64%. Recommendation That the FBT due on attributable fringe benefits received by non-employee associates of major shareholder employees added to the remuneration of the major shareholder- employee as outlined above. Furthermore, any pooled benefits received by non- employee associates of major shareholder employees should be included in the 64% pool. Issue: Description of filing requirements Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section ND 2(2A) should be amended to a less prescriptive provision to eliminate any confusion over filing obligations of employers. 103 Comment Officials are concerned that section ND 2(2A) as drafted, is too prescriptive in form and may lead some employers to believe they must furnish their calculation sheets along with the return. Therefore officials recommend that section ND 2(2A) be redrafted to state simply that employers must calculate their FBT payable in the form prescribed by the Commissioner and return this by 31 May next following the end of the return period. Recommendation That section ND 2(2A) be amended to a more general provision. 104 R R E E M M E E D D I I A A L L I I S S S S U U E E S S 105 FOREIGN INVESTMENT FUNDS RULES AND COMPANY MIGRATION Issue: Value of interest on entry to or exit from foreign investment fund rules Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 24W – M J Kokich, 25W – CJ Smith, 26W – H Lowry, 27W – G O M Gair, 28W- J W Drury) The foreign investment fund rules should be amended so that New Zealand investors who become subject to the foreign investment fund rules because of a company migration are able to elect to value their investments at cost price rather than market value. Comment The submissions consider the case when the shares in a company decrease in value in the period before the company migrates from New Zealand, and then increase in value once the interest is subject to the foreign investment fund rules. They suggest it is inequitable that, even though a loss may be made over the entire period in which the shares are held, the pre-migration capital loss will be non-deductible if the shares were acquired as a long term investment, while any gain following migration will be subject to tax under the foreign investment fund rules. From a policy perspective, officials do not agree that this result is inequitable. When taxpayers acquire shares under this scenario, it is in the knowledge that the anticipated capital growth from holding the shares would not be taxable, and that any losses would be non-deductible. That the company migrates following a fall in its share value should not provide a windfall gain to shareholders by allowing them to access pre-migration losses. It would be, however, inequitable that existing shareholders should receive a benefit that is not available to shareholders who sold their holding pre-migration. Such shareholders were not able to offset their capital losses against future foreign investment fund income, as is being proposed by the submission- makers. Subjecting the investment to the foreign investment fund rules recognises that following migration, New Zealand is no longer able to tax the economic income of the New Zealand shareholders by taxing the company directly. Instead, the income must be taxed indirectly in the hands of the shareholders. The only way that the pre- migration and post-migration income can properly be identified is if market value at the time of migration is used when calculating post-migration income or losses. It is also an established tax principle that when assets move from one set of tax rules to another, they do so at market value. The submissions note that when the current foreign investment fund rules were introduced in 1992, transitional rules allowed investors to choose whether to enter the rules on the basis of cost or market value at the time the rules took effect. They suggest this provides a strong precedent for doing likewise with the current amendments. 106 Officials do not agree with this proposition. An important distinction with the 1992 transitional rules was that they introduced a fundamentally new way of taxing foreign income. It was considered appropriate in that context that transitional rules should be implemented. By contrast, the current amendments are being made to rules for taxing foreign income that have now been in place for almost eight years. It is established principle that the income accruing in foreign investment funds is taxed as it arises. Using market value for entry into the rules when a company migrates ensures that only the income or loss accruing once the company has migrated is brought to account under the foreign investment fund rules. This separate treatment of pre-migration and post-migration gains and losses ensures consistency with the separate established policies for taxing shares in resident and non-resident companies respectively. Officials consider it appropriate, therefore, that the foreign investment income or losses should continue to be calculated based on the market value of an interest at the date a company migrates, as is established in the bill. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Exemption for publicly listed entities on recognised exchanges Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers, 21W – Corporate Taxpayer Group) An exemption from the foreign investment fund rules should be provided for interests held in publicly listed companies. Comment The submissions suggest that the foreign investment fund rules were enacted to prevent New Zealand residents deferring or avoiding New Zealand tax by accumulating income in offshore funds. They suggest that because publicly listed companies pay dividends regularly and the shareholders are not able to control the distributions from the company, there is no opportunity for deferral of income. In officials' view, the submission fails to address the fundamental policy behind the foreign investment fund rules, namely that the rules aim to remove distortions in the investment decisions of our residents, by measuring and taxing the economic income of New Zealand shareholders from foreign companies as it accrues. Merely because a company is listed and its shareholders have no control over their dividend flows does not remove the incentive for investors to acquire shares in that company because its tax treatment may be concessionary compared to that of a New Zealand company. Thus such an exemption for publicly listed companies would be contrary to the policy rationale of the foreign investment fund rules. 107 To illustrate by way of example, companies resident in Singapore are taxed on their Singapore income at 26%. Significantly, however, there are a number of incentives available to companies investing in Singapore that will have the effect of reducing this rate. Singapore also does not tax companies on income earned from outside Singapore, except when it is received in Singapore. As one submission acknowledges, publicly listed companies typically do not distribute all of their income by way of dividends. This means that merely taxing the dividend flow will not be sufficient to capture the tax benefits implicitly accruing to the New Zealand shareholders. If the foreign investment fund rules did not apply to such interests, shareholders of that company could benefit significantly from the more relaxed tax treatment afforded that company than to a New Zealand resident company. It is also relevant to note that not all listed entities pay dividends, and shareholders should be aware of an entity’s distribution policy prior to investment. Officials do not agree that an exemption from the foreign investment fund rules should be extended to all publicly listed company. Such an exemption would clearly be contrary to the policy intent of the rules. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Removal of loss quarantining Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited) The requirement that foreign investment fund losses cannot be offset against non- foreign investment fund income, but can only be carried forward and offset against future foreign investment fund income, should be removed. Comment The submission notes that foreign investment fund losses are currently quarantined; they can only be offset against ordinary income to the extent that foreign investment fund income has previously been returned. The foreign investment fund rules have been the subject of detailed consideration in the past. They were initially reviewed by the Consultative Committee in 1988 before the original rules were implemented in 1988, and were the subject of significant review and refinement by the Government in 1991 to 1993. The current rules were enacted in 1992. 108 The quarantining of foreign investment fund losses is part of the basic design of the foreign investment fund rules, and was recommended by the Consultative Committee in July 1988. It may be appropriate to review whether the quarantining rules remain appropriate in the context of a broader review of the foreign investment fund rules. Such a review is, however, beyond the scope of the amendments currently under consideration. Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Accounting profits method – exclusion of grey list income Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited) The accounting profits method should be amended to enable shareholders to exclude New Zealand and grey list country income derived by a foreign investment fund from the calculation of foreign investment fund income. Comment The submission suggests that the method of applying the accounting profits method should be changed to allow taxpayers the possibility of excluding income derived by that fund from New Zealand or a grey list country from the calculations. This would recognise that such income would not be taxed in New Zealand if earned directly by a fund resident in New Zealand or a grey list country. The issue here is how accurately one might be able to measure income derived through a foreign entity. For controlled investments, a relatively accurate measurement is obtained, as the controlled foreign company rules require the income of a foreign entity to be re-cast as if the foreign entity were a branch. This approach is, however, impractical for uncontrolled investments, when shareholders are unlikely to have access to sufficient information to enable relevant income calculations to be made. Consequently, the foreign investment fund rules allow taxpayers to choose one of four proxy methods for measuring their foreign investment fund income or loss. It is inherent in the design of the rules that there is a trade-off between attempting to measure income accurately and the ability of taxpayers to comply with the rules. The point raised in the submission addresses a fundamental aspect of the design of the foreign investment fund rules. It may be appropriate to review how income should be measured under the accounting profits and other methods in the context of a broader review of the foreign investment fund rules. Such a review is, however, beyond the scope of the amendments currently under consideration. 109 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Use of branch equivalent tax accounts (BETAs) by individuals Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The application of the branch equivalent tax account (BETA) rules for individuals should be clarified. Comment The BETA mechanism is intended to prevent double taxation of controlled foreign companies and certain foreign investment fund income, which would otherwise arise from tax being imposed both on attribution of income and separately on dividend receipts. The PricewaterhouseCoopers submission notes that when income is attributed to an individual under the foreign investment fund rules before dividends are received, the BETA mechanism operates to alleviate double taxation. However, the submission suggests that when the dividend is received before income is attributed, the application of the mechanism is unclear. The submissions do not elaborate on why the application of the mechanism is unclear. However, from discussions with the submissioners, officials understand that they would like to see similar provisions to the BETA rules for companies, as amended in 1992, extended for use by individuals. Officials note, however, that the current provisions applying to companies operating a BETA are complicated. Extending the model currently applying for companies to individuals would introduce a significant additional layer of complexity to already complex provisions. Officials also note that the perceived problem should not be an issue in the long run, as listed companies typically do not distribute 100 percent of their income and it is reasonable to expect that dividends will be paid after the income is attributed to the shareholder. Even in the transitional year, when it may appear that dividends are being paid before income is attributed, it seems appropriate to argue that those dividends are paid from pre-migration sources, meaning there is no double taxation. On balance, therefore, officials do not consider an amendment to extend the company treatment of BETAs to individuals would be appropriate. 110 Recommendation That the submission be declined Issue: Accounting Profits method – non-standard balance dates Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The calculation of foreign investment fund income is based on the use of one measurement day, 31 March. The legislation should be amended to allow foreign investment fund interest holders using the accounting profits method to calculate their income interest as at the balance date of the foreign investment fund. Comment The submission notes that the calculation of foreign investment fund income is to be based on the use of a single measurement day, 31 March, and was intended as a simplification measure. The submission suggests that the application can pose a problem for foreign investment funds with non-standard balance dates. The submission further notes that for foreign investment funds with non-standard balance dates, it would be necessary to make special information available to shareholders at 31 March to calculate their income interests. The submissions consider that it would be more practical if shareholders were able to calculate their income interest as at the foreign investment funds balance date, as this information could be taken straight from the shareholder information contained in the financial statements. Officials note that the single measurement date is a concessionary rule to reduce the compliance costs associated with having to determine a person's income interest at the end of each quarter in the year. If a person holds an interest in a foreign entity on 31 March, they are treated as having held the interest for the entire year. Conversely, if a taxpayer does not hold an interest on 31 March, they are treated as not having held the interest for any part of the year. March 31 was selected as the single measurement date because it aligns with the end of the income year for taxpayers with standard balance dates. If the submission were to be adopted, it would be necessary to use the balance date test for all foreign investment funds. If taxpayers were given the choice of 31 March or the foreign investment fund's balance date; they could select the date that gives the best tax result. This would be inappropriate. The 31 March date has been used in practice since 1992 without any apparent difficulties. Officials do not consider the argument in the submission to be sufficiently compelling to justify a change in the measurement date. 111 Recommendation That the submission be declined. Issue: Operation of Branch Equivalent Tax Account – minor error Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) There is a minor cross-referencing error in the existing section MF 13(2). This section refers to item “d” of the formula in subsection (1). This should read item “b”. Comment Officials agree that an amendment to correct the cross-reference would be desirable, and consider the amendment should be backdated to the 1997-98 income year, the time from which the current provision was effective. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, with application from the 1997-98 income year. Issue: Increasing the $100,000 deemed rate of return threshold Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The threshold for using the deemed rate of return method currently set at $100,000 should be increased to $250,000 Comment The submissions note that the foreign investment fund rules as originally enacted in 1993 established a maximum threshold of $100,000 for use of the deemed rate of return method. This means that natural persons whose total foreign investment fund interests were below $100,000 can elect to use the deemed rate of return method when calculating foreign investment fund income. This amount has not been increased since that time, despite general increase in other monetary thresholds contained in the tax legislation. Consequently, it is proposed that the threshold should be updated. Officials note that the deemed rate of return method is considered to be the least reliable method for measuring foreign investment fund income, which is why constraints were placed on its use. However, it is the least complicated method, and has the potential for significant compliance cost savings if it can be employed more readily. 112 Officials agree that an increase in the threshold would be appropriate, but because it provides the least reliable measure of income, consider it appropriate that its use should remain restricted to some extent. Exactly what level the threshold should be increased to is a somewhat arbitrary judgement. However, officials consider an increase to $250,000 would be consistent with the aim of reducing compliance costs while still addressing concerns as to the reliability of the method for measuring income. Officials consider that application from the 1999-2000 income year, consistent with the application dates currently in the bill, would be most appropriate. This would enable taxpayers who are calculating foreign investment fund income for the first time in the 1999-2000 income year to use the new threshold for that income year. For taxpayers with existing foreign investment fund income, however, the higher threshold will effectively apply only from the 2001-2002 income year. This reflects that these taxpayers have already made decisions on which method to use to calculate their foreign investment fund income or losses. If taxpayers were now to be able to elect to use the deemed rate of return method for the 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 income years, they would be able to choose the method that gave them the best tax result for those years. This would be inappropriate. Recommendation That the submission be accepted, with an application from the 1999-2000 income year. Issue: Increasing the de minimis exemption from $20,000 Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) The de minimis threshold used to exclude taxpayers with small interests in foreign entities should be increased from its current level of $20,000. Comment The submissions seek an increase in the de minimis exemption threshold below which taxpayers simply return income as it is received. An increase in the threshold is sought on the grounds that it will reduce the compliance costs of taxpayers, and that there has not been an increase since 1992. While both submissions seek an increase in the de minimis threshold, Brierley Investments Limited seeks an increase to $100,000, while PricewaterhouseCoopers seeks an increase only to $50,000. Officials agree that it is appropriate to review the de minimis threshold, in light of the length of time since it was set. Again, the level to which it is adjusted is largely a matter for judgement. Any decrease in compliance costs to taxpayers from an 113 increased threshold must be balanced both against potential revenue loss and the risk that investments up to the threshold are chosen primarily for their tax advantage. Officials consider that if the de minimis threshold were increased to $100,000, the potential revenue loss and the risk of inefficient investment would outweigh any benefit to taxpayers in lower compliance costs. A $50,000 threshold would appear to better balance the competing considerations, although the judgement remains somewhat arbitrary In view of the issues associated with corporate migration, officials recommend as a transitional measure that the de minimis should be increased to $50,000. Representatives of Brierley Investments Limited orally indicated to the Finance and Expenditure Committee that an increase in the de minimis to $50,000 would take out all but approximately 400 of their shareholders. However, the level of and jusitification for a threshold should be reviewed more fully if a future review addresses some of the more fundamental policy underpinning the foreign investment fund rules. It may be that such a review will determine the $50,000 threshold to be too high. Officials consider it appropriate for the increase to apply from the 1999-2000 income year. In the ordinary course of events, however, such a change to the threshold would be made prospectively. In this case, though, if the de minimis threshold were increased prospectively, smaller shareholders affected by corporate migration in the 1999-2000 income year would still need to account for their interests for that year before the increase takes effect. Recommendation That the submission to raise the de minimis threshold to $50,000 be accepted, with application from the 1999-2000 income year. Issue: $20,000 threshold – natural persons and trustees Submission (7 – Brierley Investments Limited, 12A – PricewaterhouseCoopers) It is currently unclear whether the de minimis threshold applies to trustees. Clarity, whether by legislation or Inland Revenue guideline, is sought on this issue. Comment The submission details the situations when the Income Tax Act contemplates whether or not a trustee falls within the definition of a natural person. It suggests that legislative amendment is necessary to clarify whether trustees are to be treated as natural persons in determining whether the de minimis rule applies to trustees. Officials note that the policy intent of the natural persons exemption is not to include trustees. Trusts have a structure more akin to that of a company and so should be 114 excluded from the de minimis exemption. If this were not the case, taxpayers with large interests could potentially take advantage of the de minimis rule by holding their interests through a number of trusts. Officials agree, however, that that it would be desirable to clarify the application of the law. It is proposed, therefore, to make an amendment to put beyond doubt that trustees are not treated as natural persons for foreign investment fund purposes. As the amendment is merely a clarification of existing law, any application date chosen would be somewhat arbitrary. Officials propose that the clarification apply from the 1999-2000 income year, consistent with the application date of the other foreign investment fund amendments in the bill. Recommendation That an amendment be made to clarify that natural persons do not include trustees for the purposes of the foreign investment fund rules, with application from the 1999- 2000 income year. Issue: Miscellaneous drafting issues Submission (19 - Institute of Chartered Accountants of New Zealand) Further amendments should be made to: • clarify that “funds” are included within the scope of the amendments, as well as ‘entities’; • state explicitly that the cost or expenditure of a foreign investment fund when applying the de minimis threshold is based on market value for a migrating entity; • ensure that a migrating company will not have to publish separate sets of pre- migration and post-migration accounts in the year of migration; and • reflect the intent that a gain or loss be crystallised on migration and thereby become assessable or deductible for revenue account shareholders. Comment The submission suggests a number of technical drafting amendments. Officials do not consider, however, that the amendments need to be made and have discussed this with ICANZ. On the first point, officials consider that “funds” are already included within the scope of the amendments. The term "fund" is defined in section OB 1 to be a foreign investment fund for the purposes of the foreign investment fund rules. There is no anomaly in section CG 14(4) referring to "fund or other foreign entity". If an interest 115 in a foreign entity is exempted from the foreign investment fund rules, it does not become a foreign investment fund. Consequently, it is necessary and appropriate to distinguish "fund" from "other foreign entity". Similar considerations apply in the other places where the submission suggests that amendment to include reference to "other foreign entity" is required. On the second submission point, officials note that the de minimis rule in section CG 15(2)(d) applies on the basis of the "cost or expenditure incurred" in acquiring an interest. An amendment is being made in the bill to section CG 14(1) which treats the market value of the interest at the date of migration to be the expenditure incurred in acquiring the interest. Consequently, officials consider the amendments are already clear that the de minimis applies on the basis of the market value of interests at the date of migration. On the third submission point, officials note that the amendment already has the effect of ensuring that a migrating company will not have to publish separate sets of pre-migration and post-migration accounts. The drafting of section CG 12 is wide enough that so its application is not limited to controlled foreign companies. Section CG 12 also covers foreign investment funds for which income is calculated under the accounting profits method. Section CG 12(3), however, makes it clear only that separate accounts are not required for the pre-migration and post-migration periods for controlled foreign companies, or for foreign investment funds when income or losses are calculated under the branch equivalent method. The amendments in the bill, therefore, ensure that similar treatment will apply when foreign investment fund income or losses are calculated under the accounting profits method. On the final submission point, officials note that the deemed disposition and reacquisition applies “for the purposes of this Act”. This means that normal provisions in the Act that would apply if the interest was sold will apply automatically, without the need to set out again in section CG 23 what the normal treatment would be on the disposition of the shares. Recommendation That the submissions be declined. Issue: Sundry issues raised Submission (23W- P L A du Chateau, 24W – M J Kokich, 25W – C J Smith, 26W – H Lowry, 27W – G O M Gair, 28W – J W Drury, 30W - JR Allison, 31W - W J Keith, 32W - G E Trotman) • New Zealand should give an imputation credit for the underlying foreign tax paid on dividends (23W- P L A du Chateau) • Investments in migrating companies should have the same tax treatment as investments in companies registered in New Zealand (26W – H Lowry). 116 • Shareholders who have held shares in a company for at least five years when the company migrates on the day of migration should be exempted from the foreign investment fund rules (28W- J W Drury). Submissioners also commented that: • A capital gains tax has no place in the New Zealand situation (23W- P L A du Chateau). • A small minority should not be penalised by a regime that was designed to control large overseas investors (23W- P L A du Chateau). • Family Trusts are unjustly penalised as the de minimis exemption only applies to natural persons (28W- J W Drury). Consideration should be given to also applying the exemption to trustees (32W - G E Trotman). • It is inconsistent that New Zealand welcomes overseas investment but penalises outward investment by taxing unrealised capital gains under the FIF rules (31W - W J Keith). Comment These issues have largely been dealt with elsewhere in the report. On specific points, however, officials note that: • As imputation credits are only designed to prevent double New Zealand taxation of company profits, they do not extend to foreign taxes. • An exemption from the foreign investment fund rules for shareholders who have held their shares for five years when a company migrates would be contrary to the intent of taxing economic income as it accrues. There is also no policy reason for such an exemption. • The de minimis threshold exempts taxpayers from the foreign investment fund rules at a level where the costs of compliance and administration are considered to outweigh any potential revenue loss and the risk that investments up to the threshold are chosen primarily for their tax advantage. Extending this exemption to family trusts would enable the establishment of several trusts, all for the benefit of one individual in order to receive multiple exemptions. This would be contrary to the intent of the de minimis rule. 117 AMALGAMATION PROVISIONS Submission (PricewaterhouseCoopers) There are no provisions in the bill regarding the amalgamation regime. However, there are several provisions in the Income Tax Act 1994 relating to the amalgamation of companies which require clarification. The provisions are: • section IF 6, dealing with the entitlement of an amalgamated company to carry forward net losses, attributed foreign net losses and foreign investment fund net losses upon amalgamation; • section FE 7(3), dealing with consideration to be included in an amalgamating company's base price adjustment calculation upon amalgamation, section FE 6(7) and section FD 10(4A). Comment The submission seeks changes to the provisions in the Income Tax Act which deal with the amalgamation of companies. There is no provision in the bill relating to the amalgamation regime. Even if the Government considers the submission has merit, the proposed changes should not be inserted at the select committee stage of a bill. Other tax practitioners and taxpayers should have the opportunity to consider, and make submissions on, proposed changes to the Income Tax Act. The submission should be considered as part of the tax policy work programme, and go through the generic tax policy process. Recommendation That the submission be declined. 118 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENTS TO INCOME TAX ACT 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section CC 1(1)(bb) should be amended to refer to section 188(1)(a) of the Accident Insurance Act 1998. Comment Section CC 1(1)(bb) was amended by the Accident Insurance Amendment Act 2000. The amendment was meant to insert the words “(as it read before its repeal by section 7 of the Accident Insurance Amendment Act 2000)” after the reference to section 188(1)(a) of the Accident Insurance Act 1998. However, the amendment substituted those words rather than inserted them. Officials consider that the correcting amendment should apply from 1 July 2000, the date from which the original amendment is to come into force. Recommendation That section CC 1(1)(bb) be correctly amended. 119 MINOR REMEDIAL AMENDMENT TO TAX ADMINISTRATION ACT 1994 Submission (Matter raised by officials) Section 44A should be amended to correctly refer to “taxable income”. Comment Section 44A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 incorrectly refers to a taxpayer’s “net income”. It should refer to a taxpayer’s “taxable income”. Officials consider that the reference should be corrected with the effect from 17 November 1998, the date from which the section took effect. Recommendation That section 44A be corrected from 17 November 1998.
POLICY ADVICE DIVISIONTHE TREASURY 1 24 July 2000 Mr Mark Peck, MP Chairperson Finance and Expenditure Committee Parliament Dear Mr Peck Officials were requested to provide further advice to the Committee on several outstanding issues for your deliberation on the Taxation (FBT, SSCWT and Remedial Matters) Bill. The issues are as follows: Superannuation fund withdrawal tax issues • Whether a non-life annuity should be exempt from the withdrawal tax only if it is for a minimum of ten years, rather than five years. • Whether, in relation to a member who is taking “partial retirement”, an objective test of a member’s intention not to increase their hours of work is needed. Officials have also identified several minor changes regarding the superannuation fund withdrawal tax for the Committee to consider. Multi-rate fringe benefit tax issues • Whether employers should be allowed to top up their earlier FBT payments retrospectively to 64% if they are unable to undertake the square-up calculation. Officials have also identified a minor change regarding multi-rate FBT for the Committee to consider. As outlined further in this letter, ICANZ has now stated that it is fundamentally opposed to the proposed amendment to the multi-rate calculation to add the value of attributed fringe benefits to cash remuneration in this bill. However, officials consider that the rationale for this amendment still stands. Officials have prepared two slips for the Committee’s deliberation, one with the official’s recommendation to include the value of fringe benefits in the multi-rate calculation, and the other (Slip #2) without. 2 Superannuation fund withdrawal tax Officials consulted on the draft legislation with the Investment Savings and Insurance Association (ISI) as instructed by the Committee. Also as requested by the Committee, officials discussed the issue of a minimum ten-year payment period for annuities and the intention test under the partial retirement exemption. Extension of the length of exempt non-life annuity payments In the Officials’ Report, officials recommended to the Committee that withdrawals in the form of a non-life annuity that provides a payment over not less than five years be exempt from the withdrawal tax (See Officials’ Report, p.27). The Committee instructed officials to provide further advice on whether the payment period should be increased to not less than ten years. ISI accepted a ten-year period but requested that the exemption also apply to pensions payable over 10 years or life. This is on the basis that the purchase of a non-life annuity over ten years is identical in substance to a fund paying a pension over similar terms. Officials recommend the exemption include a non-life annuity for a period of no less than ten years and pensions payable for at least ten years. Intention test for “Partial Retirement” Officials were instructed to consider whether an objective test is needed to ascertain employees’ intentions not to increase hours of work following partial retirement (See Officials’ Report, p.33). The ISI was concerned that a move towards a more objective test to determine intention would place a significant obligation on trustees, would require considerable amounts of information to be provided to trustees, and in the end would still require a judgement on a member’s intention. The approach of requiring a statutory declaration was considered, but rejected, given the sufficient ability to impose penalties under the Tax Administration Act 1994. The ISI instead recommended that there be a notice in writing provided by the member which includes a statement from the member’s employer or employers that there is no understanding to raise the employee’s hours of work. Officials agree this provides an increase in objectivity with a lesser compliance cost impact on superannuation funds and members. Officials recommend that a member be required to provide a statement in writing to the trustee. If the Committee wants more confidence around this election a statement from the member’s employers, as suggested by the ISI, could be required. 3 Other issues discussed While the discussion with the ISI concerned the draft legislation, it alerted officials for the need to recommend a number of minor changes in policy. These are: • The transitional provision relating to employers who elect the 39% SSCWT rate after 1 October 2000 should be removed as it is confusing and provides little value given the ability of each employee to decide whether to elect that rate. • Additional rules relating to superannuation funds who are also members of a superannuation fund or a superannuation scheme are required. These measures reduce the compliance costs imposed on superannuation funds by removing the need for information to be transferred in cases where that information is not necessary. • To increase the period in which a superannuation fund has to transfer information to another superannuation fund from 20 to 40 days given that the fund required to provide information may in turn have to request that information from a third party. • The reserves included in the definition of employer contributions to superannuation savings should be narrowed in the case of superannuation funds with ten or more unassociated members. The ISI also made the comment that the structure of the legislation is clearer and that it is pleased with the opportunity to comment on the draft legislation. Multi-rate fringe benefit tax Ability for employers to top-up earlier payments retrospectively to 64% if unable to undertake the square-up calculation. Officials and the Specialist Tax Adviser were asked to report back to the Committee to clarify and provide an agreed position on the issue of employers who find themselves unable to undertake the square-up calculation. This could occur due to the employer having inadequate records or systems in place with the expected enactment date of the legislation being part-way through the current income year. The issue was raised in the submission of the New Zealand Law Society (See Officials’ Report, p.84) and was endorsed by the Committee’s Tax Adviser. The submission was that, at least in the first (transitional) year, employers who use the 49% rate instead of the 64% rate in quarter 3 should be able in the final quarter to avoid the mandatory square-up if they find they are unable to undertake the calculation. Such a scenario could occur for the following reasons: • The employer may have inadequate records. Employers can only be informed with certainty over the detail of their obligations and requirements for record-keeping once the legislation has been enacted. The likely date of enactment will not occur until part- way through the current income year which commenced on 1 April 2000; and 4 • The square-up calculation is new. As the square-up calculation is new to all employers and their advisers, employers could use the 49% rate in quarter 3 believing that they can undertake the square-up, but then find their records are incomplete. The original recommendation by officials was to decline the submission on the grounds the intention of the bill is to provide employers with a broad choice between either using the 64% rate in every quarter or opting into the square-up. Allowing employers to knowingly use the 49% rate and then “top up” in the final quarter would result in revenue loss in the form of use- of-money by those employers who would otherwise use the flat 64% rate (as no use-of- money-interest would apply). After discussions with the Committee and its Tax Adviser, officials agree that this issue needs to be reconsidered. The extension of the transitional period to quarter 2 means that an employer’s decision in quarter 3 whether to use the 49% or 64% rate will determine whether they are required or can choose to undertake the square-up. Some employers may use the 49% but then find they cannot physically undertake the calculation (for the reasons discussed above). Officials view this as a one-off transitional issue, as employers will in future years have the experience and/or ability to seek advice on whether it is appropriate for them to opt into the square up. In accepting the submission, the issue could be solved either by an amendment to the bill stating that in the 2000-2001 income year such a top-up could be made where the square-up could not be physically undertaken, or administratively, with Inland Revenue adopting a pragmatic approach and accepting such an adjustment. Employers who did top up their FBT payments would pay either the same or more FBT than they would under the square-up. Employers will not be subject to a shortfall penalty for lack of reasonable care, as their final quarter liability will be equal to or greater than their liability had they undertaken the square- up calculation. A shortfall penalty can only be imposed if there is a tax shortfall because of a lack of reasonable care. Officials recommend that this issue be dealt with legislatively and consider that such a transitional rule will not increase the complexity of the multi-rate FBT rules for employers. Final FBT return when employer ceases employing Under the bill, an employer is required to undertake the square-up process at the end of the quarter in which the employer ceases employing. Given that employers can continue to provide fringe benefits to past employees, officials recommend that this provision should only apply when the employer ceases employing and does not provide fringe benefits to past employees. 5 Update on the proposed change to the multi-rate calculation to add the value of attributed benefits to cash remuneration The proposed amendment to the multi-rate calculation ensures that remuneration, whether in the form of cash or fringe benefits, is subject to the same amount of tax. In the Officials Report (p.76-78) we indicated that ICANZ and the Employers’ Federation had indicated their support for the proposal. In further discussions, ICANZ has now informed officials that it is “fundamentally opposed” to the proposed change to the multi-rate calculation being included in this bill. ICANZ considers that including the value of attributed fringe benefits increases compliance costs significantly, and should therefore be subject to further consultation. Officials disagree with this position as the consequences outlined in the Officials’ Report of not including the value of attributed fringe benefits still stand. Specifically, the consequences from not amending the legislation to include the value of attributed fringe benefits are that: • There would be potential inefficiencies in that a $1 increase in cash remuneration could result in more than a $1 increase in FBT liability (owing to fringe benefits being subject to a flat rate at each cash remuneration threshold rather than through progressive rates as would be achieved by the amendment). • There would be potential for tax avoidance as excluding the value of benefits would result in FBT liability being based on cash remuneration only and not total remuneration. Therefore the exclusion would allow the structuring of remuneration packages below a higher tax threshold (such as $37,999 or $59,999). The remainder of the package would be in the form of fringe benefits taxed at a flat rate based on the band in which the last $1 in cash remuneration falls. Officials do recognise there will be an increase in compliance costs in undertaking the calculation, but these costs are mitigated to some extent by the removal of the requirement to annualise remuneration under the proposal in the bill. Officials consider that the change in the multi-rate calculation by adding the value of attributed fringe benefits to cash remuneration will need to be implemented. By delaying implementation, employers and Inland Revenue will have to go through systems changes twice. Officials consider it more practical to implement the proposal fully so there is only one change to employers’ and Inland Revenue’s systems. Furthermore, officials consider that the proposal is developed to such an extent that further consultation will not result in any substantial changes. Officials therefore recommend that the proposal to include the value of attributed fringe benefits in the multi-rate calculation proceed in the bill. Officials have prepared two slips for the Committee’s deliberation, one including the value of fringe benefits in the multi-rate calculation, and the other without. 6 Officials recommend that a copy of this letter should be made available when the bill is reported back to the House to indicate that ICANZ did not support including the value of attributed fringe benefits.

A .5 Government Response to the Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee on Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department Presented to the House of Representatives in accordance with Standing Order 248 (1) Government Response to the Report of the Finance and Expenditure Committee on its Inquiry into the Powers and Operations of the Inland Revenue Department Introduction The Government welcomes the report o f the previous Finance and Expenditure Committee, which provides a valuable contribution to improving various operational aspects o f the Inland Revenue Department. The Committee commenced its Inquiry in April 1999: • following a growing public concern over the manner in which the Inland Revenue Department conducted its operations • with an intention to assess the impact of, and holding the Government accountable for, the compliance and penalties legislation. The terms o f reference for the Inquiry included reviewing the: • powers o f the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue • application of the compliance and penalties regime • department’s debt management practices • feasibility and desirability o f establishing a tax ombudsman • department’s structure, operation and culture. The Committee’s Inquiry was completed in October 1999. The Committee’s recommendations are comprehensive and are intended to improve the integrity of, and the public’s confidence in, the tax system. The Government and Inland Revenue are particularly concerned with maintaining public confidence in, and the integrity of, the tax system1. New Zealand's tax system is based on voluntary compliance, which can be eroded by perceived lack of fairness of, or inappropriate actions taken by, the tax administration. The Government supports most o f the recommendations made by the Committee and has instructed Inland Revenue to proceed with the consideration and implementation o f the agreed recommendations. These include two Machinery o f Government recommendations that the Government and associated agencies still have to consider and make decisions upon. The Government can report that Inland Revenue has made good progress in considering and implementing the Committee’s recommendations since the release of the Committee’s final report. 1 Sections 6(1 ) and 6(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 charges Ministers and officials of Inland Revenue with the responsibility of protecting the integrity of the tax system. 2 A number o f the recommendations have been addressed, and Inland Revenue is undertaking work on the remaining recommendations. Some o f this work is being undertaken within the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties rules. This review, which commenced in October 1999, will assess the impact of the legislation on the public and present policy options for discussion. A Government discussion document is planned for release in February 2001. Depending on the extent o f the submissions made by the public and subsequent Government decisions there could be changes to legislation. Attached, as Appendix One, is an update on the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. The Government recently introduced three amendments improving the fairness o f the current compliance and penalty rules. These amendments are part of the Government’s response to some o f the issues raised in the Finance and Expenditure Committee’s Inquiry. The amendments are: • reducing the incremental penalty from 2% a month to 1% a month on late paid tax • increasing the “grace” period before use-of-money interest starts • standardising the serious hardship and financial difficulty provisions across most taxes. Specific information about the Government’s response to each recommendation is outlined below. The Government responds to the Finance and Expenditure Committee's report in accordance with the general requirements of Standing Order 248 (1) but taking into account the dissolution of the 45th Parliament within the timeframe prescribed in Standing Order 248 (1). Recommendations and the Government’s Response Recommendation 1 The Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to provide a clear four-year time bar in relation to all taxes except where the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has reasonable grounds to suspect a return to be fraudulent or wilfully misleading. Response The Government considers this recommendation restates the current law in relation to assessments issued by the Commissioner. However, the Government is concerned that in cases where an assessment or amended assessment is issued just before the expiration of the four-year time bar, the time in which a taxpayer can discuss that assessment is truncated. This issue will be considered as part o f the post-implementation review o f the compliance and penalties legislation. 3 In the meantime, the Commissioner must be mindful that assessments should be as accurate as the information available allows and that before issuing a complex assessment all possible opportunities for discussion with a taxpayer should be exercised. Discussion with taxpayers in the pre-assessment phase allows taxpayers and Inland Revenue to endeavour to resolve potential matters through a process which is informal, simple, and low cost. The Government is also concerned with the problem identified by taxpayers that, on occasions, insufficient information is provided to taxpayers showing how and why amendments have been made. The Government has asked Inland Revenue to review the information provided to taxpayers at the time o f issuing assessments in order to ensure that taxpayers understand the basis o f the assessment. Recommendation 2 The burden of proof remain with the taxpayer, but that consideration be given to establishing a “test” for the Inland Revenue Department to meet to ensure that only properly calculated and substantiated amended assessments are issued to complying taxpayers. Response The Government agrees that the burden o f proof should remain with the taxpayer. This position is consistent with the view o f the Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance2 (the Committee of Experts). The Committee of Experts considered that the onus o f proof in all civil proceedings should remain with the taxpayer - except for civil penalties for evasion (as is currently the case). The Committee of Experts observed that if a taxpayer challenges an assessment the taxpayer is required to prove not only that the Commissioner's assessment is wrong, but also by how much it is wrong. It was recommended that the law should be clarified expressly to provide that if a taxpayer can prove on the balance o f probabilities that the Commissioner’s assessment is excessive by at least a certain amount, the court should reduce the Commissioner’s assessment by that amount. This issue will be considered as part of the post-implementation review o f the compliance and penalties legislation. In all cases, except those involving a minor error, the original assessment is based on information contained in returns furnished by complying taxpayers. Any amendments to these assessments are issued on the basis o f agreement between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue or following the disputes resolution process. This process provides a “test” to ensure that assessments are properly calculated and substantiated. Report to the Treasurer and Minister o f Revenue by a Committee of Experts on Tax Compliance, December 1998. 4 In December 1999, the department completed a review of the disputes resolution process to assess how it operates in practice and has made recommendations to improve the overall process. These recommendations included: • redesigning and simplifying some administrative parts o f the disputes resolution process • ensuring that the disputes resolution process operates in a more timely manner • clarifying the rules for taxpayer-initiated disputes. The implementation timetable for these recommendations is currently being developed. As noted under the response to recommendation 1, the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation is considering ways o f ensuring taxpayers have the opportunity to dispute a decision when an assessment is made just prior to the expiration o f the four-year time bar. In addition, there may be concerns with the reasonableness o f assessments issued and the information provided to non-complying taxpayers. The Commissioner o f Inland Revenue can issue "default assessments" when a tax return has not been filed by the taxpayer or the Commissioner is not satisfied with the tax return made. Although there are processes and rules in place to establish what a reasonable basis is for issuing these assessments and for informing taxpayers o f their basis, the Government has asked Inland Revenue to review these processes and rules so that an assessment can be made as to their adequacy. Recommendation 3 Section 81 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 be amended to allow for access to personal information but this provision be linked to requests for information by the individual concerned under privacy principle 6. Response The Government agrees that personal information should be available but only if making that information available does not impinge upon the privacy rights of taxpayers or adversely affect Inland Revenue’s ability to collect revenue. Inland Revenue is working through the implications o f this recommendation with the Office o f the Privacy Commissioner and the Office o f the Ombudsmen. This work is expected to be completed by the end o f July 2000. Recommendation 4 An electronic footprint be inserted in the Inland Revenue Department’s files to record who accesses individual taxpayers’ details. 5 The Government agrees with the general intent o f this recommendation and notes that this issue was addressed by the State Services Commission in their December 1998 inquiry into the Confidentiality and Security o f Citizens' Personal Information Held by the Inland Revenue Department. The State Services Commission’s inquiry found that: • Inland Revenue maintained a sophisticated security control framework within its information technology systems for the protection of personal information • due to the volume of records and transactions held by the department tracing every inquiry would be uneconomical • Inland Revenue’s perspective on privacy o f information is that all information is secret except to the individual concerned. This culture o f commitment to personal information protection is the “system” for protection or security. Inland Revenue has developed an electronic tracking program to address this issue further. Testing has confirmed that the electronic tracking program is capable of simultaneously monitoring up to a maximum o f 300 taxpayer accounts. The electronic tracking program is not intended as a stand-alone measure but buttresses other security and control mechanisms already in place. As the electronic tracking program is only a component of the existing security and control system, it was not designed to track activity within all taxpayers’ accounts and, as noted by the State Services Commission, doing so would be uneconomical. Inland Revenue is developing internal guidelines for the use o f the electronic tracking program. These guidelines will address the application o f the electronic tracking program and the circumstances under which a taxpayer can request it be applied to their account. This work is expected to be completed by the end o f July 2000. Recommendation 5 The Inland Revenue Department review its approach in respect of the care and management provisions in light of recent Court of Appeal decisions, with a view to amending its internal guidelines to make it clear the Commissioner of Inland Revenue can exercise discretion on a case by case basis. Response The Government agrees that the Commissioner o f Inland Revenue should exercise discretion on a case by case basis within the care and management provisions. Inland Revenue has examined the implications o f the Court o f Appeal decisions on the application of care and management provisions o f the Tax Administration Act 1994. Following this examination and after obtaining external legal advice, two draft policy statements concerning settlement of litigation and negotiating settlements for assessments pre-litigation were released for external consultation in October 1999. Response 6 Inland Revenue is currently consulting with interested external parties with a view to determining a clear departmental policy. Recommendation 6 The procedures for monitoring the delegation of the powers of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be reviewed. Response The Government agrees that the delegation o f the Commissioner's powers should be reviewed. Inland Revenue commenced an audit of the application of the Commissioner's delegated powers in February 2000. The objective and scope of this audit includes: • reporting the effectiveness of the procedures for monitoring the delegations process • reviewing the application o f delegations in the field, including the process for granting and monitoring the delegated authority, and ensuring staff understand their responsibilities • an examination o f processes for ensuring national consistency. This audit will be completed in late May 2000 with work on addressing any issues arising from that audit starting once the audit is complete. Recommendation 7 With respect to the penalties regime: • a past record of “good behaviour” be taken into account when deciding whether to impose a penalty • the Inland Revenue Department exercise a greater degree of flexibility when applying shortfall penalties • shortfall penalties not apply when it is determined that the taxpayer has made an inadvertent error. Response The Government supports this recommendation and has included these issues in the terms of reference for the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. 7 Recommendation 8 The Inland Revenue Department develop a systems audit methodology in order to assess whether taxpayers are adopting a reasonable standard of care. Response The Government agrees with this recommendation. Inland Revenue already has a policy in place that details the process used to assess whether a taxpayer has adopted a reasonable standard o f care. This policy was published internally and externally in March 1998 in Tax Information Bulletin3 Volume Ten, Number 3. The department is also currently reviewing its audit function to determine ways in which its audit methodologies can be further improved. This work is expected to be completed in late 2000. In addition, the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation will consider the standards imposed on taxpayers and whether the performance expectations on taxpayers are reasonable. Recommendation 9 The Inland Revenue Department reinforce both publicly and internally that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. Response The Government agrees with this recommendation. Inland Revenue re-released its policy on this issue in the November 1999 Tax Information Bulletin. This policy reinforced the current position that if a taxpayer or adviser has not interpreted legislation a penalty for unacceptable interpretation cannot apply. In addition, Inland Revenue reinforced the policy to staff through an internal information bulletin in mid-November 1999. The Government, however, wishes to review whether this issue creates compliance problems should a taxpayer deliberately avoid reasonable efforts to determine what the law is, for example, if a taxpayer does not interpret the legislation on a complex tax issue to avoid possible penalties. Given the possible risks associated with the avoidance o f penalties issue, it wi ll be considered as part o f the post-implementation 3 The Tax Information Bulletin is Inland Revenue’s monthly publication that contains information about changes to tax-related legislation, judgements, rulings and other specialist tax topics. 8 review o f the compliance and penalties legislation. This matter will also require consideration o f the appropriate standards required o f tax advisers. Recommendation 10 The Government review the process by which assessments can be challenged, placing particular emphasis on assessing the merits of establishing a time limit on the Commissioner of Inland Revenue when addressing a taxpayer’s Notice of Response. Response The Government supports this recommendation and has included this issue in the terms o f reference for the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties review. However, issues in this area will be partially resolved by the introduction o f the new complaints' management process and the operational review o f the disputes resolution process. As noted under the response to recommendation 1, the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation is considering ways o f ensuring taxpayers have the opportunity to dispute a decision where an assessment is made just prior to the expiration of the four-year time bar. Recommendation 11 The method by which use of money interest is calculated be reviewed to determine whether changes to the interest rates for overpayments and underpayments to reduce the differential between the rates are appropriate. Response The Government supports this recommendation and has included this issue in the terms o f reference for the post-implementation review of the compliance and penalties legislation. Recommendation 12 The Government review the whole area of write-offs and in doing so consider: • whether there should be a time limit on the reinstatement of a debt • whether, if the present policy is to continue, the term “write-off" should be replaced by wording that more accurately describes the policy (for example “provisional write-off") • whether it is necessary for the write-off provisions to be contained in the Inland Revenue Acts. 9 The Government supports this recommendation and has included these issues in the terms of reference for the post-implementation review o f the compliance and penalties legislation. The current terminology is confusing and the Government is giving consideration to the adoption of clearer terms so that taxpayers can better understand what is being proposed by Inland Revenue. Recommendation 13 The Inland Revenue Department issue clear directions to taxpayers as to their options, rights and obligations with respect to repayment arrangements. Response The Government agrees with this recommendation. Inland Revenue has addressed this recommendation through the publication o f an information booklet (Debt options) and summary sheet that details the taxpayers' options for repaying overdue taxes. When a taxpayer is advised that they are in debt, the summary sheet is sent with that notification. The department is promoting the use o f the booklet and the summary sheet to ensure that whenever taxpayers have the possibility of going into debt that they are aware o f their repayment options. The Debt options booklet and summary sheet became available in early March 2000 and the feedback received has been positive. Recommendation 14 The ministerial approval thresholds for instalment arrangements and remissions be removed, but that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue be required to provide a regular report to the Minister of Revenue outlining applications for remissions and instalments in excess of $100,000. Response The Government supports this recommendation. The issue of increasing the ministerial approval threshold was included in the Less Taxing Tax discussion document that was released in September 1999. The discussion document recommended that the threshold, above which ministerial approval is needed to remit tax or enter into instalment arrangements, be increased from $50,000 to $100,000. There was wide support in the submissions for increasing the threshold. Two submissions suggested that the threshold should be increased even further to $250,000, and the Institute o f Chartered Accountants of New Zealand noted Response 10 that the Organisational Review o f Inland Revenue recommended that the Minister does not need to be involved at all. The Minister’s involvement is designed to provide an assurance that the Commissioner is appropriately applying the hardship provisions in the most significant cases. However, it is inconsistent with the separation of the Commissioner’s statutory function o f day-to-day tax administration from the Minister’s role of political oversight. The Government therefore recently decided that the requirement for ministerial approval should be removed completely. This has the advantages of: • streamlining the instalment arrangement process with a likely result of increased revenue; and • producing administrative cost savings for Inland Revenue and reducing compliance costs on taxpayers because of faster processing times. The necessary legislative amendments were included in the May tax bill introduced in May 2000. Recommendation 15 The Government review the preferential status of the Inland Revenue Department in liquidations. Response The Government is reviewing Inland Revenue’s status in liquidations. This issue was raised in a report from the Law Commission. Inland Revenue is providing input into a report being prepared by the Ministry o f Commerce for Ministers’ consideration. This report will be delivered to Ministers in June 2000. Recommendation 16 The Inland Revenue Department re-establish a problem resolution service with experienced personnel who are committed to customer satisfaction outcomes. Response The Government supports the intent o f this recommendation. Inland Revenue is currently developing a new complaints’ management process. Inland Revenue research, undertaken prior to December 1999, identified a number of factors that would need to be incorporated into the high-level design o f the new process. These included: • the new process would need to be part o f an integrated customer service strategy 11 • customers wanted a system that is accessible, fair, responsive and effective • the feedback from complaints be incorporated into organisational learning that leads to improvements in the tax administration. Inland Revenue is currently consulting with staff, customers and their representatives, on proposals for the delivery of the new complaints’ management process that includes: • an enhanced commitment to resolving the majority o f issues as part o f the current business process • a partially centralised process to manage and resolve the small proportion of complaints that are not resolved by the current business process • a centralised process to monitor and report on complaints • a process that taps into customer feedback and the learning from complaints to improve business processes. The new complaints’ management process is expected to be fully implemented in late 2000. Once introduced Inland Revenue officials will brief the Finance and Expenditure Committee on the complaints’ management process. This response should be read in conjunction with the responses for recommendations 17 and 18. Recommendation 17 The Inland Revenue Department ensure that the problem resolution service, once established, is well publicised. Response When the new process for handling complaints about unresolved problems is established, the Government agrees that the public needs to be aware o f its availability. The design phase of the new complaints’ management process will include a comprehensive communication approach that will ensure that the new complaints process is well advertised both internally and externally. This recommendation will be completed in conjunction with recommendation 16. Recommendation 18 The Inland Revenue Department advise all complainants, dissatisfied by the results of an internal inquiry, of their rights to appeal to an external agency. 12 The Government agrees. Inland Revenue's current practice is to advise complainants o f their right to approach external agencies, such as the Ombudsmen, for a review of decisions made by the Commissioner. Inland Revenue will incorporate an explanation of these customer’s rights into the detailed design o f the new complaints’ management process. This is in conjunction with recommendations 16 and 17. Recommendation 19 The Government establish a specialist tax adviser position within the Office of the Ombudsmen, with appropriate resources, to investigate matters of tax administration by the Inland Revenue Department. Response The Government has not yet formed a view on this recommendation. As this is a Machinery o f Government issue consultation with relevant government agencies is necessary. Currently, consultation with the Ombudsman is being undertaken on matters concerning the appropriate structure and resources. Recommendation 20 The Inland Revenue Department investigate ways to preserve over the counter services in areas where it is closing offices, particularly in isolated areas. Response The Government agrees that Inland Revenue should investigate ways to preserve an appropriate level o f services in those areas where Inland Revenue has closed offices. Inland Revenue has implemented a series o f major changes to simplify the tax system and reduce the requirement for taxpayers to contact Inland Revenue. In developing these changes the department undertook extensive research to ascertain taxpayers’ requirements in terms o f service delivery. One o f the findings was that taxpayers prefer to use the telephone to transact business with the department. Supporting the tax simplification changes was the introduction o f five call centres in early 1999. These call centres provide toll-free access to all taxpayers to Inland Revenue's services. Response 13 In those areas where offices have closed, Inland Revenue is providing agency services as the need demands at a local level4 and is promoting the use of its telephone and personal appointment services. Taxpayers are also able to make tax payments at all Westpac Trust branches (approximately 220 branches)5. Recommendation 21 The Inland Revenue Department enhance its monitoring of telephone services to ensure greater timeliness and accuracy of responses and that the department identify and remedy any skills deficiencies as a matter of priority. Response The Government supports the intent of this recommendation. Inland Revenue treats the management o f telephone enquiries as a departmental priority and already monitors the timeliness and quality of the services provided in the five call centres. While service delivered in the Personal Call Centres is satisfactory, the performance delivered in the Business Call Centre is below acceptable targets. Inland Revenue has undertaken a range of initiatives to improve the performance of the Business Call Centre that includes: • providing existing staff with additional training on a training needs basis • recruiting and training new staff • supplementing existing call centre staff with others from across the department to deal with predicted increases to call volumes, particularly when the workload is predicted to exceed current capacity • improving the technology system to better manage workloads. Recommendation 22 The Inland Revenue Department take steps to enhance the timeliness and quality of its responses to written correspondence and that the performance standard in the 1999/2000 Purchase Agreement of dealing with all correspondence within eight weeks of receipt be reviewed. Response The Government agrees that Inland Revenue should take action to improve the timeliness and quality o f its responses to correspondence. 4 For example, fortnightly agencies are held in Alexandra and Blenheim. 5 In the February to April 2000 period approximately 118,000 financial transactions were made through Westpac Trust branches. 14 For the 1999/00 financial year, Inland Revenue changed the performance standard for answering correspondence from responding to 85% within four weeks to responding to 85% within three weeks. As at 31 March 2000, Inland Revenue was responding to 87.1% o f correspondence within three weeks and 96.9% within eight weeks. Performance Standards for correspondence will be further reviewed as part o f the 2000/01 budget cycle. Recommendation 23 The Government consider moving the responsibility for drafting tax legislation back to the Parliamentary Counsel Office. Response The Government is yet to make a decision on this recommendation. However, a joint officials' report on this issue was delivered for ministerial approval on 30 March 2000. The Government is still considering the recommendations made in this report and will make decisions shortly. Recommendation 24 The Government consider whether establishing a board of directors to provide an oversight of the Inland Revenues Department’s operation of its powers is desirable. Response The Government does not support this recommendation. The Finance and Expenditure Committee has suggested that the board o f directors could be modelled on the Reserve Bank’s board o f directors. However, with the accountability relationship legislated in the State Sector Act 1988 and the monitoring o f central agencies, the value o f such a board for Inland Revenue would be questionable. The Richardson Committee6 examined a similar option in 1994 and rejected the option because: • direct Government oversight and control o f "the coercive powers of the state" to collect taxes is considered desirable • the board would dilute the accountability between the Minister and the Commissioner for the delivery o f contracted services 6 The Richardson Committee (chaired by Sir Ivor Richardson) was responsible for the oversight and direction of the 1994 Organisation Review o f Inland Revenue. 15 • Ministers already have access to a range o f specialist advice on policy, administration and purchase issues from within the Minister’s Office and the central agencies • the Generic Tax Policy Process has enhanced and strengthened the public consultation provisions for developing new legislation. Recommendation 25 The Inland Revenue Department implement, as a matter of priority, a nationally consistent training programme aimed at improving communication and customer service skills. Response The Government agrees with the intent o f this recommendation. Inland Revenue is designing a national training programme to improve customer service and communication skills, subject to funding being available for the 2000/01 year. This project is linked to the development o f the complaints' management process referred to in the response to recommendation 16. The design o f the training programme will incorporate customer feedback obtained through the complaints' management process. High level design o f the training programme will be completed by 30 June 2000 with training delivery commencing early in the 2000/01 financial year. Recommendation 26 The Inland Revenue Department consider implementing a programme along similar lines to the Business and Parliament Trust, which would enable staff to build relationships with, and have greater exposure to, the business community. Response The Government supports Inland Revenue taking measures to increase its understanding o f business practices and concerns. Inland Revenue will consult with the Business and Parliamentary Trust and other commercial organisations to see how this can be achieved. Recommendation 27 The Inland Revenue Department establish a taxpayers’ charter to outline to taxpayers their rights and obligations in respect of the tax system. 16 The Government agrees with this recommendation. Inland Revenue adopted its Taxpayers’ Charter in 1992. However, since that time there have been a number o f changes in Inland Revenue that need to be embedded into the Taxpayers’ Charter. Inland Revenue is developing a revised Charter. In doing so, Inland Revenue is conducting internal and external consultation with interested stakeholders. Once this consultation is completed a proposed Charter will be referred to the FEC for its consideration and comment. Following this feedback, a further round of consultation will be undertaken to finalise the Charter. Conclusion This Government is pleased to have received from the previous Finance and Expenditure Committee their report o f their Inquiry into the Powers and Operations o f the Inland Revenue Department. The Government is able to report that Inland Revenue is addressing the majority o f the recommendations in a manner that is satisfactory to this Government. The Government is considering the two Machinery of Government recommendations related to the responsibility o f drafting legislation (recommendation 23) and the establishment of a specialist tax adviser in the Office of the Ombudsmen (recommendation 19). Response 17 Appendix One An update on the Compliance and Penalties Post-implementation Review The new compliance and penalties legislation, enacted in 1996, was designed to promote effective and fairer enforcement o f the Inland Revenue Acts, and to provide better incentives for taxpayers to comply voluntarily with their obligations. The post-implementation review is the last phase o f the generic tax policy process.
