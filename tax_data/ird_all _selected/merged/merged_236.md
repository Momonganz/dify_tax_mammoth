Please remember that it has not been passed by Parliament yet, so there may be changes before it becomes law. Consolidation for Group Companies The new tax consolidation regime will allow a wholly-owned group of companies to consolidate and be treated as a single company for income tax purposes. The regime simplifies the tax rules applying to corporate groups and lowers their tax costs, since intra-group transfers won't be liable for income tax, stamp duty, or gift duty. It also allows groups of companies to improve their economic efficiency by rationalising large and complex group struc- tures. Entering the regime will be entirely optional, and companies may consolidate on a functional, re- gional or industry basis. All companies in a consolidated group will be jointly and severally liable for payment of the group’s income tax. The Commissioner may relax this requirement if a group applies for approval for joint and several liability to be limited to specific companies. This will enable companies to consoli- date where their prudential supervision require- ments or group financing pledges do not permit undertakings of joint and several liability for tax. The new provisions will apply from the 1993-94 income year. Inter-Corporate Dividend Exemption extended to wholly-owned groups The inter-corporate dividend exemption will be extended to wholly-owned groups (whether or not they choose to consolidate) from 1 April 1993. As long as the company paying the dividend and the company receiving it are within the same wholly- owned group, and they have the same tax balance date, the dividend may be exempt from income tax. This extension overcomes concerns that companies might otherwise feel that they have to consolidate just to obtain the exemption. The single balance date requirement is intended to counter tax avoidance schemes that utilise differ- ent balance dates within a group. The Commis- sioner will have the discretion to relax the require- ment where it would distort assessable income because of differing business cycles within a group. Taxation of petroleum exploration and mining amended The tax rules for petroleum exploration and mining will be amended to make the New Zealand industry more competitive internationally and encourage foreign investment. Exploration expenditure may be deducted in the year it is incurred, instead of when the licence is relinquished or commercial production begins, as at present. Mining development expenditure may be depreci- ated over seven years, instead of the current ten. Depreciation will begin from the start of commer- cial production for onshore developments, and from the date expenditure is incurred for offshore developments, in recognition of the long lead times between the start of development and the begin- ning of production. The treatment of farm-outs (the transfer of a licence or licence share in return for work under- taken) will also change. Where a petroleum pros- pector farms out development costs to outside investors, it will no longer be taxed on the transac- tion. Changes to the treatment of exploration expendi- ture, development expenditure and farm-outs came into effect on 16 December 1991, when the Government announced the regime. New anti- avoidance and transitional provisions came into effect when the bill was introduced. New Depreciation Regime The new legislation will establish the statutory basis for the new depreciation regime announced last year. Depreciation deductions will become a statutory entitlement, rather than being allowed at the Commissioner’s discretion. The Commissioner will continue to set depreciation rates, but in accord- ance with statutory criteria. Taxpayers will have the right to request a higher rate of depreciation in particular cases if they believe the general rate is too low. They may then object if the Commissioner declines to issue a special rate or if they are not satisfied with the rate issued. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 Taxpayers may choose between the straight line and diminishing value depreciation methods for most assets. Using the straight line method will enable assets to be completely written off instead of being carried forward at low values. Assets with a book value of less than $2,000 may be depreci- ated collectively as one asset in a pool account, thus eliminating the necessity for keeping separate asset accounts. Assets designed to be used for shift work or subject to abrasive or corrosive materials may no longer be depreciated at higher than general rates, since an adjustment for the conditions under which such assets operate will be built into the general rates. The deductibility of repairs and maintenance, presently governed by section 108, will in future be dealt with under the normal deductibility provi- sions in the Income Tax Act. The new depreciation regime will apply from the income year commencing 1 April 1993. The new rates will be announced when Inland Revenue’s review of depreciation rates is completed. They will only apply to new assets purchased after 1 April 1993. Changes to the QCET regime The formula for calculating qualifying company election tax (QCET) will be fine-tuned. The existing formula does not work correctly where a company has imputation credits left in its imputation ac- count. It also results in an over-calculation where a company has not yet paid its income tax for the year before it became a Qualifying Company, and causes an under-calculation where a company has overpaid its provisional tax for that year. The change will be retrospective to the beginning of the Qualifying Company regime. The date for paying QCET for 1992-93 elections will be extended to the company’s terminal tax date for the same income year. The concessional tax will be subject to use-of-money interest if it is not paid by the third provisional tax date for 1992- 93. Crown Research Institutes - income tax status defined The legislation will bring the ten new Crown Research Institutes, which came into being on 1 July, within the income tax net. They are to be treated in the same way as state-owned enter- prises, statutory producer boards and other statu- tory bodies for the purpose of determining voting and market value interests and the eligibility to carry forward or set off losses. PAYE bonds for non-resident employees The Commissioner will be able to accept from an employer a bond or other form of security to cover PAYE on non-resident employees in situations where their liability to tax in New Zealand is uncertain. Where a bond or other security is provided, an employer need not make PAYE deductions for non-resident employees until they become liable to tax in New Zealand, or the Com- missioner specifies a date from which tax deduc- tions are to be made. The employer is then liable for any PAYE incurred in the period covered by the bond. It is expected that the Non-Resident Contractors' Unit of Special Companies Section in Inland Revenue's Wellington District Office will handle applications. Refund period for wrong RWT deductions extended The period in which payers of resident withhold- ing tax can refund amounts deducted in error will be extended. Payers may make refunds at any time up to 31 March of the year in which the mistake was made. The amendment will be especially welcomed by banks because customer relation- ships are adversely affected when refunds of over- deducted amounts cannot be given if an error is discovered after the bank has paid the deductions to Inland Revenue. Amendments to the GST Act Inland Revenue will issue GST assessments when- ever we process a GST return. At present, assess- ments are only made at a taxpayer’s request or the Commissioner’s initiative. A time of supply rule for fringe benefit tax paid on an annual or income year basis will be provided. Receivers and liquidators will no longer be al- lowed to charge GST on the sale of goods or services and then pay the GST component to secured creditors. Goods sold outside New Zealand will be zero- rated even if imported into New Zealand, thus removing a potential double impost of GST. Provisions relating to casinos will be corrected to 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 ensure that commissions received from games such as baccarat are subject to GST. The redemp- tion of chips and the receipt of commission will be taken into account in calculating the value of the supply by a casino. Changes to the Gaming Duties Act The period for delivering a gaming machine duty return where a licence has been cancelled will be extended from seven days after cancellation to twenty days after the end of the month, to bring it into line with the normal return due date. Gaming machine operators may apply for a return period that ends within seven days either side of the last day of the month. This will reduce compli- ance costs for operators by allowing them to align the return period with their internal month end accounting period. The Commissioner may write off amounts under $5 owed by a gaming machine operator. The calculation of a casino win will be amended to ensure that unredeemed chips are not counted twice in determining the taxable win. Change to Gaming and Lotteries Act Machines or devices that dispense tickets only, such as Avago, will be removed from the defini- tion of a gaming machine. Other Legislation Before Parliament Redundancy Payments (Taxation & Benefits) Bill The Government announced on 28 July that the measures in the Redundancy Payments (Taxation & Benefits) Bill will apply from 30 November 1992. The bill proposes provisions to bring tax on redun- dancy payments into line with other tax rates. Redundancy payments will no longer be mostly tax free, but are to be taxed in full as income. There will be no distinction between lump sum and instalment payments, and the specified sum calculation will no longer exist. The FBT liability on employers will also be removed, since the whole of the payment will be included in employ- ees’ assessable income (employers currently pay FBT on the amount of the redundancy which exceeds the specified sum). Redundancy payments will not be subject to the ACC Earner Premium. The 26-week unemployment benefit stand-down period for anyone receiving a redundancy payout will be scrapped. It will be replaced by a gradu- ated stand-down ranging from two to ten weeks, depending on income. Orders in Council No Earner Premium on redundancy payments Redundancy payments have been removed from the definition of "earnings as an employee". From 1 July 1992, Earner Premium does not have to be deducted from redundancy payments. Provisional tax use-of-money interest rate lowered The use-of-money interest rate for over- and under-payments of provisional tax has been lowered to 6 percent, effective from 1 July. In his announcement of 5 June, the Minister of Revenue said that lowering the rate the Government pays on over-payments of provisional tax would reduce the opportunity for using the regime to obtain higher than market rates for short-term deposits. FBT Prescribed Rate of Interest reduced The interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans was lowered from 10.5 to 10.3 percent for the quarters commencing 1 April and 1 June 1992. The new interest rate reflected the continued down- ward trend in market interest rates, and was the lowest since the FBT regime was introduced, the Minister of Revenue announced on 26 May. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 Budget Announcements Business entertainment deductions limited Fifty percent of business entertainment expenses will be subject to FBT. For taxpayers not within the FBT regime, only 50 percent of entertainment expenditure will be deductible for income tax and can be claimed as a GST input credit. There will be limited exceptions to the 50 percent rule. The Government plans to make these changes in a tax bill to be introduced later this year. The new treatment will take effect from the income year commencing 1 April 1993. Provisional tax deferral countered Two-way interest will be extended back to the first provisional tax payment date for taxpayers above a certain threshold. The threshold has not been decided yet, but it will not be below $30,000 residual income tax. The change will apply from the beginning of the 1994/95 income year. It will affect early balance date provisional taxpayers from 7 February 1994. Most others will be affected from 7 July 1994. Commissioner may issue binding rulings The Commissioner will be given the discretion to issue binding rulings. Details have not been finalised. Legislation may be introduced early next year. Penalties to be tightened The 1992 Budget announced that the penalty provisions in the revenue Acts will be tightened up and rationalised. Some measures may be included in legislation early next year. The only specific measure announced in the Budget was the intro- duction of a penalty for late filing of tax returns. International tax rules strengthened The Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) regime will be strengthened by the inclusion of a de facto control test, and the "Grey List" (list of countries for which the FIF regime does not apply - see the 15th Schedule of the Income Tax Act) exemption will be reviewed. No decisions have been made yet on the countries to be listed. Changes to the regime will generally be effective from 1 April 1993. An interest in a Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) will be defined as an interest in a foreign entity that does not fall within the CFC definition. Although more taxpayers will be caught by the definition, those with interests in FIFs of less than $10,000 will be exempt from the regime. Taxpayers will be given a number of ways to calculate FIF income. Changes to the FIF regime are effective from Budget night. Foreign Dividend Withholding Payments (FDWP) remain and anti-avoidance rules will be introduced to stop non-cash dividend repatriations. Inland Revenue action on Dishonoured Cheques We have been asked to restate Inland Revenue's policy on advising taxpayers when their bank does not honour cheques we receive - either because of incorrect/incomplete details or insufficient funds. Inland Revenue will not return cheques to taxpay- ers for alteration. If a cheque is not honoured - either because it is completed incorrectly or because of insufficient funds - the bank will normally tell the client this. The client should deal directly with the bank to find out the reasons for the dishonour. When a bank advises Inland Revenue that they won't honour a cheque, we will send a statement to the taxpayer showing "payment cancelled". This statement will reverse the payment in the taxpay- er's account, and show the effect of this reversal - e.g. any balance that is now overdue, and any additional tax charged. If a taxpayer's cheque is dishonoured for a reason other than lack of funds, and s/he made a genuine attempt to pay, we will consider a request for remission of any additional tax charged. If you want to make such a request, please send it in writing to the Debt Management Unit of the district office that handles your file. You should also send all supporting documentation from the bank. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 GST and Non-Resident Importers Introduction A person who is non-resident for GST purposes may import goods into New Zealand. On importa- tion of those goods, the Customs Department will usually levy GST under s.12 of the GST Act. Inland Revenue has been asked to set out the circum- stances in which a non-resident can claim back the GST paid to Customs as an input tax deduction. This item sets out: (i) Who a non-resident is for GST purposes; (ii) When a non-resident can register for GST; (iii) Whether a customs agent can claim an input tax deduction on behalf of a non-resident principal; (iv) When a supply is in New Zealand for GST purposes; and (v) The documentation required to support an input tax deduction. Non-Resident There is no definition of “non-resident” for GST purposes but s.2 of the GST Act defines “ resi- dent”. Any person who is resident in New Zealand in terms of s.241 of the Income Tax Act 1976 is also resident for GST purposes. Further, a person who is not resident for income tax purposes is still resident for GST purposes: (i) to the extent that person carries on any activity while having a fixed or permanent place in New Zealand relating to that activity; or (ii) if the person is an unincorporated body of persons (partnership, joint venture or trust) and its centre of administrative management is in New Zealand. Registration for GST If a non-resident carries on a taxable activity and makes more than $30,000 worth of supplies in New Zealand in any 12 month period, the non-resident is liable to be registered for GST and must register for GST. In the absence of registration for GST, the non-resident is deemed to be a registered person anyway. Alternatively, a non-resident who is not liable to be registered can voluntarily register for GST. The only requirement for voluntary registration is that the non-resident carries on a taxable activity, or intends to carry on a taxable activity. GST and Government Departments Summary This item is to advise that Inland Revenue has issued a memorandum to all Government Depart- ments and Offices of Parliament, outlining certain consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. These amendments became necessary through the introduction of the Public Finance Act 1989. The memorandum explains the implications of the amendments for Government Departments and Offices of Parliament. Background The Public Finance Act 1989 brought about re- forms in public sector financial management. These financial management reforms changed the appropriation process and the manner in which public authorities (excluding State Owned Enter- prises) account for and report on their use of resources. These changes in turn altered the way in which Government Departments and Offices of Parliament account for GST. To ensure that the GST Act reflected these reforms, the First Schedule to the Public Finance Act 1989 contained a number of consequential amendments to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Enquiries As these amendments only affect government organisations, we have not included details of the changes in this publication. However, government organisations can get any further information they need on their GST obligations from: Richard Philp Taxpayer Services IRD Head Office P O Box 2198 Wellington Phone (04) 472 1032, extension 8415. Local Inland Revenue district offices should not be approached on this matter. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 Input Tax Deduction Customs will usually levy GST on the importation of goods by the non-resident. If registered, the non-resident will want to claim that tax back as a GST input tax deduction. Legislation A non-resident can only claim back the tax paid to Customs if that tax falls within the definition of “input tax” in s.2 of the GST Act. The definition of “input tax” includes GST levied on the importation of goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Principal Purpose of Making Taxable Supplies - Supply in New Zealand A non-resident registered for GST may have difficulty showing that goods are acquired (im- ported) for the principal purpose of making tax- able supplies. This is because only supplies made in New Zealand are taxable supplies and there is a general rule in s.8(2) that supplies made by a non- resident are made outside New Zealand. However, the general rule in s.8(2) is subject to s.8(2)(a) and s.8(2)(b). If these sections apply, a non-resident may be deemed to make supplies in New Zealand. Assuming all the other require- ments of a taxable supply are met (eg. the supply is charged with GST), the non-resident will then be able to claim an input tax deduction for the im- ported goods. Section 8(2)(a) deems a supply by a non-resident to be in New Zealand if the goods are in New Zea- land at the time the non-resident supplies them to a purchaser. Therefore, if s.8(2)(a) applies, the goods are imported to make a supply in New Zealand and the importer can claim an input tax deduction for those goods. However, s.8(2)(a) is subject to s.8(2)(b). The effect of s.8(2)(b) is that, if the person who has purchased the goods from the importer can claim an input tax deduction for them, s.8(2)(a) will only apply if the importer and the purchaser expressly agree that s.8(2)(b) will not apply. If the parties fail to agree, s.8(2)(b) deems the supply to be made outside New Zealand and the importer cannot claim an input tax deduction for the imported goods. In summary, a non-resident importer is deemed to make a supply in New Zealand; (i) If the imported goods are in New Zealand at the time the importer supplies them to a pur- chaser; and (ii) Where the purchaser of those goods can claim an input tax deduction, the importer and the purchaser have agreed that s.8(2)(b) will not apply to that supply. Use of a Customs Agent A non-resident registered for GST may employ an independent New Zealand customs agent to act on its behalf in New Zealand. The agent may arrange for clearance of the goods through Customs and pay the GST on behalf of the non-resident. The agent may carry out other administrative duties such as distributing the goods to separate purchas- ers and answering customer enquires. The customs agent cannot claim an input tax deduction for GST paid to Customs because the tax paid is not input tax in terms of s.2 of the GST Act. The goods are imported by the non-resident who supplies them to the purchaser. The agent never acquires the goods but supplies services facilitating the supply by the non-resident. One of those services may be to pay the GST on behalf of the non-resident. However, because the agent never acquires the goods, GST paid by the agent on behalf of the non-resident does not qualify as input tax and the agent cannot claim an input tax deduction for GST paid to Customs. Documentation Required by an Importer to Support an Input Tax Deduction Section 24 of the GST Act requires a supplier to issue a GST tax invoice for taxable supplies made by that person. The recipient of a supply cannot usually claim an input tax deduction without a GST tax invoice. However, because Customs do not supply imported goods (they simply levy GST on them) there is no legislative requirement that Customs issue a GST tax invoice to an importer. Nor is there any requirement that the importer hold a GST tax invoice before an input tax deduc- tion can be claimed. However, before an importer can claim an input tax deduction for GST levied by Customs, the importer must have documentary proof to show that the goods were in fact imported and GST levied. If the importer is not on the Customs Deferred Payment Scheme (discussed below), Inland Rev- enue will accept the Customs Entry Import Form as proof of import. The Customs Department administers a scheme known as the Customs Deferred Payment Scheme. Where an importer is entitled to defer payment under the scheme, the Customs Entry Import Form 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 or the Deferred Payment of Duty Statement is sufficient proof of import. Generally, a person approved to use that scheme does not pay duty (including GST) at the time of obtaining a Customs release, but has the amount of duty debited to an account. A statement detailing imports for a “duty accounting period” is forwarded to each approved importer. The importer then has 20 days from the end of the “duty accounting period” to make payment. Documents used as evidence to support an input tax deduction must be in the name of the regis- tered person claiming the input tax deduction. Examples Example 1 U.K. Corp., which is a non-resident company for GST purposes and registered for GST, imports clothing into New Zealand in its own name to sell to a large New Zealand retailer. U.K. Corp’s independent New Zealand customs agent pays the GST levied by Customs and carries out other administrative duties on behalf of U.K. Corp. The New Zealand retailer paid for the goods 2 months before they entered New Zealand. U.K. Corp want to know if they, or their agent, can claim the GST paid to Customs as an input tax deduction. GST Treatment U.K. Corp. cannot claim the GST back as an input tax deduction. The supply from U.K. Corp to the New Zealand retailer is made by a non-resident and is deemed to be made outside New Zealand (s.8(2)). Section 8(2)(a) does not apply because the goods were not in New Zealand at the time the goods were supplied from the importer to the purchaser, i.e., at the time of payment for the goods. Therefore, U.K. Corp has not made a supply of goods in New Zealand. The tax was not charged on goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and the GST paid to Customs does not qualify as input tax in terms of s.2 of the GST Act. The customs agent cannot claim an input tax credit. The agent did not acquire the clothing for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, and therefore the tax paid is not input tax. Example 2 Aust Co., which is a non-resident for GST pur- poses and registered for GST, imports scientific equipment into New Zealand and distributes it to New Zealand purchasers. Aust Co. recently imported equipment into New Zealand for sale to a hospital. The time of supply for this sale oc- curred when the goods were in New Zealand. The parties did not agree that s.8(2)(b) would not apply. GST was levied by Customs on the importa- tion of the equipment and paid for by a customs agent on behalf of Aust Co. Aust Co. want to know if they, or their agent, can claim the tax paid to Customs as an input tax deduction. GST Treatment Aust Co. cannot claim an input tax deduction for the tax paid to Customs. Section 8(2)(a) deems the supply of equipment to be made in New Zealand because it is a supply by a non-resident of goods which are in New Zealand at the time of supply. However, because the purchaser can claim an input tax deduction for the supply and the parties did not agree that s.8(2)(b) would not apply, the goods are deemed to be supplied outside New Zealand by s.8(2)(b). Therefore, the tax was not charged on goods acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Aust Co. has not made a supply of goods in New Zealand and the GST paid to Customs does not qualify as input tax in terms of s.2 of the GST Act. The customs agent cannot claim an input tax credit. The agent did not acquire the equipment for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies and the tax paid is not input tax. Example 3 The same as example 2 but this time Aust Co. and the hospital agree that s.8(2)(b) will not apply and the supply will take place in New Zealand. Aust Co. charges GST on the supply. GST Treatment Aust Co. can claim an input tax deduction for the tax paid to Customs. The supply is deemed by s.8(2)(a) to be a supply in New Zealand. Section 8(2)(b) does not apply because the parties have agreed it does not apply. Therefore, there is a supply in New Zealand and Aust Co. have ac- quired the goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The GST paid qualifies as input tax and Aust Co. can claim an input tax deduction. Reference Technical Rulings para. 108.8. H.O. GST N.2.1 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 Background This article follows on from the one in TIB Volume Three No. 5 about the IR 10. In that article, we state as part of our policy on reopening assessments on the grounds of omission of income: “If an audit/investigation reveals an omission of income then: • If that omission is because disclosure was not required on an IR 10 (but the income has been recorded in the financial statements which were not filed with Inland Revenue), then this will not be a reason of that fact for reopening a statute barred assessment. • If the income was omitted from the financial statements then section 25(2) may be applied to reopen a barred assessment.” We have been asked how we will apply the policy in cases where there is no provision on the IR 10 to show an item, but when the profit has been dis- closed in a Disclosure Return, IR 4A (covering “inter-related arrangements”) or in a Property Disclosure Return, IR 4T. Note: If someone is a party to a financial arrange- ment which must be disclosed to Inland Revenue under section 64H of the Income Tax Act 1976, s/he must file a Disclosure Return (IR 4A) or a Property Disclosure Return (IR 4T) as appropriate. However, this return won’t have to be filed if there is a reporting exemption for the arrangement. Policy If the profit on an item has been disclosed in either the Disclosure Return or the Property Disclosure Return, there is not an omission of all mention of the item. This means there will not be reason to reopen an assessment. This is the case whether or not the profit in the disclosure return is recorded in the financial statement. If a Disclosure Return IR 4A, or a Property Disclo- sure Return, IR 4T, has not been furnished, the policy set out in TIB Volume Three No. 5 applies. The IR 10 and Section 25 of the Income Tax Act 1976 Franked Australian Dividends and the 1992 IR 3 Guide Background It has recently come to our attention that the 1992 IR 3 Guide contains an error on the correct treat- ment of franked Australian dividends. This item sets out the correct treatment of franked Austral- ian dividends. Discussion Australia has a dividend imputation regime similar to New Zealand’s. An Australian dividend is said to be “franked” if it is carrying an imputa- tion credit. A New Zealand resident is not entitled to the benefit of any imputation credit under the Aus- tralian tax system. At page 10, the 1992 IR 3 Guide states: "If you have received Australian Dividends they will be either “franked” or “unfranked”. If your dividend is ”franked”, deduct the franked credits from your gross dividend and include the net amount that you received in Box 15B." This is incorrect. The amount that is to be returned is the amount actually received (or receivable) from the company, plus any Australian non- resident withholding tax that has been deducted. For example, a New Zealand shareholder will receive a notice from the Australian company that may show any or all of the following entries: “Franked Amount”, “Unfranked Amount”, “Withholding Tax” and “Imputed Credit”. The amount that is to be returned by the New Zealand shareholder is the total of the franked amount, unfranked amount and withholding tax. The amount of imputed credit is to be ignored. A credit will be allowed for the withholding tax in the normal manner. Example A New Zealand shareholder in an Australian company receives the following dividend state- ment: Franked Amount$100.00 Unfranked Amount$80.00 Withholding Tax$12.00 Imputed Credit$63.93 The amount that is taxable in New Zealand is $180.00. The amount that the taxpayer would have actually received from the Australian company is $168.00. The withholding tax credit of $12.00 will be allowed as an overseas tax credit.

Inland Revenue has noted an increasing number of such cases. Our audit staff are currently dealing with this problem, and investigating contracts offered by employers. Already, many contracts have been overturned, and employees put back on PAYE deductions. Their employers are now facing claims for PAYE not deducted, plus additional tax amounts - totalling quite substantial amounts in some cases. Some of the employers involved may also be prosecuted. Employee or self-employed? Inland Revenue uses several tests to work out the correct employment status of staff. They include: Control - who has control over how and when the work is done, and who is responsible for quality or pricing? Integration - is the type of work or the way it is done the same as work performed by other staff who are employees? Is the work an integral part of the employer's business? Independence - does the worker supply all the necessary tools? Does s/he work from home? Is s/he free to work for other people as well? Intention - how are the payments for the work made? Did the worker carry out the same activity as a self-employed person (or as an employee) in the past? Why is the worker being treated as self-employed? Economic reality - does the type or nature of business justify employing an independent contractor? Overall, Inland Revenue is looking at who has control over the work done, and how and where it is done. If the answer is the employer, then the worker is almost certainly an employee. IRD and Police Combine to Fight Organised Crime Inland Revenue and the Police will soon combine forces to fight tax evasion in organised crime. Under an agreement signed by IRD Commissioner David Henry and Police Commissioner John Jamieson, Inland Revenue will use information supplied by the Police to conduct tax investiga- tions on income from illegal activities. Inland Revenue will assess profits from organised crime, and seek prosecutions where tax returns have not been filed. We will not be conducting criminal investigations, but we will assist the Police in their investigations. We will only pass on information where it is permitted under the tax laws. The Police see Inland Revenue as a useful partner in countering organised crime such as drug deal- ing, wildlife smuggling, car conversions, bookmaking, protection rackets, prostitution and poaching. These businesses need cash to carry out their illegal activities and if that income is taxed, there will be less of it for the criminals to continue operating. These activities are estimated to make up an "underground economy" worth some $1.3 billion a year. Illicit income is still fully taxable, as the tax laws make no distinction between legal and illegal revenue. Inland Revenue is setting up a specialist unit based on a similar Australian Tax Office (ATO) unit. It will have six staff initially, with expansion over the next four years. Final numbers will depend on the unit's cost-effectiveness. The unit will be funded by reallocating existing resources into what is now identified as a "high compliance" risk area. One of the unit's senior officers will train with the ATO, which has been successfully operating a similar investigation unit since 1987, identifying $200 million in taxes owed from the profits of organised crime. Based on the Australian experi- ence, the unit is expected to bring in around $10 for every $1 spent on tracking down tax evasion in the criminal sector. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.1 “Clubs and Societies” and “Education Centres” New Booklets from Inland Revenue Inland Revenue has recently published two new information booklets, "Clubs and Societies" (IR 254), and "Education Centres" (IR 253). We wrote the Clubs and Societies book as a result of research we carried out last year, which indi- cated a need for better tax information in this area. It is designed to help members deal with the special tax obligations of clubs and societies, and will be most useful for people who look after financial or taxation responsibilities. In addition to general information on taxes which affect clubs and societies, the booklet includes a section dealing with the income tax exemptions available. There is also detailed information about income and expenses for income tax and GST. We sent a copy of this booklet out with taxpacks sent to the more than 30,000 clubs, societies and non-profit organisations throughout New Zealand. The other new booklet, Education Centres, is written for people who administer the financial and taxation affairs of educational institutions. It contains general information about income and expenses for both GST and income tax. We have posted copies of this booklet to all of New Zealand's 4,500 educational institutions, from early childhood centres to universities. Please contact your local Inland Revenue office if you want copies of either of these booklets. Due Dates Reminder August 31 GST return and payment for period ended 31 July 1992 due.

We are using an independent market research firm to run this survey and collate the results. However, because of the size of the TIB mailing list (approximately 13,000, plus IRD staff), it's not practical to get a response from everyone. For this reason, we've only sent a questionnaire to every fifth reader. If you haven't received a questionnaire, but you have comments that you want to make, we'd like to hear them. Please write to us at: Tax Information Bulletin Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON or fax your comments to us on (04) 473 3250. This will help us to adapt the Tax Information Bulletin to meet the needs of you, our readers. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.2 Public Service Motor Vehicle Reimbursing Rates Use for Income Tax Purposes In TIB Volume 3 No. 2 we set out new rules for using the Public Service “Mileage” Rates (PSMRs) and gave a simplified alternative rate. Comments from our local Inland Revenue offices suggest that there may be some misunderstanding of these rules. The new rules and rates apply only to the reim- bursement of motor vehicle expenses incurred by - • employees, irrespective of annual distance travelled, and • shareholder-employees whose total reimbursed travel for the year does not exceed 2,000kms. If a company wishes to reimburse a shareholder- employee for more than 2,000km of business- related travel in one year, the reimbursement must be on a factual, verifiable basis. The PSMRs or the alternative rates cannot be used. Self-employed taxpayers, including members of a partnership, can use the PSMRs where their business travel does not exceed 2,000km in a year. If the travel exceeds that figure, claims for travel must be based on actual expenditure apportioned, where appropriate, between the business and private travel of the vehicle concerned. Reference HO 10.A.8.4 the National Standard Cost Scheme. The main difference will be that this method will use a farmer's own costs of production, rather than nationally provided average costs. Amendments to Herd Scheme The existing herd scheme will be retained but made more flexible. Differential herd values will be introduced so farmers can value their herd livestock at values other than national average market values. This will allow them to take into account regional, breed and quality variations. Subject to a supporting valuation, a farmer can set his/her herd values at 90%, 100%, 110%, 120% or 130% of the National Average Market Values. However, the farmer must notify Inland Revenue before changing values, and any change in percent- age will be assessable for income tax. Farmers will also be able to value some stock of a class under the herd scheme, and some under an alternative valuation option. They will then have the discretion to move stock from the alternative valuation scheme to the herd scheme on an animal- by-animal basis. This will help farmers who are increasing livestock numbers or recovering from an adverse event. Trial of new value setting methods Because of problems with the current method of setting National Average Market Values, the Government will trial two new methods. These are a year-end “snapshot” of livestock values based on information from livestock valuers, and a survey of stock values over the main sale periods. Livestock Valuation Reform Announced Introduction The Government is going to reform the way livestock is valued for tax purposes, to give greater flexibility and more accurate results. Under the present regime, some farmers who use the trading stock scheme pay tax in advance through overvaluation of livestock. This applies especially to farmers who breed their own stock. This is the main reason why the Government capped trading stock values over the last two years. Please note that this article discusses proposed legislation, which is not law at the time of print- ing. Replacement of Trading Scheme The trading stock scheme will be repealed to overcome the anomaly set out above. It will be replaced by two new cost options, one of which is based on national standard costs. National Standard Cost Scheme A National Standard Cost Scheme will replace the trading stock scheme, to more readily reflect the cost of livestock production. Inland Revenue will announce figures each year from which farmers will be able to calculate the value of livestock on hand at year's end. Self Assessed Cost Scheme This is a new option for valuing livestock at cost. It will generally follow the same operating rules as 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.2 Amendments to High-Priced Livestock Scheme There are several proposed amendments to the high-priced livestock scheme: • it will now apply only to stock with a purchase price of more than $500, or more than five times the National Average Market Values. • stock may be depreciated using either the straight line or diminishing value method • depreciation rates will be based on economic life • once an animal is depreciated to the national average market value, it will be moved to the scheme being used for other stock of the same class. The requirement to depreciate animals to $1 will be repealed. Adverse Events The Government will amend the Income Equalisa- tion Scheme to make it easier for farmers to spread income resulting from the force sale of livestock after an adverse event. Farmers will be able to “self-assess” an adverse event depending on their own circumstances, rather than having to rely on regionally declared events, as under the present scheme. More Information These changes result from recommendations that the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee made to the Government. If you want a copy of the Committee's report, which contains the Govern- ment's decisions, please write to: Legislative Affairs Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Legislation not passed yet Please note that these proposals are not law yet. We will publish full details of the changes as soon as they are passed by Parliament. Cash Basis Holders and the Application of Determination G24: Straight Line Method Introduction We have been asked if cash basis holders can use Determination G24: Straight Line Method. The short answer to this question is no. The straight line method is only available to taxpayers who calculate income or expenditure on an accru- als basis. A more detailed explanation is provided below. Cash Basis Holder Status is Binding The term “Cash basis holder” is defined in section 64D of the Income Tax Act 1976 (“the Act”). A taxpayer cannot opt out of the cash basis holder status. This is clear from section 64D(1), which states: “Subject to this section, a natural person shall be a cash basis holder in respect of financial arrangements held by that person in any in- come year ...” (emphasis added). Significance of Cash Basis Holder Status A cash basis holder returns income from financial arrangements on a cash or receivable basis, subject to the calculation of the cash base price adjustment set out in section 64F(3). This means that income during the life of the financial arrangement is not calculated on a yield to maturity basis. That point is evident from the wording of section 64C(5), which states: “Subsections (2) to (4) of this section shall not apply- (a) To a cash basis holder ...”. This means that a cash basis holder cannot use the straight line method provided for in section 64C(2A). Determination G24: Straight Line Method The Commissioner signed Determination G24 on 10 July 1991. It is a simplification measure that relaxes the requirement for taxpayers to calculate income on a yield to maturity basis. Cash basis holders cannot use Determination G24 as it is the expression of a method provided for in section 64C(2A). As mentioned above, that section does not apply to cash basis holders. Reference: HO.T.181 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.2 Tax Options for Farmers affected by Snowstorms The Ministers of Agriculture and Revenue recently made an announcement to ensure that farmers hit by the recent snow storms are aware of their tax options. The tax implications of the devastation caused by the storms emerged as one of the major concerns of the affected farmers. There are several opportu- nities in the tax system to alleviate these concerns. To avoid overpaying tax, farmers with signifi- cantly reduced incomes should consider estimating their 1992-93 provisional tax. Such estimates should be “fair and reasonable”, although Inland Revenue is aware that many farmers are unsure how badly the snowstorms have affected them. The Commissioner of Inland Revenue will also use his discretion to extend the period in which farm- ers can make Income Equalisation deposits. For farmers who cannot yet make deposits for the 1991-92 income year, an extension will be allowed until 30 October. Farmers who have been ad- versely affected by the snowstorms will also be allowed early withdrawals from the scheme. Farmers should contact their accountants or tax advisors to ensure they make the best use of the tax options available to them. Snow Relief Trust - Charitable Status Inland Revenue recently granted charitable status to the South Island "Snow Relief Trust". This means that individuals who make donations to the Trust will be able to claim a rebate under section 56A(2) of the Income Tax Act, and public compa- nies that make donations will be entitled to a deduction under section 147. To be eligible, donations to the Trust must be evidenced by a receipt. Receipts will be in the form of a Trust Bank or Bank of New Zealand deposit slip butt, stamped with the name of the Trust. Under section 56A(2), an individual may only claim a rebate for a donation of $5 or more. For any income year, the total rebate that an individual can claim is limited to the lesser of 33 1 /3% of all donations s/he makes, or $500. For public companies, the deduction available under section 147 (for any income year, to any one donee) is limited to the greater of 1% of the company's assessable income, or $4,000. The total deduction to all donees for a single year is limited to the greater of $1,000 or 5% of the company's assessable income. Reference: HO 10.C.5.1 Group Companies will be entitled to new tax privileges under a change in Inland Revenue Policy. Inland Revenue has adopted the Tax Simplification Committee's recommendation that group compa- nies should be able to nominate a company officer to act as tax agent for the group. The nominated agent will have the privileges set out in the existing extension of time arrangements. This will allow group companies to spread their workload for IR 4 company tax returns throughout the financial year. The extension of time arrangements will be slightly different for group companies. Each arrangement will be separately negotiated between the group and the local District Commissioner or a nomi- nated Inland Revenue representative. Groups of companies will also have all their statements and returns sent out in one envelope, rather than receiving them separately. Please contact your local Inland Revenue office if you want more information about this change. Extension of Time for Group Companies Tax in Dispute - Interest Rate Change The interest rate on tax in dispute has been low- ered from 13.5% to 10%. The new rate applies from 1 April 1992, both for interest paid by and to Inland Revenue. Where interest is payable for a period that bridges 1 April 1992, it will be calculated at the old rate for the period before 1 April, and the new rate on and after that date. The new rate will also apply to interest on late GST refunds, and GST in dispute. Two separate rates will also apply, where a calculation bridges 1 April 1992. Reference: HO 10.T.2.3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.2 Tax Audits - New Booklet from Inland Revenue Inland Revenue has recently released “A Guide to Inland Revenue Audits”, a booklet for small business operators and investors. It describes the audit process from start to finish; what happens during the auditor's first visit, what records are checked, and so on. The booklet then gives a detailed explanation of the individual's rights and obligations during an audit, including how much notice is required, what the person being audited must do, what s/he may do, the role of legal privilege and the right to see IRD records about him/herself. The book also covers what happens after an audit; assessments, refund or payment of tax, late pay- ment penalties, penal action, and what the tax- payer can do if s/he disagrees with the results of the audit. Most people who are in business or who receive investment income will be audited by Inland Revenue at some stage, so it is important that they understand the audit process, and their rights and obligations. This new book takes the mystery out of the experience of being audited. IRD Follow-up on Undeclared Income A new system is making it hard for taxpayers to hide undeclared income from Inland Revenue. Two thousand people who gave incorrect income details in last year's tax returns have already been identified by the system, in its first five months to the end of August. Together they owe an extra $2.8 million tax. The new Income Verification system works by checking information that taxpayers supply against income from employers and other sources. All returns that Inland Revenue receives are automati- cally checked for discrepancies, and taxpayers who have left income out of their returns are identified and followed up. Most taxpayers are honest and fill in their tax returns correctly. However, there are some who believe they should pay less than their fair share. The new computer system makes it very difficult to hide income, and will help Inland Revenue to make sure that everyone pays the fair amount of tax. Where Inland Revenue finds that taxpayers have deliberately attempted to hide income, they will be charged a late payment penalty, and could face prosecution and penal tax. Inland Revenue is sending letters to people who gave incorrect income details, to tell them what they owe before sending them an account for the outstanding tax. Anyone who disagrees with such an assessment should contact their local Inland Revenue office. Qualifying Companies winding up It may be argued that a Qualifying Company which winds up or is formed part way through an income year is unable to maintain Qualifying Company status for that year. This is because section 393B(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 re- quires a company to satisfy certain criteria at all times during the income year. It is not intended that a company lose the benefits of being a Qualifying Company or a Loss Attribut- ing Qualifying Company in any year solely be- cause it winds up or is formed in that year. Inland Revenue will interpret the Qualifying Company legislation accordingly. We have been asked whether Inland Revenue considers that a company which elects to be a Qualifying Company for the 1992-93 income year, and which pays Qualifying Company Election Tax at the concessional rate, will effectively revoke its election to enter the regime if it winds up in the 1992-93 year. If the answer was “yes”, the com- pany would not be liable to pay Qualifying Com- pany Election Tax, and any distributions it makes would be subject to tax at the normal rate. Inland Revenue believes that the principles out- lined above would apply to this situation. A Qualifying Company that winds up part way through the 1992-93 income year will retain its Qualifying Company status for the part of the year before winding up, provided it meets all the other eligibility criteria during that time. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.2 Due Dates Reminder October 5 PAYE deductions and IR 66ES for last 15 days of September 1992 due - “large” employers only. 7 First instalment of 1993 provisional tax due for taxpayers with June balance dates.

You can do this by applying to your local Inland Revenue office. During recent maintenance of Inland Revenue's database, we have found several cases where an IRD number belonging to one company is being used by another company. Usually, this comes about when a branch or division of a company is sold, and the new owner continues to use the old IRD number. This often results in payments for income tax, GST, Fringe Benefit Tax and/or AC premiums going to the wrong account, which causes incorrect assess- ments. It then takes a lot of work for the companies (and Inland Revenue) to sort out the situation, and get both accounts corrected. Your attention to this will help to improve the service that we give to you. Dividends paid on Fixed Rate Shares issued before 30 July 1991 Section 63(2E) of the Income Tax Act provides that a dividend is exempt where it is paid before 1 April 1994 on fixed rate shares which were acquired before 8.00 pm on 30 July 1991. Such a dividend is exempt provided that no term of the share is altered at any time from 30 July 1991 to the date the dividend is paid (section 63(2E)(e)). Inland Revenue has been asked whether the termination of a contract in the circumstances outlined below constitutes an alteration of the contract that would prevent the exemption apply- ing. A company has entered into a preference share transaction. Under the contract for acquisition of the shares, the shares are fixed rate, the rate is not reviewable and there are no circumstances in which the term of the contract can be altered. The contract terminates at some point after 1 April 1994. In view of the taxation of dividends on the shares from 1 April 1994, the parties enter into an agree- ment now to terminate the contract on a certain date, such as a dividend payment date, before 1 April 1994 and before the contract expires. Will a dividend be exempt where it is paid prior to termination, but subsequent to the agreement to terminate the contract? The Commissioner considers that an agreement to terminate the contract in the above circumstances does not in itself constitute an alteration of a term of the contract for the purposes of section 63(2E)(e). The 1991 Budget measures relating to pre-Budget fixed rate shares anticipated that such arrangements may be terminated before 1 April 1994. It was not intended that an agreement to terminate would alter the exempt status of divi- dends paid on these shares prior to termination. Students' Loan Obligations - IRD Pamphlet Inland Revenue has recently distributed to stu- dents a pamphlet explaining their repayment obligations. Although the legislation which enables IRD to collect loan repayments through PAYE is not yet passed, essential information had to be published before students leave their campuses for the year. Borrowers need to know about their obligations now, so they can meet them when the legislation is in place next year. Many borrowers are unaware of key issues, such as how Inland Revenue will collect their repay- ments when they get a job, and what will happen to their loans if they go overseas. They will need to know the answers to these questions before they finish their studies, and mailing the pamphlet to all borrowers is the most direct way of telling them. Ministry of Education figures show that 43,554 loan contracts have been processed up to the end of September, with a total amount of $139,031,385. This averages out to $3,192 per student. You can get a copy of the pamphlet from any Student Loan Office, from Student Associations on campus, or from any Inland Revenue district office. We will produce a more detailed booklet as soon as the legislation is passed. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.3 Non-Resident Sports People and Entertainers Application of Section 61(17), Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction We have been asked to state our policy on the exemption from New Zealand income tax of visiting overseas entertainers and sports people. This item sets out Inland Revenue's interpretation of section 61(17) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Background Under Section 61(17), any income that a non- resident entertainer derives from taking part in any of the following activities is exempt from New Zealand income tax: •a cultural programme of (or wholly or partly sponsored by) any overseas government or the New Zealand Government • a programme of an overseas foundation, trust, or other organisation that exists (either wholly or partly) to promote any cultural activity, and that is not carried on for the private pecuniary profit of any proprietor, member, or shareholder • any game or sport, where the participants are the official representatives of an association, league, union, or other body that administers the game or sport in an overseas country. Section 61(17) was inserted into the Land and Income Tax Act 1954 (now the Income Tax Act 1976) by section (5) of the Land and Income Tax Amendment Act (No. 3) 1975. The introduction followed an exemption in the Income Tax (With- holding Payments) Regulations 1975, which speci- fied that payments to certain overseas artistes would not attract a new withholding tax on pay- ments to entertainers and sports people. Comment The legislation was intended to exempt from New Zealand income tax any fees or remuneration paid to visitors to this country who were (either singu- larly or as a group or team) official representatives of their home government or the body organising the game or sport in the home country. Mostly these visitors were employees of that overseas government or organisation. Comment made at the time the legislation was introduced gave the following examples of types of organisations whose participants would qualify for the exemption. • Chinese acrobatic teams, Russian circus or ballet • A symphony orchestra or ballet supported by public funds or subscriptions in the overseas country • An Australian Rugby League team - but if an Australian club team visited New Zealand, its members were not exempt from tax under this section. Clearly the intention when the legislation was introduced was that the exemption would apply to national (government) sponsored activities that had some “cultural” significance, and to interna- tional representative sports teams. There has been some confusion over the interpreta- tion of the phrase cultural programme in para- graph (a) of section 61(17), as the term is not defined. Considering the intention of the section on its introduction and the examples given at that time, an artiste would need to be more or less an employee of, or paid by, his/her government or a government funded agency at the time of the visit to qualify for an exemption. The fact that an overseas organisation has some government input or sponsorship does not neces- sarily qualify the visiting entertainer for exemp- tion. Each case must be considered on its own merits. Inland Revenue’s decision in each instance will be influenced by the original intention of the legislation as mentioned earlier. Where the event is organised in New Zealand by a New Zealand organisation there would need to be some Government involvement or sponsorship as well as a significant cultural element to the activi- ties that make up the programme. The Wellington Festival of the Arts is an example of the latter. All overseas performers attending the Festival as invited guests of the organising committee would be exempt from New Zealand income tax under paragraph (a). An overseas entertainer would not be allowed an exemption if s/he was not employed by an over- seas government or agency, and the local event was not an overseas or New Zealand Government sponsored cultural programme. Paragraph (b) of the section exempts payments made where the visit is organised by an overseas non-profit foundation, trust, or organisation formed to promote cultural activities. Exemption 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.3 under this paragraph could include, national, state and civic organisations, such as orchestras, choirs and similar public funded cultural activities. An overseas artiste visiting New Zealand at the invitation of a local foundation, trust etc. would not qualify under this paragraph. Sportspersons are covered by paragraph (c). To qualify, the athletes must be official representa- tives of the governing body of the sport in their home country, state or city. A sportsperson may qualify for exemption on one visit but not on another. The example given earlier of a rugby league player visiting New Zealand as an Austral- ian representative on one visit would be exempt. The same player visiting with a club team would fail to qualify as exempt. NOTE: The above rules may be modified by any double tax agreements any individual country may have with New Zealand. Tax records of non-resident entertainers and sportspersons are handled by the Non-resident Entertainers section in our Auckland district office. If you are enquiring about this class of taxpayer, please write to: The District Commissioner Inland Revenue Department P O Box 1498 AUCKLAND and mark your letter for the attention of the Non- resident Entertainers section. Reference: H.O.10.V.4.2 The Department of Social Welfare is paying special assistance to farmers who are under critical finan- cial hardship, such as kiwifruit growers and farmers affected by the South Island snowstorms. Section 61(35) of the Income Tax Act exempts from income tax such special assistance paid by Social Welfare. Farmers who receive such assistance from Social Welfare should therefore not treat it as income for tax purposes. These payments from Social Welfare are not the same as the Adverse Event Family Income Support payments which the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries made from October 1988 to March 1991. Special Assistance paid to Farmers in Critical Financial Hardship Determination E8: Persons Not Required To Comply With Section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976 This determination sets out the circumstances under which people do not have to make accrual adjustments, as required by section 104A of the Income Tax Act 1976, to the expenditure deduct- ible under section 104. It specifies the kind of expenditure, amount and maximum period from balance date where accrual adjustments are not required. It differs from E7 by applying to the income year commencing 1 April 1992 and updat- ing the rating reference. The determination was made pursuant to section 104A(5) of the Act, and the Commissioner signed it on 7 October 1992. The full determination is printed in the appendix to this Tax Information Bulletin. Inland Revenue achieves reduction in Overdue Tax The amount of overdue tax owed to Inland Rev- enue has dropped by nearly $140 million in the past year. The collectible debt at 30 June 1992 was $1,089.6 million, compared with $1,228.4 million at the same time last year. Over July and August, this figure has been reduced by a further $40 million. Inland Revenue’s new debt systems have helped us to achieve this significant reduction in debt owed. We are now able to chase people up a lot faster, since our system automatically identifies debtors and issues reminder notices. A reorganisa- tion of Inland Revenue’s Debt Management units will help us to continue making a significant inroad on the debt. Inland Revenue’s job is to make sure that everyone pays their fair share of tax. People are becoming more aware of their obligation to pay their tax on time, but we will continue to follow up thos who don’t. If anyone is having problems meeting their tax liability, they should get in touch with the Debt Management staff at their local district office. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.3 Due Dates Reminder October 30 GST return and payment for period ended 30 September 1992 due.

Taxation of Redundancy Payments Introduction All redundancy payments paid on or after 30 No- vember 1992 will be fully taxable as income of the recipient. This change results from the passing of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) 1992 (previously known as the Redundancy Payments (Taxation and Benefits) Bill). Background The legislation relating to redundancy payments had been before Parliament since May of this year. It proposed an alteration of the treatment of redundancy payments for both taxation and Social Welfare benefit purposes. Now that the Bill has passed, it has created sepa- rate amendment Acts to both the Income Tax and Social Security Acts. The Social Security Amend- ment Act (No 4) 1992 makes changes to the stand down period imposed on applicants for unemploy- ment benefits who have received redundancy payments. Key Issues Section 68 The concession in section 68 of the Income Tax Act that applied to redundancy payments has been repealed with effect from 30 November 1992. All redundancy payments paid on or after that date will be taxed in full as income. Such payments are extra emoluments so they will be liable for PAYE deductions of 28 cents in the dollar. There is no longer any need to calculate a “specified sum”, nor to ensure that a redundancy payment is made in a single lump sum. Fringe Benefit Tax Redundancy payments have been removed from the definition of fringe benefit in the Income Tax Act. Employers will not have to pay Fringe Benefit Tax on any part of a redundancy payment paid after 30 November 1992. Earner Premium Accident Compensation Earner Premium does not have to be deducted from redundancy payments. This applies from 1 July 1992. Impact on Social Assistance Taxpayers should be aware that any redundancy payment they receive will be included in their assessable income for the year. An increase in assessable income will have a direct effect on eligibility for some forms of social assistance during that year. This may particularly affect recipients of Family Support and National Super- annuation who receive a redundancy payment. These taxpayers should contact Inland Revenue to discuss the effect of the redundancy payment on their entitlement to any benefits and, if necessary, apply for a special tax code. Other people who may be affected are those who are receiving student allowances, repaying student loans, or paying Child Support. Payments before 30 November 1992 Redundancy amounts paid to employees before 30 November 1992 will be eligible for the concession- ary tax treatment provided for in section 68 of the Income Tax Act. However, note that the require- ments of section 68 are strict and must be complied with before the concession will be allowed. In particular, the following rules must be observed : •there must be a true redundancy which falls within the scope of the definition of “redun- dancy” in section 68; •the payment must be in a single lump sum; •the payment must be made on the occasion of the termination of the employment. The Courts have 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 held that this is a timing requirement and pay- ments made prior to or after the date of ceasing work will be ineligible for the concession; •the employee cannot cease employment and then recommence in the same position or substantially the same employment as that from which s/he received a redundancy payment; •payments to which the redundant employee is entitled but which are independent of the redun- dancy (e.g. holiday or sick pay, long service leave) are fully assessable as income and cannot be included in the redundancy lump sum. Retiring Allowances The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 4) does not affect the taxation of lump sum retiring allow- ances, bonuses and gratuities, which are still covered by Section 68 of the Income Tax Act. These payments continue to be taxed in full as fringe benefits and do not form part of the recipi- ent’s assessable income. However, the Government has recently announced that it will shortly intro- duce legislation which will make these retirement payments fully taxable as income in the same way as redundancy payments. The change to taxation of lump sum retirement payments is proposed to take effect on 1 April 1993. There may be some confusion about the difference between a retirement and a redundancy. Retire- ment is not defined in the Income Tax Act but redundancy retains the definition contained in section 68. After 30 November any payment that falls within the definition of a redundancy pay- ment in section 68 (i.e. the position becomes superfluous to the requirements of the employer) can only be taxed as income of the recipient. South Island Snow Relief Scheme Introduction This item clarifies the tax treatment of payments made under the South Island Snow Relief Scheme. Payments made under this scheme are not taxable in the hands of the recipients. Discussion The New Zealand Income Support Service (NZISS) makes payments under this scheme pursuant to section 124(1)(d) of the Social Security Act 1964. That section provides for the payment of money out of the Consolidated Account for: “the purpose of \[granting special assistance under\] ... any welfare programme approved by the \[Minister of Social Welfare\]:” The scheme is intended to assist South Island farming families who were significantly affected by snowfalls in July and/or August 1992, and who cannot now meet the costs of essential family living expenses. Applicants must also meet NZISS criteria, including the location of the farm. The payments are designed to feed and clothe family members, and are not intended to provide money for farm working expenses. The maximum amounts payable per week under the scheme are $100 for a single farmer, $145 for a farming couple or a solo farmer with one child, $180 per week for a farming couple with one child, and a further $10 per week for each additional child. Tax status of payments To be treated as income, a payment must either fall within the broad definition of income or, failing that, within the specific provisions of section 65 of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 65 sets out specific receipts that are to be included as assessable income for tax purposes. Section 65(2)(d) provides that “income tested benefits” are assessable income. Section 2 of the Income Tax Act defines an income tested benefit as a benefit payable under Part 1 of the Social Secu- rity Act. However, payments under the South Island Snow Relief Scheme are paid under Part 3 of the Social Security Act, not Part 1. This means that they are not assessable income under section 65(2)(d) of the Income Tax Act. Therefore, these payments must be considered under the normal meaning of the term “income” if they are to be taxable. The term “income” is not defined in the Act, but the Courts have considered it on a number of occasions. Generally speaking, income is a gain in money or money’s worth that a person derives as a reward for services rendered, from the profits of a busi- ness, from a profit-making undertaking, or from property. In addition, there must be an element of recurrence or regularity in the payments. Inland Revenue does not consider that these payments are income. The recipients are not 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 receiving the payments as a reward for services rendered, nor are they a return from an investment or undertaking entered into for the purpose of making a profit. Although the same could be said for the unemployment benefit, that payment is specifically included in section 65 since it is an income-tested benefit. Consequently, NZISS special assistance payments from the South Island Snow Relief Scheme are not taxable. Reference: HO.10.F.1.1. Summary of Qualifying Company Regime The Qualifying Company regime comes into effect from the 1992-93 income year. It is designed so closely-held companies and their shareholders can be treated, as far as possible, as one entity for income tax purposes. This means that for taxation purposes a Qualifying Company is treated in a similar way to a partnership. Most companies which have five or fewer share- holders or are “flat owning” companies can elect to become Qualifying Companies. There are special rules for counting the number of shareholders. For example, a husband, wife and their children are counted as one. Where a shareholder is itself a company there are “look through” provisions to determine the number of ultimate shareholders. The major advantages of electing to become a Qualifying Company are: • Generally only dividends paid with imputation credits attached are taxable; other dividends are tax free. • Capital gains, both realised and unrealised, can be distributed tax free without having to wind up the company, • In most cases, a Qualifying Company may elect to become a Loss Attributing Qualifying Com- pany (LAQC). A LAQC passes company losses it has incurred on to its shareholders to be claimed against their other income or carried forward. The possible disadvantages of electing to become a Qualifying Company are: • The company may have to pay a Qualifying Company Election Tax (QCET). Whether QCET is payable depends largely on the company’s retained earnings. • The company must forfeit any losses carried forward from previous years. • If the company fails to pay its income tax while it is a Qualifying Company, the shareholders who have elected are liable to pay it. If a company was incorporated before 1 December 1991 and elects to become a Qualifying Company for the 1992-93 income year, the rate of QCET is reduced from 33% to 7.5%, and only 25% of the prior years’ losses are cancelled (these cannot be attributed to shareholders). To be eligible for these concessions, Inland Revenue must receive the elections by 31 March 1993. There is a lot of information to deal with in enter- ing and staying in the regime. The legislation behind it is explained in Tax Information Bulletin Volume Three No 7. There is also a “Qualifying Companies” booklet available from any Inland Revenue office. This explains how the regime works, including the practical requirements of election and how to calculate QCET. Inland Revenue Audits - Retaining Private Records Taxpayers who are in business may find it advis- able to retain their private financial records, as well as business records. This is because banks and other organisations frequently charge when they search for records which a taxpayer has not re- tained. This charge is often a source of annoyance to taxpayers, especially when it is for searching for non-business records. The Income Tax Act does not require business taxpayers to keep private records (such as bank statements, withdrawals, cheques and deposit details). However, when Inland Revenue audits business records, we often check private records at the same time. This may be to ascertain if business receipts have been lodged to private accounts, and/or to consider a taxpayer’s private expendi- ture. This means that it may pay taxpayers who are in business (either as sole traders, in partnership or through a company) to also retain their private bank account and other records. They will then avoid the expense of obtaining a copy of these records, if they are audited by Inland Revenue. In addition, if these private records are readily available, the time taken up in an audit will be less. Tax practitioners may wish to bring this recom- mendation to the notice of their clients who may be affected. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 It is our Job to be Fair Confirmed by Advertising Standards Complaints Board The Advertising Standards Complaints Board has rejected a complaint that Inland Revenue's slogan “It's our job to be fair” is misleading. The complaint concerned an IRD advertisement in the New Zealand Herald to remind employers and companies to file their PAYE reconciliations by 31 May 1992. The complainant contended that it was not Inland Revenue's job to be fair, but to collect taxes in accordance with the relevant legislation. In its decision, the Advertising Standards Com- plaints Board referred to a Taxation Review Authority judgement that “The slogan must mean that it is the Department's job to apply the law fairly to all taxpayers, and to treat taxpayers in an even-handed manner, so that taxpayers in the same situation are treated in a similar manner.” The complaint was an isolated case, as research has shown that 84% of taxpayers surveyed agreed that IRD was helping the public by providing reminder advertising. The purpose of the advertising is to ensure that people do not inadvertently fail to meet their tax obligations through lack of awareness of a due date for paying, or filing a return. This is certainly fair, as there are penalties for people who do not comply. Unclaimed Money Inland Revenue has put together a list of thou- sands of people who may be entitled to unclaimed money. These funds include dividends, old bank accounts, insurance policies, unclaimed wages and the balances in solicitors' trust accounts. Under the Unclaimed Monies Act 1971, money which is left untouched for six years or more is paid into a consolidated fund. Inland Revenue collects this money, and refunds it to the rightful owners if they can prove their identity. Anyone who believes they may be owed money from this fund should forward their name, ad- dress, IRD number and some proof of identity to: The District Commissioner Unclaimed Monies Inland Revenue Department P O Box 812 MASTERTON A copy of a birth certificate, a driver's licence or a passport is acceptable identification. Liable Parents' Tax Returns needed Liable parents who haven't already filed their 1992 tax returns should do so as soon as possible, to avoid paying too much child support next year. The Child Support Agency recently began sending out letters to more than 40,000 liable parents who haven't filed 1992 returns, to ask them to provide their income details for the 1992 year. These letters are the first stage in the annual assessment of Child Support liabilities. The amount that liable parents have to pay is recalculated in January each year, based on their taxable income of two years previously - in this case, the year ended 31 March 1992. Parents who haven't given Inland Revenue their income details may have their liability assessed at the maximum income of over $55,000. Most liable parents earn less than this amount, so it is to their advantage to provide their income details. They can do this by sending one of the following to Inland Revenue: • their 1992 tax return • copies of all their 1992 IR 12s • a letter from their employer, the NZ Income Support Service or Accident Compensation. Inland Revenue's Child Support Agency will not contact liable parents who have already filed their 1992 returns. Anyone who has only recently sent in a 1992 return and still receives a child support letter should disregard it. Any liable parents who want to query the informa- tion they receive should ring the Child Support Agency toll-free on 0800 800 363. For people in the Auckland free calling area, the number is 486 2313. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 Names of Tax Evaders Published Inland Revenue made public the names of more than 400 tax evaders recently. The list was pub- lished in the New Zealand Gazette, Issue No. 171. These people deliberately evaded tax totalling almost $2 million dollars. They include a large number of employers who failed to deduct PAYE from their employees' wages, or who failed to pay these deductions to Inland Revenue. More than 70% of tax evaders fell into this category, and one company was charged over $62,000 in penal tax. Other offences included income tax offences, evasion of Fringe Benefit Tax, and failing to ac- count for GST. The individual amounts evaded ranged from a few hundred dollars up to $150,000. Voluntary Disclosures People can contact Inland Revenue to make volun- tary disclosures about what is wrong with their tax affairs. If they do this before we discover possible evasion, they will not be prosecuted in Court, and they will be charged penal tax at the lower rate of 25% instead of 150 percent. Further, they will not have their names published as tax evaders. If you want more information about making a voluntary disclosure, ask for the “Putting your Tax Affairs Right” booklet (IR 282) from any Inland Revenue office. Error in the Working Copies of the GST Legislation There are no paragraphs (cb) and (ic) in the current legislation. The sections involved provide objection rights for taxpayers in respect of certain decisions made by the Commissioner. Reference should be made to the GST Amendment Act 1990, number 64. Working copies should be corrected accordingly. There is an error in the printing of the Reprinted Statutes and on page 90,851 of the sixth (6th) edition of the CCH GST Legislation. Section 32(1)(a) is cited as“.. 11(1)(cb):” This should be“.. 11(1)(ab):” Section 32(1)(aa) is cited as “.. 11(ic):” This should be“.. 11(1C):” Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. The Acts referred to in this package are named at the top of each group of items. Income Tax Act 1976 Donation of Books to Library Section 56A - Rebate in Respect of Gifts of Money and Payment of School Fees: A taxpayer donated some books to a city library and asked whether this could be treated as a donation for the purposes of the donations rebate. The taxpayer also asked whether a claim could be made in excess of the allowable $500 rebate. A taxpayer can only claim a rebate under section 56A for a “gift of money”; s/he cannot claim a rebate for donated goods or property. The Commissioner has no discretion to allow a rebate for a greater amount than the $500 specified in section 56A. Reference: HO.TPP014 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 Local Authority Childcare Centre's Income Section 61 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax: A local authority asked whether the income it derived from an Early Childhood Care Centre was exempt from income tax. The authority set the centre up as a company for the purpose of making a profit. Section 61(2A) of the Act sets out the types of income on which a local authority is assessable for income tax purposes. A local authority trading enterprise's income, or income that a local authority derives from a local authority trading enterprise, is assessable. Section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974 defines a local authority trading enterprise as a company in which the local authority holds equity securities or voting rights, or an organisation through which the local authority operates a trading undertaking. In this case the income from the child care operation was assessable. Reference: HO.TPA026 Taxation of Legal Aid Payments Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: The taxpayer, who was employed as a salesperson, was a defendant in a court case and asked whether legal aid payments received should be treated as assessable income. The word “income” is not defined in the Act. It is necessary to rely on the char- acteristics that have been identified by the courts over the years. An important feature of income is that it is something which comes in - it is a gain or a profit. The case Finlay J. v IR Commrs. (1934) 18 TC 12 made it clear that income tax is a tax on what in one form or another goes into a person’s pocket. In the case of recipients of legal aid, there is no doubt that a benefit is received, and that the benefit has an easily established monetary value. However, the legal aid has no value to the recipient other than saving that person from incur- ring expenditure. The value of the benefit cannot be converted into money by the recipient, as s/he does not physically receive the payment. Consequently, someone who receives legal aid cannot be said to be receiving income. If the taxpayer was a lawyer for whom payments of legal aid constituted fees earned, then the payments would be assessable income. This is because the lawyer receives the payment directly as income. Reference: HO.TPP034 Spreading of Accident Compensation Payments Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: A taxpayer received a lump sum payment of earnings-related compensation from the Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Corporation, and asked to have the income spread over the years that the compensation covered. Payments of earnings related compensation are assessable as income under section 65(2)(c) of the Act. The payments are assessable in the year of receipt. There are no spreading provisions in the Act for this type of payment. Reference: HO.TPP001 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 Crop Price included in Sale and Purchase Agreement Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: An orchardist asked whether a payment for crops on the sale of an orchard was assessable income. The sale and purchase agreement for the orchard included a separate price for crops which had not been harvested at the date of the sale. Where the crop has a price which is shown separately in the sale and purchase agreement, that price is assessable income to the vendor. The purchaser can claim an equivalent deduction. If no separate price is assigned in the sale to growing crops, the crop proceeds will be assessable in full to the purchaser when the crop is harvested and sold. Reference: HO.TPA006 Interest on Investment with Nominee Company in Liquidation Section 75 - Income Credited in Account or Otherwise Dealt With: A taxpayer invested money with a nominee company. Interest from the investment was compounded and reinvested. The nominee company subsequently went into liquidation with little likelihood of the investment being recovered. The taxpayer asked whether a refund of tax could be claimed on the interest which had been reinvested with the nominee company. Section 75(1) of the Act sets out the situations under which income is deemed to be derived. It states that where income has been credited in account or rein- vested, or accumulated, or dealt with in the interest of that person, it represents assessable income. As the interest in this case was reinvested, it is deemed to have been derived. The question of whether or not the investment is subsequently recovered does not affect the taxation of the interest already earned. Interest income was de- rived, was assessable and was taxed accordingly. Any resident withholding tax paid on this interest is credited against the tax liability in the taxpayer’s annual return of income. Reference: HO.TPP021 Childcare Expenditure Section 105 - Deduction for Expenditure or Loss Incurred in the Production of Income from Employment: The taxpayer wished to claim a deduction for ex- penditure incurred on childcare. The person had returned to previous employ- ment following parental leave. Section 105(2) of the Act prevents an employee from claiming a deduction for expenditure or loss incurred in earning income from employment. This means that a claim for childcare expenses is not allowable. A self-employed person is not able a claim a deduction for childcare expenditure as it is an expense of a private nature and is not allowable under section 106(1)(j) of the Act. However, expenditure on childcare may qualify for the rebate pro- vided by section 54 (housekeeper or child care rebate). Reference: HO.TPA003 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 New Zealand Exchange Teachers to United Kingdom Section 241 - Determination of Place of Residence: A New Zealand teacher was considering a position as an exchange teacher in the United Kingdom. The teacher wanted to know the tax implications of the exchange. When a New Zealand teacher is on an official exchange to the United Kingdom, the teacher’s salary is still paid from New Zealand. New Zealand residents are subject to tax in New Zealand on their worldwide income, unless it has been specifically exempted. If a teacher is in the United Kingdom, even though that teacher’s salary is being paid from New Zealand, it is being earned in the UK. Consequently, it will only be subject to New Zealand tax if the teacher is still resident in New Zealand for tax purposes. The primary test of whether an individual is a “tax resident” is determined by the existence of a “permanent place of abode” in New Zealand, regardless of whether s/he has a permanent place of abode in any other country. An indi- vidual’s residency status must be worked out on the basis of individual circum- stances. The teacher may also be liable for tax in the United Kingdom. Under the provi- sions of The Double Tax Relief (United Kingdom) Order 1984, a New Zealand exchange teacher will be liable to tax in the United Kingdom on teaching income received from New Zealand, if s/he is present in the United Kingdom for more than an aggregate of 183 days in any 12 consecutive months. To prevent the occurrence of double taxation, the teacher can apply to New Zealand Inland Revenue for a special tax code certificate to reduce the PAYE tax deducted in New Zealand for the period that s/he is subject to tax in both coun- tries. When the teacher files a New Zealand tax return, providing sufficient documen- tary evidence is furnished, a credit will be given for any tax s/he has paid in the UK. However, the amount of credit that will be allowed cannot exceed the amount of New Zealand tax payable on that income. Reference: HO.TPP015 Sports People Playing Overseas Section 242 - Liability of Income Derived from New Zealand and Abroad: The taxpayer (a self-employed sports person) asked about the tax implications of a contract to play for an overseas club. The contract was for 5 months and the taxpayer returned to New Zealand after this period. The contract included cash payments and the supply of accommodation. In this case the taxpayer was deemed to be a resident in New Zealand. All income received by a person who is a resident in New Zealand is liable for income tax in New Zealand under section 242 of the Act. This applies to all income received from within or outside New Zealand. The taxpayer's income from overseas was therefore liable for income tax in New Zealand. The expenditure incurred in earning the income would be allowed as a deduction and a credit for any tax paid overseas would also be allowed. The credit is limited to the lesser of the tax paid overseas or the tax payable in New Zealand on the overseas income. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 If the taxpayer had not been a New Zealand resident for tax purposes during the period of absence s/he would be liable for income tax only on income with a New Zealand source. If the income received from New Zealand included inter- est, dividends or royalties the person would be liable to pay non-resident with- holding tax on this income. Reference: HO.TPA025 Tax Exempt Organisations and Fringe Benefit Tax Section 336N - Fringe Benefit Tax - Interpretation: A sports club asked whether it was liable to file fringe benefit tax returns. An employee of the club had use of the club’s motor vehicle and took it home nightly. Every employer who provides a fringe benefit to an employee must pay Fringe Benefit Tax on that benefit, even if the employer is exempt from income tax under the Income Tax Act or any other act. The club had to file fringe benefit tax returns and account for fringe benefit tax on the employee's use of its motor vehicle. Reference: HO.TPA014 Childcare Facilities and Fringe Benefit Tax Section 336N - Fringe Benefit Tax - Interpretation: An employer asked whether fringe benefit tax would be payable on the value of places in a childcare facility, paid for by the employer, and reserved for employees’ children. The childcare facility was not on the employer’s premises. Any benefit that an employee receives or enjoys is a fringe benefit under section 336N of the Act. In this case, a fringe benefit had arisen and the value of the fringe benefit provided would be based on the actual use of the childcare facility by the employees’ children. The fringe benefit would not qualify for the exemp- tion provided in paragraph (n) of the definition of “fringe benefit” in section 336N(1) as the childcare facility was not on the employer’s premises. If an employer paid for a place at a childcare centre for the child of a specific employee, or paid the employee’s childcare fees, the payment would be mon- etary remuneration and taxable to the employee. Reference: HO.TPA008 Guaranteed Minimum Family Income - Self-Employed People Section 374E - Guaranteed Minimum Family Income Credit of Tax: A self- employed person asked whether s/he was entitled to the Guaranteed Minimum Family Income tax credit in addition to the Family Support Tax Credit. The taxpayer’s total family income was less than $10,000. Section 374E(1) of the Act provides that the Guaranteed Minimum Family In- come tax credit is payable only to a person engaged in employment. A self- employed person is not eligible for the tax credit. Reference: HO.TPA021 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 Withholding Tax and Foreign Entertainers Article 17 - Double Tax Agreement - United States of America: An entertain- ment agency asked what taxes should be deducted from payments to an Ameri- can entertainer who was leaving New Zealand. The entertainer had worked in New Zealand for the previous four months, and had earned approximately US$4,000. A person who is not resident in New Zealand is liable for New Zealand tax on income which has a source in New Zealand. The entertainer would therefore be liable for income tax on the income earned here. Article 17 of the Double Tax Agreement between New Zealand and the United States of America exempts from income tax income of less than US$10,000 per year earned by an entertainer from one country working in the other country. However, the Withholding Payments Regulations do not permit the issue of an exemption certificate to a non-resident entertainer. This certificate would prevent the deduction of withholding tax from the payments. Withholding tax should therefore be deducted at the rate of 20 percent of the gross payments. In this case, the entertainer (or his/her agent) would need to file a return of income to determine the tax liability on the payments. The return can be filed before the taxpayer leaves New Zealand. Inland Revenue would require an undertaking from the taxpayer that s/he will earn no further income while in New Zealand during the remainder of the year for which the return is being filed. Reference: HO.TPA033 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on Goods and Services supplied to Non-Resident Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: An overseas business which was not registered for GST sold an aircraft to a client in New Zealand. When the aircraft arrived in New Zealand, inspection showed that the engine required major maintenance, which under the sale agreement was to be at the expense of the overseas business. The overseas business received the invoice, including GST, for the work done in New Zealand. They asked whether GST should have been charged in view of the fact that they were not resident of New Zealand and were not in New Zealand when the work was done. Goods and services are deemed to be supplied in New Zealand under section 8(2) of the Act where the supplier is resident in New Zealand. In this case as the services were performed in New Zealand by a supplier resident in New Zealand, GST had been correctly charged. Reference: HO.TPA039 GST on Purchases in New Zealand by Overseas Person Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: An overseas resident requested a refund of GST charged on clothing s/he purchased while on holiday in New Zealand. S/he bought the clothes for personal use directly from a clothing retail shop, and took them out of New Zealand with other lug- gage. The overseas person was not registered for GST purposes. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.4 GST was charged on the sale as the supplier was resident in New Zealand. In this case the overseas person was not entitled to a refund of GST as s/he was not registered for GST, and also the goods had been purchased for his/her own use. If the supplier had exported the goods, or if the purchaser had not taken posses- sion of them until s/he was outside New Zealand, the supply would be zero- rated for GST purposes under section 11(1) of the Act. The exception to this ruling would be if the non-resident purchased goods through the sealed bag system. This system allows export warehouse licence holders who have been granted a licence to operate a sealed bag system. They can use this system to sell duty-free and GST-free goods to tourists who will be departing New Zealand within five working days of the date of sale. Reference: HO.TPA028 GST on Assets retained on Cessation of Business Section 11 - Zero-Rating: An overseas business registered for GST for the pur- pose of selling its products in New Zealand. The venture was unsuccessful and the business requested cessation of their GST registration. They also asked if they should account for GST on the unsold goods, which were now held over- seas. The taxable supplies were less than $30,000, and the business did not expect to make any further sales in New Zealand. In this case the business was still required to account for GST on the retained assets under section 10(8) of the Act. However, as the goods were located out- side New Zealand at the time of retention or supply, the supply would be zero- rated under section 11(1)(b) of the Act. Reference: HO.TPA038 GST on Services supplied to Overseas Business Section 11(2) - Zero-Rated Services: An overseas manufacturer commissioned a New Zealand advertising agency to advertise for personnel to work overseas. The agency asked what rate of GST was chargeable on the services provided to the manufacturer. Where services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand, and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are per- formed, the supply is zero-rated under section 11(2)(e) of the Act. In this case GST was chargeable at zero percent because the advertising services were sup- plied “for and to” the non-resident manufacturer. Reference: HO.TPA030 Retention of Business Records for GST Purposes Section 75 - Keeping of Records: An overseas company registered for GST and asked whether it could keep the business records at its head office in Australia. The company would need to obtain approval from Inland Revenue to hold the records in Australia. Section 75(3) of the Act requires that every registered per- son who supplies goods and services in New Zealand shall keep in New Zea- land copies of sufficient records in English for a period of at least 7 years after the end of the taxable period to which the records relate. The section also pro- vides that the Commissioner may on application approve the retention of the records outside New Zealand. The application to retain records outside New Zealand can be approved at an Inland Revenue District Office.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) What we learned from the Readers' Survey This is the first Tax Information Bulletin since we've received the final results of the recent Readers' Survey. The key outcomes from the survey results are: ï The main reason why most people receive the TIB is to find out about new or changed Inland Revenue policies. The second most important reason is to get Inland Revenue's interpretation of new tax laws. ï 90% of readers thought that the level of language in the TIB is just right. ï Almost 80% of readers want to receive the TIB monthly. ï 83% of readers refer back to most issues of the TIB two or more times. As a result of specific requests from readers, we've made these changes: Table of Contents We've moved the table of contents to the front cover, and broken it into sections. This will make it easier to find specific articles when searching through back issues. Due Dates Reminder This section received the highest rating for the ìleast neededî section in the TIB, partly because some of the dates had already passed by the time some readers see the TIB. In future the reminder will cover approxi- mately two months following the TIB release date, so it should be more useful. This means the reminders in successive TIBs will overlap, so you should have plenty of warning for any upcoming due dates. The dates in this reminder come from Inland Revenue's IRD Calendar (IR†24), which covers the period from 1†April 1992 to 31†March 1993 (updated annually). You can get a copy of this calendar from any Inland Revenue office. Two-Column Layout Readers' opinions were divided on this subject. Some thought that having two columns made speed-reading easier, while others found it difficult to follow articles that run from one page to another. To suit as many readers as possible, we will keep the two-column layout, but break as few articles as possible over two or more pages. Where we do have to break an article, we'll include a ìto page...î and ìfrom page...î to make it easier to follow. Typeface (Font) Several readers commented that they had trouble with the typeface (font) in the TIB. We've changed this to a slightly narrower typeface for most of the TIB, so there is less hyphenation, and more words per line. The word and letter spacing is also more consistent. We haven't used the narrower typeface for the ìQues- tions We've Been Askedî section, because the column width there suits the present typeface. Space between Articles A number of readers found the TIB too cramped, and wanted more space between articles. We will leave more space where possible, which will also reduce the number of articles that are printed across two pages. Quality of Paper Several readers found the shiny paper very hard to read under artificial light, and others thought that the paper was of too high a quality (and cost) for the TIB. We are looking into changing the paper in the TIB, and we'll let you know the results as soon as possible. However, since readers use the TIB as a reference document the paper needs to be reasonably durable. Index Frequency Most readers want the index updated every six months. From now on we will close off the index at 30†June and 31†December each year, and issue a new one each January and July. Upcoming Legislation There is some reader demand for articles about upcoming legislation. We will include these, but make sure they are kept separate from the legislation that has been passed. Binders or Labels Several people asked for ring binders or labels to make filed TIBs easier to find. We don't have the facilities to produce or distribute binders as cheaply as you could obtain them, but we will include cut-out-and-stick-on labels in the TIB periodically, probably at the same time as the index. Examples One of the most popular demands was for practical examples to show the effect of new legislation or policy. Wherever appropriate, we will include these from now on. Summary Overall, most readers who took part in the survey were happy with the Tax Information Bulletin (although there was one respondent who used it as a soporific). We hope that you will find the above changes useful, and that the TIB will continue to meet your needs. Thank you to all our readers who took part in the survey. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) New Tax Legislation Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1992, Gaming Duties Amendment Act (No.2) 1992, Stamp and Cheque Duties Amendment Act (No.4) 1992, Estate and Gift Duties Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 The above Acts were enacted on 14 December 1992. They resulted from the Taxation Reform Bill (No.5) 1992, which was introduced into Parliament in July. Many of the bill's proposed amendments dealt with: • The introduction of a new regime that allows wholly-owned companies to elect to form a consoli- dated group, which can be treated as a single entity for tax purposes • Fine-tuning of the Qualifying Company regime and other matters introduced in the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 • A rewrite of the petroleum mining provisions, to incorporate new treatment of exploration and development expenditure, and of farm-out arrangements • The introduction of a new depreciation regime. Parliament subsequently placed the proposed depreciation legislation into a separate bill, the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No.11) 1992. This bill is still with the Finance and Expenditure Select Commit- tee, awaiting Government decisions on international comparability.

This regime applies from 1†April 1993, so standard and late balance date groups can consolidate for the 1993-94 income year. Early balance date groups will be able to consolidate for the 1994-95 income year. Under consolidation, wholly owned groups of compa- nies are able to: ï transfer assets within the consolidated group, with deferred income tax and stamp duty consequences and no gift duty consequences; ï claim deductions for administration and other costs of holding companies which may not be deductible to the company that incurred the expenditure; ï utilise losses incurred by group members, by referring to shareholder continuity of the group, not of the individual member; ï offset imputation credits within the group, even though ordinary imputation credit rules do not permit grouping of imputation credits. The provisions in sections 191C - 191WC are designed to co-ordinate the operation of the regime with the remainder of the Act, as well as to prevent the regime from being abused. Background The Government announced the consolidation regime in its 1991 Budget. In essence, consolidation treats a group of companies owned by the same shareholders as one economic entity. In effect, the regime implements the Valabh Consultative Committeeís preliminary recom- mendation that intra-group asset transfers should be tax-free. An original objective of consolidation as it was first proposed was to reduce the disadvantage to wholly- owned groups caused by the removal of the inter- corporate dividend exemption. However the Govern- ment has decided to retain the inter-corporate dividend exemption for wholly-owned groups. IRD Administrative Practices Depreciable assets Currently Inland Revenue allows depreciable assets to be transferred within 100†percent commonly owned groups without tax consequences. The legislative basis for this administrative discretion is contained in sec- tions 108 and 117 of the Act. The Income Tax Amendment Bill (No.11) 1992 pro- poses amendments to these sections, which could apply as early as 1†October 1992 for early balance date companies. The consolidation tax treatment of deprec- iable assets is likely to replace this administrative practice from 1†April 1993. Gift Duty Currently, asset transfers between 100 percent com- monly-owned companies are treated as not liable for gift duty. Public Information Bulletin No.96 of October 1978 explains this treatment. The consolidation provisions specifically exempt from gift duty any asset transfers in circumstances which constitute gifts, if these occur within 100 percent commonly-owned groups. Inland Revenue will review the policy statement in PIB†96 in light of the amendments contained in this Act. Until the outcome of that review, asset transfers between 100 percent commonly-owned companies which are not part of the same consolidated group will remain unaffected by these amendments. Which companies can consolidate ï Consolidation is restricted to ìeligible companiesî (explained below). ï It is only available to New Zealand resident compa- nies that are 100 percent commonly owned. (General provisions on measurement of voting and market value interests apply when working out 100 percent common ownership.) ï Parent/subsidiary companies or sister/brother compa- nies that are 100 percent commonly owned may elect to form a consolidated group. ï All the companies in a consolidated group must have the same tax balance date. Eligible companies Consolidation is restricted to companies that are taxed under consistent rules for any particular activity. Accordingly, consolidation is restricted to an ìeligible companyî defined in section 191D as one which is all of the following: ï resident in New Zealand; ï not treated as non-resident under a Double Taxation Treaty Agreement; ï not exempt from income tax; ï not a loss attributing qualifying company under the qualifying company regime. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) from page 3 A loss attributing qualifying company may not consoli- date because it may only have one class of share and, by definition, a group consisting of two companies has at least two classes of shares. 100 percent common ownership 100 percent common ownership is determined in the way set out in sections 8A to 8D of the Act (provisions for measuring a personís interest in a company using voting interest, and market value interest where appro- priate). At any one time a group of people must own between them 100 percent of the interests in every company in the group. In addition, they must own the interests in the same proportions for each company (section 191E). Example 1: Group made up of a holding company and its subsidiaries XYZ 30%30%40% Holding Co SubCo 1SubCo 2SubCo 3 Example 2: Group of commonly-owned related companies ShareholdersShareholders XYZXYZ 30%30%40%30%30%40% Co 1Co 2 Less than 100 percent common shareholding Companies that are less than 100 percent commonly owned may be permitted to consolidate in limited circumstances (governed by section 191E and section 191(4). These circumstances are: ï If they have not more than 1 percent variation in common shareholding due to nominal shareholding required to be held under company law; ï If they have not more than 3 percent variation in common shareholding due to shares held by employee share purchase schemes approved under section 166 of the Income Tax Act. Parent/subsidiary or brother/sister groups Unlike consolidation regimes in Germany and the United States, there is no requirement to include the parent company in the regime. This means a consoli- dated group may comprise associated subsidiaries that are wholly owned. One balance date A group of companies cannot consolidate unless they all have one common balance date. This makes sure that the groupís income for any income year relates to the same period, not an amalgam of different periods. Where a group has several tax balance dates, they must decide on one tax balance date. Formation Rules A group of companies that wishes to consolidate must give Inland Revenue written notice of their election to form a consolidated group (Section 191F). That notice must also contain: ï an undertaking by each company to be jointly and severally liable for the groupís income tax liabilities (see ìJoint and Several Liabilityî on page 5); ï nomination of an agent or ìnominated companyî of the group (see ìNominated Companyî on page 5). Commencement Dates Generally, a company will commence being treated as a member of a consolidated group: ï from the start of the income year in which it notifies Inland Revenue, if it gives this notice within 63 days of the start of that income year (section 191F(3)); ï in any other case from the start of the following income year (section 191F(3)). There is special provision for a group of newly-incorpo- rated companies to be treated as a consolidated group from the beginning of the income year of incorporation and formation, provided they notify Inland Revenue within 63 days of the latest of those incorporations (Section 191F(4)). There is also a special provision which allows a group of companies that have become entitled to form a consolidated group during an income year to be treated as a consolidated group from the day of first entitle- ment, provided they notify Inland Revenue within 63 days of the first entitlement (Section 191F(5)). There is an anti-avoidance provision to prevent groups consolidating during an income year instead of at the start of the year, where there is an arrangement to abuse the regime (section 191F(8)). Companies that form a consolidated group during an income year rather than from the start of an income year must furnish a set of part year accounts in the return for that year (see ìPart Year Accountsî on page†6). 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Example 3 Tom Co Ltd and Dick Co Ltd become wholly owned on 30 June 1993. The group has a 31†March balance date. The group elects to be a consolidated group within 63 days of first becom- ing commonly owned. Consolidation commences on 30 June 1993. Part year accounts are required for the period before consolidation. Extension of time for furnishing notices Inland Revenue may accept notification given outside the 63 day period if the Commissioner is satisfied that the notice of election could not reasonably have been furnished earlier (Section 191F(6)). Entering an Existing Group The rules for entering an existing consolidated group are similar to those for forming a consolidated group. A company electing to join an existing consolidated group must give the Commissioner a written election notice which contains an agreement to be jointly and severally liable for the groupís income tax (section 191I(2)). Commencement dates A company that joins an existing consolidated group will generally commence being treated as a member of the group: ï from the start of the income year in which it notifies Inland Revenue, if it gives this notice within 63 days of the start of the income year (Section 191I(3)); ï in any other case, from the start of the following income year. A newly-incorporated company can join an existing group from the beginning of the income year of incorpo- ration provided it notifies Inland Revenue within 63 days of incorporation (section 191I(4)). A newly acquired company can also join an existing consolidated group from the day it becomes entitled to become a member, provided it notifies Inland Revenue within 63 days of entitlement (section 191I(5)). There is an anti-avoidance provision to prevent compa- nies joining a consolidated group part-way through an income year rather than from the start of the year, where there is an arrangement to abuse the regime (Section 191I(8)). Companies that join a consolidated group during an income year must furnish a set of part year accounts in the return for that income year (section 191I(5)). Extension of time for furnishing notices Inland Revenue may accept notification given outside the 63 day period if the Commissioner is satisfied that the notice of election could not reasonably have been furnished earlier. (section 191I(6)). Joint and Several Liability A company forming or joining a consolidated group must give an undertaking to be jointly and severally liable for the groupís income tax including provisional tax, PAYE, RWT, SSCWT, and FBT (sections 191F(2), 191I(2), 191Q and 191R). There are limited provisions for relaxation of the joint and several liability. First, the requirement for joint and several liability may be limited to one or more companies of the group, when the group makes its election. In this case the Commis- sioner must be satisfied that the company/companies bearing liability for the group tax have sufficient assets to meet the groupís tax liability. The reason for this provision is so that groups of companies that have financial arrangements subject to negative pledge clauses can still consolidate (section 191L(3) and (4)). If the companies liable for the group tax default in paying it, the Commissioner may raise separate assess- ments on the companies excluded from joint and several liability for the amount of the group tax liability attrib- utable to them. The excluded companies would thus be liable for their share of the group tax in the event of a default (Section 191L(5)). Second, joint and several liability may be removed from a company that leaves a consolidated group if the Commissioner is satisfied that removing such liability would not significantly prejudice the collection of income tax ( section 191L(2)). Nominated Company The nominated company must be a member of the consolidated group. The group can change which company is the nominated company by sending written notice to Inland Revenue (Section 191H). Where there are changes to the group, the role of the nominated company may be significant. For example, if two members in a consolidated group of four companies become wholly owned by new owners, it is possible for both groups to claim continued consolidated group status. To overcome this potential problem, section 191J(4) ensures the group of which the nominated company is a member continues as the consolidated group. Tax consequences are therefore not triggered for that group. (See ìExit Rulesî below for consequences of a consolidated group not having a nominated company) Member of One Group Only Where a company is a member of more than one consolidated group at any time, it will be treated as a member only of the first consolidated group it joined, as long as it still meets the requirements for being treated as a member of that group (Section 191G). continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) from page 5 Exit Rules A company may leave a consolidated group voluntarily by sending to Inland Revenue a written election to cease to be treated as a member. The company's membership will cease from the beginning of the income year after the year Inland Revenue receives the notice, if so requested in writing. Otherwise, the company will be treated as a non-member from the beginning of the income year in which Inland Revenue receives the notice (section 191J(1) and (2). There are also provisions which deem a company in certain circumstances to have ceased being a member. These circumstances are when: 1. the company ceases to be an ìeligible companyî as defined; 2. the company ceases to be entitled to be a member of the same consolidated group as the nominated company; 3. the consolidated group to which a company belongs ceases to have a nominated company. (However, if the nominated company of the group is wound up and Inland Revenue receives notice within 20 days of the wind-up that another company is to be the new nominated company, the company will not cease to be a member. The Commissioner has discretion to accept a notice after the 20 day period.) In the first two of these situations, the company is treated as a non-member from the beginning of the income year in which the deemed cessation occurs, or from the date of deemed cessation if the company specifically requests this in writing (section 191J(6)). However, Inland Revenue will deny this request where there is a finding of a tax avoidance arrangement (section 191J(7)). In the third situation above, the company is treated as having ceased to be a member from the beginning of the income year in which the deemed cessation occurs if there is no new nominated company within the 20†day period. Where a cessation date occurs part way through an income year, the company leaving the group must furnish part year accounts for that income year (see ìPart Year Accountsî below). A company that ceases to be a member of a consolidated group through being wound up is treated as having ceased to be a member from the date of wind-up. This is not conditional upon adequate accounts being furnished to the Commissioner (section 191J(8)). Part Year Accounts A company that enters or exits an existing consolidated group part way through an income year must furnish part year accounts (Section 191K). These are necessary as the company becomes a different tax entity, and is subject to different tax rules in the income year of entry or exit. The company should include these part year accounts in its tax return for that year, and file it by the usual due date. (For example, if a company with a 31 March balance date joins a consolidated group three months into its income year, it must furnish a set of part year accounts with its return for that income year.) The part year accounts replace the normal full year accounts that would otherwise have been furnished. The company's assessable income is determined (to the extent fair and reasonable and with any necessary modifications) by treating the part year as a complete income year. Where accounts cover six months, they should include only half the normal deductions permit- ted for items such as depreciation or amortisation. As the part year is treated as a complete income year, the income/loss of the separate part year periods are not netted off. This is relevant in determining part year losses and profits for carry forward and offset under sections 188 and 191. Example 4 ABC group is a consolidated group which DCo joins on 30 September 1995. Both ABC group and DCo have 31 March balance dates. On an indi- vidual taxpayer basis, DCo determines its assess- able income to 30 September 1995 and includes it in its own return for the income year ended 31†March 1996. DCo 's pre- and post- consolida- tion results are not offset against each other. If the pre-consolidation result was a loss of $100 and the post-consolidation result attributable to DCo is a profit of $90, DCo is allowed a pre-consolidation loss of $100; it would not be limited to $10. Returns, Assessments and Liability of Consolidated Group Generally, a consolidated group files one tax return, receives one tax assessment and consequently has only one tax liability for any income year. One tax return A consolidated group files one tax return, which includes the income derived by all companies in the group (Section 191L(1)(a)). The group will file that return under an IRD number that is separate from the individual companies' IRD numbers. The member companies will not have to file separate returns unless these are needed because of part year consolidations. The Commissioner can grant an extension of time for filing the consolidated group's tax return under section 17(5), provided the consolidated group is made up of ten or more companies. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) (b)). This treatment of intra-group income and expendi- ture items results in intra-group transactions being treated as transactions between branches of the same company, so that there are no taxation consequences. Under section 191M(1)(a), only income items that would not be assessable income if the group were a single company are not taken into account. This ensures that income arising from transactions with a third party outside the consolidated group, but as part of an intra- group arrangement, remain assessable to the group. Under section 191M(1)(b), only those expenses that would not be deductible if the group were a single company are not taken into account. This ensures that intra-group expenses (including reimbursement between group members for fringe benefits provided) are not deductible. In the case of outlays to a third party (such as fringe benefit tax paid), the expenses are deductible. Example 6 ParentCo engages a third party to provide manage- ment consultant services. ParentCo on-charges the fees to SubCo. SubCo is a land-holding company deriving no income. ParentCo is not allowed a deduction for the management fees paid to the third party. Administration expenses of holding company deductible Section 191M(1)(c) allows deductions for administra- tion and other expenses of a holding company regard- less of whether the holding company itself derives any assessable income. This is because those expenses would be deductible to that consolidated group if treated as if a single company. One qualification is that a nexus must exist between that expenditure item and the assessable income or business activity of any other member of that consolidated group. This prevents deductions to a non-operating group. Expenses not deductible if group is a single company Consistent with the treatment of a consolidated group as a single company, section 191M(1)(d) denies deductions for expenses which would be deductible to the member but not to the group. Interest deductible under section 106(1)(h)(ii) is excepted. This permits deductions for interest on money that one member borrowed from outside the group so another group member could purchase at least 66 percent shareholding of a third group company. The group must demonstrate a clear and direct link between the borrowing and the intra- group loan used to purchase equity in a manner that meets the requirements of section 106(1)(h)(ii). continued on page 8 Consolidated accounts The Commissioner has discretion to determine what information (in addition to the consolidated tax ac- counts) Inland Revenue needs to enforce the consolida- tion regime and the Income Tax Act generally. The Commissioner will specify if individual accounts are required (Section 191L(1)(b)). One tax assessment The group will receive only one income tax assessment, based on the tax return it files. There will not be separate assessments unless they are required by part year consolidations (Section 191L(1)(d)). Availability of tax credits on single com- pany group basis Subject to the usual quarantining rules, total group income is calculated before taking into account avail- able credits (foreign tax credits and controlled foreign company or ìCFCî credits). This means the credits belonging to individual companies that don't have any New Zealand taxable income can be offset against the income of other companies in the group. In this way, the group can use credits that are otherwise non-utilisable (Section 191L(1)(c) and section 191D(2)(b)). On the other hand, where the credits are attributed to individual group members that have taxable income, but the group is in overall tax loss, the credits will be lost. This is because the availability of the credits is deter- mined after calculating total group loss. Example 5 SubCo†1 and SubCo†2 are a members of a consoli- dated group. SubCo†1 has tax credits of $100 from tax it has paid overseas. SubCo†1 has taxable income of $1,000. SubCo 2 makes a loss of $1,800, so on a group basis, there is a net loss of $800. The $100 tax credits are not available for offset to the group. Calculating Group Assessable Income Put simply, the group assessable income is the sum of the member companiesí assessable incomes, with some special rules applying for the following: ï intra-group items of income/expenditure; ï treatment of the consolidated group as a single company; ï the determination of thresholds on a group level. (Section 191L) Assessable/deductible items Assessable/deductible items arising from intra-group transactions are not included in the determination of group income, except for transactions involving the disposition of trading stock (section 191M(1)(a) and 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) from page 7 Example 7 ABC consolidated group purchases land. The land is legally held by subsidiary C as a revenue asset. Parent A uses the land for its head office. Subsidi- ary C is not allowed a deduction for expenses incurred in acquiring the land. Income assessable if group is a single company Section 191M(1)(e) includes in the group income any profit or gain that would not be assessable when derived by a member but which would be assessable if derived by the consolidated group as a single company. This provision is intended to prevent intra-group arrange- ments to transfer assets and re-characterise them to avoid tax. This provision is similar to the provision in section 191(6) aimed at preventing group structuring to avoid tax from certain activities. Capitalisation of group costs of improvements to fixed assets Section 191M(2) permits capitalisation of non-deduct- ible expenditure that a group member incurs in relation to an asset held by another group member. Example 8 In consolidated group ABC, ACo owns a building. BCo makes some capital improvements to the building. The cost of those capital improvements can be added to the costs incurred by the owner, ACo. Threshold levels determined on group basis Where a provision of the Act specifies a threshold, the position of the group is to be determined as if the consolidated group were one entity (Section 191M(1)(f)). Example 9 Consolidated group ABC wants to know under what circumstances it may invoke section 64C(2A) and use the straight line method of calculating income or expenditure. Section 64C(2A) permits a straight line method of calculation if the total value of all financial arrangements held or issued is less than $1 million. Assume each member in ABC group has less than $1 million of financial arrangements but the group as a single company has financial arrangements with a combined value of over $1 million. ABC group may not invoke section 64C(2A) as the group exceeds the minimum threshold value of financial arrangements. Special Provisions on Dispositions of Property A comprehensive set of asset transfer rules applies to intra-group transfers of assets. Generally, no tax is payable on the intra-group transfers of assets other than trading stock. Transferee rule Tax becomes payable in relation to the intra-group transfers when the transferred asset is sold out of the group. Consistent with the treatment of the consolidated group as one entity with separate branches, selling shares of a company in the group that holds the trans- ferred asset constitutes a sale of the asset out of the group (section 191N(6)). This treatment is necessary to prevent consolidation from being abused. Example 10 In FGH Group, FCo shares are sold to a third party. At the time of sale FCo is holding land assessable under section 65(2)(f) which was transferred to it by GCo. The difference between the transferred asset's market value at the time of the share sale and the deemed transfer value is included in the return of income by the group. These are the rules applying to various types of assets: Financial arrangements Generally, section 64F of the accrual rules requires a base price calculation for any transferred asset, in order to allocate income or expenditure from the transferred financial arrangement between the transferrer and the transferee in the year of transfer. An intra-group transfer of a financial arrangement would require a base price adjustment. Section 191N(4) specifies the deemed consideration for the transfer, so that it does not result in any allocation of income or expenditure between the transferrer and transferee for the year of transfer. To qualify, both parties must use the same method of allocating income or expenditure (e.g., yield to maturity basis) and meet certain conditions. These conditions are: ï election of a nil allocation by the nominated company; and ï the transferrer and transferee are members of the same consolidated group for the whole income year of transfer; and ï neither party is entitled to carry forward pre-consoli- dation losses, unless the groupís assessable income is sufficient to absorb all such losses. These conditions are designed to prevent income being allocated so as to give undue tax advantage. Where the group does not meet these conditions but there is no change in the method of calculation, it must make a fair and reasonable allocation for the year of 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) transfer. Where there is a change in the calculation method, the transferrer is deemed to have transferred the financial arrangement at market value. The follow- ing example illustrates the allocation required in all three situations. Note: The Taxation Reform Bill (No.6) 1992 contains a minor amendment to section 191N(3). continued on page 10 Example 11 In XYZ Group, a company (transferor) transfers debenture stock on 1/12/94 to a member of the group (transferee). The base price adjustment required under section 191N(4) is as follows: Debenture stock details Face value$250,000 Coupon rate (payable quarterly)10% Issue date1/3/92 Maturity date1/3/97 Purchase date1/9/93 Purchase cost$235,880 Purchase yield to maturity12% Assessable income to 31/3/94$16,502 Transfer date base price adjustment SameSameDifferent methodmethodmethod (i)(ii) Item a for the base price adjustment formula to equal nil$221,132 Item a for the base price adjustment formula using the purchase constant annual rate of 12%$240,267 Item a for the base price adjustment formula using market value based on a market yield of 9.5%$252,506 Transferor income allocation from 1/4/94 to 1/12/94 SameSameDifferent methodmethodmethod (i)(ii) a = value at transfer date+ $221,132 + $240,267 + $252,506 cash coupons plus (5 x $6,250) + $31,250+ $31,250+ $31,250 + $252,382 + $271,517 + $ 283,756 b = acquisition price- $235,880 - $235,880 - $235,880 c = assessable income to 31/3/94 - $16,502- $16,502- $16,502 Base price adjustment+ $0 + $19,135 + $31,374 Total accrual income 1/9/93 to 1/12/94 Accrual income+ $16,502 + $35,637 + $47,876 Transferee income allocation from 1/12/94 to 1/3/97 SameSameDifferent methodmethodmethod (i)(ii) a = Face value+ $250,000 + $250,000 + $250,000 b = Value at transfer date- $221,132 - $240,267 - $ 252,506 Cash coupons (9 x $6,250) + $56,250+ $56,250+ $56,250 Accrual income allocated using appropriate method+ $85,118+ $65,983+ $53,744 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Trading stock Consolidation replicates the tax treatment provided previously by the proviso to section 85(4). Unlike the tax treatment on intra-group transfers of other assets, intra-group transfers of trading stock are generally not ignored for tax purposes. Instead, such transfers are deemed to occur at the transferrerís tax carry over value, or at cost for new purchases. However, the nominated company may elect to have transfers ignored according to the general asset transfer rules for all or certain lines of trading stock, provided the Commissioner is satisfied that the trading stock in question and its ownership can be specifically traced (Section 191N(5)). Depreciable assets Section 191N(1) provides for depreciation clawbacks or further deductions under the Act, to be determined generally based on the tax book value plus subsequent capitalised costs. Example 12: transfer of depreciable asset Assume a transfer of an ice-cream plant within FGH group. A tax event occurs on the sale of the ice-cream plant out of the group. The details are as follows: Purchase date1/4/94 Purchase cost$10,000 Transfer date31/3/95 Tax book value on transfer date$8,000 Consideration for transfer$8,500 Tax event1/4/96 Market value at tax event date$7,000 Tax book value at tax event date$6,400 Depreciation recovered$600 (The consideration passing between the companies for the transfer is irrelevant. Depreciation is calculated on the tax book value on transfer). Other assets Any other assets such as land and revenue assets are deemed to be transferred intra-group at cost to the transferrer, including expenditure incurred in purchas- ing or improving the assets and legal costs in improving legal rights in relation to that asset (Section 191N(1)). Value of absorbed asset Where an asset is transferred intra-group as part of another asset rather than in its original form, and its market value cannot be determined, there is provision for its market value as at the time prior to absorption to be taken into account (Section 191N(7)). Adjustment on sale of shares on revenue account Where a parent company has consolidated with a subsidiary and the shares in the subsidiary are held on revenue account, any gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary shares would be assessable or deductible under normal income tax rules. Section 191N(8) provides for a necessary adjustment on the sale price to take account of any exempt intra-group transaction. Without the adjustment a deduction for ìlossesî on sale of the shares would be ìincurredî and deductible. Example 13 ParentCo and SubCo are members of a consoli- dated group. ParentCo's shares in SubCo are held on revenue account. The purchase price of the shares was $2.00 a share. While a consolidated member, SubCo transfers most of its assets to ParentCo. This results in a lower share market price of $1.00 per share. ParentCo sells its shares in SubCo to a third party. Section 191N(8) applies to adjust the sale price to $2.00, so no loss is available to the group. Anti-avoidance provision Section 191N(9) is aimed at consolidated groups which consolidate for a brief period solely to obtain the benefit of tax-free asset transfers. In that instance, the transfers will be recognised and included in the groupís income. Stamp Duty on Intra-Group Conveyances Section 13 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 contains new provisions covering the imposition of stamp duty on transfers within a consolidated group. Generally, the stamp duty treatment is similar to the income tax treatment of asset transfers. Stamp duty is not payable on intra-group transactions at the time of transfer, but it may become payable if the asset is transferred out of the group, including by way of sale of the shares of the recipient company holding the asset. Stamp duty will be imposed on the market value of the asset at the time of transfer out of the group, not on its market value at the time of initial transfer within the group. This will minimise compliance costs because it requires assets to be valued only if they eventually leave the group. If the tax were based on the value of trans- ferred assets at the time of initial transfer, consolidated groups would effectively be required to value any asset subject to intra-group transfers at the time of transfer, because of the difficulties they would have in attempting to determine that value at a later time. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Income Tax and Stamp Duty Consequences on Wind-up When the transferee company holding an asset which was transferred intra-group ceases to be a member of the group through being wound up, income tax is not payable (section 191N(6). However, stamp duty becomes payable (Section 13(4) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971). Gift Duty Section 74A of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 has been amended so that no gift duty will be payable on asset transfers within a consolidated group. Unlike the treatment for income tax and stamp duty, gift duty does not become payable at a later date when the asset is transferred out of the group. Another provision prevents gift duty becoming payable on transactions between companies, if these transactions constitute dividends. Loss Carry-Forward and Grouping The loss carry forward provisions in section 188 (general provisions), 188AA (transitional provisions) and 188C (mining losses) apply with modifications to a consolidated group as if it were one tax entity. The grouping provisions in section 191 and 191A are also modified to apply to the group as one tax entity. Any loss the consolidated group incurs is treated as a group loss (section 191O(2)). Any loss that a company incurs before it becomes a member of a consolidated group remains that of the member (section 191O(3)). The member's pre-consoli- dation losses are offset against group assessable income. There are limits to the offset (sections 191O(5) and (6)). These limits are discussed below and in examples 15 and 16. The member's pre-consolidation losses not offset against group assessable income may be either: ï carried forward for offset against future income derived when it leaves the group; or ï offset to a company 66 percent commonly owned with it, including another consolidated group. The consolidated group losses and pre-consolidation losses carried forward are offset on a ì first in - first outî basis. Where these losses are incurred in the same income year, the losses are pro-rated (section 191O(4)). Example 14 Assume SubCo†1, SubCo†2 and ParentCo are the members of a consolidated group. SubCo 1 and SubCo 2 have pre-consolidation losses incurred in the 1993 income year of $100 and $200 respec- tively. The group has assessable income of $200 in the 1994 income year. The losses offset against group income are pro-rated one-third from SubCo 1 and two-thirds from SubCo 2 Limited loss offset where members are not a group at all times Under ordinary loss offset rules a loss may be offset provided the group existed from the year the loss was incurred through to the income year of offset. In a consolidated group of members which was not a 66 percent commonly owned group at all times, section 191O(5) restricts the loss to the aggregate of: ï the amounts that the company incurring the pre- consolidation loss (ìloss companyî) is permitted to carry forward, and ï the amount permitted to be offset against income of those members that formed a 66 percent commonly owned group with the loss company at all relevant times. The incomes of the loss company and the other group members (66 percent commonly owned) in the year of consolidation are calculated in accordance with section 191M on a single company basis. Example 15 ACo has pre-consolidation losses of $1,000 (incurred in the 1991 income year). The consoli- dated group comprises ACo, BCo and CCo. CCo was not 66 percent commonly owned with ACo during the 1991, 1992 and 1993 income years. BCo was 66 percent commonly owned with ACo at all times. In the 1994 income year (first year of consolidation), the consolidated group has assess- able income of $1,200 comprising $300, $300 and $600 derived by ACo, BCo and CCo respectively. The amount of loss that may be deducted is determined as follows: ACoís assessable income in 1994$300 (available for carry forward under s188) BCo's assessable income in 1994$300 (available under s191A) Total deduction against consolidated$600 group income Limited loss offset on part year consolidation Where a company with pre-consolidation losses is a member for only part of the consolidated groupís income year, the amount of loss offset against the consolidated groupís income is also restricted, taking into account any income derived in the part period before consolidation. Section 191O(6) takes into account the possibility that the loss company may have been a member of another consolidated group in the part period before consolidation. Accordingly, the amount of loss offset is restricted under section 191O(6) to the lesser of: A. the amount of pre-consolidation loss to be carried forward against group income, less any assessable continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) income derived by the company or by another consolidated group of which the loss company was a member during the part year period before consoli- dation; B. the part year assessable income of the consolidated group. Example 16 Assume ACo in ABC group left XYZ group to join ABC Group midway through the income year. The incomes derived during the relevant periods are: ACo (loss carried forward)$1000 ACo (income)Nil XYZ Group (income)$400 ABC Group (income)$500 Lesser of $1000 - (0 + 400) = $600 or $500. Only $500 may be carried forward under section 191O(6). Group income deemed company income for purposes of section 188(9) Where pre-consolidation losses are carried forward against future consolidation assessable income, for the purposes of section 188(9) the income the consolidated group derives is treated as if it was derived by the loss company (section 191O(7)). Attributed Foreign Income and Foreign Investment Fund Income of Consolidated Group Members Only New Zealand resident companies are eligible to consolidate. Members of a consolidated group with interests in controlled foreign companies (CFCs) and foreign investment funds (FIFs) must include in the consolidated groupís income any attributed foreign income and FIF income. For this purpose, section 191P generally provides for Part IVA (relating to CFCs and FIFs) to apply as if the consolidated group were one company. Any tax credit becoming available or any attributed foreign loss and FIF loss incurred are treated as becom- ing available to or incurred by the consolidated group (section 191P(2)). A memberís pre-consolidation tax credits, attributed foreign loss and FIF loss remain in the ownership of the member company, but they may be carried forward and offset against the consolidated group income subject to the normal quarantining rules. The order of offset is similar to that applicable in section 191O. Section 191P(3) provides for a memberís pre-consolidation tax credit, attributed foreign loss and FIF loss to be utilised as follows: ï to be offset against the groupís income tax or attrib- uted foreign income or FIF income, subject to the quarantining rules; ï to be credited or deducted or set off against future income tax payable or income derived by the member when it leaves the consolidated group or joins another group; ï to be carried forward by the member company to future income years; ï to be offset against income tax payable by or income of any other company (other than the consolidated group) as permitted under the Act. Like losses under section 191O, the groupís tax credits and attributed losses and FIF losses are offset on a ìfirst in- first out basisî. Where the losses are incurred in the same income year, the losses are pro-rated (section 191P(4)). Example 17 Assume ACo, BCo and CCo are the members of consolidated group ABC. ACo and BCo have pre- consolidation attributed foreign losses of $100 and $200 respectively, carried forward from the 1993 income year in respect of their Hong Kong companies. The consolidated group has attributed foreign income from Hong Kong in the 1994 income year of $200. The losses are pro-rated one- third from ACo and two-thirds from BCo. Limited credit and loss offset where members are not a 66 percent commonly owned group Like losses under section 191O, some restrictions to offsets of credits and losses are necessary where the members of the consolidated group were not members of a 66 percent commonly owned group as required under the Act. Accordingly, section 191P restricts the amount that may be offset to the aggregate of the following amounts: ï the amount of the tax credit or loss permitted to be carried forward by the company to a subsequent year, and ï the amount permitted to be offset against tax payable or income of other member companies that were at all relevant times members of a 66 percent commonly owned group. The income tax payable and the income of the compa- nies in the year of consolidation is determined by applying section 191M of the Act (i.e., on a single company basis). Limited offsets on part year consolidation Where a company is a member of a consolidated group for only part of an income year, the amount of tax from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) credits or losses that may be offset are restricted to take into account the company's income tax payable or income derived in the part period before it joined the group. Accordingly, the amount of offset is restricted under section 191P(6) to the lesser of: A. the amount of pre-consolidation tax credits to be credited against the group's income tax payable (or loss to be deducted against the groupís income), less any income tax payable (or income derived) by the member (or by another consolidated group of which it was a member) during the part period before it joined the group; B. the amount of income tax payable (or income derived) by the consolidated group that can be reasonably and fairly attributed to the part of the income year during which the newly-joined com- pany was a member of the consolidated group. The income tax payable or income derived is calculated by applying the provisions in section 191K in relation to part year accounts. Consolidated Group Members' Provisional Tax A consolidated group's provisional tax payable is determined by applying the provisions in Part XII of the Act as if the consolidated group were a single company. Joint and several liability Companies forming or joining a consolidated group must give an undertaking to be jointly and severally liable for the consolidated groupís income tax. This extends to provisional tax. However, where a group has approval for joint and several liability to be limited under section 191L to one or more of its companies, the provisional tax liability is also so modified (Section 191Q(1)(a)). Calculating provisional tax payable based on fraction of RIT incurred in a preceding income year In the first year of consolidation or in any income year in which there are new members, calculating the group's provisional tax relies on the Residual Income Tax (RIT) that each member incurred in a preceding income year before becoming a consolidated group member. Section 191Q(1)(b) requires the consolidated group to include in its RIT for the preceding year the proportion of the individual company 's income for the preceding year which reflects the proportion of the provisional tax year in which the company was a member of the consoli- dated group. continued on page 14 Example 18 XCo joins XYZ consolidated group on 1 April 1994. The group has a 31 March balance date. XCo was a member for 12 months during the 1995 income year. XYZ group must include 12 months of RIT derived by XCo in the 1994 income year (plus 5 percent uplift) in its provisional tax payments for the 1995 provisional tax year. XCo makes no payment of provisional tax individually. Example 19 YCo joins consolidated XXX Group on 8 July 1995. XXX Group has a 31 March Balance date. YCo and the group made their first instalments of provisional tax separately. When YCo joins the group, XXX Group must recalculate the preceding yearís RIT for its subsequent instalments of provisional tax. YCoës provisional tax liability for part of the year is squared up at year end and it doesn't have to pay any further provisional tax. Calculating provisional tax for company leaving a consolidated group Where a company was a member of a consolidated group for all or part of a year and ceases to be a member for all or part of a succeeding year, it must estimate its provisional tax, with associated penalties for under- estimation. The consolidated group may estimate down its provisional tax payment (Section 191Q(2)). Withholding Tax Obligations of Consolidated Group Members Joint and several liability for the consolidated groupís income tax extends to resident withholding tax (RWT), fringe benefit tax (FBT), specified superannuation contributions withholding tax (SSCWT) and tax deductions under Part XI, including PAYE deductions (Section 191R). However, the members are individually responsible for complying with their respective obliga- tions, such as filing individual returns.. Imputation Credits The consolidated group must maintain its own separate imputation credit account (ICA) covering the groupís activities (section 191S(1)). The opening balance of a newly formed Group ICA is nil. An existing consoli- dated groupís opening balance is equal to the closing balance of the preceding imputation year (section 191S(2)). The ICA of each member in the group is maintained separately from the group ICA, in accordance with Part XIIA of the Act. The individual ICAs will generally record the balance to the date of consolidation. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) further income tax that a consolidated group member pays may be credited against the group's income tax payable. To the extent that it is so credited, the credit is not available under section 394L(5) to the individual member (section 191SC(8)). Application of specific imputation provi- sions to consolidated groups Section 191SD(1)(a) provides for a consolidated group that maintains a policyholder credit account (ìPCAî) to be able to make transfers of the credit balance in the group ICA to the group PCA. This provision is the equivalent of section 394FA(1). Where the consolidated group has a non-standard balance date, section 191SD(1)(b) provides for section 394FA(3) and (4) to apply with any necessary modifica- tions to the consolidated group as if it were the company referred to in those subsections. This means that certain deemed transfers from the group ICA to the group PCA will occur on the last day of the imputation year. Section 191SD(2) provides for section 394G to apply to a consolidated group as if it were a single company, and for intra-group dividends not to be taken into account for purposes of section 394G(2) to (4). This means that the imputation ratio and benchmark dividend rules apply to all dividends except intra-group dividends paid by each member in the group. The attachment of imputation credits to intra-group dividends will be optional. Section 191SD(3) imposes on a consolidated group's nominated company the responsibility for ensuring that the group complies with sections 394J (the requirement to furnish annual imputation returns) and 394K (the requirement to furnish an imputation return as re- quested by the Commissioner or as otherwise required under that section). The provisions in section 191SD(4) and (5) generally provide for sections 394L, 394N, 394O, 394P and 394M relating to further tax payable and imputation penalty tax to apply to the group as if it were a single company and for references to a company to apply as references to a consolidated group. Section 191SD(6) provides for section 394ZF(2) to apply where dividends are deemed under section 394ZF(1) to be paid by a member of the group. Section 191SD(7) provides for section 394ZG and 394ZH to apply to the consolidated group as if it were a single company and for the references to provisions of the Act to be references to the equivalent consolidation provisions. Dividend withholding payments An equivalent provision to section 394ZM(2) applies to a consolidated group whose member is paid a foreign withholding payment dividend. The amount of the dividend withholding payment (DWP) to be deducted Credits and debits arising to group's ICA Sections 191SA and 191SB generally replicate the provisions in sections 394D and 394E, but by treating the consolidated group as if it were a single company. Debiting and crediting between consoli- dated group and individual companies Post-consolidation credits and debits arising to the group ICA do not arise to the individual ICAs (section 191SC(1)). Section 191SC(2) provides the mechanism for transfer- ring credits from the individual ICAs to the group ICA. A transfer is made when a debit arises to the group ICA and that debit is not offset by any group credit that arose earlier or on the same date as the credit in the indi- vidual ICA. The ordering procedure in section 394E(4) applies to the group credits. When a credit transfer occurs, a corresponding debit arises under section 394E to the individual ICA (section 191SC(3)). The ordering procedure in section 394E(4) also applies to the individual credits in the individual ICAs that are transferred under section 191SC(2). The ìfirst in - first outî rule applies. If two or more credits arose at the same time, the consolidated group may elect which credit to offset. Where no election is made, the credits are offset on a pro-rata basis (section 191SC(4)). Example 20 ACo and BCo are members of ABC Group. Both companies have pre-consolidation credit balances and, in particular, credits of $100 and $200 which arose at the same time (5/7/92). On 10/10/95 a debit of $100 arises to the group ICA which is not offset by any group credit. Assume no election is made. The credits from ACo and BCo are offset proportionately, that is, one-third from ACo and two-thirds from BCo . If a debit were to arise to the individual ICA account and cause or increase a debit balance, section 191SC(5) provides for that debit not to arise to the companyís ICA but to be debited to the Group ICA. In this way the individual member does not have to pay further income tax. Section 191SC(6) provides for a debit arising from a refundable excess under the export market development provisions to be treated as a refundable excess to the consolidated group. This is achieved by debiting the group ICA with an amount equal to the amount of refundable excess calculated under section 394L(4A). A corresponding credit arises to the individual ICA to reflect the transfer (section 191SC(7)). Section 191SC(8) provides for the equivalent of the provision in section 394L(5), so that the amount of from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) can be reduced by the amount of the credit balance in the groupís branch equivalent tax account (BETA) pursuant to the election of the nominated company of the group under section 191VC(2) - (section 191T(1)). Joint and several liability for the consolidated groupís income tax extends to DWP (section 191T(2)). Section 191T(3) provides in a separate provision from section 394ZN(2), so the group can elect to have its losses which are available for carry forward and offset under sections 188 and 191N reduced in satisfaction of a DWP liability. Section 191T(4) provides that when a company becomes entitled to a refund of DWP the amount of the refund available will be determined by the credit balance in the groupís DWP or ICA at the end of the most recent imputation year. The credit balance is reduced by any earlier refund paid during the imputation year to the company or any other group member (section 191T(5)). These provisions are equivalent to section 394ZO(2) and (3). Section 191T(6) provides that where a company that is a member of a group has paid DWP during an income year, it is entitled to a refund if the group incurred a loss in that year. The section sets a limit on the amount able to be refunded that mirrors the restrictions in section 394ZO(4). Where a company makes a payment of DWP when it is not a member of a group, and is subsequently entitled to a refund after it has joined a group, section 191T(4) in effect governs the limit on refund (section 191T(7)). Subsection (8) provides that the Commissioner can disallow a shareholderís claim for a tax credit arising from a DWP credit attached to a dividend received if there has been no DWP paid to support that credit by any member of the consolidated group. This is a modifi- cation to section 394ZP(4). Dividend Withholding Payment Accounts A consolidated group must maintain a group DWP account if any member of the group maintains a DWP account. The groupís account is maintained separately from the individual DWP account (section 191U(1)(a)). The group may also elect at any time to maintain a group DWP account. The nominated company must notify the Commissioner of the election to maintain a group DWP within 21 days of the date of election (section 191U(1)(b) and (2)). The opening balance of the group DWP will be nil in the first year, and after that equal to the closing balance of the preceding imputation year (section 191U(3)). A Group that has voluntarily maintained a group DWP account may elect to cease maintaining it subject to the conditions set out in section 191U(4) and (5). Credits and debits arising to group DWP account Sections 191UA and 191UB generally replicate the provisions in sections 394ZV and 394ZW, but by treating the consolidated group as if it were a single company. Debiting and crediting between group and individual DWP accounts Post-consolidation credits and debits arising to the group DWP account do not arise to any individual DWP accounts. (section 191UC(1)). Section 191UC(2) provides the mechanism for transfer- ring credits from any individual DWP accounts to the group DWP account. A transfer is made when a debit arises to the group DWP and that debit is not offset by any group credit that arose earlier or on the same date as the credit in the individual DWP. The ordering procedure in section 394ZW(4)(c) applies to the group credits. When a credit transfer occurs, a corresponding debit arises under section 394ZW to the individual DWP account (section 191UC(3)). The ordering procedure under section 394ZW(4)(c) also applies to credits in two or more individual DWP accounts that are transferred under section 191UC(2). The ìfirst in - first outî rule applies. If two or more credits arose at the same time, the consolidated group may elect which credit to offset. Where no election is made, the credits are offset on a pro-rata basis (section 191UC(4)). If a debit were to arise to a company's DWP that would cause or increase a debit balance, section 191UC(5) provides for the debit not to arise in the companyís DWP account but to be debited to the group DWP account. In this way the individual company does not have to pay further DWP. Section 191UC(6) provides for the equivalent of the provision in section 394ZZF(5), so that the amount of further DWP a group member pays may be credited against DWP payable by any member of the group at a later date. To the extent that it is so credited, the credit is not available under section 394ZZF(5) to the indi- vidual member. This provision is targeted at companies which maintain a DWP account before consolidation. Application of specific DWP provisions to consolidated groups Section 191UD(1) provides for a company that is a member of a group that operates a DWP account to attach DWP credits to a dividend that it pays. The amount attached is debited to the group DWP account. Section 191UD(2) provides for a consolidated group that maintains a Policyholder Credit Account (PCA) to be able to make transfers of the credit balance in a group DWP to the group PCA. This provision is the equivalent of section 394ZXA(1). continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Where the consolidated group has a non-standard balance date, section 191UD(2)(b) provides for sections 394ZXA(3) and (4) to apply with any necessary modifi- cations to the consolidated group as if it were the company referred to in those subsections. Section 191UD(3) provides for section 394ZY(1) to (4) to apply to a consolidated group as if it were a single company, and for intra-group dividends not to be taken into account for purposes of subsections (2) to (4). This means the DWP benchmark provisions apply to all dividends except intra-group dividends paid by each member in the group. The attachment of DWP credits to intra-group dividends will be optional. Section 191UD(4) provides for sections 394ZY(4A), (4B) and (4C) (relating to the calculations of the allocation deficit debit, the DWP payment credit transfer fraction and the imputation credit transfer fraction) to apply to a consolidated group that maintains a PCA as if references to a company and provisions of the Act were references to a consolidated group, and to equivalent consolidation provisions respectively. Dividends paid intra-group are not taken into account for purposes of these provisions. The obligations to provide information under sections 394ZZA and 394ZZB fall on the company in the consolidated group that pays a dividend with a DWP credit attached, as section 191UD(5) provides for these provisions to apply as if references to a DWP account company were references to a company in a group that maintains a DWP account. The nominated company is responsible for furnishing the annual DWP account return under sections 394ZZC and 394ZZD. Section 191UD(6) requires these provi- sions to apply as if the consolidated group were a single company and each reference to a provision of the Act were a reference to the equivalent consolidation provi- sion. If it makes an election in accordance with section 394ZZE(2), a group may transfer any year end credit balances in its DWP account to the groupís ICA (section 191UD(7)). The provisions relating to further DWP payable and DWP penalty tax in sections 394ZZF, 394ZZG, 394ZZH, and 394ZZI, and to the power of determina- tion in section 394ZZJ, are to apply as if the consoli- dated group were a single company. The members of a group are jointly and severally liable for any further DWP, or DWP penalty tax or additional tax that becomes payable by the group. Branch Equivalent Tax Accounts A consolidated group must maintain a group branch equivalent tax account (BETA) if any member of the group maintains a BETA. The groupís account is to be maintained separately from the individual BETA (section 191V(1)). The group may also elect at any time to maintain a group BETA. The nominated company must notify the Commissioner of the election to maintain a group BETA within 21 days of the date of election (section 191V(2)). A group that voluntarily maintains a group BETA may elect to cease maintaining a group BETA subject to certain conditions applying in section 191V(3) and (4). Debits and credits arising to group BETA The opening balance of the group BETA will be nil in the first year of operation, and thereafter equal to the closing balance of a preceding imputation year. The credits that may arise in the group BETA are: (a) credits for tax paid on attributed foreign income that the consolidated group derives in any year. This amount is calculated using the formula in section 191VA(2)(a); (b) credits for the amount of ìtax paidî through the reduction of a company or group loss of an amount calculated using the formula in section 191VA(2)(b); (c) credits transferred from individual BETAs under section 191VB(2). The credits in (a) and (b) above arise on the date the consolidated group's tax return is filed. The credits in (c) above arise on the date immediately before the relevant debit arose in the individual companyís BETA (section 191VA(3)). Section 191UA(4) and (5) provide for these debits to arise in the Group BETA: (a) The amount of credits in the BETA used to reduce a DWP liability (The debit arises on the due date for paying the DWP.); (b) The amount of BETA credit balance elected to be transferred to the Group ICA (The debit arises on the date the Group elects to credit the Group ICA.); (c) The amount of any refund of income tax paid on attributed foreign income derived by the consoli- dated group (The debit arises on the date the refund is paid.); (d) The amount of debit that would arise under section 394ZZP(3) on a breach in shareholder continuity of the consolidated group (The debit arises at the specified time the debit arises under section 394ZZP(3).); (e) The amount of the credit balance in the BETA where the Group ceases to maintain a Group BETA (The debit arises immediately before the Group ceases to maintain a BETA.); (f) the debit arising under section 191VB(5): this is a debit that would have arisen to the individual companyís ICA had there been sufficient credits in that ICA. (The debit arises at the time first referred to in that section.) from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Section 191VA(6) provides an ordering rule for the reduction of the credit balance in the BETA under section 191VA(4)(a). Debiting and crediting between group and individual BETAs Post-consolidation credits and debits arising to the group BETA do not arise to the individual BETA accounts, if any (section 191VB(1)). Section 191VB(2) provides the mechanism for transfer- ring credits from the individual BETAs, if any, to the group BETA. A transfer is made when a debit arises to the group BETA and that debit is not offset by any group credit that arose earlier or on the same date as the credit in the individual BETA. The ordering procedure in section 394ZZP(6)(c) applies to the group credits. When a credit transfer occurs, a corresponding debit arises under section 394ZZP to the individual BETA (section 191VB(3)). The ordering procedure in section 394ZZP(6)(c) also applies to credits in two or more individual BETAs that are transferred under section 191VB(2). The ìfirst in - first outî rule applies. If two or more credits arose at the same time, the consolidated group may elect which credit to offset. Where no election is made, the credits are offset on a pro-rata basis (section 191VB(4)). If a debit would arise to the BETA of a company that would result in a debit balance, section 191VB(5) provides for the debit not to arise in the companyís BETA but to be debited to the group BETA. Application of BETA provisions to con- solidated groups Section 191VC(1) provides for a consolidated group that maintains a group BETA to elect in accordance with section 394ZZQ(2) to make transfers of the credit balance in the group BETA to the groupís ICA. The group's nominated company may also elect in accordance with section 394ZZQ(4) to use the credit balance in the group BETA for the purpose of reducing the DWP liability of any group member (section 191VC(2)). Section 191VC(3) provides for section 394ZZR, relating to determinations by the Commissioner as to BETA credits and debits, to apply to the group BETA as if the consolidated group were a single company. A group BETA, like a company BETA, will never have a debit balance. A refund of income tax paid on attrib- uted foreign income and due to the group will be retained by the Commissioner where it would result in a debit balance in the BETA (section 191VC(4). Where a company pays tax on attributed foreign income then joins a group, a refund can be obtained if the group BETA has sufficient credits (section 191VC(4)). Policyholder Credit Accounts A consolidated group must maintain a group policy- holder account (PCA) if any member of the group is carrying on a business of providing life insurance to which sections 204 to 205F of the Act apply. The groupís account is maintained separately from the individual PCA account (section 191W). Credits and debits arising to group PCA The opening balance of a newly formed consolidated groupís PCA is nil. An existing groupís opening balance is equal to the closing balance of the preceding imputation year (section 191WA(1)). Sections 191WA(2) and (3) provide for the following to arise as credits in the groupís PCA : (a) The amount of the credit balance in the group ICA that the group elected in accordance with section 191SD(1)(a) to be transferred to the group PCA (The credit item arises on the date the amount of the credit arises as a debit to the groupís ICA.); (b) The amount of the credit balance in the group DWP that the group elected in accordance with section 191UD(2) to be transferred to the group PCA (The credit item arises on the date the amount of the credit arises as a debit to the groupís DWP ac- count.); (c) The amount of any credit arising to the group PCA under section 191WB(1) (The credit item arises at the time first referred to in section 191WB(1).) Section 191WA(4) and (5) provide for the following to arise as debits in the group PCA: (a) The amount of any credit balance in the group PCA elected by the group to be used as a credit against income tax payable on policyholder income the group derives (The debit item arises on the last day of the relevant income year.); (b) The amount of any credit balance in the group PCA that the group elects to transfer to the group ICA (The debit item arises on the date the election is made.) Debiting and crediting between group and individual PCAs Section 191WB(1) provides the mechanism for transfer- ring credits from the individual PCAs to the group PCA. A transfer is made when a debit arises to the group PCA and that debit is not offset by any group credit that arose earlier or on the same date as the credit in the individual PCA. The ordering procedure in section 394E(4)(c) applies to the group credits. When a credit transfer occurs, a corresponding debit arises under section 394ZZZB to the individual PCA (section 191WB(2)). The ordering procedure in section 394E(4)(c) also applies to credits in two or more individual PCAs that continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) are transferred under section 191WB(1). The ìfirst in - first outî rule applies. If two or more credits arose at the same time, the consolidated group may elect which credit to offset. Where no election is made, the credits are offset on a pro-rata basis (section 191WB(3)). Application of PCA provisions to con- solidated groups Section 191WC(1) provides for a consolidated group to elect to credit any credit balance in the group PCA in payment of income tax payable on policyholder income the group derives. The election is made by recording the from page 17 amount of the credit as a debit to the groupís PCA (section 191WC(2)). The group may also elect in accordance with section 394ZZZC(4) to transfer the credit balance in the group PCA to the group ICA (section 191WC(3). Section 191WC(4) provides for sections 394ZZZC(5) and (6) and 394ZZZD (relating to elections to use credit balance to reduce income tax and determinations by the Commissioner on PCA debits and credits) to apply as if references to a PCA company and the PCA provisions were references to a consolidated group and to equiva- lent consolidation provisions. Group Transfers of Trading Stock The proviso to section 85(4) which permitted trading stock to be transferred within a group without tax consequence is repealed. The repeal is consistent with a recommendation in the Valabh Committee's interim report, Tax Accounting Issues, released in February 1991. The Government has decided to restrict the tax treatment previously allowed under that proviso to certain wholly-owned groups and to consolidated groups. From 1 April 1993 the tax-free transfer of trading stock is limited to 100 percent commonly owned groups that meet certain conditions. These conditions are that the transferrer and transferee companies : ï are resident in New Zealand; and ï share a common tax balance date. The Commissioner may waive the requirement for a common tax balance date, where he determines that the difference in balance dates is necessary to avoid a material distortion of either company's income by causing income and expense for a single business cycle to be reported in different income years. The Commis- sioner will only use this discretion if either of the companies apply for it. Example Company A and Company B are 100 percent commonly owned. Company A has a 30†June balance date, Company B has a 31†March balance date. Company A may transfer trading stock tax- free to Company B if either company can satisfy the Commissioner that it would cause a material distortion in either company to have a common balance date. Deferred tax on the trading stock transferred intra- group becomes payable when the asset is sold out of the group. To prevent the provision being abused, the sale of shares of the transferee company holding the trading stock constitutes a sale out of the group. Example Company A transfers trading stock to Company B. Some shares in Company A change hands so that Company A is no longer 100 percent commonly- owned with Company B. Gains or losses on the transferred trading stock become assessable/ deductible as there is a deemed disposal and reacquisition at market value, by the original transferrer of that asset. For companies with standard or late balance dates, the repeal applies from the first day of the companyís 1993- 94 income year. For companies with early balance dates, it is effective from the first day of the 1994-95 income year. The effective dates coincide with the earliest possible dates a company may commence being treated as a member of a consolidated group. Companies included in a Group of Companies The provisions in sections 191(1) and 191(3)(b) are amended to clarify that a ìgroup of companiesî is one in which a group of persons hold 66 percent commonly in each company. For loss offsets, the group must exist at all relevant times. This does not mean that the same group of persons must hold 66 percent in each company at all times. The amendments clarify that the composi- tion of that group of persons may change, provided there is at all relevant times a group of persons holding 66 percent in common in each company. The amend- ment takes effect from the 1992-93 income year. Groups of Companies Sections 85(4), 191(1), 191(3)(b), 191(4) and 191(7), Income Tax Act 1976 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Definition of Wholly Owned Group of Companies The definition of a ìwholly owned group of companiesî in section 191(4) is amended. It now refers to a group of companies that is 100 percent commonly owned. Small variations in common shareholding due to company law requirements and holdings of employee share purchase schemes approved under section 166 (up to 3 percent) are permitted. The definition applies for purposes of the new provisions on the inter-corpo- rate dividend exemption under section 63(2K) and consolidation under sections 191BC-191WC. It also applies for purposes of existing provisions including sections 108A on additional depreciation and 86H on bloodstock valuation. The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year. Joint Assessments Provision repealed Section 191(7), which provided for joint assessments of groups of companies, is repealed. The Government has decided to replace joint assessments with single assess- ments on consolidated groups. For companies with standard or late balance dates, the repeal becomes effective from the first day of the 1993-94 income year. For companies with early balance dates, it takes effect from the first day of the 1994-95 income year. The effective dates coincide with the earliest possible dates those companies may commence being treated as members of a consolidated group. continued on page 20 Treatment of Section 192 and 195 Debentures There are two minor amendments to section 4 of the Act. Section 192 and 195 debentures are now included in the definition of ìshareî, so interest paid on them is a distribution to a shareholder under section 4(1)((a). Paragraph (h) of section 4(1) is therefore redundant and has been removed. It is also now clear that the amount for which a section 192 or 195 debenture is issued can be returned to the debenture-holder tax-free under section 4A(1)(c). The amendments apply from the date such debentures were included in the definition of ìshareî - generally 31†July 1991. Grandfathering of dividends on fixed rate shares issued before 31 July 1991 The provision relating to grandfathering of dividends paid on pre-1991 Budget redeemable preference shares (section 63(2E)(h)) has been amended. Dividends are tax-free where they are payable at a rate which is a specific fixed percentage of the amount subscribed, or is a percentage of the amount subscribed determined by a fixed relationship to a commercial interest rate. Para- graph (h) has been expanded to include dividends that are determined by a combination of those two factors. The amendment is backdated to 1 April 1992. Exemption for dividends paid within wholly owned groups Section 63(2K) has been inserted into the Act so that dividends paid between members of a 100% commonly owned group are exempt from tax if the recipient and the payer of the dividend have the same balance date. However, where they have different balance dates, in certain circumstances the dividend may be tax-free. This will apply where the Commissioner determines, on the application of either the recipient or the payer, that the difference in balance dates is necessary to avoid a material distortion of either company's income by causing income and expense for a single business cycle to be reported in different income years. For example, where a company with a June balance date wishes to pay a dividend to its parent with a March balance date, the Commissioner would have to be satisfied that it would cause a material distortion in the June balance date company to move to a March balance date, and it would also be distortionary for the March balance date company to take a June balance date. Once the Commissioner has determined that the different balance dates of payer and recipient are necessary, dividends passing between those companies will be exempt. However, section 63(2L) gives the Commissioner power to revoke a determination he has made if he considers that the different balance dates are no longer necessary or if they are part of a tax avoidance arrangement. Certain dividends are excluded from the exemption (section 63(2K)(e)). This retains the previous position in that the general intercorporate dividend exemption in place before 1†April 1992, and the interim regime effective until 1†April 1993, did not apply to these dividends. The amendment applies from 1 April 1993. Miscellaneous Dividend Amendments Sections 4,63,313 and 327ZA, Income Tax Act 1976 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) from page 19 Non-resident withholding tax This section corrects a minor defect in the formula for calculating non-resident withholding tax on taxable bonus issues (section 313). The amendment is back- dated to 1 April 1992. Resident withholding tax Section 327ZA(b) has been amended so that it applies to all dividends and not just specified dividends. The effect is that a credit may arise to a company's imputation credit account under section 394D(1)(k) for the amount of resident withholding tax that has been deducted from a dividend the company derived. The amendment applies from 1 April 1992, when dividends paid to companies became subject to resident withholding tax. There are several amendments to the qualifying com- pany provisions. They all apply from the commence- ment of the regime. Shareholder’s effective interest in Qualifying Company This section makes a minor amendment to section 393A(2)(a), which provides that a shareholderís voting and market value interest in a qualifying company is determined under sections 8A to 8E. Section 8E relates only to measurement of an interest for the purposes of the loss and credit continuity provisions. The reference to that section has been removed, since it is irrelevant for the purposes of the qualifying company regime. Revocation of Qualifying Company election Section 393E(2) has been amended to clarify that a shareholder election is deemed to be revoked upon the sale of all of a shareholderís shares to a new share- holder. Where a shareholder disposes of only some shares in the qualifying company, his/her shareholder election is still valid. Qualifying Company elections This provision amends section 393F(3) to extend the 63 day period of grace for making shareholder elections to two situations: ï where a shareholder becomes sui juris; ï where a shareholder has purchased shares from a vendor who retains a shareholding in the company. (This is necessary because the vendorís election is not revoked and therefore section 393F(2)(b) does not apply.) Shareholder’s liability for Qualifying Company 's tax Section 393H has been amended to clarify that a qual- ifying company is primarily responsible for its own tax. Deduction of Interest paid on Money borrowed to buy shares in Qualifying Company Section 393I(3) has been replaced with subsections (3) and (3A). Subsection (3) clarifies that a shareholder in a qualify- ing company may not deduct interest paid on money borrowed to acquire shares in the company to the extent of non-cash dividends s/he received in a year. Subsection (3A) provides that, for the purpose of determining whether a deduction for interest is available where a shareholder has borrowed to invest in a qualify- ing company, distributions from the company are not exempt and are deemed not to be dividends. This means that the rules for determining deductibility match those applying to a partner investing in a part- nership. Before this amendment, some apportionment may have been required where shareholders received exempt dividends arising from items such as a capital gain derived and distributed by a qualifying company. Taxation of Qualifying Companies Section 393J(a)(i) is amended to remove some circular- ity caused by the reference to section 394ZL. Qualifying Company Election Tax The formulae for calculating standard qualifying company election tax (QCET) and QCET for the 1992- 93 income year have been amended. The previous formulae incorrectly calculated the amount of QCET in two ways: ï The first part of the formula should have calculated the gross dividends distributed. The credits (item c) are therefore added to item a of the formula. ï The credits in the imputation and dividend withhold- ing payment accounts took no account of tax paid after the end of, but in relation to, the 1991-92 income year. In addition, where a refund was owing but not yet paid, the balance overstated the credit in the account. Qualifying Company Regime Amendments Part XIIAA, Income Tax Act 1976 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) The amendments remedy these problems. An amendment is also made to item e of the formula for QCET calculated at the concessional rate. Item e in effect calculates the net dividends received and retained by a company between 30 November 1990 and the date of entry to the qualifying company regime. Tax is paid on such dividends at the company rate. Because there was often no reason to calculate or keep a record of non-cash dividends that a company received before the removal of the intercorporate dividend exemption, it is now sometimes difficult or impossible to accurately state the amount of non-cash dividends it received. Non-cash dividends have therefore been omitted from the calculation. However, this enables companies associated with a company entering the regime in the 1992-93 income year to pay non-cash dividends to that company in order to take advantage of the concessional rate. A new subsection (4) has therefore been included in section 393T. It provides that, in effect, non-cash dividends are included if that would significantly increase the amount of QCET payable. Finally, the formula for calculating concessional QCET has been amended so that item e does not include dividends derived from a company that becomes a qualifying company for the 1992-93 income year. Item e was inserted in the formula to prevent a company paying dividends to a related company that becomes a qualifying company for the 1992-93 income year for the purpose of having such dividend income taxed at the concessional rate. Where the payer itself becomes a qualifying company for the 1992-93 income year, there is no benefit to be gained by passing dividends to a related company in this way. Such dividends should therefore not be included in item e. Due date for paying QCET, and use of money interest New section 393U of the Act sets out the due date for paying QCET for companies entering the regime in the 1992-93 income year. The tax is due on the terminal tax date for the 1992-93 income year. (For other income years, QCET is due on the terminal tax due date for the year before the year in which the company becomes a qualifying company.) However, companies will have to pay use of money interest on their QCET if it isn't paid by the third provisional tax instalment date for the 1992-93 income year. For standard balance date companies, this is 7†March 1993. The amount of interest payable is calculated under the formula in section 393U(2). The formula calculates a daily rate payable for each day on which the tax is unpaid from the day after the third provisional tax date to the terminal tax date for the 1992-93 income year. The applicable rate is the general use of money interest rate (currently 6%). The interest is payable on the terminal tax date for the 1992-93 income year. Example Company A, with a standard balance date, be- comes a qualifying company for the 1992-93 income year. It pays QCET of $1,000 on its terminal tax date for the 1992-93 income year - 7†February 1994. The amount of interest also payable on 7†February 1994 is: $1,000 x 6% x 336 = $55.23 365 The tax is outstanding for 336 days (8/3/93 - 6/2/94 inclusive). New subsections (6) and (7) have been inserted into section 393L to extend those provisions to the use of money interest imposed by new section 393U. As a result, no deduction is allowed for such use of money interest (section 106(1)(f)). Subsection (7) applies the Act to the interest as if the interest were income tax. Information to be given to shareholder Section 393M(5) of the Act has been amended to provide that where a shareholder asks a qualifying company for a statement of the amount of non-cash dividends s/he received in a year, the company must include this information in the shareholder dividend statement. Shareholders who have borrowed to invest in a qualify- ing company may not deduct interest on that borrowing to the extent of any non-cash dividends received during an income year. They therefore need to know the amount of non-cash dividends they have received during the year. Loss Attribution Elections Section 393O has been amended to provide in effect that minority shareholders can no longer revoke loss attribu- tion elections. Taxpayers considering entering the loss attribution regime have expressed concern about the effect of a revocation of a loss attribution election and the power this gives to disgruntled minority sharehold- ers. Loss attribution elections can only be revoked by resolution of the board of directors, or by sui juris shareholders with 50% or more of the shareholding of continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) the company. Where the sui juris shareholders hold less than 50%, all sui juris shareholders can revoke the election. from page 21 Petroleum Mining Regime Amended Sections 214D - N, Income Tax Act 1976 Section 393O(2) has been amended so that the death of a director of a qualifying company no longer causes revocation of a loss attribution election. Imputation Sections 394E, 394ZW, 394ZZP, Income Tax Act 1976 A minor defect in the new credit continuity provisions has been corrected. Under legislation in place before 1†April 1992, credits to the imputation, dividend withholding payment and branch equivalent tax accounts arising on or before 16†December 1988 were not subject to the imputation credit continuity rules. The new rules provided that in effect the continuity provisions did not apply to credits arising before that date. This amendment restores the previous position. Foreign Dividend Withholding Payments Where a company in loss, or anticipating a current year loss, receives a foreign dividend, the loss may be reduced in satisfaction of a foreign dividend withhold- ing payment (FDWP) liability. Section 394ZN now also provides that where the recipient of a dividend is in profit but is in a group with a company in (or anticipating a) loss, that companyís loss may be reduced in satisfaction of a FDWP liability. The provision will only apply if that companyís loss may be offset against the first companyís profit. Subsection (3), which gives the Commissioner power to disallow the election where the loss company does not in fact incur a sufficient loss, has been extended to apply in the above circumstances. The Commissioner is also empowered to disallow the election in part where the companies are in the same group for part only of an income year. The amendment is backdated to 1 April 1992. Introduction Major amendments have been made to the petroleum mining regime. From 16†December 1991 petroleum exploration expenditure, development expenditure and farm-out arrangements will be taxed in a new manner. There are also new anti-avoidance provisions. Background On 16 December 1991 the Government announced its intention to introduce new tax legislation affecting the petroleum mining sector. The new legislation was intended ìto achieve broad international comparability of tax treatment of petroleum exploration and develop- ment expenditure, both onshore and offshore.î The measures contained in the new legislation were to be effective from that date. Key Issues Exploration Expenditures The term exploration expenditures has been defined as exploratory well expenditures, prospecting expenditures and expenditures incurred in acquiring a prospecting licence, prospecting permit or an exploration permit. The term does not include any residual expenditure (section 214D). Exploration expenditures are now deductible in the year incurred (section 214F(2)(a)). Development Expenditure Development expenditures have been defined as those incurred for the purpose of planning, constructing, or acquiring petroleum mining assets (petroleum mining assets include petroleum permits or permit specific assets). Permit specific assets which are necessary for carrying on development operations have an estimated useful life which is dependent on the remaining life of the permit. Development expenditures exclude explora- tion and residual expenditures (section 214D). Development expenditures are now capitalised and deductible over seven years. Deductions begin in the first year of commercial production for onshore projects and from the year incurred for offshore developments (section 214F(2)(b)). Farm-out arrangements A farm-out arrangement is defined as one where a farm- in party agrees with a petroleum miner (farm-out party) 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) to incur expenditure for work in a permit area either by undertaking or paying for that work. In return for incurring this expenditure the farm-in party acquires a right or option to any future revenue from petroleum that arises from that permit or subsequent permit (section 214D). The expenditure incurred as part of a farm-out is no longer assessable income in the hands of the farm-out party. Expenditure incurred on the part of the farm-in party is either exploration or development expenditure, depending on whether an exploration permit or a development permit is involved (section 214I(1) section 214I(2)). Other Issues Definition of Offshore Development Offshore developments are defined as those in which the major part of the facilities required for the extraction, production, treatment, processing, and separation of petroleum are required to be situated in a marine environment below the high tide mark (section 214D). Access to deferred deductions when related parties disassociate Previously, when a petroleum miner sold a petroleum mining asset to an associated party the miner was only entitled to any deferred deductions up to the level of assessable income received. The legislation has been amended to allow a miner access to any remaining deferred deductions should the miner and buyer become disassociated. However, the Commissioner has the power to determine whether the disassociation was undertaken for the purpose of accessing those deductions, in which case he will continue to treat the two as associated parties for tax purposes (section 214F(7)). Exploration expenditure deemed to be development Where a party buys or farms in to an exploration permit, the expenditure will be deemed development expendi- ture if, at that time, there is either: ï an application for a mining permit for the area (or part of the area) enclosed by the exploration permit; or ï petroleum is being produced in commercial quantities on a continuing basis (section 214F(8)). Clawback Provision A clawback provision has been introduced. Where an exploration well is drilled and expenditure is deducted and then the well is later used for the commercial production of petroleum, that previously deducted expenditure can now be clawed back, without interest, and treated as development expenditure. The burden of the clawback will fall on the current owners of the permit, at the time of the clawback, in proportion to their equity in the permit (section 214F(9)). Transitional Provisions for Farm-out Arrangements Where farm-out arrangements negotiated before 16†De- cember 1991 have led to expenditures after that time, such expenditure is subject to a transitional provision. The new regime deals specifically with expenditure incurred by the farm-in party. The treatment of the farm-out party combines aspects of the 1990 regime and the new regime. Income is not assessable in the hands of the farm-out party. The farm-out partyís deferred deductions incurred with respect to that permit must be reduced but not deducted. The means of determining the amount of reduction is specified in section 214I(2) of the 1990 regime. Sale or Disposal of a Permit When selling or disposing of a permit or permit specific asset, the seller receives consideration which it may use in any way it chooses (section 214D). Therefore, a sale differs from a farm-out arrangement as any money received by the farm-out party must be spent on explora- tion or development in the specific permit to which the farm-out relates. The income from a sale or disposal is assessable income in the hands of the seller (section 214H). Any deferred deductions attributable to that petroleum asset are deductible in the year that the consideration is received (section 214F(5)). Joint Ventures are not Partnerships Joint ventures are no longer defined as partnerships, so they do not qualify as associated parties (section 214D). Objecting to a Determination Procedures by which a petroleum miner can object to a determination made by the Commissioner have been introduced under section 214L(1)). Anti-avoidance Provisions A new anti-avoidance section has been included in the legislation. The first part is a general anti-avoidance provision which makes it explicit that section 99 of the Income Tax Act applies to the petroleum regime (section 214MA(1)). The second part is more specific. It states that certain types of arrangements described in the legislation are deemed to be arrangements designed to avoid or alter the incidence of tax (section 214MA(2)). Application Date Changes to the treatment of exploration expenditures, development expenditures and farm-outs came into effect on 16†December 1991. All other changes, such as the anti-avoidance provisions and subsequent amend- ments to section 214N, apply from 1†July 1992. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Crown Research Institutes subject to Income Tax Sections 8B, 61(2), 197I and 394B, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction There have been several amendments relating to Crown Research Institutes (CRIs). They involve the definition of the assessable income of CRIs, their exclusion from certain income tax exemptions, prohibiting CRIs from maintaining imputation credit accounts, and ensuring that CRIs can utilise the loss carry forward and group- ing provisions. Background Established pursuant to the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992, CRIs commenced operation on 1 July 1992. The Government had previously decided that CRIs should be subject to income tax. These amendments are consequential to that decision. Key Issues CRIs have been included in the Income Tax Actís ìspecial corporate entityî definition. This allows them to be treated in the same way as state-owned enterprises and statutory producer boards for the purposes of measuring voting and market value interest provisions (sections 8A - 8F of the Income Tax Act). The special corporate entity status is designed to cater for companies with no ultimate natural person shareholders. Including CRIs in the special corporate entity definition is to their benefit as it will enable them to utilise the loss carry forward and grouping provisions in the Income Tax Act. It will also prevent CRIs from grouping their losses with other CRIs or any other Crown-owned entities. A CRI will only be able to group for loss purposes with its own subsidiaries CRIs will not be permitted to maintain imputation credit accounts (section 38). This can be justified on tax policy grounds as the Crown is the sole shareholder in CRIs, and it obviously cannot utilise any imputation credits arising from the payment of income tax by CRIs. To ensure that the Government decision that CRIs be subject to income tax is upheld, CRIs are expressly excluded from the income tax exemptions applying to public authorities and scientific or industrial research promoters. It is expressly provided that all payments that a CRI receives for the purpose of producing public good science outputs are deemed to be assessable income (section 20(2)). A substantial part of the business of CRIs will be the supply of public good science outputs. Funding received for this purpose by CRIs from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology should be treated as assessable income according to ordinary concepts. It is arguable, however, in the absence of an express legislative direction, that non- specific output funding received by CRIs from the Foundation for Research, Science and Technology could be described as having a capital rather than revenue character. (Non-specific output funding is untagged, so CRIs have a complete discretion as to which particular public good science output they use these funds for.) Accordingly, to put the matter beyond doubt, all public good science output funding received by a CRI is deemed to be assessable income. Application Date These amendments apply from 15†June 1992, being the commencement date of the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992 under which CRIs are formed and registered. Forestry Amendments Section 74(5), Income Tax Act 1976 An amendment treats standing timber as separate from the land it is growing on if that land is sold and the timber is subject to a cutting right. Previously the standing timber was deemed to be sold along with the land, even if cutting rights had been granted to a third party. When standing timber is subject to a forestry right registered under the Land Transfer Act 1952 or a profit ‡ prendre granted before 1†January 1984, the deeming provision of Section 74(5) does not apply on the sale of land on which the standing timber occupies. This amendment applies to sales of land occurring on or after the commencement of the 1992-93 income year. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Bloodstock Depreciation Section 86H(1A)(b), Income Tax Act 1976 An amendment ensures that bloodstock not previously used for breeding receive the interim 25% depreciation loading. The previous section 86H(1A)(b) excluded some bloodstock not previously used for breeding from this loading. The amendment allows for the application of the 25% loading if the bloodstock has not actually been used for breeding purposes by any other person before a taxpayer acquires it, whether or not a previous owner has taken the bloodstockís value into account under the section or claimed a deduction for it. The interim loading will continue to apply when bloodstock is transferred under a matrimonial agree- ment and between companies in a wholly-owned group as provided for previously. The amendment applies for the 1991-92 income year and subsequent years. Refunds where Excess RWT deducted in error Section 327F, Income Tax Act 1976 An amendment extends the time in which payers of resident withholding income can make refunds to investors when they have deducted too much tax as a result of a payer error. When the Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) regime was introduced it allowed payers to refund any excess tax which they had deducted as a result of a payer error, as long as they made the refund before the date by which RWT deductions for the relevant period were due to be paid to Inland Revenue. They then had to issue an amended RWT deduction certificate or shareholder dividend statement. The NZ Bankers' Association highlighted problems which arise where errors are not identified until after the relevant deductions have been paid to Inland Revenue. Where errors were discovered too late for a refund to be made the only way in which depositors could get any excess deduction refunded was to wait until the end of the income year and claim a refund through the tax system. This adversely affected customer relationships and was considered a significant administrative prob- lem. The Tax Simplification Consultative Committee also identified this problem, and recommended the amend- ment. The amendment to section 327F will allow payers to refund amounts deducted in error at any time up to 31†March in the year in which the error was made. If the person receiving the interest or dividends has received an RWT deduction certificate or shareholder dividend statement, s/he must return it to the payer for cancellation. The payer will then issue an amended certificate or statement. The amendment will apply from 14 †December 1992. Provision Denying Employment-Related Expenditure Clarified Section 105(2), Income Tax Act 1976 Section 105(2) of the Income Tax Act has been amended to remove a reference to other provisions of the Act relating to deductions of employment-related expenditure or loss. The legislation previously provided that taxpayers were not able to deduct expenses incurred in gaining or producing income from employment, except where a deduction was expressly provided for in the Income Tax Act. The legislation intended that employees should not be able to deduct any employment-related expenditure or loss. However, section 105(2) allowed for deductions which were specifically provided for in the rest of the Act. The amendment clarifies the subsection by removing the reference to other express provisions of the Act. This makes it clear that no employment-related deductions are allowed at all, and over-rides other provisions of the Act which could be interpreted as allowing employ- ment-related deductions. The amendment applies from the 1992-93 income year onwards. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) PAYE Bonds for Non-Resident Employees Section 350A, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The new section 350A enables the Commissioner to accept from an employer a bond or other form of security to defer the obligation to deduct PAYE from non-resident employees in situations where their liability to tax in New Zealand is uncertain. Background The taxation of non-resident employees is dependent on whether: ï they qualify for the ì92 day exemptionî contained in s61(19) of the Income Tax Act 1976; ï they qualify for the ì182 day exemptionî under a Double Taxation Agreement; ï or their non-resident employer has a permanent establishment in New Zealand. As all of these are dependent on future events, there is often uncertainty at the outset whether a tax liability will arise. Except for the most straightforward cases it is not possible to determine in advance whether an exemption will apply. Consequently, Inland Revenue requires PAYE to be deducted until such time as the employeeís right to the exemption has been established, at which time a refund is made. This is at the end of the employ- eeís visit. This policy is necessary in view of the ìflight riskî that non-resident employers and employees present. This policy is stated in PIB 97. As foreign tax jurisdictions may also require PAYE to be deducted until the exemption is established, the employers are often forced to either make double deductions of PAYE or pay the PAYE themselves. This unnecessarily adds to the cost of doing business in New Zealand and encourages non-residents to ensure their employees remain exempt from tax in New Zealand (through tax planning) or to flout their PAYE obliga- tions. Issues To protect tax revenue and reduce employers' compli- ance costs and current administrative burdens, section 350A provides that the Commissioner is now able to accept a bond or other form of security, at his discretion, to cover the PAYE on non-resident employees in situations where their tax liability is uncertain. Where such a bond or other security is provided, the employer need not make PAYE deductions from the non-resident employee unless and until the employee clearly becomes liable to tax in New Zealand, or the Commissioner specifies to the employer a date after which tax deductions are to be made. Where an employee is liable to tax from a certain point in time (for instance, the start of an income year), PAYE must be paid from that date onwards. This obligation to deduct PAYE from future source deduction payments would arise where, for instance: ï the bond becomes inadequate to cover further source deductions; or ï it become apparent that the exemption will not be available. In the latter case an obligation to deduct PAYE from past source deduction payments will arise. One IR†12 will be completed for the period in which the employee is liable to tax. Where that period covers two income years it will be necessary to apportion the source deductions made to each income year to ensure the employee is credited with the tax attributable to source deduction payments made in the previous income year. Where it becomes certain that the employee is not liable to tax in New Zealand the bond will be returned to the employer. It is envisaged that the bond will be of a similar form to that currently accepted for Non-Resident Contractorís Withholding tax. The Non-Resident Contractorsí Unit of Special Compa- nies Section in Inland Revenueís Wellington District Office will handle applications. Application Date The provisions of section 350A apply from 14 Decem- ber 1992. 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Provisional Tax Use of Money Interest Rate Clarified Section 398A and 413A, Income Tax Act 1976 There have been minor clarifying amendments to sections 398A and 413A of the Income Tax Act, which cover the use of money interest rate for provisional tax under- and overpayments. The amendments make it clear that each dayís interest is to be calculated having regard to the prevailing specified rate of interest appli- cable to that particular day. The amendments do not represent a change in the policy of the legislation. These amendments apply from 1 July 1992. Zero-Rating of Goods situated outside NZ at Time of Supply Section 11(1)(b), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 11(1)(b) of the GST Act has been repealed and replaced. Goods situated outside New Zealand at the time of supply will now be zero-rated, regardless of whether they are imported into New Zealand. Under the previous wording of the section, goods which were sold overseas and were to be imported into New Zealand for home consumption were subject to GST at the time of supply, and also at the time they were imported into New Zealand. The amended section zero-rates the supply of goods not situated in New Zealand at the time of supply. Such goods only become subject to GST if and when they are actually imported into New Zealand. The amendment applies from 14 December 1992. GST - Supply of Games in Casino Premises Section 5(11B), 5(11C) and 10(15A), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction The amendments to sections 5(11B), 5(11C) and 10(15A) provide for the fact that the supplier of services for GST purposes may be the holder of the casino operatorís licence or the holder of the premises licence, depending upon the management structure. The amend- ments also amend the calculation of that supply to take into account redemptions of chips. Background The original provision provided that money paid to play games on casino premises was deemed to be for a supply of services by the holder of the casino operatorís licence. This provision presupposed a lease-type arrangement would exist between the holder of the casino premises licence and the casino operator, in which case the casino operator would be the supplier. However, there may be instances when the supplier is in fact the holder of the premises licence. A specific example is where the casino operator merely operates the casino under management contract, with income accruing to the holder of the casino premises licence. In addition, by deeming a supply to be made where money is paid to participate in authorised games, games where money bet does not always give rise to casino income were included. An example is baccarat, where the casino takes a commission only from certain win- ning hands. Further, the previous calculation of supply omitted reference to redemptions of chips. Key Issues The amended section 5(11B) focuses on money paid to a casino in deeming a supply to be made, rather than money paid to the casino operator or by players on the premises. The supplier could be either the holder of the premises licence or the casino operator, depending on the nature of their agreement. The amendment ensures that commissions paid for games such as baccarat are consideration for supply. The definition of casino operatorís licence has been replaced with a definition of casino operator. The calculation of the value of the supply in section 10(15A) now takes into account redemptions of chips. Application Date The amendment applies from 14†December 1992. 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) GST on Fringe Benefits Section 21(4), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment to Section 21(4) of the GST Act corrects a reference to the Fringe Benefit Tax provisions in the Income Tax Act. This was necessary following amend- ments to the FBT provisions in the Income Tax Act. The GST Act contains special time of supply rules for fringe benefits. It refers to the provisions in the Income Tax Act which govern quarterly payment of FBT. However, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1991 amended the FBT provisions so FBT could be paid quarterly or on an annual (income year) basis. The amendment provides for a time of supply for fringe benefits where FBT is paid on an annual (income year) basis. The amendment applies from 14†December 1992. GST Refunds Section 45, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 45 of the GST Act, which sets out the time in which refunds of excess tax can be made, has been amended to bring it into line with the amended sec- tion†27. The amendment replaces references to tax properly payable with references to tax assessed under section 27 of the Act. The effect of the amendment is to provide that refunds will be made, within eight years of the end of the relevant period, where the amount of GST paid is greater than the amount assessed. The amendment applies to tax payable with respect to returns due to be made on and after 14 December 1992. Time Limit for GST Objections extended Sections 32(3) and 33(1), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sections 32(3) and 33(1) of the GST Act set out the time limits in which certain objections can be made. These sections have been amended, and the time limit has been extended to two months. Under the previous legislation, a person could object to a decision or an assessment made by the Commissioner within 28 days of the notification of that decision or assessment, subject to the Commissionerís discretion to extend the time limit. The amendment extends the time limit for objections to two months. The amendment applies to decisions notified on or after 1 December 1992 and to assessments for which notices of assessment are given on or after 1 December 1992. Commissioner able to make GST Assessments in all Cases Section 27, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 27 of the GST Act, which deals with GST assessments, has been amended. The amendment clarifies the circumstances in which the Commissioner is able to make an assessment. Previously, the Commissioner could make an assess- ment only in certain defined situations, such as where a person failed to file a return, or the Commissioner was not satisfied with a return as filed. The amendment enables the Commissioner to make an assessment of GST payable by any person. Where the Commissioner has not made an assessment, a person can request that an assessment be made. The amendment applies to returns due to be made on and after 14†December 1992. 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Companies may Group for GST Purposes Section 55(1), Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 An amendment to section 55(1) of the GST Act corrects a previous amendment to the section, and allows companies the option to group for GST purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1992 (the No.2 Act) set out new company grouping and loss offset provisions in the Income Tax Act. It also amended the company grouping provision in the GST Act to conform with the new company grouping provisions in the Income Tax Act (see TIB Vol 3 No 8, page 10). The No. 2 Act mistakenly provided that all companies who were able to group for loss offset purposes under the Income Tax Act were groups for GST purposes, thereby removing their ability to elect to group for GST purposes. This amendment rectifies the mistake and provides that companies who are a group for loss offset purposes may elect to group for GST purposes. The amendment applies with respect to supplies made on or after 1 April 1992 (the date the amendment to the GST Act made in the No.2 Act came into effect). GST Liability of Personal Representatives, Liquidators and Receivers Section 58, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction An amendment has been made to section 58, which sets out the GST obligations of personal representatives, liquidators and receivers. The amendment clarifies that these people have a personal liability for the GST obligations incurred in their capacity as personal representative, liquidator or receiver. Background This amendment clarifies the intention of the legislation and makes it clear that personal representatives, liquida- tors and receivers are, and always have been, liable for GST. Key Issues The amendment deems personal representatives, liquidators and receivers to be registered persons. In effect, this imposes a personal liability for GST on people who carry on a taxable activity in their capacity as personal representative, liquidator or receiver. The GST due for each taxable period must be returned to the Commissioner with priority over creditors. The main changes to the previous legislation are as follows: ï It is recognised that receivers and the like are usually appointed as agents of the company in receivership. It is the company which carries on the taxable activity and not the receiver. The amendment deems personal representatives, liquidators and receivers to be registered persons carrying on the taxable activity of the ìincapacitated personî (i.e., a registered person who has died, gone into liquidation or receivership or become bankrupt or incapacitated). ï The amendment makes it clear that there are not concurrent liabilities for GST in the period of inca- pacity. Personal representatives, liquidators and receivers are registered persons with respect to the taxable activity and the company is no longer the registered person for that time. ï The Commissioner no longer has the discretion to deem personal representatives, liquidators and receivers to be registered persons; the liability is imposed automatically. The amendment does not alter the current practice for people in receivership-type situations. Before this amendment personal representatives, liquidators and receivers were liable for GST incurred in the period in which they were carrying on a taxable activity in their capacity as personal representative, liquidator or receiver . The amendment merely clarifies the legisla- tion. Application Date The amendment applies from 14 †December 1992. 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Amendment to Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Section 13 of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 is amended so the stamp duty payable on conveyances between companies that are members of the same consolidated group can be deferred. Before this amendment, stamp duty was payable on conveyances of property, even between companies that are 100 percent commonly owned. The consolidation regime permits deferral of income tax on intra-group asset transfers, and also allows similar treatment of stamp duty. Stamp duty will not be payable on conveyances between companies that are members of the same consolidated group. The stamp duty is deferred and becomes payable only if the asset conveyed leaves the group. This includes a situation where the company that acquired the property intra-group leaves the consolidated group or is wound up. The amendment applies from 1 April 1993, when consolidation generally becomes effective. Stamp Duty on Conveyances within a Consolidated Group Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Gaming Duty Amendments Gaming Duties Act 1971 Filing Returns An amendment to section 12D of the Gaming Duties Act 1971 removes the requirement for a gaming ma- chine operator to file an early GMD return where his/her gaming machine operatorís licence is cancelled, or an application for its renewal is refused. It also allows the Commissioner to authorise the making of returns for a return period that ends within seven days either side of the last day of a calendar month. Before this amendment, if a gaming machine operatorís licence was cancelled or an application for its renewal refused, the operator had seven days in which to deliver There is a possibility of transactions between non- consolidated members constituting dividends as well as gifts. To overcome a possible double taxation problem, section 74B provides that gift duty is not payable on gifts that constitute dividends (whether assessable or exempt). Currently, transfers of assets which occur between 100% commonly owned companies are treated as not liable to gift duty. This treatment is explained in Public Information Bulletin No.96 (October 1978). Inland Revenue will review the policy statement in PIB 96 in light of the amendments contained in this Act. Until the outcome of that review, asset transfers between 100% commonly owned companies which are not part of the same consolidated group will remain unaffected by these amendments. Any consequence of this review will apply from a specified date (which could be earlier than 1†April 1993). Application date The amendment to section 74A that relates to gifts within consolidated groups applies from 1 April 1993. The Commissionerís administrative practice will be withdrawn from 1 April 1993. The amendment remov- ing double taxation implications of a gift that is also a dividend applies from 14 December 1992. Introduction Section 74A of the Estate and Gift Duties Act is in- serted to expressly exempt from gift duty gifts within a consolidated group, and Section 74B is added to remove possible double taxation implications of a gift that is also a dividend. Background Before this amendment, Inland Revenue's interpretation was that the transfer of assets ìbetween companies in a group, i.e., wholly-owned subsidiaries or companies with common shareholdingsî were not gifts and there- fore not subject to gift duty (see PIB 96). The term ìgroupî in PIB 96 means a 100% commonly owned group. We are currently reviewing this policy. Key Issues Section 74A only exempts from gift duty gifts between consolidated group members. This means that gifts between companies that are 100 percent commonly owned will not qualify for the exemption unless those companies are members of the same consolidated group. Unlike the income tax and stamp duty treatment, gift duty does not become payable at a later date when the donee company holding the gift leaves the consolidated group. 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) The amendment inserts a new definition of ìcasino operatorî, which means the holder of either a casino premises licence or a casino operatorís licence or a temporary authority, who is entitled to the gaming income of a casino. This makes sure that the person entitled to a casino's gaming income is liable for casino duty, and must file the appropriate returns. The amendments apply from 14†December 1992. Calculating Casino Win An error in section 12M of the original legislation which took into account the value of unredeemed chips twice has been corrected. Casino duty is calculated on a casino operator's ìcasino winî. The casino win is basically all sales of chips plus any money paid to play games, less chips redeemed and any money paid out as prizes. The original legislation made an adjustment for unre- deemed chips so that the duty applied to any unre- deemed chips. However, this is already implicit in the calculation of casino win. The adjustment for unredeemed chips has been re- moved, so casino operators will not be double-taxed on the value of chips not redeemed. The legislation now levies the duty as originally intended. The amendment applies from 14†December 1992. Definition of a Gaming Machine An amendment substitutes a new definition of ìgaming machineî in section 2 of the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1977. This definition is used in levying gaming ma- chine duty in the Gaming Duties Act 1971. The previous definition referred to machines used in games of chance. It was not always clear whether this definition included machines used merely to dispense tickets or cards in games, rather than to actually deter- mine the outcome. The new definition refers to devices as well as ma- chines, to take into account technological advances in the workings of gaming machines. It specifically excludes machines or devices used only to distribute tickets in sequence, where the machine or device itself does not determine or manifest the outcome of the game. For example a device that dispenses ìAvagoî cards is not a gaming machine. The amendment applies from 14†December 1992. a final return. The possibility of compliance difficulties made this short a period impractical. Where a gaming machine operatorís licence is cancelled or an application for renewal is refused, the return and payment date that applies will be the same as normal; the 20th of the following month. The original gaming machine duty legislation had no flexibility with regard to the return period, which was set at one calendar month. Gaming machine operators may now apply to the Commissioner for a return period that ends within seven days either side of the last day of a calendar month. This added flexibility will permit larger operators to account for the duty at the same time as they complete internal returns. The payment date for tax remains the same. This amendment applies from 14†December 1992. Amounts under $5.00 For most revenues that Inland Revenue collects, the Commissioner is able to write off debits under $5.00. The original gaming machine duty legislation did not provide for this. Section 12FA of the Gaming Machine Duty Act 1971 has been amended so that the Commissioner may write off amounts of gaming machine duty payable that are less than $5.00. This applies to debit balances only; Inland Revenue will pay out any refunds regardless of the amount. The amendment applies from 14†December 1992. Liability on Casino Licence Holders The original casino duty legislation made the holder of the casino operator's licence liable for casino duty. This has been amended to take into account the possibility that either the holder of the premises licence or the holder of the operator's licence may be liable for casino duty. As with the GST legislation, the original casino duties legislation presupposed a lease-type arrangement would exist between the holder of the casino premises licence and the casino operator. In this case the casino operator would be the supplier, and be liable for the casino duty. However, there are instances when the supplier may in fact be the holder of the premises licence. Specifically, where the casino operator merely operates the casino under management contract, with profits going to the holder of the casino premises licence. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Share Losses - Deductions Court of Appeal Decisions Background The Court of Appeal decisions in C of IR v Stockwell (CA 119/92) and C of IR v Inglis (CA 116/92) were delivered on 19†November 1992. These will both have important implications for some taxpayers. They decided that if taxpayers buy shares and would have been liable for tax on any profits or gains from selling the shares, then any losses they incur on that sale are deductible. The decisions apply only to people who trade in shares (or other property) as a business, or who buy shares for the purpose of reselling them. The Court drew a clear distinction between these people and others who typically invest spare money from time to time, hoping for dividends and some capital growth. Proceeds from these casual transactions would be neither taxable nor deductible. Introduction In two recent test cases Inland Revenue asked the Court of Appeal to clarify when taxpayers may deduct losses incurred on the sale of shares. The Court said that those losses are deductible if the taxpayers would have been taxed on any profit from the sale of those shares. In the light of these decisions, this article outlines when profits from share transactions will be assessable and when losses from share transactions will be deductible. It also sets out how Inland Revenue will apply these Court decisions to taxpayers who claim deductions for losses on share sales. The test case results will also be relevant to the taxation of transactions in other types of personal property and to land sales (under section 67(4)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976). However, this article covers only the tax treatment of share transactions. Taxpayers' Rights and Obligations In each of our offices we have recently displayed a charter which spells out people's rights and obligations in dealing with Inland Revenue. This charter tells people what service they should expect from us, and what obligations they have in their dealings with us. These include the right to prompt, courteous and efficient service from Inland Revenue, and the right to individual attention. The charter also tells people of their right to question Inland Revenue's decisions, and to be informed of their rights and obligations before an audit begins. Also included is people's obligation to act honestly when dealing with their tax affairs. All of our offices have reviewed their performance to make sure we are providing our customers with the service outlined in the charter. They also have sugges- tion forms so customers can provide comments on our service, and suggestions on how we can improve it. We want feedback from our customers, and if there are cases where we are not fulfilling our promises we want to know, so we can do something about it. 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Taxation of Share Sales Profits or gains from the sale or other disposition of company shares are assessable for income tax if: (a) The profits are business profits (section 65(2)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976); or (b) The taxpayer is in the business of dealing in shares (section 65(2)(e), 1st limb); or (c) The taxpayer acquires the shares with the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of them (section 65(2)(e), 2nd limb); or (d) The profits come from any undertaking entered into or devised for a profit making purpose (section 65(2), 3rd limb). “Acquired for the purpose of selling” Profits from selling shares are taxable if the taxpayer acquired the shares with the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of them. However, sometimes taxpayers buy shares for more than one purpose, and may be uncertain about the tax treatment of those share transactions. In these situations the dominant purpose at the time of buying the shares is the relevant one. Often ordinary investors acquire shares to make capital gains from their growth in value, as well as to earn income from dividends. In this situation there is no clear purpose of resale when the shares are bought, so any profit on sale would not be taxable. Neither would any losses be deductible. To work out whether the profit (or loss) from a taxpay- er's share sales are assessable (or deductible), it is necessary to look at each individual parcel of shares that the taxpayer sells during the year, and the purpose for which s/he acquired those shares. What the Cases said This article concentrates on the Inglis case, which is the main judgment about taxing share sales. The Stockwell case agreed with the decision in Inglis, and also consid- ered the sort of behaviour that would show that a taxpayer was in the business of dealing in shares (section†65(2)(e), 1st limb). In the Inglis decision the taxpayer had sold properties and invested the proceeds in the sharemarket until he and his wife were ready to purchase a larger house. The share market crash meant that he made substantial losses on those share investments. He wasnít in the business of dealing in shares, but the fact that he bought the shares to sell them when he and his wife decided to buy a house proved that he had bought the shares with the clear and dominant purpose of reselling them. If he had sold any of the shares at a profit, that profit would have been taxable as profits from property acquired for the purpose of resale (section 65(2(e), 2nd limb). The Court of Appeal reasoned that the Act allows deductions for expenditure or loss in gaining or produc- ing assessable income (section 104), but section 106 (1)(a) prevents any such deductions for capital losses. However the Court considered that this prohibition only applies to losses of fixed capital and that money used for share trading effectively changes to circulating capital (i.e., ìthe cost of tradeî). Thus, in substance, the shares became stock in trade, were held on revenue account and any trading loss on them would be deductible under section 104. This means that a taxpayer who is in the business of dealing in shares or who buys shares with the dominant purpose of reselling them can claim a deduction for any loss realised on the resale of those shares. The practical effect of these decisions is that where a taxpayer acquires shares with the dominant purpose of reselling them, then in the year of sale: (a) the taxpayer will be assessable on any profit from the sale (i.e., the amount by which the sale price (less any brokerage) exceeds the cost price (plus any brokerage)); (b) the taxpayer may claim a deduction for any loss on the sale (i.e., the amount by which the sale price (less any brokerage) is exceeded by the cost (plus any brokerage)) (c) expenditure incurred to acquire shares will be deductible and the amount of any difference on resale will be taxable or deductible, as the case may be. Taxpayers who seek to deduct share sale losses (where profits would have been assessed under the 2nd limb of section 65(2)(e)) have the onus of showing that when they bought the shares they had a clear and dominant purpose of reselling them. The requirement for taxpay- ers to show their clear and dominant purpose in acquir- ing shares was established in C of IR v National Dis- tributors (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346. In that case, the court envisaged that taxpayers would point to the following types of activities in order to give an objective indication of their purpose in acquiring shares ï regular and systematic reviewing of their share portfolio ï whether they adopted a coherent pattern of sales and purchases; ï if they had sold shares for no other apparent purpose than for trading; ï whether the shares were held for a relatively short period; ï the taxpayerís vocation; and ï any other relevant circumstances about their acquisi- tion and use of the shares. continued on page 4 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) involved in the actual proceedings); or (c) Inland Revenue has told the objector that the outcome of a group claim would be applied to that objector. (See the article on Gisborne Mills Ltd & Ors v C†of†IR (1989) 11 NZTC 6,194 in TIB Vol.1, No.5 for Inland Revenue's policy on reopening assessments.) Applications for re-opening Past Assessments: Procedure. Taxpayers who think they can claim a deduction for share sale losses they incurred in previous years can object to their assessments for the relevant income years. Inland Revenue will consider any such objections as late objections under section 30(2) of the Act. If you want to make such an objection, you should send it in writing to your local Inland Revenue office. Please include these details for each share sale: ï name of company ï number of shares sold ï date of purchase, and cost price of shares (including brokerage) ï date of sale, and sale price of shares (net, after brokerage) ï other associated expenses (e.g. interest) ï amount of profit or loss ï the purpose for buying the shares (and evidence to establish that purpose - such as an outline of other share transactions over a period that includes the income year of the assessment. Inland Revenue would expect any taxpayers claiming a deduction for a loss to declare any profits from similar transactions). You may use the format on page 35 as a convenient way of showing all this information: Summary The Court of Appeal decisions in C†of†IR v Stockwell and C†of †IR v Inglis allow taxpayers who trade in shares (and other property) as a business, or who buy for the purpose of reselling (and would therefore be taxable on any profits from those transactions) to deduct any losses they incur on those transactions. Inland Revenue will apply the decisions to current claims and objections. We will also consider reopening past assessments where taxpayers can show that the decisions should apply to their assessments, given their particular circumstances. References: HO.10.S.2.1 Tech Rulings 12.9.5; 12.9.5.1; 12.9.5.3; 12.9.6. We suggest that taxpayers use the format on page 35 as a convenient way of showing all the necessary informa- tion. Example Chris is not a professional gambler, but likes to go on tours to big overseas racing carnivals two or three times a year. She funds each trip by investing on the sharemarket (she finds the returns are better than the TAB) and realising the investments when she makes her travel arrangements. She invested $8,000 to provide for her Melbourne Cup trip (the total cost was $8250, once brokerage was included). However, when she sold the shares she only got $3,880 ($4,000 less brokerage of $120). Chris spent that November at home but got some consolation by working out that she could deduct $4,370 (i.e. $3,880 minus $8,250) from her assessable income for that year. Inland Revenue's Policy on applying the Decisions Current Claims/Objections Inland Revenue will apply the decisions to current claims and current objections to assessments. We will contact the taxpayers who have such claims or objec- tions. Reopening of Past Assessments In addition, some taxpayers may be able to have past assessments reopened. Generally, if Inland Revenue has issued an assessment and the taxpayer hasnít objected within the time limit, the assessment becomes final and the taxpayer canít have it amended unless s/he makes a late objection. It is then up to the Commissioner to decide whether to allow the objection and amend the assessment (sections 27 and 30(2)). However, the Commissioner will consider the particular circumstances of each objection to see if he will accept a late objection and reopen a taxpayerís assessment. In making this decision, the Commissioner will take account of factors including: (a) whether the objector has consistently asserted that s/he was entitled to a deduction (in contrast to a taxpayer who never sought a deduction in the past, but who becomes aware of a decision affecting another taxpayer and tries to take advantage of it); or (b) whether the objector has been associated with a claim or action against Inland Revenue on an issue relevant to the objection (even if not formally from page 3 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Please provide this information if you intend claiming losses on share transactions (You can also use this format if you want a past assessment reopened) Name:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Occupation:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ IRD Number:\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Show details for all shares acquired for the purpose of resale. 1 PurchasesSales Name ofNo. ofDate ofCost 2 No. ofDate ofProceeds 3 Profit or companyshares bought purchaseshares soldsalefrom saleloss ($)($)($) 1 Include all shares acquired for resale, even if they have not been sold 2 Cost = price of the shares plus any brokerage paid 3 Proceeds from sale = the amount received, less brokerage paid Other Information 1.

This policy will apply to HP agreements from 1†April 1993. The retail profit element of a HP agreement must be returned in the income year the HP agreement is entered into, and the interest element must be returned on an accrual or ìRule of 78î basis (Tech Rulings Ch.12, para 12.42.3.3 explains this formula). The Government intends to amend section 76 of the Income Tax Act so that the existing retail profit reserve on any HP agreement entered into on or before 31†March 1993 can be spread over the lesser of the remaining years of the agreement, or that year and the next three years. It also intends to enact a new finance lease regime which will apply to HP agreements entered into from 1†April 1993 onwards. Existing Policy The existing policy allows taxpayers to offset a reserve against income derived from HP agreements. Inland Revenue allows the reserve because it represents an allowance for: ï the retail profit content, and ï the interest content of any instalments that are unpaid at balance date. This is based on the assumption that the interest and profit content of the HP agreement is spread equally over all instalments. NOTE: The Hire Purchase Act 1971 defines ìHire Purchase Agreementî as either a customary Hire Purchase Agreement or a Conditional Sale Agreement. Inland Revenue adopts this defini- tion for the purposes of the Income Tax Act. ìRetail Profitî is the profit that the seller would have made if the goods in question were sold for cash. New Policy The new policy will apply to HP agreements from 1†April 1993. The timing of the change is consistent with our usual practice of applying policy changes from a future date. Inland Revenue reviewed its policy in the light of: (a) Sections 222A to 222E of the Income Tax Act; (b) Case M13 (1990) 12 NZTC 2092 and Case M94 (1990) 12 NZTC 2578; and (c) Current accounting practice (see SSAP 18). Following the review, HP agreements should clearly follow the specified lease regime in sections 222A to 222E of the Income Tax Act. This policy amends the previous policy on HP agreements and the specified lease regime, which was set out in Public Information Bulletin No.120/1, of August 1983. A HP agreement is a ìspecified leaseî for the purposes of sections 222A-222E. ìLeaseî is defined in section 222A(1) to include any hire or bailment and includes both a true hire purchase agreement (that is a bailment with an option to purchase) and a conditional sale agreement. Sections 222A to 222E of the Income Tax Act provide a code for financial leases (called ìspecified leasesî in the provisions). In particular these sections specify how the income from the ìfinancialî portion of the specified lease should be returned. Section 222C deems income derived from a specified lease to be interest. In a HP agreement that income is any amount above the ìcost priceî of the asset. ìCost Priceî of an asset is the normal selling price at which the retailer would have sold it. Section 222C also gives methods to calculate the amount of interest for any particular income year. There are two prescribed methods; one approximates the yield to maturity (YTM) method, the other is any method that has the Commissionerís approval (The only other method to date which has the Commissioner's approval is the ìRule of 78î method). The retailer can use the Rule of 78 method if the HP agreement meets these criteria: (a) the term of the agreement is 5 years or less; and (b) all instalments are of an equal amount other than the final instalment, which must be within five percent of other instalments; and (c) all instalments are payable regularly, e.g., weekly, monthly, six monthly. As noted above, section 222C deals only with the interest income, that is, the amount above the cost price. The retail profit should be returned in the income year the HP agreement is entered into. The purchaser does not have to deduct interest in the same manner as the retailer returns it (see Tech Rulings Ch.12, Para 12.42.4). Section 222D governs the amount of interest which the purchaser can deduct in any income year, providing the interest meets the deductib- ility test in the Act. 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) The Government has indicated that it will introduce a new finance lease regime which will apply to HP agreements entered into from 1†April 1993. This regime will bring both specified leases and HP agreements into the accrual regime. The principal change will be that the interest element of these transactions will generally be returned on a YTM basis (or in some circumstances straight line or another method which conforms with commercially acceptable practice and gives materially the same result as YTM). The retail profit element will continue to be returned as income in the income year the HP agreement is entered into. The proposed new regime will apply to transactions entered into on or after 1 April 1993. Proposed Transitional Measures The Government has indicated that it will amend section 76 of the Income Tax Act, which allows income to be spread where there has been a change in account- ing practice. It is proposed that taxpayers who have entered into HP agreements on or before 31†March 1993 will be able to spread the existing retail profit reserve over the lesser of the remaining life of the agreement or over the year of adjustment and the three succeeding years. This means taxpayers should have sufficient time to adjust to the change in Inland Revenueís policy. We will publish a detailed statement on the transitional measures and finance lease regime as soon as the legislation is passed. This statement will include practical examples to demonstrate the effect of the legislation. Reference:HO.10.R.9.1. Tech Rulings 12.42.8 and 20.50.2 Objecting to Assessments Part two of Inland Revenue's Objection Procedures booklet (IR†266) states that taxpayers can make an objection only to a notice of assessment. Following legal advice, we have determined that in reality a taxpayer objects to an assessment; not the actual printed notice which conveys the assessment. Consequently, a taxpayer may object to an assessment of tax shown on a notice of adjustment that s/he receives before receiving the actual notice of assessment. The time limit for lodging an objection remains two months from the date on the notice of assessment. In the case R v DFCT ex parte Hooper Cook J said when referring to an assessment: ìAn ëassessmentí is not a piece of paper: it is an official act or operation; it is the Commissionerís ascertainment, on consideration of all relevant circumstances, including sometimes his own opin- ion, of the amount of tax chargeable to a given taxpayer. When he has completed his ascertainment of the amount, he sends by post a notification thereof called ëa notice of assessmentí ... But neither the paper sent nor the notification it gives is the ëassess- mentí. This is and remains the act or operation of the Commissioner.î This issue arose when Inland Revenue disallowed an assessment because we had not yet issued a notice of assessment. Similar objection rights exist in relation to determina- tions that the Commissioner makes about such things as: ï a loss, or a loss carried forward ï Foreign Investment Funds ï imputation ï source deduction payments. In the case Lloyds Bank Export Finance v C†of†IR (1991) 13 NZTC 8134 PC, Inland Revenue argued before the Privy Council that an assessment must result in tax to pay, and that a taxpayer could not object to an assessment in nil tax to pay or loss situations. The Privy Council did not support this view and confirmed that a taxpayer can object to any assessment of his/her liabil- ity, regardless of whether it has a positive, negative, or neutral (nil) result. 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Taxpayer Audit Programme - Lines of Authority Introduction We previously published this item in TIB Volume One, No. 7 of January 1990. Since then, the New Zealand Society of Accountants has asked us to provide an update on the structure and operations of Inland Rev- enue's Taxpayer Audit Programme. Taxpayer Audit is currently carrying out a programme evaluation, which may affect the current structure. Background Inland Revenue's field audit/investigations activity is grouped under the Taxpayer Audit Programme - consisting of Payroll Inspectors, GST Audit, Income Tax Audit, Investigations Unit and Specialist Units. Structure The Taxpayer Audit programme has three main levels: 1. Head Office Taxpayer Audit in Head Office is headed by the Direc- tor (Taxpayer Audit) and is concerned with policy matters. There are two specialist units set up in Head Office - a small team of Specialist Inspectors and a recent policy initiative has seen the establishment of the Special Audit Unit. 2. District Office In our district offices, Payroll Inspectors, GST Auditors and Income Tax Audit staff all have Supervisors to whom they report directly. The Manager (Taxpayer Audit) has overall responsibility for the Payroll, GST Audit and Income Tax Audit programmes, and reports to the local District Commissioner 3. Investigations Unit The Investigations Unit is structured on a regional basis. In each region (Northern, Waikato, Central and Southern) there is a Controller (Taxpayer Audit), who is situated at the Inland Revenue Regional Office in Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington or Christchurch. There are Senior Investigating Accountants, Investigat- ing Accountants and Investigations Officers in most of our district offices, and Assistant Controllers (Investiga- tions) in Auckland, Otahuhu, Takapuna, Hamilton, Napier, New Plymouth, Palmerston North, Wellington, Lower Hutt, Christchurch, Dunedin and Invercargill. The Senior Investigating Accountants work on the more complex large audits. What to do if you are concerned about an Audit or Investigation If you disagree with any of the findings of an audit or investigation, or if you are unhappy about the way an audit or investigation is being conducted, you should initially raise the matter with the officer concerned and/ or that officer's immediate superior. If the problem is not resolved, your next point of contact will depend on the type of audit or investigation. ï For Payroll Inspectors, GST and Income Tax Audi- tors, contact the relevant Supervisor at your local IRD office. If the matter cannot be resolved at this level, ask for the local Manager (Taxpayer Audit). If the s/he is unable to help, then the next step is the District Commissioner and ultimately the Regional Control- ler. ï For cases involving the Special Audit Unit, you should contact the Manager (Special Audit). If s/he cannot resolve the matter, ask for the Director (Tax- payer Audit). ï For cases involving Specialist Inspectors, you will need to contact the Manager (International Audit). If s/he cannot resolve the matter, ask for the Director (Taxpayer Audit). 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) ï Sometimes an Investigating Accountant or Investiga- tions Officer from one District /Region investigates a file in another District/Region. The lines of control of these investigations remain at "home base". In these investigations, issues may arise which need to be discussed. Where the parties involved are not at the same location, discussions will be held by mutual arranged place. In this situation IRD staff are happy to travel to other centres. If discussions with the Controller (Taxpayer Audit) do not resolve the matter, you may wish to contact the local Regional Controller where the file is held. A formal request for case stated would be dealt with by this Regional Controller. Interest on Qualifying Tax in Dispute Introduction Inland Revenue must pay interest when refunding qualifying tax in dispute. Our Objection Procedures booklet (IR†266) states that this interest is only payable on the non-deferrable portion of tax in dispute. How- ever, this is incorrect; we must pay interest on all qualifying tax in dispute that we refund. Background When a taxpayer makes a ìcompetentî objection (explained in our Objection Procedures book), s/he may put off paying up to half of the tax in dispute until the objection is decided. The half that s/he can put off paying is called deferrable tax in dispute, and the half that s/he must pay by the normal due date is called non- deferrable tax in dispute. Interest Payable If an objection is fully or partly allowed, Inland Revenue must refund any consequential overpayment, and pay interest on the qualifying tax in dispute. This is so whether the Commissioner concedes an objection, or if the Courts or Taxation Review Authority decide in the taxpayer's favour. Inland Revenue must pay interest on any qualifying tax in dispute that the taxpayer pays before the objection is decided, and which must subsequently be refunded. If the taxpayer chooses to pay an more of the tax in dispute than the minimum non-deferrable part (50%), then Inland Revenue must pay interest on this total amount. The prescribed formula for calculating the interest is: X x Y x Z 365 X = the number of days for which interest is payable Y = the amount of qualifying tax in dispute that Inland Revenue is to refund Z = the specified interest rate (13.5% up to 31/3/1992; 10% from 1/4/92) Examples Example 1 Inland Revenue issues an income tax notice of assess- ment on 25 May 1992, which shows residual income tax (RIT) of $3,500 due by 7 February 1993. The taxpayer makes a competent objection to the assessment on 18 June 1992. S/he considers that the RIT should have been $1,000. The Commissioner declines the objection on 2 July 1992, and on 15 July 1992 the taxpayer requests that a case be stated to the High Court. The qualifying tax in dispute is $2,500. On 8 February 1993 (the 7th is a Sunday), the taxpayer pays the $1,000 that is not in dispute, and half of the tax in dispute ($1,250). On 3 May 1993 the High Court decides in the taxpayer's favour, confirming that the assessment should have been $1,000. On 12 May 1993 Inland Revenue refunds the overpaid tax of $1,250 and interest of $32.20. That interest was calculated using the prescribed formula: 94 x $1,250 x 10% = $32.50 365 Example 2 If the taxpayer in Example 1 had chosen to pay all the tax in dispute, (even though by law s/he only had to pay half of it), the qualifying tax in dispute on which interest is to be calculated would be $2,500. The interest payable would then be $64.39. 94 x $2,50 x 10% = $64.39 365 Reference: HO.10.T.2.3. 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Depreciation on Second-Hand Assets Introduction This article sets out the circumstances in which a taxpayer can claim depreciation based on the actual price paid for a previously depreciated asset that s/he acquires from another person. Section 111(1) Section 111(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976 limits the depreciation that may be claimed on assets acquired from another person. The new owner may only claim as much depreciation as the previous owner could have claimed if s/he had retained the asset. However, the new owner can claim depreciation based on the actual price paid for the asset where the Commissioner is of the opinion under section 111(2) of the Act that ìthe circumstances are such that a deduction in respect of the depreciation of the property based on the actual price or other consideration given for the property should be allowed.î In these circumstances the purchaser can depreciate the asset based on the amount s/he paid for it, regardless of its depreciated value in the hands of the vendor. Application of Section 111(2) Section 111(1) will not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that the purchaser should be able to claim depreciation based on the actual price paid for the property. The Commissioner will normally exercise this discre- tion if there is an armís length sale where: (i) the sale is bona fide; and (ii) the purchase price is a fair market value for the asset; and (iii) the purchaser buys the asset for use in income producing activities, and the vendor no longer uses it for producing activities. In CIR v Lys and Others (1988) 10 NZTC 5,107 there was a transfer to a family trust. The High Court stated that this transfer should be considered in relation to normal commercial and conveyancing practices. If the transaction was in accordance with these practices then section 111(2) should apply even though the parties were related. Summary Where there is a transfer in accordance with normal commercial practice for armís length sales, the new owner can claim depreciation based on the amount s/he pays for the property. The fact that the parties are related does not in itself prevent the Commissioner from exercising his discretion under section 111(2).

Background The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 clarified Government policy by confirming that grants and subsidies made by the Crown and public authorities are subject to GST when made to a regis- tered person for his/her taxable activity. Suspensory loans and advances are ìgrants or subsidiesî when the loan or advance becomes non-repayable because the conditions for non-repayment are satisfied. Suspensory loans and advances have been made with no provision for GST payable. Recipients of suspensory loans and advances would therefore be out of pocket if required to return GST on those loans and advances which did not include provision for GST. Key Issues To prevent recipients of suspensory loans and advances from being out of pocket, the Government has decided that any loans or advances made before 1†January 1993 will not be subject to GST when converted to a grant or subsidy. However, loans and advances which were explicitly stated to include GST will still be taxable upon conversion. A registered person can claim a GST refund if s/he paid GST on a suspensory loan or advance which made no provision for the GST liability. This measure was brought into effect by the Goods and Services Tax (Grants and Subsidies) Order 1992. Recipients of loans and advances made after 1 January 1993 must return GST on any loan or advance which is converted to a grant or subsidy. 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Companies in Receivership or Liquidation - RWT Exemption Certificates Ruling This ruling applies to companies in receivership or liquidation that wish to apply for a certificate of exemp- tion from RWT under subsection 327M(12). Where statements were not prepared for the receiver or liquida- tor, or there are insufficient records to produce detailed budgeted accounts, we will accept pro forma accounts that show: a) the amount of losses to be carried forward; and b) the amount of expected income or loss for the year; and c) that the losses in a) will be sufficient to fully offset any income in b). This is provided: ï the company has filed tax returns which confirm the losses; or ï there are other reasonable grounds for concluding that the company will meet the requirements of paragraph (a) or paragraph (b) of section 327M(12), and these grounds are provided to Inland Revenue in writing. Application Date The policy applies from 1†January 1993. It may not be applied retrospectively. Reference:HO.10.I.6.9 Tech Rulings 58.15.6.5 and 58.15.6.6 Introduction This item sets out details of what Inland Revenue will accept as budgeted accounts where a company that is in receivership or liquidation applies for a certificate of exemption from resident withholding tax (RWT). Background Section 327M(12) of the Income Tax Act 1976 allows the Commissioner to issue certificates of exemption from resident withholding tax. There are two situations where the Commissioner can issue such a certificate. One of these is where a taxpayer will or is likely to incur a loss, or has losses to carry forward that are greater than that year's assessable income (paragraph (a) in section 327M(12)). To meet this criterion, section 327M(12)(d) requires the taxpayer to supply budgeted accounts that confirm the losses (or projected losses) to Inland Revenue. Companies in receivership or liquidation often have current or prior year losses. However, some of these companies cannot produce budgeted accounts to confirm their losses to Inland Revenue. We currently accept accounting statements prepared for the liquidator or receiver, but in some cases these accounting statements have not been prepared when a liquidation or receiver- ship begins. In these cases, we will apply the following policy. 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received.

The payments were made to help the worker with the services provided on behalf of the organisation. The payments made to the volunteer from family and friends are not of an income nature as they are not paid or received as reward for services. Nor were the payments expected or relied on for the volunteer's support. The gifts were marks of affection, esteem or respect for the volunteer. The payments did not therefore have the character of income, so they were not assessable for income tax purposes. Reference: HO.TPA041 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Assessability of Insurance Commission Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: An insurance agent asked whether commission derived from selling policies to himself and his immediate family should be treated as assessable income. All commissions paid on policies that an insurance agent sells are assessable income under section 65 of the Act. This is regardless of whether or not the policy was sold to family. Reference: HO.TPP069 Assessability of Gratuity to Retiring Employee Section 68 - Retiring Allowances Paid to Employees: When s/he ceased em- ployment, a taxpayer received a gratuity payment for long service leave entitle- ment. S/he asked whether this payment was assessable for income tax pur- poses. The taxpayer’s employment agreement stated that the employer would grant on retirement or resignation a gratuity payment to employees who had 10 or more years service. The payment was to be calculated at the rate of one week’s salary for each year of service less any paid leave taken under a long service leave entitlement. If a payment made to an employee is calculated according to any right or entitle- ment which is not dependent on the employee’s retirement or redundancy, the payment is fully assessable for income tax purposes. In this case, as long service leave could be taken instead of a gratuity payment, and the payment was not dependent on the taxpayer’s retirement or redundancy, it was fully assessable. Reference: HO.TPA048 Deduction for Outward Bound Course Fees Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: An employer asked whether s/he could claim a deduction for fees paid to enable an employee to attend an Outward Bound course. Expenditure incurred in producing assessable income, or in carrying on a busi- ness for that purpose, is deductible under section 104 of the Act. In this case the employer was allowed a deduction because the Outward Bound course was regarded as training given to the employee. Reference: HO.TPA045 Profit on Sale of Leased Asset Section 107 - Revised Assessments Where Assets Purchased and Resold After Deduction of Payments Under Lease: A taxpayer in business leased a motor vehicle, and subsequently purchased it after a year. The purchase was a condi- tion of the lease, but the lease was not a “specified lease” as defined in section 222A. The taxpayer then sold the motor vehicle 6 months later for more than the purchase price. continued on page 44 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) from page 43 Under section 107, the lesser of these amounts is assessable in the year of sale: • the excess of sale over purchase price, or • the deductions allowed under the lease This applies whether or not the purchase was a condition of the lease. Reference: HO.TPP032 Interest Income Derived by Deceased Estate Section 232 - Income Derived by Trustee after Death of Deceased Person: The trustee of an estate asked about the tax treatment of the deceased person’s interest income which had accrued to the date of death. The deceased was a cash basis holder. The interest had been received by the trustee after date of death. Interest which is not paid out to the person or dealt with until after the date of death is deemed under section 232 of the Act to have been derived by the trus- tee. The income should therefore be included in the estate’s return of income. Reference: HO.TPA005 Income of New Zealand Resident Working Overseas Section 242 - Liability of Income Derived from New Zealand and Abroad: A New Zealand resident asked why income received while working overseas would be liable for New Zealand income tax. The person had left New Zealand to work overseas for 4 months and subsequently returned. The taxpayer was deemed to be a New Zealand resident for income tax pur- poses. Income that s/he received in New Zealand was liable for income tax in New Zealand under section 242 of the Act. This applied to all income that the taxpayer received, whether it was from within or outside New Zealand. A person who is not a New Zealand resident for tax purposes is only liable for income tax on income with a New Zealand source. Reference: HO.TPA016 Interest Derived by Overseas Exchange Teacher Section 243 - Classes of Income Deemed to be Derived from New Zealand: A French exchange teacher working in New Zealand derived interest income from a bank deposit in New Zealand. The teacher was a deemed resident under section 241, so the bank deducted resident withholding tax from the interest. The teacher questioned whether this deduction was correct. Section 243 of the Act deems the interest to be derived from New Zealand, because it has a source in New Zealand. Article 21 of New Zealand’s Double Tax Agreement with France contains an exemption which applies to income received from teaching activities in New Zealand for up to two years. The exemption does not apply to income from activities other than teaching. The bank had therefore correctly deducted withholding tax from the interest. If the teacher had not been a deemed resident, non-resident withholding tax would have applied. Reference: HO.TPA012 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) Exemption from Resident Withholding Tax for Non-Profit Bodies Section 327M - Certificates of Exemption: A non-profit body asked if it was possible to be exempted from the deduction of resident withholding tax from interest on an investment. The non-profit body received total income of less than $1,000 in its most recently completed accounting year. A non-profit body which is exempt from income tax, or which has a total income of less than $1,000 may apply for a certificate of exemption from resident with- holding tax under section 327M of the Act. If the body’s income exceeds $1,000, resident withholding tax must be deducted from any interest or dividends they receive. Reference: HO.TPA015 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on Food Parcels sent Overseas Section 11 - Zero-Rating: A food retailer asked whether food parcels sent over- seas on behalf of persons living in New Zealand are zero-rated for GST pur- poses. A person in New Zealand purchased the food parcels, and as part of the sale the retailer was to send the parcels to a person overseas. A supply of goods and services entered for export to a place outside New Zea- land will be zero-rated under section 11 of the Act. In this case the goods would be treated as a zero-rated supply by the food retailer. Reference: HO.TPA049 GST and Domestic Rental Properties Section 14 - Exempt Supplies: The taxpayer asked whether s/he could claim GST on the purchase price of a dwelling used for rental purposes. The supply of rental accommodation is an exempt supply under section 14(c) of the Act. In this case no GST can be claimed on any expenditure, including the purchase price of the rental property.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) In its 1992 Budget, the Government announced planned changes to the tax treatment of entertainment expendi- ture. The Minister of Revenue made this press statement about the Budget announcement on 17†December 1992: Further information on the Governmentís proposed new tax treatment of entertainment expenditure will be available from early next week at Inland Revenue Offices. The proposed legislation enacting the changes is included in the Taxation Reform Bill (No†6) introduced to Parliament today. ìPublic interest in the development of detailed policy on entertainment expenditure has been understandably high,î the Minister of Revenue, Wyatt Creech, said today. ìGiven the level of interest, and the regimeís introduc- tion to Parliament, the Inland Revenue Department is making available a publication on the operation and practical implications of the tax changes.î Under the proposed legislation fringe benefit tax will be imposed on 50% of entertainment expenditure, with the cost of the entertainment and the FBT liability fully deductible. FBT will not, however, be imposed on non-employing taxpayers. Instead only 50% of the entertainment expenditure will be deductible. ìSubmissions on the Bill will be heard by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee,î Mr Creech said. ìThe chairperson of the committee advises me that the likely closing date for submissions will be 12 February 1993. They can be lodged from now on.î The following articles reproduce the text of the informa- tion available from Inland Revenue. Tax Treatment of Entertainment Expenditure The Proposed Tax Treatment of Entertainment Expenditure This guide to the proposed tax treatment of entertain- ment expenditure is based on the legislation contained in the Taxation Reform Bill (No. 6) 1992 at time of its introduction into Parliament. It has been prepared to assist people to understand the detail of the proposed tax treatment. The legislation is to be referred to the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. Submis- sions on the Bill will be heard by the Finance and Expenditure Select Committee. Because changes can occur as a result of the Select Committee process, this publication may not therefore reflect the final form of the legislation. It is expected that the closing date for submissions to the Select Committee will be 12†Febru- ary 1993. Background and Summary Currently, businesses are able to fully deduct entertain- ment expenses for tax purposes. Entertainment ex- penditure often carries a significant portion of private benefit, as well as a business benefit. The private benefit should not be deductible. Because it is difficult to apportion the private component, the legislation sets a minimum of 50†percent of the total expenditure as the private element. The tax treatment proposed in this legislation brings defined expenditure on entertainment into the Fringe Benefit Tax regime, and offers an alternative income tax treatment for non-employing taxpayers. The Inland Revenue Department is committed to enforcing this legislation and plans to step up compli- ance activity in this area. Any questions on the proposed entertainment regime may be directed to: Legislative Affairs Directorate Head Office Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Phone: (04) 472-1032 Fax: (04) 499-1690 Wyatt Creech Minister of Revenue Information about the proposed new entertainment provisions continues on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) For Tax Purposes, What is Entertainment? In the Bill as introduced, entertainment is defined as being the provision of: (i) food; (ii)beverages; (iii) recreation; Recreation is widely defined as being active or passive participation in sports, games, physical exercise, or artistic, cultural, social, or leisure pursuits or amusement whether or not provided in connection with an entertainment facility. An entertainment facility includes land, buildings, aircraft, yachts or other vessels or vehicles. (iv) accommodation or travel provided in connection with entertainment in the form of (i), (ii) or (iii) above; Where the accommodation or travel is connected with or undertaken for the purposes of facilitating entertainment as in (i), (ii) or (iii) above, it is subject to the same tax treatment as the entertain- ment itself. For example, a client of an advertising agency is taken to Club Med. The dominant purpose of the expenditure was entertainment or entertainment-related, the total expenditure, including accommodation and travel will be subject to the regime. (v) money or moneyís worth for the provision of any of (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) above. This means that allowances paid to cover entertain- ment as defined will become fully subject to FBT. Reimbursing payments will be partially subject to FBT. What Entertainment is Excluded? The Bill excludes several types of entertainment from the proposed treatment: ï Goods and services which constitute entertainment but are provided at market value to paying customers in the ordinary course of a business, such as a restau- rant selling food and drink to the public. Consequently, meals sold to the public will not be subject to tax. Expenditure incurred by a restaurateur to entertain suppliers, for instance, will, however, be subject to the regime. This exclusion prevents the business being charged FBT or denied a deduction for its inputs. Where a restaurant provides entertainment which is not in the course of the business, i.e. for no charge, it will become subject to the regime. ï Entertainment which is already assessable as income to the person to whom it is provided. ï Expenditure which is incurred in promoting or advertising goods and services to the general public or a broad sector of the general public. The invitation must be public and non-exclusive. Some examples of where this exclusion would apply are: - a movie theatre provides a free ticket to every 10th patron. - a trade association holds an exhibition publicly advertised to members of the construction industry. - a manufacturer publicly invites retailers to the launch of its new T.V. If the manufacturer invited retailers of that manufacturer's product only, the promotion would not meet the terms of the exclusion, not being to a broad sector of the public. The provision of morning and afternoon teas or similar light refreshments would be excluded even in this case under the general exclusion however. ï Expenditure incurred in the provision of entertain- ment for charitable purposes. For example, the sponsorship of a hospital childrenís Christmas party. ï The provision of morning and afternoon teas or similar light refreshments provided at any time during the day. ï Expenditure incurred in the provision of an in-house dining facility or cafeteria which is open to all employees. The provision of food and drink to employees and clients in in-house dining facilities on non-social occasions is exempted. Consequently, expenditure incurred in the provision of a staff cafeteria will be excluded from the regime. The exemption will not, however, apply to : - executive dining rooms not available to all employees; - alcohol consumed in an in-house dining facility; and - staff parties, such as a Christmas party. ï Entertainment enjoyed as an incidental part of employment on the premises of the employer, who in the ordinary course of business provides entertain- ment to the public. This provision would exempt, for instance, incidental food provided to a kitchen-hand by a restaurateur. ï Entertainment enjoyed by a reviewer or critic of entertainment. Consequently, expenditure incurred on entertainment by a film or food critic, for instance, would not be subject to the regime. ï Entertainment provided in conjunction with commer- cial travel by aircraft, train or bus, for example, in- flight meals. ï Entertainment provided by an after-dinner speaker. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) What is the Proposed Tax Treatment? The regime contains two alternative tax treatments: ï Entertainment expenditure of employers is subject to the FBT regime. ï Non-employing taxpayers may elect to have their entertainment expenditure subject to the FBT regime with an alternative of non-deductibility. This alterna- tive recognises the fact that additional compliance costs would result from non-employing taxpayers joining the FBT regime. Generally, 50 percent of entertainment expenditure will be subject to FBT. Where the expenditure involves employees, and is at the employerís premises, 50 percent of the expenditure will be subject to FBT. An in-house dining facility open to all employees is not subject to the regime. Can Taxpayers Elect to Move Between Alternatives? It will not be possible to move between the alternative treatments. The entertainment expenditure of taxpayers already in the FBT regime will become subject to the FBT treat- ment. Those taxpayers who are not employers may elect to make the expenditure non-deductible, or subject to FBT. Where the entertainment regime applies to those not liable for income tax this will be by way of the FBT regime. Why 50% of the Expenditure? The 50% approach recognises that the benefits derived from entertainment expenditure include both business and private components. The Government accepts that any proportion chosen will necessarily only be an arbitrary approximation of the actual private benefits conferred in a particular situation, but 50% strikes a fair balance. What Kind of Records will Taxpayers Need to Keep? There should be no need to keep any additional records, apart from the normal ledgers, journals, invoices or receipts which clearly show what the actual expenditure is. These records are already required to substantiate any expense deduction. More Detail on Other Areas of the Legislation In-house Entertainment Facilities Expenditure incurred in the provision of in-house entertainment will be subject to tax. Half of the expendi- ture will be subject to FBT or partial non-deductibility. Any expenditure incurred in the provision of an exempt in-house dining facility will fall outside the regime because of the specific exclusion relating to it. The provision of an in-house gymnasium, swimming pool, squash court, etc., will be subject to the regime. The value of an in-house facility (not including an exempt in-house dining facility) will be based on: ï external market value of a similar facility, where it is presumed that that market value includes all relevant costs; or ï a combination of actual direct and indirect costs relevant to the facility. The indirect costs that should be included are: ï utilities; ï repairs and maintenance of equipment; ï rent; ï depreciation. The basis of apportionment of indirect costs should follow the rules used for trading stock purposes whereby a common measure such as floor area is used. Corporate Boxes Half of the cost of a corporate box will be subject to the regime. The regime will apply to both temporary and permanent facilities. Examples would include corporate boxes at sports grounds and hospitality tents at horse races. Conferences, Seminars and Trade Displays Entertainment provided at a conference, seminar or trade display will be subject to FBT or non-deductibility. Entertainment will not, however, include the provision of morning and afternoon teas or similar light refresh- ments. Where the entertainment provided at a conference, seminar or trade display is specifically identified in the charge to a taxpayer, FBT or non-deductibility will be imposed on that person. Where, however, the value of the entertainment is not specifically identified, the liability will fall on the conference organiser. In relation to an overseas conference, it would be unreasonable to impose a New Zealand tax liability on a non-resident organiser. Accordingly, FBT or non-deductibility would apply to a ìfair and reasonable portionî of the total charge to the taxpayer. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) deductible entertainment expenditure for income tax purposes. Shareholders Following the current practice in relation to non-cash dividends provided to shareholders, entertainment provided to: (i) shareholder-employees of any company will be subject to FBT, with the cost of the entertainment and the FBT liability fully deductible; (ii) shareholders of qualifying companies will be exempt from tax and non-deductible; (iii) shareholders of non-qualifying companies will be treated as a non-cash dividend, assessable to the shareholder and non-deductible to the company. Changes to the Current FBT Regime A number of exemptions to the current definition of fringe benefit will be removed. Consequently, the definition of fringe benefit will be extended to include: ï entertainment, not including an allowance, provided to an employee by his/her employer for the purpose of enabling the employee to entertain someone, includ- ing existing or prospective clients or customers of the employer. Fifty percent of the expenditure incurred in the provision of such benefits will be subject to FBT. ï a membership subscription which the employer of the employee has paid, and which entitles the employee to membership of a club of which members of the general public may become members. Consequently, subscriptions to a gym or tennis club, provided by an employer to employees will be subject to FBT. ï benefits enjoyed through the in-house provision of entertainment, but not including entertainment provided through an in-house dining facility. Fifty percent of such expenditure will be subject to FBT. The exemption for small amounts (the de minimis) in the FBT regime will be ìcappedî at $75 per quarter per employee for the first three employees receiving fringe benefits and $225 per employer per quarter thereafter. If the value of fringe benefits exceeds this threshold, the full value of the benefits will be taxable. This de minimis will not, however, apply to the provision of entertainment. Allowances and Reimbursing Payments The definition of entertainment includes ìmoney or moneyís worth...î This means that entertainment allowances paid to employees will be fully subject to FBT. Reimbursing payments will be partially subject to FBT. from page 3 Entertainment as defined includes travel or accommoda- tion to facilitate the provision of food, drink or recrea- tion. Consequently, the cost of travel or accommodation will be subject to tax where the predominant purpose of the expenditure is to facilitate entertainment, for example, where the presentation of conference material is merely incidental to sightseeing tours and social functions. Jurisdictional Coverage All entertainment provided by a New Zealand resident will be subject to the regime irrespective of where and to whom the entertainment is provided. A person who is not resident in New Zealand, but has business income derived in New Zealand, will be subject to the regime for entertainment provided in New Zealand. If that person entertains offshore, the expendi- ture would not be subject to the regime unless a deduc- tion was claimed for that expenditure against New Zealand sourced assessable income. Controlled Foreign Companies and Foreign Investment Funds Entertainment expenditure incurred by a CFC will be subject to the entertainment regime. For the FIF regime, non-deductibility will be followed when branch equivalent income is calculated. However, use of either comparative value or deemed rate of return is based on the valuation of the investment in the FIF rather than the calculation of the entityís income, and non-deductibility would have no effect. Further, enter- tainment expenditure would not be identified using the accounting profits method. Consequently, unless the branch equivalent method is followed to calculate FIF income, the regime on entertainment will not apply to the holder of a FIF. Non-Taxable Bodies Following the current operation of the FBT regime to non-taxable bodies 50 percent of the expenditure incurred in entertaining employees will be subject to FBT, where that entertainment occurs in the course of carrying on a business. Government departments and local authorities will, however, be subject to FBT for entertainment provided to employees and clients or customers. Goods and Services Tax Amendments will be made to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 to ensure that where entertainment expenditure is incurred, an associated GST output tax liability will arise. This output tax liability will be based on the FBT value or the amount that is non- 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Accommodation - deemed to be entertainment where incurred in connection with, or for the purposes of facilitating the provision of food, drink or recreation. The extent to which it is deemed to be entertainment will be determined on the facts of the case. Annual General Meeting - the treatment accords with that for a conference or seminar. Any entertainment (as defined) provided at the meeting will be subject to the regime. Note that morning and afternoon teas provided at a conference or seminar are specifically excluded from the definition of entertainment. Allowances - to the extent that an allowance is paid for the provision of entertainment that amount is subject to the full imposition of FBT. Apportionment is therefore required where an allowance is paid for entertainment as well as for other forms of expenditure. Amusement - included in the definition of recreation, the provision of which is deemed to be entertainment. Board Meeting Lunch - the provision of food or drink at a board meeting will be subject to FBT, not including that provided in a staff cafeteria. Briefing for Product Launch - where the require- ments contained in the advertising/promotional exemp- tion (see "What Entertainment is Excluded"), are met the expenditure will fall outside the regime. In any case, morning and afternoon tea, or similar light refreshments, will be exempt. Business Lunches at Restaurants - will be subject to the regime. Business Travel - will not be affected, although any travel in connection with or for the purposes of facilitat- ing the provision of entertainment will be subject to the regime. For instance, after a business conference a holiday is taken in Hawaii. The cost of the travel associated with that holiday will be subject to FBT or partial non-deductibility. Business Training Sessions - any entertainment provided at such a session is subject to the regime. This excludes the provision of morning and afternoon tea. Cafeteria- specifically excluded from the definition of entertainment. Charity Shows - any entertainment expenditure incurred for charitable purposes is exempted from the changes. For example, a childrenís hospital Christmas party. Tickets to a charity ball, however, would not be deductible as the recipient of the entertainment - the employee - is not a ìcharityî. Christmas Party - provided to employees and/or clients is subject to tax. Client Meals - any meal provided to any person is subject to the changes. Club Fees/Subscriptions - will be subject to FBT. Cocktail Parties - deemed to be the provision of entertainment therefore the cost is not fully deductible or will be subject to FBT. Conferences - morning and afternoon tea provided at a conference is exempt - all other expenditure in respect of the provision of entertainment at a conference will be subject to FBT or partial non-deductibility. Corporate Boxes - deemed to be an entertainment facility and 50 percent of the cost of the box is either non-deductible or subject to FBT. Corporate Jets - deemed to be an entertainment facility on occasions where it is associated with entertainment. Depreciation - any depreciation allowance claimed in respect of an entertainment facility will be subject to the regime. Employee Meals - any meal provided to an employee, whether away from home on business, or working overtime is subject to FBT. If the meal is provided in an in-house dining facility, it will not be subject to the regime. Exhibition - falls within the advertising/promotion exemption if exhibiting goods or services of a business of the taxpayer or another person to the general public. Fashion Parade - any entertainment provided at a fashion parade is deductible if it is available to the general public. Film Critic - expenditure incurred in critiquing movies, i.e., purchasing tickets, will not be subject to the regime. Film Premiere - if open to the general public any associated entertainment is deductible. Free Drinks, Free Movie Passes - fall within the advertising/promotion exemption if given to members of the general public. For example, via a radio give-away. Games Room - if situated in an employerís premises for the benefit of employees half of the cost is subject to FBT. Gifts - provided to employees or clients will be subject to the regime if the gift(s) are in the form of entertain- ment. Gymnasium - same treatment as a games room, if the gymnasium is in the employerís premises for the benefit of employees. Harbour Cruise - the provision of entertainment by recreation via an entertainment facility. In-Flight Airline Meals - will not be subject to the regime in accordance with the exclusion for entertain- ment provided in conjunction with commercial travel by aircraft. Lease Incentives - provided in the form of entertain- ment for example a holiday is subject to the regime. Leisure-Time Pursuits - are recreational activities and are deemed to be entertainment. Alphabetic List of Entertainment Types continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Scenic Flights - deemed to be entertainment as they provide recreation in the form of amusement. Seminars - any entertainment (excluding the provision of morning and afternoon teas) provided at a seminar will be subject to the regime if incurred by, for instance, a sole trader. Shopping Centre Promotions - fully deductible if made available to the general public. Sightseeing Tours - deemed to be entertainment via the provision of recreation. Tickets - to a sporting event or the theatre for instance will be subject to FBT or partial denial of deductibility. Travel - deemed to be entertainment if predominantly in connection with the provision of food or drink or recreation. Wine Tasting - falls within the promotion/advertising exemption if open to the general public. Yachts and Boats - deemed to be an entertainment facility. from page 5 Meals - ï taken whilst working overtime ï taken whilst away from home on business ï in restaurants ï not including those in an exempt in-house dining facility are subject to the regime. Non-Employee Meals - 50 percent of the expenditure is subject to the regime. If the meal is provided in an in- house dining facility, it will not be subject to the regime. Plant and Equipment - deductions for repairs, mainte- nance and depreciation allowances claimed on plant and equipment used for the provision of entertainment will be partially denied. Promotional Give-Aways - fully deductible if made available to the general public. Recreation - defined to be the provision of entertain- ment.

Under this Act the energy under- takings of Electric Power Boards and territorial local authorities (these local authority undertakings are sometimes called ìMEDsî in this article) are transferred to new energy companies. The income tax treatment of these undertakings is currently governed by section†197C of the Income Tax Act†1976. Energy companies will essentially be taxed like any other company under the general provisions of the Income Tax Act. The taxation provisions in the Energy Companies Act are of a transitional nature, and provide for the tax positions of Boards and MEDs to be trans- ferred to their successor energy companies. The original tax provisions were replaced by the Energy Companies Amendment Act 1992 which was enacted on 17†Decem- ber 1992. Corporatisation Process Before discussing the tax implications of the Energy Companies Act (ìthe Actî) it is first necessary to give an overview of the process by which Electric Power Boards (ìBoardsî) and MEDs are corporatised under the Act. The Act itself is an outcome of the Energy Sector Reform Bill which was introduced in the House on 4 December 1991. It was enacted on 25 June 1992 and its general commencement date is 1 July 1992. The corporatisation of a Board or MED consists of the following stages: ï preparing an establishment plan; ï forming an energy company; and ï transferring the Board's or local authority's energy undertaking to an energy company. Establishment Plan All Boards and territorial local authorities (ìlocal authoritiesî) must prepare establishment plans for transferring their energy undertakings to energy compa- nies. They must submit these plans to the Minister of Energy (ìthe Ministerî) by 31†December 1992, for the Ministerís approval. There is provision in the Act for this submission date to be extended to 31†March 1993 with the Ministerís consent. Each establishment plan for an energy company must contain the following main items: ï a share allocation plan; ï a valuation of the energy undertaking to be trans- ferred; ï an indication of any non-voting equity securities to be issued by the energy company to any person; ï an indication of any debt securities to be issued by the energy company to any person; and ï a draft memorandum of association, articles of association and statement of corporate intent. The share allocation plan is to contain the Boardís or local authorityís recommendations as to the persons or classes of persons to whom the voting equity securities in the related energy company should be allocated once the energy undertaking is transferred to an energy company. The plan will also contain recommendations as to what the terms of those shares should be. An establishment plan is not effective until the Minister has approved it. The Minister must approve local authority establishment plans, and may not amend them. It is likely (though not mandatory) that all the equity securities in MED successor energy companies will be allocated to the relevant local authorities. The Minister may decline to approve a Boardís estab- lishment plan. He may also (after allowing an opportu- nity for the Board to submit a revised plan) amend a Boardís establishment plan and approve the plan in its amended form. The major exception to this ministerial power of amendment is in relation to a Boardís share allocation plan. The Minister may not approve a Boardís establishment plan unless the share allocation plan has been endorsed by the Boardís interim trustees (defined in section 4 of the Act). Where a Boardís share allocation plan has not been so endorsed the voting equity securities in the successor energy company must, by default, be allocated on a pro rata basis to the constituent local authorities in the Boardís area. Two or more Boards or local authorities (including any combination of Boards or local authorities) may prepare and submit to the Minister a joint establishment plan which provides for only one successor energy company to the two or more Boards or MEDs. A local authority may also prepare an establishment plan that provides for its energy undertaking to be transferred to two or more energy companies. Formation of Energy Companies Once the Minister has approved an establishment plan, a Board or local authority must form an energy com- pany to which their energy undertaking can be trans- ferred. This company must be formed and registered under the Companies Act by 1 April 1993 (or such later date as the Minister may allow). The sole subscriber for the shares in an energy company on its incorporation shall be respectively a Board or local authority. These shares will be deemed to have been allotted as fully paid up to the subscribing Board or local authority. Where the Minister has approved a joint establishment plan the relevant Boards or local authorities will have to jointly form and register an energy company in which they are the subscribers. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Transferring Energy Undertakings to Energy Companies Transferring Boards' Energy Undertakings A Boardís energy undertaking will be transferred to its successor energy company on a date appointed by Order in Council. The transfer will be by way of vesting rather than sale, so no consideration is payable to the Board by the successor energy company. The Board itself will be dissolved on the same date that its energy undertaking is vested in the successor energy company. Each Order in Council made for a Board and its succes- sor energy company must give effect to the relevant approved establishment plan (including its share allocation plan), and the energy company shall issue shares to the persons, or classes of persons, specified in the Order accordingly. Any shares in the successor energy company that the Board subscribes for shall vest in the persons specified in the Order. The shares that the successor energy company issues will be deemed to be fully paid up, and shall be issued on such terms as are specified in the relevant Order in Council. The successor energy company will also assume any of the Board's liabilities. Transferring Local Authorities' Energy Undertakings Each local authority must transfer its energy undertak- ing to one or more energy companies by 1 April 1993 (or such later date as the Minister may allow). This transfer must take place in accordance with an approved establishment plan. Unless a creditor consents to an energy company assuming a liability of its predecessor MED, the liability will remain the local authorityís. The MED successor energy company must issue sufficient debt securities to the relevant local authority to enable the local authority to meet its former MED-related liabilities. Tax Implications The original tax provisions in the Act - sections 54 and 62 - have been replaced by new sections which apply from 1 July 1992, the same date as the Actís general commencement. This substitution was made by the Energy Companies Amendment Act 1992, which was enacted on 17†December†1992. Tax Treatment of Share Allocations under the Act This part of this article deals only with the tax treatment of the initial allocation of energy company shares to those identified in approved establishment plans as persons to whom the shares should be issued (ìallotteesî), and to the on-sale of those shares by allottees. The ordinary tax rules governing share transfers will apply to any subsequent transfers of energy company shares. Gift Duty Section 54(3) of the Act provides that any vesting or issue under the Act of shares in a Boardís successor energy company will not constitute a dutiable gift. There will be no gift duty consequences on the transfer of assets from a Board or MED to an energy company because the Act deems a Board or MED and its succes- sor energy company to be the same person for all tax purposes. Income Tax An allottee will not be liable for income tax on any energy company shares that s/he receives under an approved establishment plan. The only exception would be where a person receives shares in the capacity of an energy company employee pursuant to an employee share scheme (section 69, Income Tax Act). Whether allottees will be liable for income tax if they on-sell their energy company shares at a profit will depend on whether the relevant charging provision - section 65(2)(e) - applies. Section 65(2)(e) provides that any profits or gains from selling or disposing of any personal property are taxable in certain situations, including when the property is acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it. Because the receipt of energy company shares by allottees arises through operation of statute, section 65(2)(e) would not apply to an allottee's subsequent disposition of the shares. Section 65(2)(e) can also apply when a taxpayer's business comprises dealing in the property disposed of. Since an allottee who is a share trader will typically receive any energy company shares in his/her capacity as a consumer rather than in a share trading capacity, section 65(2)(e) will also not apply in this situation. Generally, all allottees (except people who receive shares in their capacity as energy company employees) will hold their energy company shares on capital account. Tax Treatment of Debt Securities - Accruals Regime Inland Revenue will apply section†64J of the Income Tax Act in respect of the debt securities issued by energy companies under section 48(3)(b) of the Act, so that these securities are deemed to have been issued at market value. This will ensure that the entire amount of a debt security is neither assessable to the holder of the security nor deductible to the issuing energy company. Tax Treatment of Energy Companies An energy company will be taxed like any other com- pany, and will be subject to the general provisions of the Income Tax Act. Section 197C of the Income Tax Act, which relates to the taxation of energy trading operators (i.e., Boards and MEDs), will not apply to energy companies. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Expenditure incurred by Boards, MEDs and energy companies relating to the corporatisation process (for example, the cost of preparing an establishment plan) will typically be capital in nature and therefore non- deductible. Boards, MEDs and energy companies may claim GST input tax credits on this expenditure, except where it relates to the making of exempt supplies. General Rule Section 54(1) of the Act deems an energy company to be the same person as its predecessor Board for the pur- poses of the Inland Revenue Acts. Similarly, an energy company and its predecessor MED are deemed to be the same person for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts (section 62(1)). (Although an MED is only a branch of a local authority at general law, it is deemed under section 197C to be a separate person for Income Tax Act purposes.) Implications The present tax positions of Boards and MEDs will be transferred intact to their successor energy companies. For example, an energy company will have the same balance date and IRD and GST number as its predeces- sor Board or MED, tax losses will be carried over, approved Globo Asset accounts will be unaffected, and the tax values of depreciable assets and trading stock will remain the same. Energy companies will be required to maintain imputa- tion credit accounts from their formation. Section 394D(1)(a)(iv) of the Income Tax Act will prevent any credits arising in an energy companyís imputation credit account where the company pays any income tax on income derived by its Board or MED predecessor. Section 394E(1)(b)(iii) will prevent any debits arising in an energy companyís imputation credit account when the company receives a refund of income tax which was paid on income derived by its Board or MED predeces- sor. The application of the imputation regime to Boards and MEDs is discussed below. Any energy company restructuring occurring after the initial transfer of undertakings under the Act will be subject to the ordinary tax rules. Shareholder Continuity Sections 54(2) and 62(2) of the Act ensure that energy companies do not breach shareholder continuity require- ments for the purpose of inheriting any losses incurred by their Board or MED predecessors. This is achieved by deeming the initial shareholders in the energy companies to be the same persons as those persons deemed to be the shareholders in the relevant predeces- sor Board or MED. Transfer of MED to Two or More Energy Companies Section 62(3) of the Act prevents, in the case of a local authority energy undertaking being transferred to two or more energy companies, the double counting of any losses. If any loss of the MED has been taken into account in the accounts of one of its successor energy companies that loss may not be taken into account in the accounts of any other energy company. Merger of Two or More Energy Undertakings into One Energy Company Two or more Boards or local authorities are permitted under the Act to transfer their energy undertakings to one energy company. There is no specific tax legislation relating to such mergers. The application of the general tax provisions in sections†54 and 62 of the Act in such cases would result in the tax position of each Board and MED prior to corporatisation being combined in the one successor energy companyís tax position. Tax Treatment Where MEDs Corporatised Ahead of Act A number of local authorities, probably in contravention of section 594ZO of the Local Government Act 1974, corporatised their MEDs before the Energy Companies Act came into force. The companies to which local authorities transferred their energy undertakings ahead of the Act are deemed from 1 July 1992 to be energy companies for the purposes of certain provisions (principally accountability-type provisions) of the Act (section 81(1)). Section 82 of the Act specifically validates the early corporatisation of the energy undertakings of the Dunedin City Council, Palmerston North City Council and Invercargill City Council. Section 81(3) effectively prevents a company, to which a local authority transferred its energy undertaking in advance of the Act, from accessing the loss grouping provisions of the Income Tax Act before 1 July 1992 (being the commencement date of the Energy Compa- nies Act). Section 197C(8) of the Income Tax Act places restrictions on an MED using the loss grouping provisions in the Income Tax Act. Section 81(3) deems a company to which a local authority transferred its energy undertaking ahead of the Act to be an energy trading operator for the purposes of section 197C(8) up to 1 July 1992. Section 62(4) provides that the taxation provisions in section 62 apply to the companies to which local authorities transferred their energy undertakings ahead of the Act as if those companies were energy companies. These companies are therefore treated as being the same persons as their predecessor MEDs for tax purposes. Application of Local Authority Trading Enterprise Definition to Energy Companies Under section 61(2A) of the Income Tax Act local authorities are liable for tax on any income they derive from local authority trading enterprises (LATEs). The LATE definition is contained in section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Section 394B(2)(c) prevents a company whose constitu- tion prohibits all of its income or property from being distributed to any proprietor, member or shareholder from establishing and maintaining an imputation credit account. Members of a Board or local authority cannot receive in a proprietary capacity any distribution of income or property. They are only entitled to be remu- nerated for their services in accordance with Part IVC of the Local Government Act 1974. This decision that Boards and MEDs have not been entitled to maintain imputation credit accounts since the inception of the imputation regime is consistent with the policy underlying section 394B(2)(c) and the imputation regime generally. The main policy rationale for the imputation regime was to provide relief to shareholders from the double taxation inherent under a classical taxation system (rather than to give any taxation benefit to the company itself paying tax from which imputation credits arise). If, however, a company has no shareholders who are entitled to receive dividends to which imputation credits may be attached, that company should not be permitted to establish an imputation credit account. This policy is reflected in section 394B(2)(c) and clearly applies in the case of Boards and MEDs who have never had any shareholders entitled to receive dividends. The issue of the inability of Boards and MEDs to maintain imputation credit accounts is quite separate from the corporatisation process and would have arisen regardless of this process. from page 9 Companies to which local authorities transferred their energy undertakings ahead of the Energy Companies Act came within the LATE definition (by virtue of being companies in which local authorities held a majority of shares) up until 1 July 1992. Energy compa- nies were excluded from the LATE definition in the Local Government Act from 1 July 1992 by an amend- ment to that definition (section 594B(1)(b)(iia)) made by Section 10 of the Energy Companies Amendment Act 1992. The reason for this exclusion is to prevent energy companies in which local authorities hold a majority interest from being subject to the regulatory regime in Part†XXXIVA of the Local Government Act in addition to the regulatory regime in the Energy Companies Act. An amendment in the Taxation Reform Bill (No.6) - introduced in Parliament on 17†December 1992 - will bring an energy company which is under the control of a local authority back into the LATE definition for income tax purposes only with effect from 1†July 1992. Those companies to which local authorities transferred their energy undertakings ahead of the Energy Compa- nies Act will therefore always have remained in the LATE definition for Income Tax Act purposes. Application of Imputation Regime to Boards and MEDs Inland Revenue has considered the application of the imputation regime to Boards and MEDs, and has decided that section 394B(2)(c) does not permit them to maintain imputation credit accounts. This means that there will be no imputation credits available from Boards and MEDs to be inherited by the successor energy companies. Introduction This item deals with taxpayers with balance dates other than 31†March. They are required to return business income to their respective balance dates. Background Section 15 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the Act) allows taxpayers with a balance date other than 31 March to return income to that balance date. This concession is subject to taxpayers obtaining the Commissionerís consent, except where they adopt an industry standard balance date (see TIB Volume 3 No.9 of June 1992 for more information). It was held in Taxation Review Authority case K41 (1988) 10 NZTC 348 that taxpayers must return income that is not associated with their business to 31†March each year. Those taxpayers with a non-standard balance date must return business income to a non-standard balance date. Inland Revenue's Position The Commissioner believes that the decision in case K41 applies to all taxpayers and partnerships with non- standard balance dates. This means such taxpayers must return all business income to that non-standard balance date. Business income includes all income associated with the taxpayerís business. In practice this will include virtually all income to a non-individual tax- payer. The Commissioner believes that this includes business interest and dividend income. Non-Standard Balance Dates and Business Income 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Where taxpayersí business income includes resident withholding income, they will need to apportion the resident withholding income between their income years. Please note that resident withholding tax credits are not to be apportioned, but apply to the income year in which the deductions are made. Generally, companies within the same group of compa- nies will have a common balance date. Thus where one company pays interest to another company within the same group and those companies have a common balance date, they will deduct and return the interest to that common balance date. Examples Example A Z is an individual in paid employment who also has a part-time business. The business has an approved non- standard balance date of 31 October. Z will return his income from employment and interest from personal bank accounts each 31 March. He will return the business income, including interest from any business bank accounts, to each 31 October. Under section 15 of the Act, income returned to a 31†October balance date is deemed to have been derived in the year to the succeeding 31†March. Z will therefore make one return of income as at 31 March, which will include his business income to the non-standard balance date of 31†October. For his 31†October 1992 balance date, Z will return his†business income as at 31 March 1993. At that date Z will also return his employment income and non- business interest derived to 31 March 1993. Example B Y is an individual who operates a dairy farm. Y adopted the industry standard balance date of 31 May. Y also has a part-time job driving a school bus. Y returns all income related to the farm operations to 31†May each year. This includes interest on business accounts and interest from the dairy company account. Y returns the wages and any interest from personal accounts to 31 March. Y makes one return of income. In 1993 this will be as at 31 May. That return will comprise non-business interest and employment income to 31 March 1993, and busi- ness income for the twelve months to 31 May 1993. Example C X is an employee of Xtra Ltd, and its primary share- holder. Xtra Ltd has an approved non-standard balance date of 30†June. The bulk of Xís income arises from her shareholding in Xtra Ltd. This is a sufficient reason for X to apply to adopt Xtraís balance date. Once this has been approved X will return her salary, company current account interest, and dividends sourced from Xtra to 30 June. She will return non-business income such as interest on personal bank accounts to 31 March. X will file one return of income as at 30 June. Under section 15 of the Act the business income is deemed to have been derived in the year ending 31†March. There- fore in 1993, X will return her non-business interest income for the 12 months ended 31 March 1993 and all of her business income for the 12 months ended 30†June 1993 as at 30†June. Inland Revenue considers that where a shareholder- employee earns a salary that relates to his/her shareholding, then that salary is derived from the business (company). It is business income. Example D W Ltd is a company. It is a member of the Alphabet group of companies. The Alphabet group has an approved non-standard balance date of 30 November. W Ltd loaned money to another company within the group, V Ltd. Interest earned on this loan is business income and should be returned to W Ltdís adopted balance date. This ensures consistency as V Ltd will be deducting the interest to the groupís balance date. Where money is borrowed to acquire another company, the îacquiredî company must be included within the ìgroup of companiesî as at 31 March in the relevant income year. Application The above comments do not represent a change in the Commissionerís policy. Rather they are meant as a restatement of existing policy.

These assessments are based on parents' 1992 taxable income, and they will apply from 1†April 1993 to 31†March 1994. Liable parents can estimate their income for 1993-94 if they believe it will be less than 85% of their 1992 income. Parents who do this will need to provide documentation to the Child Support Agency to support their estimates. Some liable parents may ask their tax practitioners to provide this information. Employers and tax practitioners who are deducting Child Support from wages and salaries can shortly expect to receive amended deduction notices resulting from this annual assessment action. GST and Bloodstock destined for Export to Asia - Definition of “Consumption” This policy statement amends Inland Revenueís policy contained in Tax Information Bulletin Vol 2, No.7. and Vol 3, No.3. Background Under section 11(1C) of the Goods and Services Tax Act (ìthe Actî), the Commissioner may extend the period of time that goods intended for export may remain in New Zealand. In TIB Vol 2, No.7 and Vol 3, No.3, we ruled that where it was not possible for bloodstock to be exported within 28 days of the time of supply due to the nature of the contract, zero rating of the supply would still apply providing the bloodstock was exported within 183 days (six months) of the date of supply. Discussion The New Zealand Thoroughbred Breedersí Association has asked Inland Revenue to review its policy under section 11(1C) of the Act. We have therefore extended the period of time that bloodstock sold at the annual yearling sales and destined for export to Asia may stay in New Zealand. We accept that the tropical conditions, lack of space in the importing countries, and immaturity of the bloodstock warrant a further extension of time up to 10 months from the date of supply (i.e., the sale). Inland Revenue has also agreed to amend the definition of îconsumptionî contained in TIB Vol 2, No 7. and TIB Vol 3, No.3. In the previous TIBs ìconsumptionî was defined as ìbreeding, racing, or entry into show in New Zealandî. We have agreed that given the purpose for which thoroughbred bloodstock is purchased, a replacement definition of the ìconsumptionî principle is appropriate. Our view is that ìconsumptionî of a thoroughbred yearling occurs when the horse contests a race for prize money according to the New Zealand Rules of Racing. Policy With written application, bloodstock sold at the annual yearling sales which is intended for export to Asia may remain in New Zealand for up to 10 months from the date of sale. (Inland Revenueís policy on bloodstock destined for export to countries outside Asia remains unchanged. With written application, bloodstock destined for countries outside Asia may remain in New Zealand for up to six months from the date of supply.) No change is made to the requirements that; (i) Any request for an extension of time beyond the 28 day rule must be in writing, and be accompanied by a copy of the contract of supply, and (ii) The animal must not be used in New Zealand under the ìconsumptionî principle. ìConsumptionî as applied to a thoroughbred yearling should be defined as occurring when the horse contests a race for prize money under the New Zealand Rules of Racing. If the animal has not been ìconsumedî as defined above and is still in New Zealand at the expiration of the six month or ten month period, GST becomes payable whether the animal is subsequently exported or not. If the animal has not been ìconsumedî as defined above and is still in New Zealand at the expiration of the six month or ten month period, the vendor must account for GST on the sale. When the animal is subsequently exported the vendor can recover the GST.

The tax consequences of this decision could be signifi- cant. There are expenses which self-employed people can claim, but which are not deductible for employees. There are also consequences for GST, PAYE deduc- tions, Earner and Employer Premiums and Fringe Benefit Tax. Inland Revenue is considering the implications of this court decision, and we will publish a detailed policy statement in an upcoming TIB unless there is an appeal to the Court of Appeal. However, Inland Revenue will not seek back taxes if we have accepted in the past that an owner-driver is self- employed. Reminder - Club and Society Tax Returns Inland Revenue sent letters to more than 26,000 clubs and societies in December 1992, to remind them to put in their tax returns. All clubs and societies must file a tax return each year, unless they are tax exempt. Organisations which meet certain criteria are exempt from income tax. Inland Revenue's ìClubs and Socie- tiesî booklet (IR†254) gives detailed information about this. You can get a copy from your local Inland Revenue office, or ask there if you need more information about the tax obligations for a club of society. Companies assessed for an extra $332 Million Inland Revenue investigations revealed that companies owed an extra $332 million of tax in the past year. More than half of this tax arose from audits of big businesses. Investigations of companies with a turnover of more than $50 million a year revealed an extra $179 million owing in income tax and GST. Investigations of smaller companies with a turnover between $3 and $50 million resulted in assessment of an extra $126 million of income tax and GST. Inland Revenueís investigations are proving very cost- effective, since every direct dollar devoted to company investigations last year returned an extra $22.26 in extra tax assessed. Tax evasion is rare amongst companies, but there is plenty of room to differ on what constitutes legitimate tax minimisation through measures such as write-offs and deductions. Companies spend a lot of money trying to reduce the tax they have to pay; this is a fact of business. In return, Inland Revenue specialist investiga- tors regularly audit companies to see that they are paying the amount of tax required under the law. It is part of Inland Revenueís job to make certain that all taxpayers pay their correct share of taxes. Inland Revenue is constantly seeking to improve our technology and approach to company tax investigations. By June 1993 we will have a special computerised system completed, which will help us to pinpoint the most likely areas of company tax avoidance, based on past trends. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Introduction The Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 received royal assent on 21†December 1992. It provides for the collec- tion of loans made to students at tertiary institutions under the Governmentís Student Loan Scheme from 1†January 1992. Collection will be made through the tax system from the 1992/93 income year. Outline of Scheme Most loans are made to students between 1†January and 31†December each year. They will be transferred from the loan manager (Student Loans Management Ltd) to Inland Revenue for collection as at 28†February of the following year. Borrowers will be given the opportunity to object to any amount that is to be transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. Where a borrower has objected, no amount will be transferred until an objection has been resolved. It is expected that objections will mainly relate to possible clerical errors. The Ministry of Education will be responsible for loans prior to transfer. Following transfer the Commissioner will issue borrow- ers with a notice showing the amount of principal transferred and the interest payable as at the date of the transfer. The Ministry of Education will deal with entitlement to loans and the amounts that may be borrowed. The Student Loan Scheme booklet explains this part of the scheme. Students who wish to borrow must apply for a loan each year. Thus a borrower may have a current loan with the loan manager, with any previous years' loan(s) trans- ferred to Inland Revenue for collection. Repayment for New Zealand Residents Repayment of a loan will be solely dependent on the level of borrowersí assessable income for tax purposes. Once this exceeds the repayment threshold ($12,670 for the 1992-93 income year and $13,104 for the 1993/94 income year) borrowers will have to repay 10 cents for each dollar of their income over the repayment thresh- old. Repayment will be required regardless of whether or not borrowers continue to borrow to finance their studies. Example Assessable income for the year ending 31 March 199320,000 Less repayment threshold 12,670 Repayment obligation$7,330 @ 10 c in $ =$733 Pay-Period Taxpayers Borrowers who have had their loan transferred (i.e. the Commissioner holds a loan balance for collection) have been excluded from the definition of a pay-period taxpayer in section 356 of the Income Tax Act 1976. This means they must file tax returns. Inland Revenue will assess any student loan repayment obligation at the same time as their income tax liability is established. Interest Money advanced under the loans is subject to interest. The total interest rate (8.2% for the 1992/93 income year) has two components: ï The base interest rate - which represents the cost to Government of the money advanced (this has been set at 6% for the 1992/93 income year), and ï The interest adjustment rate - which represents the rate of inflation (this has been set at 2.2% for the 1992/93 income year). When calculating interest, any payments made during the year reduce the loan balance. Example Loan balance on 1 April is $5,000 and the borrower makes two payments during the year, $1,000 on 1†May and $500 on 1†June. Interest Calculation $5,000 x 30/365 x 8.2% 33.69 $4,000 x 31/365 x 8.2% 27.85 $3,500 x 304/365 x 8.2% 239.03 $300.57 At the end of the year the borrower must file a tax return. Inland Revenue will then establish the borrow- er's repayment obligation when we assess his/her return. Any payments that s/he makes will be offset against this repayment obligation. The repayment obligation will be credited first to the base interest charge, secondly to the interest adjustment charge and finally to the principal owing. Example Repayment Obligation Calculation Assessable income$27,000 Repayment threshold $12,670 $14,330 @ 10 c in $ =$1,433 Application of Repayment Obligation Base interest (first)$ 219.93 Interest adjustment (second) $ 80.64 300.57 Reduction of principal (third)$1,132.43 $1,433.00 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Note: In the previous example the borrower would have the choice of having the overpayment of $67 ($1,500 - $1,433) refunded or applied in a further reduction of the loan balance (or applied to any other revenue). Interest Write-Off Borrowers who are New Zealand residents for income tax purposes may be entitled to have all or part of the base interest written off in any year that their repayment obligation is less than their base interest charge. This means that for such residents, the loan balance will never increase by more than the rate of inflation. The interest write-off will only be available to people who have not borrowed during the loan year in which the start of that income year falls. For example, a person who borrows in the 1992, 1993 and 1994 loan years (1 January to 31 December in each year) would not be entitled to any interest write-off until the 1995/96 income year, as the start of the 1994/95 income year (1 April 1994) falls in the loan year 1†January 1994 to 31†December 1994. There is a special provision on the grounds of hardship for writing off of the base interest of a non-resident engaged in full time study overseas. This is discussed below. Examples Each of the following examples assumes that the person has ceased borrowing and is a New Zealand resident for income tax purposes. 1Loan balance of $5,000 with no payments made during the year. Base interest$300 Interest adjustment$110 Repayment obligationNil Write-off$300 Added to loan balance$110 2Loan balance of $5,000 with no payments made during the year. Base interest$300 Interest adjustment$110 Repayment obligation$100 Write-off$200 Added to loan balance$110 3Loan balance of $5,000 with no payments made during the year. Base interest$300 Interest adjustment$110 Repayment obligation$350 Write-offNil Added to loan balance$ 60 Income Tax Implications of Interest Write-Off Any interest write-off will not be subject to income tax. Section 64F(7C) of the Income Tax Act 1976 excludes the forgiveness of the debt from the accruals regime. Repayment Deductions From 1 April 1993 employers must deduct instalments of their employeesí repayment obligations, in the same manner as they make PAYE deductions. Borrowers who expect their primary income to exceed the repayment threshold ($13,104) must advise their employer that loan repayment deductions are to be made, by adding ìEDî to the ìGî or ìSECî tax codes when completing their IR†12s. The PAYE tables will contain two new codes: ìG†EDî and ìSEC†EDî. Employees who expect their primary income to be higher than the repayment threshold will use ìG†EDî to ensure that 10 cents in the dollar is deducted from any income over $252 per week ($13,104 x 1/52). Employees with primary income over the threshold will also give a ìSEC EDî code to any other employer, which will ensure that 10 cents in the dollar is deducted from their total secondary income. As the repayment threshold is built into the deductions made from primary income, 10 cents in the dollar is deducted from all secondary income. Example Weekly primary income$500.00 Weekly repayment threshold $252.00 $248.00 Deduction $ 24.80 Secondary income$120.00 Deduction$ 12.00 These deductions from salary and wages are known as repayment deductions. Special Deduction Rates Borrowers whose primary income is less than the repayment threshold but who have other income that raises their total income above the threshold will not use the ìG EDî code. They may, however, apply for a special deduction rate instead of paying in a lump sum on assessment. Example Primary income 1994$10,000 Interest $ 6,104 Total income$16,104 Repayment obligation $ 300 This borrower may apply for a special deduction rate of 3 cents in the dollar to be deducted from the primary income (in addition to the normal tax deductions). continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) 2 Salary (subject to repayment deductions) $20,000 Business income $15,000 Person is a periodic payer 3 Salary (not subject to repayment deductions) $10,000 Business income $20,000 Person is a periodic payer Calculating Interim Repayments Borrowers will have the option of basing their liability on the previous yearís residual repayment obligation, plus a 5% increase, or of estimating their liability. An estimate may be made at any time up to the third instalment date. Example Assessable income 1993/94 Salary 13,934 Business Income 12,170 26,104 Repayment threshold 13,104 $13,000 Repayment obligation$ 1,300 Repayment deductions$ 83 Residual repayment obligation 1993/94$ 1,217 Interim repayment 1994/95$ 1,277 \* Payable (March balance date) 7 July 1994$ 425 7 November 1994$ 425 7 March 1995$ 427 \* $1,217 x 105% Interim Payments when Return not Furnished If a borrower hasn't filed the previous year's return by the time the first or second instalment is due, if s/he does not wish to estimate, s/he may use the residual repayment obligation for the second preceding year, increased by 10 percent. If a borrower still hasn't filed the previous year's return by the third instalment date, s/he must make an estimate. If s/he doesn't make an estimate, the amount of any payments s/he made will be deemed to be the estimate. Voluntary Payments Borrowers can make voluntary payments to Inland Revenue at any time after 1†March 1993. Borrowers will also be able to apply for a special deduction rate in any situation in which the ìG EDî or ìSEC EDî deductions will not represent that yearís liability. For example, if a borrower earns a high amount over part of the year, the deductions may be in excess of the annual liability. Crediting of Repayment Deductions For the purpose of calculating interest, any repayment deduction made from employees will be credited to their loan account on the 15th of the month in which the deduction was made. Example Deductions made on pay days as follows: 6 May 1993$ 30 13 May 1993$ 30 20 May 1993$ 30 27 May 1993 $ 30 $120 Paid to Inland Revenue 20 June 1993 Credited to account 15 May 1993$120 Employers’ Obligations The rules for collecting and paying PAYE deductions also apply to collecting repayment deductions. In addition, when they pay the deductions to Inland Revenue, employers must give us a schedule showing employees from whom repayment deductions have been made and the amount of those deductions. Interim Repayments (Periodic Payers) A borrower whose end of year liability is more than $1,000 after taking into account any repayment deduc- tions (this is the residual repayment obligation) must pay interim repayments by instalments for the following year. The amount of these instalments will be calculated in a similar manner to provisional tax. This regime will apply to: ï Borrowers who have income other than from salary or wages (from which repayment deductions have been made) in excess of $10,000; or ï Borrowers who have income that exceeds the repay- ment threshold by $10,000 or more, if repayment deductions are not made from any salary or wages. Examples 1 Salary (subject to repayment deductions) $15,000 Business income $ 5,000 Person is not a periodic payer from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Where a borrower makes any payment in excess of that yearís terminal repayment obligation, s/he will be given the choice (on the return form) of having the excess payment refunded or applied in reduction of the loan balance (or applied to another revenue). An election to have the excess payment applied in reduction of the loan balance will be irrevocable. Non-Residents In April each year, Inland Revenue will send a non- resident assessment to any borrower who has left New Zealand and ceased to be a resident. The amount payable will be $1,000 per annum (or 1/15 of the loan balance at date of departure if this was $15,000 or over) plus the estimated interest for the year. The interest will be estimated taking into account the payments that are due during the year. The total will then be averaged over four payments, which will be due on 30†June, 30†September, 31†December and 31†March. If paying the full amount of the non-resident repayment obligation would cause financial hardship, borrowers may negotiate a lesser payment with Inland Revenue. Unlike income tax, the Student Loan Scheme Act does not grant the Commissioner the power to remit any liability, other than the special hardship provision discussed below. In any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that hardship would be caused by full payment, the uncollected amount will be ìadded backî to the loan balance. Any request for relief from payment on hard- ship grounds must be made annually. A special hardship provision exists for non-residents who are engaged in full time study overseas. In this case the Commissioner may fully or partly remit the base interest for the period the student was engaged in full time study, if he is satisfied that payment would cause serious hardship. Non-residents who return to New Zealand and regain residency status must advise Inland Revenue of their return. Residents Leaving New Zealand Notification requirements Borrowers who go overseas for more than three months must advise Inland Revenue of their departure, unless they will continue to repay their loans through repay- ment deductions or instalments of their interim repay- ment obligation while away. Repayment Obligation In the year a borrower leaves New Zealand, and ceases to be resident, the repayment obligation will be assessed on the assessable income to date of departure, and a proportion of the non-resident repayment obligation for the balance of the income year to 31 March. The repayment threshold will be also apportioned according to the number of days the borrower was resident in New Zealand. continued on page 18 Example Date of departure 30 June 1993 Resident Assessment Income to 30 June 1993 $5,000 $13,104 x 91/365$3,267 $1,733 @ 10 c in $ =173.30 ìG EDî Deductions 160.00 Payable 7/2/94 $13.30 Non-Resident Assessment $1,000 x 274/365$750.68 Estimated Interest$203.32 $954.00 Payable 30/9/93, 30/12/93 & 31/3/94 $318.00 The reverse of the above will occur if a borrower who has become a non-resident returns to New Zealand and regains residency status. Interest write-off In the year in which a resident leaves New Zealand any interest write-off will be limited to the interest charge- able to the date of departure. Example Date of departure:30 June Interest 1/4/93 to 30/6/93:$300 (base) $110 (interest†adjustment) Interest 1/7/93 to 31/3/94:$825 (base) $302 (interest adjustment) Resident repayment obligation:$250 Write-off:$ 50 ($300 - $250) The reverse of the above will occur if a borrower who has become a non-resident returns to New Zealand and regains residency status. Returns and Assessments As mentioned above, all borrowers have been excluded from the pay-period taxpayer definition, so they must file tax returns. There is a separate form (SL9) for working out their student loan repayment obligation, which they should fill in and attach to their income tax returns. Inland Revenue will make loan repayment assessments in the same manner as we make income tax assess- ments, and the same standard procedures (e.g., objec- tion procedures and limitations on re-opening assess- ments) will apply to them. 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) it will be an offence for an employer to discriminate against a person because that person has a student loan. Changes in Balance Date Where a borrower has a change in balance date for income tax purposes, in the assessment of the repay- ment obligation, the repayment threshold will be adjusted on a daily basis to reflect the more or less than 12 monthsí income. The repayment obligation thus established will be apportioned to determine whether the borrower is entitled to an interest write-off. Example 19 Monthsí Income Assessable income for the period 1 April to 31†December$15,000 $13,104 x 275/365 $ 9,872 $ 5,128 Repayment Obligation $ 512.80 Base interest$ 800.00 $512.80 x 365/275$ 680.62 Interest Write-off$ 119.38 215 Monthsí Income Assessable income for the period 1 April to 30 June$25,000 $13,104 x 456/365$16,371 $ 8,629 Repayment Obligation$ 862.90 Base interest$ 700.00 $862.90 x 365/456$ 690.69 Interest Write-off$ 9.31 Further Information If you need to know more about how the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 applies to you, see Inland Revenue's publications Student Loan Repayments and Student Loans - An Employerís Guide. You can get copies of these from your local Inland Revenue office. from page 17 Payment and Recovery Any terminal repayment obligation (the net amount after deducting from the repayment obligation any payments made) is due for payment at the same time as a borrowerís terminal income tax is due. If a borrower does not make a payment by the due date s/he will be charged a late payment charge. In most cases this will be a compounding charge of 2 percent per month. In addition to the standard recovery powers that the Commissioner has for arrears, he will also be able to call up the total loan balance in any case where a borrower has not paid any repayment obligation as- sessed, or has not furnished any return or information, within two years of when it was due. Refunds, Relief and Write-Off on Death Inland Revenue will refund any overpayment unless a borrower asks us to credit it to the loan balance. If paying the full amount of a repayment obligation (or a non-resident repayment obligation) would cause serious financial hardship, a borrower may negotiate a lesser payment with the Commissioner. Unlike income tax, the Commissioner may not remit any Student Loan liability, other than as set out under the special hardship provision for non-residents who are engaged in full time study overseas discussed above. In any case where the Commissioner is satisfied that hardship would be caused by payment in full, the amount that the Commis- sioner refrains from collecting is ìadded backî to the loan balance. Any relief from payment on hardship grounds must be requested annually. As well as the standard provisions covering refunds, remission of late payment charges and special provi- sions for a borrower experiencing hardship, any amount owing on the death of a borrower will be written off. Offences and Penalties As well as the standard provisions that apply for income tax in relation to offences, penalties and penal charges, 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

S/he received income from a student allowance and from a vacation job. The vacation job involved 30 hours of work a week over a period of 11 weeks. Section 50C entitles certain low-income “full-time earners” to receive a tax re- bate. In this case, the student was not was not a “full-time earner” while s/he was studying, so the rebate was calculated on the basis of the 11 weeks of paid employment. To qualify for the rebate, the student must also be over 15 years old. Reference: HO.TPA035 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Bursaries for Employees Section 61 - Incomes Wholly Exempt from Tax: A taxpayer asked whether the bursary s/he received from an employer was assessable income. The taxpayer attended university full-time whilst remaining in the employment of the firm. The bursary was based on the salary the taxpayer would have received if s/he had been working full-time. Section 61(37) of the Act exempts scholarships and bursaries from income tax. This exemption does not apply where the main purpose for the payment of a bursary is not the provision of education. In CIR v Drew (1988) 10 NZTC 5060, it was found that an employee/employer relationship existed. In this case, the main purpose of the bursary was to secure the employment of the recipient of the bursary and the provision of educational assistance was merely incidental. A payment of this type is not exempt under section 61(37). It is assessable for income tax under section 65 as employment income or income according to ordinary concepts. Reference: HO.TPA044 Charitable Donations made by Companies Section 147 - Gifts of Money by Public Companies: A public company asked what deductions it could claim for one donation of $6,000 paid to a charitable organisation. The donation was the only one the company made for the income year. The company’s assessable income for that year was $100,000. Section 147 of the Act sets out the tax deductibility of gifts of money made by public companies to charitable organisations. In this case, section 147 limits the maximum deduction allowable for any gift of money made to any one donee by the company to $4,000, being the greater of 1% of the company’s assessable income or $4,000. Section 147 also limits the total deduction for all charitable cash donations that a public company makes to the greater of $1,000 or 5% of the company's assess- able income. Reference: HO.TPA060 Tax Treatment of Premiums Paid to an Overseas Insurance Company Section 209 - Insurance effected with Persons not carrying on Business in New Zealand: A New Zealand company asked whether tax was payable on a pre- mium for a fire risk policy paid to an overseas insurance company. The overseas company does not carry on any business in New Zealand. Section 209 of the Act imposes liability for tax on premiums (except for life insurance or reinsurance premiums) that a New Zealand resident pays to an overseas insurer who is not carrying on business in New Zealand. The overseas insurer’s taxable income is deemed to be 10% of the premium paid. The tax is payable at the rate of 38%, and is due by the New Zealand resident's terminal tax due date. The New Zealand company or the person who pays the premium to the over- seas insurer is deemed to be the insurer’s agent. As agent, s/he must furnish a tax return to Inland Revenue's Special Companies section, and pay the income 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) tax due on behalf of the insurer. In this case, the New Zealand company, as agent for the insurer, is required to furnish a tax return for the premium paid. Reference: HO.TPA063 Tax Treatment of a Lump Sum Payment from Registered Superannuation Fund to a Beneficiary Section 227 - Income Assessable to Beneficiaries: A superannuitant taxpayer asked whether a lump sum payment from a registered medical superannuation fund was assessable income. The taxpayer also asked whether the payment constituted “other income” for the purposes of the National Superannuitant Surcharge. From 1 April 1990 all payments made by a registered superannuation scheme to members, whether from a pension or lump sum scheme, are not assessable for income tax pursuant to section 227(6) of the Act. In terms of section 336D(1) of the Act, the lump sum payments to fund members will not constitute “other income” for National Superannuitant Surcharge pur- poses. Reference: HO.TPP076 Filing Annual Nil FBT Returns Section 336T - Payments of Fringe Benefit Tax on Annual Basis in Respect of Employers other than Shareholders: An employer asked whether s/he could file fringe benefit tax returns on an annual basis. The employer had not provided any fringe benefits since commencing employing staff 18 months ago and did not expect to provide any in the future. Fringe Benefit Tax is generally payable on a quarterly basis, but Inland Revenue may allow an employer to furnish an annual “nil” return. To do this, the em- ployer must complete an IR 419 to declare that s/he has not provided any fringe benefits for a 12 month period. S/he must also have filed “nil” FBT returns for four consecutive quarters, or satisfy Inland Revenue that s/he will not be pro- viding fringe benefits. The employer must immediately notify Inland Revenue if s/he begins to pro- vide fringe benefits. S/he must then furnish returns quarterly. Reference: HO.TPA065 Completion of IR 66ES Form for Newspaper Delivery Persons Section 432 - Employers to make returns as to employees: A newspaper firm asked whether it was required to furnish commencement and cessation sched- ules (IR 66ES) for school children or other students employed to deliver newspa- pers. Section 432 of the Act requires employers to furnish commencement and cessa- tion schedules to Inland Revenue for all employees starting or finishing employ- ment. The newspaper firm must complete an IR 66ES with the relevant details for all employees starting or finishing employment after 1 April 1992. Reference: HO.TPA032 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Purchase of Property by Foreign Consulate Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: A foreign consu- late asked whether it was liable to pay GST on the purchase of land for the purposes of establishing a consular building in New Zealand. The land had been purchased from a person who was registered for GST purposes. Section 8 imposes GST on all supplies of goods and services (except exempt supplies) by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity that s/he carries on. Consulates are not exempt from GST. In this case, the consulate is liable to pay the GST charged on the purchase price. If the consulate is registered for GST, it will be entitled to claim input tax credits where appropri- ate. Reference: HO.TPAO55 GST Payable on School Holiday Programme Section 8 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Supply: A GST registered business ran a school holiday programme for its employees' children over the Christmas break. The employees paid a daily fee for each child to attend to cover the costs of running the programme. The business requested confirmation that GST would not be charged on the fees paid by the parents. Section 8 of the Act charges GST on the supply of goods and services by a regis- tered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. In this case, the programme is being run by the business as part of its taxable activity and GST is payable on the school holiday programme fees. The business is entitled to claim input tax credits for GST charged on supplies of goods or services incurred in running the programme. Reference: HO.TPA068 Sale of Commercial Property Between Two Registered Persons Section 11 - Zero-Rating: A tax practitioner asked why the sale of a commercial rental building between two registered persons was subject to GST. Only 10% of the property was tenanted at the time of the sale. Section 11(1)(c) of the Act zero-rates the supply to a registered person of a tax- able activity as a going concern. In the case of the supply of a commercial build- ing, the Commissioner suggests as an administrative guideline that if the build- ing is 50% or more tenanted at the time of supply, then the supply will be treated as the supply of a taxable activity as a going concern (see TIB Volume Three, No.5 - page 4). In this case, as only 10% of the property was tenanted, the supply does not qualify for zero-rating and is subject to GST.

The employment contract provided that the vehicle remain the property of the employer for the period of the contract. Upon termination of the employment contract, the manager exercised his contractual right to purchase the motor vehicle. The employer was registered for GST but the manager was not. The manager asked about the GST implications of the transaction. GST is charged on the supply of goods and services made by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity. In this case, the motor vehicle was an asset of the employer’s business. As the employer was registered for GST and the vehicle sold was used in the course of a taxable activity, the sale of the vehicle is subject to GST. Selling a car to an employee is no different to any other supply that the em- ployer may make in the course of conducting a taxable activity. Reference: HO.TPP063 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Liability for Stamp Duty for Redetermination of Rent Section 8 - Meaning of the Term “Lease”, and Section 29 - Duty on Instru- ments Increasing Rent or Other Consideration under Lease: A solicitor asked whether a liability for stamp duty arose due to the redetermination of rent where this change was not evidenced in writing. For the purposes of this Act, an instrument increasing rent under a lease falls within the section 8 definition of a “lease”. Section 29 of the Act treats an instru- ment increasing rent as a new lease for consideration equal to the increase in rent. Additional duty is payable upon this amount. There is no provision in the Act for the re-presentation of a lease for stamping with further duty if there has been an increase in rent. However, if a new lease is prepared it should be presented for stamping in the usual way. Reference: HO.TPP065 Stamp Duty on Amalgamation of a Regional Council and a Local Authority Section 13 - No Stamp Duty Payable on Instruments of Conveyance to Certain Persons: A local authority asked whether stamp duty is payable on the transfer of assets arising from an amalgamation from a regional council to a local author- ity. Section 13 of the Act contains a number of specific exemptions from stamp duty on conveyances made to certain people. Section 13(1)(k) provides an exemption from duty on any instrument of conveyance to any local authority from another local authority if the instrument is required to implement a scheme within the meaning of the Local Government Act 1974, or for the purposes of a correspond- ing scheme implemented pursuant to any former Act. In this case, the transfer of the assets will be exempt from stamp duty provided the amalgamation of the authority falls within a scheme specified by section 13(1)(k).

Facts:The taxpayer sold properties and invested the proceeds in the share market until he and his wife were ready to purchase a larger house. The share market crash meant that he made substantial losses on those share investments. He was not in the business of dealing in shares. The fact that he bought the shares to sell them when he and his wife decided to buy a house indicated he had bought the shares with the clear and dominant purpose of reselling them. The Commissioner disallowed the losses. The case was referred to the TRA who held that the losses were deductible. The Commissioner appealed the matter to the Court of Appeal. Decision:The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and held that the losses were deduct- ible. The Act allows deductions for expenditure or loss in gaining or producing assessable income (section 104), but section 106 (1)(a) prevents any such deduc- tion for capital losses. The Court considered that this prohibition only applies to losses of fixed capital and not to losses of circulating capital (that is, “the cost of trade”). The Court went on to state that because the second limb of section 65(2)(e) makes the share transactions assessable, this had the effect that the shares were held on revenue and not on capital account. If the taxpayer had sold any of the shares at a profit that profit would have been taxable as profits from property acquired for the purpose of resale (section 65(2)(e), second limb). By making the profits on shares assessable the statute artificially changed their character from fixed to circulating capital. Therefore, the prohibition in section 106(1)(a) would not apply and any losses from the transaction would be deduct- ible. Comments:The Commissioner is not appealing this case.

Case:Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9190 (CA) Rating:•••• Act:Income Tax Act 1976: sections 65(2)(a), 65(2)(e), 101, 104 and 106(1)(a) Keywords:“business of buying and selling shares”, “deductions”, “losses on share sales” Summary:The taxpayer in this case successfully claimed losses on the sale of shares. He was found to be in the business of dealing in shares and had acquired the shares for the purpose of resale. This case was heard at the same time as Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9180, and the judgments in the two cases should be read together. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Facts:The taxpayer was a structural engineer who invested money from an inheritance in the share market. He held the shares for a period of two to eight months. His intention was to make a short term gain on the sale of shares in order to set up a property development business. He made losses on the sale of the shares and claimed them as a deduction. The Commissioner disallowed the losses and a case was stated to the TRA. The TRA allowed the taxpayer’s losses on the basis that the taxpayer was in the business of share dealing. The TRA also concluded that the taxpayer had acquired the shares with the dominant purpose of resale. The Commissioner appealed the decision. The Commissioner did not challenge the finding that the shares were acquired for the dominant purpose of resale but sought guidance on what constitutes a business of share dealing. Decision:The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The shares were bought with the dominant purpose of resale, and therefore any profit would be assessable under the second limb of section 65(2)(e). Any corresponding loss from the transaction would be deductible as a loss of circulating capital. The Court held on the facts that the presumption should be against finding that a business existed. However, as the TRA had not erred in law and had accepted the taxpayer’s evidence, the finding that the taxpayer was in business could not be disturbed. The Court also stated that where a taxpayer has a full time occupation and devotes some of his time to speculation on the stock exchange, it would be unlikely that the taxpayer has embarked on a business. The same should apply to a retired or unemployed person who engages in a modest amount of buying and selling shares. The Court also noted that the nature of income producing activities varies, and that it is not desirable to formulate hard and fast rules. The Court added that whether a particular activity amounts to a business is a matter of fact and de- gree, but recognised that the continuity and extent of the activity was an impor- tant consideration, if not the dominant consideration. It was stated that the activity need not be the taxpayer’s sole or principal activity to constitute a busi- ness. It was further noted that the buying and selling of shares merely to supple- ment an adequate income from other sources or to provide interest or excitement is unlikely to be a business. In order for a person to be regarded as dealing in shares, the Court would expect to find both a considerable number of purchases and sales over an appreciable period of time, and a substantial capital invest- ment. Comment:The Commissioner is not appealing this case. References:Inland Revenue’s policy on losses on share transactions is set out in Tax Infor- mation Bulletin (Volume Four, No. 5, December 1992). Case:TRA No. 88/92 Rating:•••• Act:Income Tax Act 1976: sections 64B, 64C and 64F Keywords:“accrual regime”, “financial arrangement”, “foreign exchange gains and losses”, “hedg- ing” Summary:Contracts for forward sales of a commodity, denominated in a foreign currency, entered into by a commodity exporter are not financial arrangements and are not subject to the accrual regime. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Gains and losses on foreign exchange hedging contracts entered into by the same exporter, which span a balance date, are to be recognised on realisation. This finding applies only in the absence of a specific accrual determination to the contrary. Facts:The objector was a commodity exporter which sold a commodity to overseas buyers. The contracts for sale were denominated in foreign currencies. At balance date the objector was party to a number of commodity contracts under which delivery of the commodity and payment (in the foreign currency) took place at different times after that balance date. At the same time the objector was party to a number of foreign exchange contracts which hedged the objec- tor’s risk that the value of the foreign currency would reduce between the date the commodity contract was entered into and the date on which payment, in the foreign currency, was made. At balance date the objector had accrued “losses” of approximately $500,000 under the commodity contracts and accrued gains of approximately $500,000 under the foreign exchange contract. The Commissioner and the objector agreed that the commodity contracts and the foreign exchange hedging contracts were separate financial arrangements and were both subject to the accrual regime. Decision:The TRA held that the commodity contracts were not financial arrangements and were not subject to the accrual regime. This finding made it unnecessary for the Authority to consider the parties’ arguments whether the accrual regime measured the gain or loss between the date the contract was entered into and payment, or between the date of delivery and payment. The TRA also held that, in the absence of any relevant accrual determination at the time, the objector was not required to recognise the accrued gain under the foreign exchange contracts at balance dates. Any gain or loss under those con- tracts was to be recognised on realisation. Comment:The Commissioner is appealing this case.

Facts:The objector company provided certain facilities, and was accredited to IATA, which is necessary to carry on the business of a travel agency. The “partners” provided some equipment and inputs; chose their hours and where they worked; arranged their own locum if necessary; were not supervised or control- led by the objector; were paid in accordance with their sales; bore any loss due to their own mistakes; shared overheads; used the company name for some com- munications; and their individual names for others. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Decision:Judge Barber decided that the objector was not liable to deduct PAYE. He con- sidered that the agents were running a type of partnership under the mantle of the company. Each agent operated her or his own personal business enterprise, in reliance on the accreditation of the objector company. This was despite the interlinking of their activities. Comment:The Commissioner is not appealing this case.

The losses were deductible. The stolen money, which had not been repaid, was regarded as capital and so was non-assessable. Facts:The taxpayer stole large sums from his employer to trade on the futures market. Whilst some trading resulted in gains, overall the taxpayer made considerable losses. The taxpayer’s intention was to repay the money from the expected profits from futures trading. Only some of the money was repaid. When detection became inevitable, the taxpayer fled to Australia. Decision:Judge Willy decided that any profit from futures trading was assessable under section 65(2)(a). It was found that there was a sufficient nexus between the losses and the gaining or producing of assessable income. The losses were accordingly deductible under section 104. The prohibition against deductions for loss of capital under section 106(1)(a) did not apply. The losses were of circulating capital. (This point was recently con- firmed in CIR v Inglis and CIR v Stockwell. Both cases are noted in this column.) The taxpayer was in the business of futures trading. The taxpayer’s activities were sourced by stolen money, and “tainted by illegal- ity”. This had no bearing on whether the activities could be regarded as a busi- ness. The remaining issue was whether the unpaid balance of the stolen money was assessable to the taxpayer. Judge Willy agreed with counsel for the taxpayer that the relevant question was the character of the money at the time of receipt. The action of stealing the funds did not produce income according to ordinary con- cepts, rather it was a transfer of capital. The taxpayer is obliged to repay the stolen money. The fact that a considerable amount is still outstanding does not, of itself, make it income. Comment:The Commissioner is appealing this case.

Facts:The taxpayer is a company carrying on the business of hiring plant, machinery and vehicles to a crop farmer. These assets were put to use by the farmer in developing a block of land he owned. The taxpayer claimed a farming invest- ment allowance under section 122 in respect of the new farming assets it had purchased. The Commissioner disallowed the claim and the matter proceeded by way of case stated to the High Court. Decision:The Commissioner argued that the taxpayer, having hired the assets out to another person, did not itself use these assets for farming or agricultural pur- poses, and did not qualify for the incentive. The taxpayer submitted that regard should be had to the intent of the legislation which was to encourage increased farm production. Also, the business of hiring plant to those involved in the actual farming should properly be regarded as a farming or agricultural business. This would satisfy the provisions of section 122(1)(a). The taxpayer also argued that it was “performing services” under section 122(1)(b) by the hiring out of plant and machinery for farming or agricul- tural use. The Court found that as section 122(1)(a) provides that the plant and machinery is to be used “by the taxpayer primarily and principally and directly ..... on any land in New Zealand”, the obvious intention of the provision is that it should apply only to those who farm the land. In respect of section 122(1)(b), the Court considered that the act of “performing services .... on any land” includes more than the mere hiring out of plant or machinery. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will seek to appeal this case.

The company claimed under a loss of profits insurance policy. The policy allowed the insurer an indemnity period of 15 months to make an assess- ment of the actual loss suffered by the taxpayer. Agreement on the final amount of insurance payable was reached at a settlement conference held almost three years after the first fire. Decision:The Commissioner contended that the insurance proceeds should be spread over the 15 month indemnity period. The Authority rejected this argument. Judge Willy held that the insurance payments under the loss of profits policy flowed from the settlement of the insurance claim. At this time, the payments were derived by the taxpayer, and therefore should be included as assessable business profits in the income year during which settlement was reached. Before settlement, the taxpayer was unable to make a reasonably accurate estimate of the amount of the insurance receipt and the insurance company was under no absolute obligation to make any payment. Comment:The Commissioner is appealing this case.

Facts:The co-shareholders took money from the till of the company during the years 1987 to 1989 and used it for personal expenditure. Following an Inland Revenue investigation, the company and the shareholders were reassessed. The company paid all income tax and GST owing and did not pursue its objection. The Com- missioner deemed the money received by the shareholders to be deemed divi- dends under section 4 and 4A. Decision:Judge Willy rejected the contention that the shareholders were merely reducing their current accounts with the company. Evidence of this from the records of the company was not provided, and those current accounts actually increased during the years concerned. The moneys received by the shareholders were properly classed as dividends under s4(1)(a). The shareholders were not entitled to a credit for the GST subsequently paid by the company in respect of the “suppressed moneys”. The GST was a liability of the company, irrelevant to the amount received by the shareholders. As to whether the shareholders were entitled to a credit for the income tax paid by the company, Willy J noted that the imputation provisions came into effect in the 1989 year, and postponed making a final determination on the matter in case the shareholders could still bring themselves within those provisions for the 1989 year. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) Comment:We do not know yet whether the taxpayer is appealing this case.

He had his penal tax reduced from 150% to 100% because of mitigating circum- stances. Facts:The taxpayer objected to the Commissioner’s assessment of penal tax of 150%. Decision:Judge Willy was satisfied that the Commissioner had correctly concluded that the taxpayer had evaded his taxation obligations. The Commissioner had also satisfied the onus of proof obligations required by the legislation In his consideration of the proper amount of penal tax to be charged, Judge Willy took into account the taxpayer’s longstanding health problems. The objec- tor had virtually a lifetime of prescription drug taking, which had affected his faculties. Judge Willy decided that the amount of penal tax assessed to the objector was excessive in this case and that it should be amended to 100% of the tax evaded. Comment:The Commissioner is not appealing this case. Case:CIR v Watson HC M70/91 Rating:• Act:Income Tax Act 1976: sections 104 and 106(1)(a) Keywords:“commencement of business”, “start-up expenditure”, “business test”, “findings of fact” Summary:The High Court dismissed the Commissioner’s appeal against a decision of the Taxation Review Authority. The TRA ruled that a full-time employee was enti- tled to claim expenses relating to part-time consultancy activities because a “business” had commenced. Facts:Until March 1989 the taxpayer was employed full-time by a large timber mer- chant as an export sales executive. In his 1988 return the taxpayer claimed travel, accommodation, meals, entertainment and other expenses in respect of a part- time export consultancy venture. The venture involved market research and feasibility studies, and taking leave during trips overseas for his employer and making trips on his own behalf, to investigate export opportunities for other New Zealand companies. The venture was conducted with the employer’s consent. Expenses for that portion of trips spent on his employer’s business were met by the employer. The taxpayer received no income from his consultancy activities until March 1989. continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) At the TRA hearing the Commissioner argued that the taxpayer had not com- menced “business” by 31 March 1988. Therefore, the expenditure claimed by the taxpayer was “preliminary to business” and thus capital and non-deductible pursuant to s.106(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The TRA found in favour of the taxpayer and ruled that the expenditure was deductible. (Case M92 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,565) Decision:In the appeal the Commissioner argued that the Authority had erred in holding that the taxpayer’s business activities had commenced prior to 31 March 1988. Ellis J. held that the TRA’s decision was based essentially on findings of fact drawn from evidence presented at the TRA hearing. This included in particular the evidence arising from the oral testimony and cross examination of the tax- payer, which the appellate Court had not had the opportunity of hearing. The Judge commented that the Authority put a great deal of weight on his assess- ment of the taxpayer as a witness and the Judge was not prepared to interfere with that assessment. The Commissioner’s appeal was dismissed. Comment:The Commissioner has not yet decided whether to appeal this case.

The supply is not an exempt supply and is subject to GST. Facts:This was a “test case” for proprietors of assets used by schools integrated under the Private Schools Conditional Integration Act 1975. That Act enabled private schools originally established to provide education with a special character to be brought within the State system. The controlling authority of an integrated school is the board of trustees, and it is responsible for the provision of free education to pupils. “Proprietors” of integrated schools determine and supervise the maintenance of the special character of the school, are the owners or trustees of the land and buildings, and enter into contracts with the parent or guardian entitling the pupil to attend the school. “Attendance dues” may be charged to fund the obligations of the proprietors for payment of debt, for capital works and improvements, and other charges associ- ated with the land and buildings such as insurance. The operation of the schools, including teachers salaries and educational materials, is funded by the State. Decision:The Court of Appeal confirmed the High Court decision. The attendance dues are paid as consideration for a “service”, and the supply is not exempt. from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) The provision of the land and buildings, entitlement to enrol, and assurance of the special character, in respect of which the attendance dues were paid, were clearly “services” as defined in the Act. The Court noted that the supply need not be to the person who pays the consid- eration. The consideration is “in respect of, in response to, or for the inducement of the supply”. The Court rejected the argument that any service provided was the collection and application of the attendance dues, which is mostly a financial service. The payments were not of “interest, principal, dividend or other amount whatever in respect of any debt security”. The debts, if any, are those of the proprietors, not the parents or guardians. Comment:The appellants have not sought to appeal the decision to the Privy Council.

The subdivision and sale of the farm was held to be a taxable activity for GST purposes. Facts:The taxpayer owned and farmed a property in New Zealand. He decided to live permanently overseas, and began the subdivision of the farm. Three years later, the subdivision was completed. The taxpayer was no longer a New Zealand tax resident. The Authority was asked to determine whether the proceeds of the sale should be subject to GST. Decision:The taxpayer argued that he was not required to register for GST in New Zea- land since he was not a New Zealand tax resident and his New Zealand income was below the threshold figure. The Authority rejected this argument and held that he was required to register under the statute. The taxpayer argued that the subdivision was a one-off property development and fell outside the definition of taxable activity. After a thorough consideration of the case law, the Authority held that the definition consisted of two alterna- tives; a continuous activity, or a regular activity. The subdivision was held to amount to a continuous activity. The Authority commented that it would be rare that a subdivision of land would not be a taxable activity for the purposes of the Act.

This was not a supply of a going concern, despite the fact that the son had previously taken over liability for the lease without any formal assignment. Facts:The objectors were a father and son partnership which carried on a photography business from leased premises. The father retired from the business. The son took over liability of the lease. There was no formal assignment of the lease from the partnership. The son later decided to buy the building to save paying rent. The son claimed a deduction of input tax in respect of the sale which Inland Revenue originally allowed. As a result of an audit of the son’s GST affairs the Commissioner advised that the supply of the building should have been zero rated under section 11(1)(c). Decision:The Commissioner argued that as there had been no formal assignment of the lease to the son, the partnership remained the tenant. Thus the sale was subject to the lease which therefore constituted the sale of a going concern. Judge Willy held that notwithstanding the lack of formal assignment, the father held his part of the lease interest in trust for his son (until the date of the purchase of the freehold). The former lease merged on settlement of the freehold. There was no activity capable of “going”. Comment:The Commissioner is not appealing this case.

Facts:The objectors were a yacht chartering partnership. The partnership sold its yacht to a firm of yacht charterers and purchased a replacement yacht with commer- cial berth from them. The partnership did not market or initiate any charter business in respect of the new yacht prior to its purchase. No goodwill passed with the sale. There were no advance bookings nor was there an introductory period to get to know the vendor’s clients. There was no restraint of trade agree- ment. The basic criteria indicating the sale and purchase of a business as a going concern were not present. Decision:The Commissioner argued that the transfer of the berth indicated that the pur- chasers were buying more than a bare yacht. Judge Willy was satisfied that 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.6 (January 1993) although the assets purchased were capable of forming the basis of a yacht chartering business, no such business passed from the vendor to the purchaser.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Fidelity Fund Levies - Income Tax and GST Implications Summary This article deals with the income tax and GST implica- tions of payments to the New Zealand Society of Accountants (NZSA) and the New Zealand Law Society (NZLS) fidelity funds. These levies are fully deductible for income tax in the income year in which practitioners incur them. This is regardless of whether payment is made in one sum or by instalments over a number of income years. The full GST liability occurs at the earlier time of payment or when the service is invoiced. Background Both the NZSA and the NZLS make annual levies on practising members to supplement their respective fidelity funds. In the last year each society has made a larger than normal levy. Income Tax Policy Paying the levy is a prerequisite for issue of a practising certificate. A solicitor must have a practising certificate to practise on his/her own account (Sections 56, 57, and 167 of the Law Practitioners Act 1982). Although the Accountantsí Society does not issue certificates of practice annually, annual payments to the fidelity fund are linked to an accountantís ongoing eligibility to practice (Section 14A of the New Zealand Society of Accountants Act 1958, and section†11 of the New Zealand Society of Accountants Amendment Act 1963). This means the respective levies are a cost of doing business for practising accountants or solicitors. The levies are deductible under section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976 (the ITA). These levies meet the requirements of section 104 of the ITA whether they are made in full or in instalments. The cost has been incurred as the total payment has either been made, or is owing and will be made. The timing of the deduction depends on individual practitioners' balance dates. The cost is deductible in the income year in which the practitioner first incurs the liability. For the special levies this is: ï Accountants - the income year in which May 1992 falls; ï Solicitors - the income year in which December 1992 falls. For most practitioners this will be the income year ended 31 March 1993. GST Policy The term ìservicesî has a broad meaning in the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act). Both the NZLS and the NZSA provide many services to their members, one of which is the provision of a fidelity fund. Therefore, the levies are payments for services. The levies are not financial services or an other exempt supply. They are a supply by the NZLS or the NZSA to their respective practising members. The levies are neither fines nor penalties on individual practitioners. Each practising member is liable to make payment by virtue of being a practising member. Nor are the levies gifts or donations. They are a prerequisite for obtaining a practising certificate for a solicitor and retention of a certificate of practice for an accountant, so they lack the voluntary nature of a gift or donation. (NZSA v CIR, NZLS v CIR (No.2) \[1986\] 8 NZTC 5,205). The levy is a taxable supply, thus GST is payable. Section 9 of the GST Act deems the supply to have occurred at the earlier time of invoice or payment. Only one invoice is issued for the levy, even where the payer elects to pay by instalments. Therefore, the full amount of GST is payable at that time. The timing of the corresponding GST input credit depends on the circumstances of the individual practi- tioner. Section 20(3) of the GST Act determines this. Those registered on an invoice basis may claim the input at the earlier of being invoiced or payment. Those registered on a cash or hybrid basis may claim the input on an actual payments basis. In either case, the practi- tioner must hold a tax invoice. A practitioner who is below the threshold for GST registration and who has not registered voluntarily may not claim any GST input credits. Instead the full (GST inclusive) amount of the levy is deductible for income tax purposes as discussed above.

We've published this article to help taxpayers work out their employment status for tax purposes; it does not introduce any policy changes. It describes the tests for determining whether taxpayers are employees or independent contractors, and discusses the recent Employment Court decision in TNT Worldwide Couri- ers v Cunningham (1992). A taxpayerís tax obligations differ according to his/her employment status, so it is important to know if s/he is an employee or not. On a related matter, Inland Rev- enue is warning taxpayers against ìopting outî of the PAYE system by calling themselves independent contractors when they are essentially still employees. Sometimes it isnít easy to tell if a taxpayer is an em- ployee. Changes in regulations and work practices may also cause the employment status of some workers to change. Court cases like Challenge Realty Limited and Ors v CIR (which judged commission real estate salespersons to be employees) and TNT (which judged owner driver couriers to be employees) show that even a long accepted status might not meet the legal require- ments for that status. Background In TNT the Employment Court found that an owner- driver courier for TNT was an employee and not self employed. TNT wasnít a tax case, but it has tax implica- tions because the general law determines employment status for tax purposes. In TNT, the courier: ï provided his own vehicle and was responsible for its maintenance and upkeep ï was responsible for all his own tax and ACC pay- ments ï claimed deductions as if he were self employed, and ï had an employment contract with TNT that said he was an independent contractor. However the Court found the courier actually had a contract of service with TNT because the employerís actions showed it treated the courier as its employee. In particular it: ï exercised strong control over the volume, type, quality and location of his work ï supervised him closely ï restricted him from carrying freight for anyone else ï had all ownership rights over the business and goodwill ï could regulate his income (by controlling where and how much he worked). Relevance of Employment Status A workerís employment status has important conse- quences for tax purposes: Payments to employees from their employer are salary or wages, which must have PAYE deducted at source. Employees cannot register for or charge GST for services they supply as employees. Independent contractors ïmay deduct certain expenses incurred in deriving assessable income ï must account to Inland Revenue for tax and ACC earner and employee premiums for themselves and any employees; and ï must meet all the requirements of the GST Act if the services they supply are a taxable activity, and they are registered (or liable to register) for GST. Types of Employment Arrangement Employment status depends on whether a worker's employment contract is a ìcontract of serviceî or a ìcontract for servicesî. A ìcontract of employmentî includes an unwritten arrangement. A written contract is neither necessary nor conclusive as to the existence of any particular type of employment relationship (although it can show the sort of work relationship the parties intended to have). Employment contracts often change as the work rela- tionship evolves (e.g., a worker takes on more duties). The Courts consider how the parties actually work together when they determine what sort of employment contract the parties have. Employees have a ìcontract of serviceî with their employer. Contracts of service evolved from the old concept of a master-servant relationship. This required an employee to be continuously available for service and to accept a high degree of control by the employer. A ìcontract for servicesî applies to the relationship between an independent contractor and a principal. It emphasises the nature of goods or services to be pro- vided by the worker rather than his or her availability to work as directed. Employment Status and Revenue Law Tax law relies on the terms ìcontract of serviceî and ìcontract for servicesî, but doesnít define them. There- fore their meanings depend on the general law - i.e., contract law developed by the Courts and any statutes that apply to a particular kind of work. A person will have the same employment status for tax purposes as s/he has under the general law. If Inland 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Revenue needs to determine a workerís status, we will use the current general law tests. Tests of the Employment Relationship The law uses five tests to determine what type of contract exists. Cases may not be clear-cut and the tests overlap (e.g., whether a worker can work for other employers is a component of both the control and independence tests). This means the results of the various tests must be weighed to find the predominant factors which will determine the relationship. Here are the five tests: 1. Control This looks at the degree of control the employer exerts over the way the work is done. The greater the extent to which the principal/employer: ï supplies the equipment, premises and materials used; ï specifies work content, hours and methods; ï can choose, pay, regulate and dismiss workers; the more likely it is that the worker will be an employee. In TNT, the Court said this was a very important test. The fact that TNT exercised a high degree of control in all these areas (except it did not supply the courierís vehicle) was the main reason for determining that there was a contract of service. 2. Independence A worker who can exercise the following types of powers or responsibilities is unlikely to be an employee: ï work for other people or clients; ï work from his/her own premises; ï supply his/her own (specialised) tools/equipment; ï have direct responsibility for the profits and risks of the business; ï hire/fire whoever s/he wishes to help do the job; ï advertise and invoice for the work; ï pay/account for taxes and government and profes- sional levies. This is the inverse of the Control test - a high level of independence is inconsistent with a high level of control. For example, although the TNT courier driver supplied his own vehicle and did his own tax and accounts, he had little or no other independence. On the other hand, when some independent contractors do work for someone, they agree not to work for a competitor or give away trade secrets. This alone wonít make the worker an employee (it actually emphasises that the worker is usually entitled to work for others). 3. Organisation/Integration A job is likely to be done by an employee if it is: ï integral to the business organisation; ï the type of work commonly done by ìemployeesî; ï continuous (not a ìone-offî or accessory operation); ï for the benefit of the business rather than the worker. E.g., courier drivers are essential to the continuous operation of most courier businesses and are usually clearly identified with their courier firm. 4. Intention This looks at the label the parties themselves and any outside authorities apply to the relationship: ï The employment contract treats them as employees; ï Payment is at regular intervals, at a set rate and PAYE is deducted; ï The worker previously worked as an ìemployeeî for the same employer; ï If a statute treats the relationship as one or the other type of contract. This is a strong, but not conclusive indication of the type of relationship. If the actual facts point to an employment relationship, then simply labelling it an independent contract will not alter the actuality. This happened in TNT. In a clause which purported to override all other aspects of the agreement, the written contract stated that the courier was an independent contractor. However the Employment Court found that the actual conduct of the relationship showed that TNT imposed a high level of control and supervision of its staff that was altogether inconsistent with any independ- ence or initiative on their part. The influence of a statute is shown in the Real Estate Agents' Amendment Act 1992. This was a consequence of the Challenge Court case and allows real estate sellers to agree with their licensee that they will be independent contractors rather than employees. 5. Economic Reality This test looks at aspects such as: ï whether the type of business or the nature of the job justifies or requires using an independent contractor; ï the behaviour of the parties before and after entering into the contract; ï if there is a time limit for completing a specific project; ï whether the worker can be dismissed; ï who is responsible for correcting sub-standard work; ï who is legally liable if the job goes wrong. Usually, an independent contractor agrees to be respon- sible for his/her work. S/he cannot usually be ìdis- missedî, although the contract can be terminated if it is broken. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Consequences of a Change in Status Taxpayers may consider that they have not been using the correct employment status in their tax returns. If you want more information about correcting this, including the requirements for a different status, contact your nearest Inland Revenue Office. The TNT case is being appealed. If the appeal decision indicates that some couriers and carriers should change their employment status for tax purposes, Inland Revenue will not seek to recover back taxes from them if we have previously accepted their returns made on the basis of the old status. We will also issue more detailed guidance on couriers' and carriers' tax obligations under the different employment relationships.

GST and Compensation to Maori Organisations Summary This item confirms that GST is not payable on compen- sation payments that the Government makes to the Maori people for the confiscation of land and the destruction of goods and chattels. History Government Commissions of Inquiry over the years have resulted in compensation payments being made to various Maori organisations. These payments were for the confiscation of land and the loss and destruction of goods and chattels. The payments for land confiscation are payable on an annual basis in perpetuity, but those for loss of property were one-off payments. The question has arisen whether these compensation payments are subject to GST in the same way as Government grants to various organisations are treated. GST Treatment A supply must take place before GST is payable. In the case of a Government grant to a GST registered organi- sation, GST is payable because the grant is deemed to be consideration for the supply of goods or services by the organisation in the course of its taxable activity. This situation comes under section 5(6D) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, which was inserted by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No 3) 1991 to reinforce Inland Revenueís policy on these grants. The recipients of these grants are supplying services to the Government through the use to which they put the grant money they receive. Compensation payable by the Crown to the Maori organisations is payable under statute. It is not consid- eration for the supply of goods or services as no supply has taken place. GST is therefore not payable on these payments. Reference:HO: GST Govt M.1. Technical Rulings Chapter 108 Livestock Valuation - New Self-Assessed Cost Guidelines The Government set up the Livestock Valuation Con- sultative Committee to review the way livestock is valued for tax purposes. In its report, the Committee recommended that farmers be able to value livestock using their own costs of production. The new scheme will be known as the Self Assessed Cost (SAC) scheme, and farmers can use it for 1991-92 and future income years. Inland Revenue has produced a set of guidelines for determining the self-assessed cost for individual farm- ers. These are contained in Appendix A to this TIB. There is more information about the other proposed livestock valuation options in TIB Volume Four, No.2 of September 1992. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Livestock Valuation Changes Questions Raised During Recent Seminars During a recent series of seminars on the proposed livestock valuation changes we were asked several questions that had common themes. Based on those questions, the following information will be of interest to livestock owners and tax practitioners involved with the farming community. This information is based on Government decisions on the recommendations of the Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee (the Committee). Legislation for the changes is in the Tax Reform Bill (No. 6) introduced in the House on 17†December 1992. The Bill is due to become law before the end of March 1993. Removing three year spread of revaluation income when moving livestock to the Herd Scheme The three year spread gave tax relief to farmers moving stock from any other scheme to the herd scheme, and to farmers who were increasing herd scheme numbers from homebred sources. Under the rules applying up to the 1992 income year all animals of a type and/or all mature animals of a livestock type had to be included in the herd scheme if the farmer had adopted that option for that livestock type. Under the proposed changes the requirement to include all mature livestock of a type in the herd scheme will be removed. Farmers, especially those who are increasing livestock numbers, can select any number of the addi- tional animals they wish to be valued under the herd scheme in any income year. Those animals not in the herd scheme can be valued at any of the other valuation options such as National Standard Cost (NSC), Self Assessed Cost (SAC), market value, etc. Example Present rules A farmer decides to increase the number of sheep by retaining 200 home bred ewe hoggets. All sheep are currently valued under the herd scheme. Because of the present requirement to include all these animals in the herd scheme, their value would be assessable income in the income year the farmer retained them. If the farmer so elects some revaluation income could be spread over three income years. Proposed Rules Under the proposed herd scheme rules the farmer could decide to move only 50 of the ewes to the herd scheme in the first year. The other 150 could be valued under another scheme in the first year and moved to the herd scheme in whole or in part in subsequent years. There will be no restriction of the number of livestock moved to the herd scheme, nor the number of years it takes to move all the additional ewes to that scheme. The proposed herd scheme rules will allow farmers the flexibility to move livestock to the herd scheme when and how they wish. The tax impact of increasing livestock numbers in the herd scheme can be spread over any number of years. The current three year spreading provisions are no longer necessary. Delaying the announcement of National Average Market Values (NAMVs) until June each year The current method of setting NAMVs involves a national survey of sale prices conducted for the twelve month period ending on 31 March each year. The Committee considered that this system is unsatisfactory as it does not accurately reflect the value of livestock on hand at balance date. For example, the major cattle and deer sales are conducted between March and May. A survey of prices up to March misses current year sales but picks up prices from sales in the previous March to May period. This methodology can cause serious distortions as happened with mixed-age dairy cows last year. The Committee recommended a ìsnapshot valuationî by livestock valuers at 30 April for sheep, goats and pigs and 15 May for cattle and deer. The weighted national average values would reflect the value of good quality stock ìon farmî at those dates. The Government has agreed that the system recom- mended should be trialled for a year in parallel with a national survey using livestock sales data over the main sales period. For most stock this will be January to May. After the trial an assessment will be made on the valuation method to be adopted. Whichever system is used for 1993 and future years the values will not be available until mid June each year. With the repeal of the trading stock scheme only the herd values will be released each June. Farmers on the herd scheme with static herd numbers will not have a taxable component if herd values increase. The late release of the values will not unduly affect their income calculations. Those who have increased herd numbers during any year will need to wait until the release of the values to calculate their annual income. Farmers wishing to re-estimate provisional tax at the third instalment date could use the previous year's national average market values or current market values. Alternatively, farmers may decide to value the additional livestock under the National Standard Cost scheme. These figures will be available in January/ February each year. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Correcting Minor Errors in GST Returns Tax Practitioners have asked for a ruling from Inland Revenue for cases where they notice errors in their clients' GST returns. They asked whether they should: ï file an amended return(s) for the period(s) in which the error was made, or ï make a one-off correcting adjustment in the next available return. For all cases of this type, the following ruling will apply: If correcting the error(s) will result in less than $50 of tax to pay (per period), it can be corrected in the next available GST return. If the correction will mean tax to pay of more than $50 in a period, the practitioner must file an amended GST return for the relevant period(s). If a practitioner files amended back returns, additional tax will be imposed automatically, though we will consider remission on a case-by-case basis, depending on the nature of the error(s). Practitioners must keep detailed working papers in all cases, which must be available to Inland Revenue on request. More Child Support Deductions being made Inland Revenue's Child Support Agency is now deduct- ing child support payments from almost half of the liable parents who have been issued assessments. We are making deductions from the incomes or bank accounts of approximately 41,000 liable parents, who make up almost half of all the liable parents for whom we have issued assessments. Of these 41,000 people, about 27,000 are beneficiaries, who have their child support payments deducted before they receive their benefits. A further 8,500 are having money deducted from their salary or wages, and the remaining 5,500 are having money deducted from their bank accounts. While many of these 41,000 people have asked for automatic deductions to be made, there has recently been a sharp increase in compulsory deductions as part of the Agency's compliance activity. As a result, the number of automatic deductions has doubled from 7,000 in November to 14,000 in January. This represents a significant step forward in ensuring that all parents meet their financial responsibility to their children, which is the fundamental objective of the Child Support scheme. By the end of January, the Agency had collected $33.7 million since July. This is 55% of all child support payments owing at 31†December, excluding default assessments. Overall, by 30†June 1993 the Agency aims to collect 64% of the amount owing for this financial year. In total, there are 87,750 parents whom we have assessed with a child support liability (excluding default assessments). 55,000 (63%) of these parents are making some contribution towards their liability. Tax Information for Employers Inland Revenue is sending out information packs to over 160,000 employers to tell them about changes in tax administration from 1†April 1993. These packs contain samples of new PAYE forms, and information about the Student Loans Scheme and Child Support. We have redesigned these forms to make it as easy as possible for employers to make PAYE deductions (and student loan repayment deductions, where appropriate), as well as to supply other tax information. Before we did this we researched employers' needs in a nationwide survey, and we have incorporated as many of their suggestions as possible into the forms. Since last year employers have been making Child Support deductions from some employees' wages, and supplying information about the dates when employees start and finish working. From 1†April 1993, some employers will also have to make student loan repay- ment deductions on behalf of some employees. 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Payments made under Restraint of Trade Agreements This statement replaces the item entitled ìPayments made under restraint of trade agreementsî in Public Information Bulletin (PIB) No 138 of September 1985. Background Under a restraint of trade agreement (also known as a restrictive covenant), in return for payment an employee agrees not to compete with his/her former employer after leaving his/her employment. A restraint of trade agreement can take many forms, such as: ï Agreement not to compete with a former employer within a certain time frame, ï Agreement not to compete with a former employer within a certain geographical area, ï Agreement not to use secret knowledge concerning industrial/scientific processes obtained whilst working for the former employer, ï Agreement not to approach a former employerís customers The general rule taken by the Courts is that restraints of trade are contrary to public policy and therefore void. These types of agreements are only considered valid where the restraint is justified by the special circum- stances of the particular case, and the restraint imposed is reasonable. In PIB 138 we stated that we would only accept that a payment made under one of these agreements is capital and not assessable if the payment was made under a valid restraint of trade agreement. Our reason for this is that where a contract is unreasonable and therefore a nullity, the character of the payment cannot be deter- mined by the nature of the agreement as there is no agreement. Discussion We have reviewed our policy in view of the decision in Case L23 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,147. In this case the Taxation Review Authority (TRA) had to consider whether a payment made to a specialist underwater diver under a restraint of trade agreement was capital, or assessable income under section 65(2)(b) ìmonetary remunerationî or section 65(2)(l) ìother incomeî, of the Income Tax Act 1976 (ìthe Actî). The TRA rejected the Commissionerís submission that a payment made under an invalid agreement automatically loses the character of capital and is therefore assessable under section 65(2). The TRA found that the practical and business purpose of the payment and the legal rights and duties intended to be created coincided. It was held that the payment did not cease to be capital in character because the agreement turned out to be ineffective. Section 8 of the Illegal Contracts Act 1970 gives civil Courts the power to give effect to a contract containing a restraint of trade clause by modifying or deleting the offending provision. The TRA does not have this ability. In Case L23, the Authority found that classifica- tion of the payment as income or capital did not turn on the issue of validity. Policy Inland Revenue accepts that assessability does not turn on the validity of restraint of trade agreements. The assessability of a payment under a void agreement must be found from the intentions of the parties in the same way as the assessability of a payment under a valid agreement. In deciding whether or not payments of either type are assessable, we will apply the general principles expressed in Buckley & Young Limited v. CIR \[1978\] 2 NZLR 485, (1978) 3 NZTC 6,271. A payment made under a restraint of trade agreement which is treated as a capital receipt will generally not be deductible to the payer, as section 106(1)(a) prohibits the deduction of capital expenditure. Example Mr X is a specialist horse trainer in Matamata. His father and grandfather were well know race horse trainers in the Waikato Region. In 1992 Mr X was offered a job as the chief horse trainer of racehorses at Follyfoot Farm. Mr Xís employer had an employment contract drawn up setting out his conditions of employ- ment. The employment agreement contains a clause stating that in exchange for the sum of $50,000, for 12 months from termination of the agreement, Mr X will not engage in or have an interest in any racehorse training business within a 100 kilometre radius of Follyfoot Farm. The classification of the payment as income or capital does not turn on the validity of the contract. Where Inland Revenue is satisfied that the agreement is genuine and observed and is not a sham, the payment will be capital in nature and non-assessable under section 65. The payment will not be deductible to Mr Xís employer as it is payment of capital. Reference:PIB No 138 (1985) Technical Rulings 56.9.17 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Introduction This item confirms Inland Revenueís policy on the appropriate basis for apportioning expenditure between business and private use, when an asset has a dual purpose. This is despite a recent Taxation Review Authority decision which allowed the costs in a particu- lar case as a business deduction. Background The Taxation Review Authority recently issued a decision on the above matter. The decision has been reported as case P16 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,107. In the case, a national courier company and its two shareholders were the subject of a tax investigation. The key issue in dispute concerned the deductibility of depreciation claimed by the company for a Jaguar racing car and related parts, and motor racing expenses. The Commissioner disallowed the depreciation and expenses claimed, and deemed the expenses to be dividends in the hands of the shareholders. The taxpay- ers objected and a case was stated to the Taxation Review Authority. Before the hearing, the Commissioner accepted that the company should be entitled to deduct one-third of the depreciation and related expenses, and that the share- holdersí deemed dividends should be reduced in propor- tion. Counsel for the taxpayers submitted that there was a nexus between the expenditure incurred and the gaining or producing of assessable income, which was sufficient to warrant deduction under both limbs of section 104 of the Income Tax Act 1976. The taxpayers participated in national motor racing in order to make the companyís name better known nationally and to induce potential customers to associate the companyís name with speed and efficiency. A Jaguar XJS saloon was purchased and taken immedi- ately into the companyís books as a racing car. One of the taxpayers participated in driving the car at racing events in order to become an element in the promotion and take advantage of any commercial opportunities arising. Company morale was enhanced and there was a spectacular increase in turnover. The depreciation claimed was deductible as the Jaguar was modified for circuit racing and was not registered or warranted for road use. It fell within the exclusion set out in para- graph (e) of the definition of ìmotor vehicleî in section 2 of the Transport Act 1962. The Commissioner submitted that the purpose of the expenditure was to race the car and that racing of the car served two separate purposes; promoting the busi- ness and facilitating the taxpayerís personal enjoyment of motor racing. The Commissioner sought to have the expenditure apportioned on that basis. One-third of the expenditure had already been allowed as advertising and promotional expenditure. The Taxation Review Authority decided in favour of the taxpayers in respect of the depreciation and expenses claim. On the facts, the Authority found that there was only one purpose for which this expenditure was incurred; that of advertising and promoting the taxpayerís business. Comment Inland Revenue is not appealing this Taxation Review Authority decision. The facts of this case represent an unusual situation, which should be seen as an exception to the general rule. Policy Where an asset has a dual purpose, business and private, Inland Revenue will continue to apply its existing policy of apportionment of expenditure between business and private on an appropriate basis. Reference 10.A.3.1 Motor Racing Expenditure - Apportionment Taxation Review Authority Decision 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Accrual Determinations Robin Adair, Inland Revenue's Deputy Commissioner (Legislation), recently signed three accrual determina- tions. A short explanation of each is provided below. The full determinations appear in Appendix B to this TIB. Determination 5B: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G5A: Mandatory Conversion Convertible Notes, made on 7 November 1991. This determination differs from Determination G5A by prescribing a method for allocating coupon interest payments between seller and purchaser when a note is sold part way through an interest period. The seller is to allocate interest that has accrued before the date of sale on a straight-line basis. This amount is treated as part of the buyerís acquisition price. Determination G7C: Futures and Options Markets This determination rescinds and replaces Determination G7B: New Zealand Futures and Options Markets and Determination G18: International Futures and Options Markets, both made on 4 December 1989. The determination differs from Determinations G7B and G18 by: (a) amalgamating the two existing determinations; (b) updating the terminology used in relation to the New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange and its members; (c) adding to the list of approved markets on the New Zealand Futures and Options Exchange; (d) adding to the list of approved overseas futures and options markets; (e) modifying the approved sources of information in respect of those overseas markets; and (f) substituting more relevant and up-to-date examples. Determination G26: Variable Rate Financial Arrangements Determination G26 applies to variable rate financial arrangements on which interest is paid at least annually. Any income or expense relating to a variable rate financial arrangement must be accrued. Determination G26 sets out two alternative methods by which this should be done, and explains the circumstances in which each should be used. A variable rate arrangement may be a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. The income or expense in relation to a variable rate arrangement could consist of: (a) Periodic or coupon interest payments as determined from time to time; (b) A premium or discount on the issue or face value of the arrangement; (c) Fees paid or received in relation to the arrangement. These amounts must be accrued. The methods provided in the determination separately accrue: (a) Periodic coupon interest on a daily basis over the income year to which it relates; (b) Any discount or premium and fees over the term of the arrangement, on either a straight line basis (Method A) or a yield to maturity basis (Method B). The critical factor in deciding whether Method A or Method B applies to an arrangement is the size of the premium or discount (including fees) relating to the arrangement. (a) Method A applies to financial arrangements where there is a small (or no) discount or premium. These are arrangements where the discount or premium and fees (non-contingent fees with a limit of 2% of the core acquisition price, plus contingent fees) are less than 2% of the average amount of principal outstanding over the term of the arrangement. (b) Method B is of general application, and may be applied to any variable rate financial arrangement within the scope of the determination. Method A permits the spreading of fees and premium or discount over the term of a financial arrangement on a straight line basis, in proportion to the principal outstanding. The simplest case of Method A occurs where the principal is fixed throughout the term. In that case, the premium or discount and fees are spread on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement. Method B can be applied regardless of the amount of fees and premium or discount. It requires the fees and premium or discount to be spread on a yield to maturity basis. Since the future cashflows are not known, the actual yield to maturity rate cannot be calculated, but must be estimated. This is done by using the initial interest rate (or price or index) and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. The spreading of fees and premium or discount may be done on either a per period basis or a per income year basis. To calculate the yield to maturity, Method B uses either Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods and G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. Interest is calculated separately for each period (or income year) depending on the actual interest rate applying in the period (or the periods within that income year). 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Questions We’ve Been Asked This section of the Tax Information Bulletin sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that we've received. We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received.

There is a tax exemption under section 61(25) of the Act for income derived by a trust or organisation carried on for charitable purposes. For taxation purposes, section 2 defines “charitable purpose” to include the relief of poverty, the ad- vancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the com- munity. The definition of “charitable” in the Charitable Trusts Act 1957 differs from the definition in the Income Tax Act 1976. Therefore, Inland Revenue makes a separate determination about whether a body qualifies for charitable status for taxation purposes. Even if an organisation has charitable status under the Chari- table Trusts Act, it must get separate approval from Inland Revenue before it can become an approved charity for tax purposes. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Inland Revenue is currently producing a booklet that deals with charities, donee organisations and tax exemptions. This will be available from Inland Revenue offices later in 1993. Reference: HO.TPAH111 Promotional Travel Prizes Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: A retailer, who was offered a promotion by a product distributor, asked whether a travel prize received under the promotion was taxable. The distributor had offered travel prizes to retailers who purchased a particular brand of product during a certain period. The win- ners could exchange the travel prizes for cash. All profits or gains derived from carrying on a business are assessable under section 65(2)(a) of the Act. Therefore, the value of promotional prizes received in the course of carrying on a business is generally included in assessable income. However, prizes will not be assessable income where they are given in kind and cannot be converted into cash. In this case, as the retailer can convert the prizes into cash, the travel prizes are assessable as business profits. Reference: HO.TPAH107 Tax Treatment of Annuities Section 65 - Items Included in Assessable Income: A taxpayer asked whether a ten year annuity offered by a life insurer was assessable for income tax pur- poses. Annuities are deemed to be included in assessable income by section 65(2)(j), or under section 65(2)(jb) as accrual income. However, section 61(59) provides an income tax exemption for annuities paid under life insurance policies offered or entered into in New Zealand by a life insurer, or offered or entered into outside New Zealand by a New Zealand resident life insurer. Section 61(59) applies to annuities paid from 1 April 1990. In this case, the taxpayer’s annuity will be exempt from income tax provided that it is paid under a life insurance policy in accordance with section 61(59). If the annuity does not qualify for exemption, the annuity payments will be assess- able under section 65(2)(j) or section 65(2)(jb). Reference: HO.TPP086 Rural Subdivisions Section 67(9) - Subdivided Farm Lots: A farmer asked about the tax implica- tions of selling a farm property which was subdivided into four economic farm- ing units as part of a subdivision scheme. Profits or gains from land subdivision schemes are assessable under section 67(4)(e) and 67(4)(f) of the Act. However, section 67(9) provides that section 67(4)(e) and (f) will not apply to the sale of subdivided farm land where: • The taxpayer used the land in the business of farming immediately before selling it; and continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) • The Commissioner is satisfied that the subdivided land is capable of being worked as economic units as farming or agricultural businesses; and • The Commissioner is satisfied that the land was sold primarily and principally for the purpose of use in a farming or agricultural business. In this case, profits arising from the subdivision of the farm land will not be assessable provided that the transaction meets the section 67(9) conditions. The Commissioner must be satisfied that the land was subdivided for farming pur- poses and that the subdivided units are actually capable of being worked as economic units. Reference: HO.TPA072 Use of Public Service Mileage Rates by Shareholder-Employees Section 73 - Power to Exempt Employees’ Allowances: A tax practitioner asked why shareholder-employees who travel more than 2,000 km annually were not given the same concession as other employees to use Public Service Mileage Rates (“PSMRs”) to calculate the reimbursement of motor vehicle expenses. He also enquired about the meaning of “factual, verifiable basis” in TIB Volume 4, No.2 (article on page 2). Inland Revenue introduced PSMRs as a concession for employees who don't use their cars for work on a daily basis. Shareholder-employees whose work-related travel exceeds 2,000 km annually cannot use this concession. For these people, reimbursement of expenses must be made on a “factual, verifiable” basis. This means that the shareholder-employee must keep records of the vehicle’s use for business purposes i.e., records, logbooks and receipts. Other employees may use PSMRs regardless of the annual distance they travel. Employees and shareholder-employees are treated differently for these purposes because employees are generally subject to control by their superiors with re- gard to the use of the vehicles. Shareholder-employees are often not subject to the same control. Reference: HO.TPAH103 Deductibility of Speeding Fine Section 104 - Expenditure or Loss Incurred in Production of Assessable In- come: A farmer who incurred a speeding fine while on a work-related trip asked whether the fine was deductible from his assessable income. Section 104 of the Act permits the deduction of a loss if it is incurred in the production of assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a busi- ness for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. Each case must be examined on its facts to determine whether the loss is sufficiently linked to the taxpayer's income-earning process. In this case, the speeding fine is not deductible as the fine is not sufficiently connected with the farmer's business activities. Reference: HO.TPAH125 from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Deduction of PAYE by Home Help Workers Section 338 - Tax Deductions to Be Made By Employers: An employer asked about the tax implications of payments made to ”private domestic workers”. Section 338 of the Act requires employers to make tax deductions from source deduction payments made to employees unless the employees are “private domestic workers”. ”Private domestic workers” are workers employed, not on a regular full-time basis, to work in the home or grounds of an employer. Private domestic work must not relate to any business of the employer. Where an employer does not deduct PAYE from source deduction payments, section 355 requires the employee to deduct it. Since their employers do not have to make deductions, private domestic workers must deduct and account for their own PAYE directly to Inland Revenue. They do this by filing an IR 56 form. Inland Revenue will issue an IR 12 showing gross earnings and PAYE for each income year. Reference: HO.TPA070 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Donations to Childcare Centre Section 2 - Interpretation: A non-profit childcare centre asked about the GST implications of contributions received from parents. The centre asked parents to make a suggested donation reflecting the length of each child’s attendance at the centre. However, attendance was not conditional on the receipt of the payment. Section 2 of the Act defines “unconditional gift” as a voluntary payment to a non-profit body where the person who makes the payment does not receive any benefit in return. For GST purposes, unconditional gifts are not treated as con- sideration for supplies of goods and services. Therefore, GST does not apply to payments made as unconditional gifts. In this case, a child’s attendance at the childcare centre is not conditional on the parent’s donation. The contributions to the centre are unconditional gifts and there is no GST. However, GST would apply if attendance at the childcare centre was dependent upon payment of a fee. Reference: HO.TPA050 GST on Grants Section 5(6D) - Payment in the Nature of a Grant or Subsidy: An organisation asked about the GST consequences of receiving a Crown grant. The organisation also asked whether a body which receives grant money on another body’s behalf and passes that money on was liable for the GST on the grant. Section 5(6D) of the Act provides that a grant or subsidy that the Crown or a public authority makes to a person in respect of his/her taxable activity is con- sideration for a supply of goods and services in the course of the taxable activity. This means that such a grant or subsidy is subject to GST. If the recipient of the payment is registered or liable to be registered for GST, s/he must account to Inland Revenue for one-ninth of the payment as GST output tax. If the grant is made to a person who is not GST registered (or liable to be so registered), that person does not have to account for GST. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) A body which receives grant money (and passes it on) on another’s behalf is not liable to account for GST. The actual recipient of the grant must account for one- ninth of the payment as GST output tax if section 5(6D) applies to the grant. Reference: HO.TPAH120 Time of Supply of Real Estate Section 9 - Time of Supply: A vendor of farm land asked whether the time of supply of the farm land (and liability to account for GST) was triggered by the payment of a deposit to his solicitor. The solicitor held the deposit as a stakeholder until the sale contract became unconditional. Section 9(1) deems a supply to take place at the earlier of the time that an invoice is issued, or the time payment is received for the supply. Where payment is made before the issue of an invoice, a real estate supply is deemed to take place at the time of the payment. Payment occurs when a deposit is applied for the benefit of the vendor of the real estate (for example, if the deposit is invested in the solicitor's trust account for the vendor's benefit, or paid towards the estate agent's fees). However, where a real estate agent or any other person holds the deposit as a stakeholder only, the deposit is not applied for the benefit of the vendor. In this case, as the solicitor held the deposit as a stakeholder only, the time of the supply was not triggered by payment of the deposit. The vendor was not re- quired to account for GST at this time. The time of supply will be triggered later when the deposit is applied for the vendor's benefit or an invoice is issued for the supply, whichever is the earlier. Reference: HO.TPAH123 Temporary Import of Goods for Servicing and Maintenance Section 12 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Imports: A company asked for an explanation of the GST implications of exported goods that are temporarily returned to New Zealand for repairs and maintenance. The com- pany exported goods which were returned to New Zealand for repairs and maintenance. The goods were sent back to the overseas recipient within 6 months of their arrival in New Zealand. The GST treatment of imported goods is contained in section 12 of the Act, which the Customs Department administers. The Customs Department have advised that this case would come within section 181 of the Customs Act 1966, which provides that if goods are brought into New Zealand for less than 12 months they are treated as temporarily imported. In these cases, a deposit equal to the sum of GST and duty payable on the value of the goods imported must be paid to the Customs Department. If the goods are removed from Customs Control within the 12 month period after their arrival, the deposit will be re- funded. Any further enquiries should be directed to the Customs Department at the port where the goods are expected to arrive. Reference: HO.TPA059 from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) GST on Imported Goods Section 12 - Imposition of Goods and Services Tax on Imports: A taxpayer asked for an explanation of the GST implications of importing a motor vehicle into New Zealand from Australia. Section 12 of the Act imposes GST on the importation of goods into New Zea- land. GST charged under section 12 is levied and collected by the Customs Department. In this case, GST will be levied at 12.5% of the value of the imported motor vehicle. The value of the vehicle is determined in accordance with section 12(2) as the sum of: (i) The value of the goods determined in accordance with the Customs Act 1966; (ii) The amount of duty and tax payable under the Customs Act 1966 and the Dumping and Countervailing Duties Act 1988; and (iii)The amount paid or payable to transport the goods to New Zealand and to insure the goods. Reference: HO.TPP091 GST on Garage Sale Items Section 51 - Persons Making Supplies in Course of Taxable Activity to be Registered: A taxpayer asked whether a person regularly holding garage sales was required to register for GST. Section 51 of the Act provides that a person carrying on a taxable activity and who has made (or expects to make) supplies with a value exceeding $30,000 in any 12 month period must register for GST. A person carrying on a taxable activity may voluntarily register for GST even if his/her turnover does not reach this level. A taxable activity involves the supply of goods or services on a con- tinuous or regular basis. Garage sales are usually one-off events held by private individuals to clear unwanted possessions. These sales are not taxable activities as they do not involve regular or continuous supplies of goods. However, if a person holds garage sales on a regular basis, s/he must register for GST if the 12 month turnover exceeds the $30,000 threshold, and can choose to register if the turno- ver is below this level. Reference: HO.TPAH110 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Conveyance Duty on GST Inclusive Price of Factory Purchase Section 41 - Valuation GST-Inclusive: A taxpayer who purchased an empty factory asked whether conveyance duty should be charged on the GST inclusive or exclusive value of the factory. Section 41 provides that the value of property for the purposes of the Act is GST inclusive. Section 41 is based on the premise that conveyance duty is payable on the total amount of consideration paid to induce the vendor to sell. This amount includes GST. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) In this case, the vendor of the factory was registered for GST and the considera- tion for the sale included GST, so conveyance duty was charged on that GST inclusive amount. Because the purchaser was also GST registered, he could claim an GST input tax credit. If the sale of the factory had qualified for zero-rating as a supply of a taxable activity as a going concern, conveyance duty would be chargeable on the amount of consideration including GST at zero percent. Reference: HO.TPAH109 Child Support Act 1991 Child Support Liability when Caring for Invalid Section 87 - Amendment of Assessments: A liable parent asked whether his child support payments could be reduced to take into account the fact that he cares for his sick elderly mother. The Child Support Act 1991 contains a formula to calculate the amount of child support that a liable parent must pay. This formula only recognises spouses, de facto partners and children as dependants for this purpose. The Family Court is the only body which can reduce child support liability to take into account special circumstances, such as financial hardship. In this case, the liable parent may apply to the Family Court for an order to depart from the formula assess- ment contained in the Child Support Act 1991.

Facts:The objectors sought to deduct share trading losses from other taxable income. Decision:One of the objectors had accumulated experience and skill in money manage- ment with a history of similar acquisitions and sales of assets for the purposes of capital gain. The change to investing in publicly listed shares was accompanied by actions that showed that this objector had approached the activity in a busi- nesslike manner. The objectors studied the background of the leading directors and kept notes of the performances of each company in which they had an interest. They also kept graphs and charts of what they took to be market trends. Before embarking on the scheme, the parties discussed it with the Commis- sioner. The objectors were told that tax would be payable on gains, and losses made would be deductible. Judge Willy decided that the objectors were engaged in the business of share dealing. He referred to the business discussion in CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,1809 (CA) and the circulating capital asset discussion in CIR v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9190.

Case:TRA No. 91/159 Case Q9 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,055 Rating:••• Act:Income Tax Act 1976 Keywords:restraint of trade agreement, capital Summary:Payment was made to an actor under a restraint of trade agreement in respect of two television commercials. The actor agreed not to endorse or promote any other type of competitive product. The payment was capital and non assessable. Facts:The objector was an actor. He entered an agreement with an advertising agency to make two television commercials for a client of the agency. He received $25,000 for the first year the commercials were shown on television and $17,500 for the second year the commercials were used. In return for these two pay- ments, the actor agreed to a restraint of trade clause. He would not be associated with the promotion in New Zealand of any product or brand of good which was similar to, or in competition with, the type of good he had advertised. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Decision:Judge Willy found that the advertising agency and client wished to obtain the actor’s services for two years clear of competition from any other manufacturer of a similar product. The Judge held that the restraint of trade clause was the fullest possible restraint which the client sought to obtain from the objector. The Judge referred to Public Information Bulletin No 138 and held that the payment, less $5,000 acting fee, was clearly capital in nature. Comments:Inland Revenue is appealing this decision. References:Technical Rulings Chapter 56.9.17 Case:Brierley Investments Ltd v Bouzaid & Henry HC Wellington CP 352/89 - McGechan J Rating:••••• Keywords:administrative law, judicial review, fairness, legitimate expectations Summary:Brierley Investments Ltd applied unsuccessfully on grounds of administrative “unfairness” for judicial review. They sought review of Inland Revenue's deci- sion to re-examine the use of their longstanding tax accounting formulae. The Court held that there were circumstances in which judicial review could be available. It held that BIL had failed to prove unfairness or error on the facts. Facts:The Respondents represent the Commissioner of Inland Revenue, (“CIR”). The Applicant, Brierley Investments Limited, (“BIL”), alleged that formulae relating to deductibility and capital/revenue apportionment were agreed with the Com- missioner, (or at least that the Commissioner accepted their use), and BIL relied upon them as future guidelines. The Commissioner contended that any agree- ment related to specific income years only. The Commissioner wished to review the use of the formulae before 1990, and to determine a suitable future basis for assessment. In 1969 BIL consulted extensively with Inland Revenue. An “agreed basis” was reached for determining the deductibility of interest and other expenditure for the income years between 1963-1967. BIL has continued to rely on this basis since 1969. An investigation between 1970-73 led to a decision by Inland Revenue to use a further “agreed basis” to determine capital and income on the disposal of shares. Inland Revenue issued amended assessments for the years 1964-1970, applying this formula. BIL objected, but did not ultimately pursue the objection. Between 1975 and 1986 BIL used both formulae for tax accounting purposes. There was no critical examination of the returns. Contact between BIL and Inland Revenue took place at a purely administrative level, and was routine and low-key. In 1987, an inspector made an investigation of BIL aimed at other specific issues. While some discussion of the formulae took place, it was not the focus of the inspector’s inquiry, and she did not confirm the validity of the general approach to deductibility questions. In 1988, Inland Revenue notified BIL of their intention to investigate the com- pany. In 1989 they confirmed unrestricted investigations would be carried out over the years before 1990. The investigations would include a review of the use of the formulae. BIL objected to the scope of the investigations, including the review of the formulae, which they claimed they were entitled to use before 1990. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) from page 19 Decision:BIL argued, principally on the basis of administrative “fairness” that the Com- missioner could not reopen the question of the right to use those formulae. BIL considered that they had consistently applied the formulae approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner had acted inconsistently with representations made, and it was “unfair” that the Commissioner was attempting to deprive BIL of the expectation that the formulae would continue to be applied for the years before 1990. BIL accepted that the investigation could examine the proper appli- cation of the formulae in those years. Mr Justice McGechan held that the remedy of judicial review could be available in the course of reaching an assessment where discretion were being exercised. He drew the distinction between challenging the use of discretion, (powers), in the pre-assessment process, where judicial review is available; and the assess- ment situation, where judicial review is not available and the Commissioner is acting under a mandatory statutory duty. He held that the Commissioner's duty to act fairly may well extend beyond the area of breach of contract or breach of representations, to the defeat of legitimate expectations. After reviewing the facts, His Honour held that BIL had failed to prove that there was an agreed basis or representation establishing either formula. The Commissioner made no clear statement to BIL, nor was there such a representa- tion. There was no basis for constructing a legitimate expectation. BIL failed to prove unfairness or error. BIL chose to take a business risk not to obtain a writ- ten confirmation of its assumptions. That risk came home. The findings of fact meant that the authorities relating to judicial review in cases of “unfairness” did not need to be explored. His Honour referred to a number of cases in which the need for both full disclosure by a taxpayer, and a clear or explicit ruling by Inland Revenue were required before a binding commitment would arise. Comments:The taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Case:TRA No. 89/230 Rating:••• Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Sections 2,6,8,9,10,14,20,24,26 Keywords:GST liability for consultant’s commission Summary:The objector was liable for GST on his commission on consultancy services for assisting in the sale of a rural landfill property. Facts:The objector arranged convoluted transactions for the sale of a rural landfill property at a price of $4,922,700. He had paid $160,000 for the property less than a year earlier. The process of arranging the sale transaction continued for at least 3 months. On settlement, the objector became entitled to a “commission” of $500,000: $50,000 in cash, and a sub-mortgage of $450,000 against the vendor’s second mortgage over the property. He never received the $450,000. Decision:The major issue was whether the objector was liable to GST on this service of arranging the sale. Judge Barber decided the objector was liable. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) Judge Barber rejected the objector’s argument that his involvement in the sale was not a taxable activity. The services were carried on continuously or regularly over an appreciable period, and involved several steps and arrangements. He also rejected the argument that as the services were carried out under a written contract of service they were exempt under section 6(3)(b). Instead of finding any evidence of a contract of employment or service, he found that the objector was retained as some type of consultant or commission agent. He also rejected the argument that the arrangements comprised an exempt financial transaction under section 14, as a supply of financial services. He found that the objector received the commission for arranging the sale, not for arrang- ing finance for the purchase. The fact that the objector did not receive the $450,000 balance of his commission was not relevant, as the sub-mortgage for that amount comprised part of the consideration for his services. The objector could not obtain a bad debt deduction for the $450,000 as he had not fulfilled the requirements of section 26. He had not furnished a return or accounted for the output tax as required, nor proved that he had written off the amount as a bad debt. He had capitalised the debt at settlement, so it was a capital loss, and not a bad debt. The Commissioner’s assessments were also largely confirmed in relation to the lesser issues. The objector had not complied with the invoicing requirements of section 24, and was unable to prove that various amounts were not part of a taxable activity. Comments:The taxpayer is appealing this decision.

Facts:The taxpayer is a branch of a Christian church. The taxpayer operates a childcare centre for which it receives grants from the Education Department and the Department of Social Welfare. The childcare centre operated on a break even basis and the taxpayer set the fees to achieve this aim. The Government grants originally subsidised the staff wages. However from February 1990 the grants changed to an all-encompassing subsidy for the gen- eral operation of the childcare centre and for the upgrading of the facilities. The taxpayer considered such grants were exempt of GST. Inland Revenue disagreed and issued assessments for the periods ending 31 October 1986 to 31 August 1990. The taxpayer objected to the assessments on 21 December 1990. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act (No.3) 1991 amended section 5 by inserting section 5(6D). Before this amendment, there was no GST liability on governmental grants or subsidies to a non profit body for the supply of goods and services to others. Section 5(6D) now imposes a liability for GST on govern- mental grants or subsidies paid to non profit bodies, where they carry on a taxable activity in supplying goods and services to others. This section deems the grants and subsidies to be consideration for the supply of goods and serv- ices. This new section had no effect on any taxable period for which a taxpayer had lodged an objection before 19 December 1990. Decision:Barber DJ concluded that the Departments of Education and Social Welfare were clearly “Public Authorities” within the meaning of the Act, and that section 5(6D) applied to the grants received by the taxpayer. The date an objection is lodged with Inland Revenue is the date on which Inland Revenue receives the objection. In this case, we received the objection after the prescribed date so section 5(6D) will apply. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision.

The High Court dismissed the appeal. Facts:The applicant was assessed to pay child support of $297.10 per month, under section 29 of the Act. She sought a departure order under section 106 to reduce her contribution to the minimum figure prescribed by section 29, $520 per annum. The applicant owns the former family home. The property is worth $165,000 and there is a mortgage on the property for $38,000. The applicant gave evidence that although she lived modestly and worked two jobs she was unable to make ends meet. She incurred a weekly deficit of $35. The Family Court Judge stated that he was unable to conclude that “special circumstances” existed or that the applicant had made out either of the grounds in s105(a)(iii) (A) or (c)(i). The Judge held that the necessary commitments of the applicant did not significantly reduce her capacity to provide financial support. The commitments towards the house were not wholly necessary in the sense that the applicant did not require a property of that scale. The Judge also held that the formula assessment did not result in an unjust and inequitable determi- nation of the level of financial support to be provided by the applicant. This was because the house was costing the applicant more than was required to provide from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 (March 1993) her with a reasonable level of accommodation. Alternatively, the house could be used as a source of additional income. Decision:The applicant argued that the Family Court Judge had misinterpreted or misapplied the special circumstances requirements and that he had misdirected himself as to the objects of the Act. The High Court dismissed the appeal. The High Court agreed with the Family Court Judge’s interpretation of the legisla- tion and held that one of the objectives of the legislation is to induce parents to alter their priorities. The High Court held that where income is insufficient to meet outgoings, unless there is something more to take the case out of the ordi- nary, this will not fulfil the requirements of “special circumstances”. Comments:We do not know whether the taxpayer will appeal this decision. References:Technical Rulings Chapter 64 Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 Case:Estate R.E. Turner v CIR High Court M43/92 Rating:•• Act:Estate & Gift Duties Act 1968 - Sections 7, 26, 92 Keywords:Dutiable estate; Passing of property; Contingency; Jersey customary law Summary:A widow was the sole beneficiary and administrix of her husband’s estate. She claimed that the Commissioner should have deducted the value of her dower rights over her husband’s land on the island of Jersey from the dutiable estate. Facts:Under Jersey law, there is a customary dower right. Under this right, the widow has a right to the life enjoyment of one third of her husband’s real property owned at the time of his death. The Commissioner assessed the husband’s estate for estate duty on the whole value of land on the island. The widow objected on the basis that the value of her dower rights should not have been taken as part of the dutiable estate. Decision:Under the legislation, the dutiable estate of a deceased person includes all prop- erty that passes under his/her will or intestacy. The Court held that the property that passed in this case included the deceased’s interest in the land on Jersey, but subject to the widow’s customary dower right under the Land Law of Jersey. An opinion from Jersey solicitors was tendered by the administrix (and accepted by the Commissioner and the Judge) as evidence that the Law of Jersey treated such a dower right as a legal (or equitable) interest in property. This right arose on the deceased’s death, was quantified in law and protected by a legal charge. The appeal was allowed. It was held that the Commissioner should deduct the value of the widow’s right from the dutiable estate. Comments:Inland Revenue has not decided whether to appeal this decision.

The Government accepted this recommendation. The following Guidelines set out the new valuation method. Farmers can use this method for 1991-92 and following income years. All legislative references in this Appendix refer to the Taxation Reform Bill (No.6) 1992, which is currently before Parliament. This Bill is due to be passed into law before the end of March 1993. 2.Introduction Any taxpayer may value inventory on hand at the end of an income year at its cost. These guidelines explain how to work out the cost of production for sheep, cattle, deer and goats. The methods are the same as those used to establish National Standard Costs (section 86C of the Income Tax Act), except that they use costs derived from the taxpayer's own costs of production. These guidelines relate directly to section 86B of the Income Tax Act. These Guidelines set out the method for sheep, cattle, deer and goats. Similar guidelines for establishing a cost of production for pigs will be released separately. 3.Summary of Guidelines These are the main steps in the method for determining the production cost of sheep, cattle, deer and goats: 1.Identify and specify the direct costs of livestock production, and assign identifiable costs to each particular livestock type. 2.Calculate the total farm livestock units (LSUs). 3.Apportion the undivided direct costs of livestock production between the livestock types. Do this based on the proportion of LSUs associated with each type and age grouping of livestock. 4.Use dual product multipliers to allocate some of the costs to the production of wool, fibre, milk or velvet. 5.Include the costs of livestock purchased. 6.Calculate an average cost per head and use it to value that year’s intake of stock in each age group- ing on hand at the end of the income year. Where mature livestock of mixed ages and intake years are valued at cost, you will need an inventory system to account for livestock over their lifetime on the farm. You can get forms from any Inland Revenue office to help with calculating the cost of livestock production. These forms are all reproduced at the end of this Appendix. Later in the year we will also develop computerised spreadsheets for this purpose. 4.Direct costs of livestock production 4.1Costs to be Taken into Account Taxpayers can take into account all tax deductible costs of production and business operation on a farm when determining the cost of livestock production. These include depreciation, but exclude taxation and any capital expenditure. However, taxpayers may exclude certain categories of costs, and apportion other costs between livestock and non-livestock enterprises. This is known as partial absorption costing (PAC), and it is used for inventory costings in other sectors. The costs that taxpayers can exclude from the total deductible farm costs in any year are: •Costs of harvesting and selling livestock products (e.g., shearing expenses, milking expenses, labour associated with these activities, velvet harvesting) •Costs of producing, harvesting and selling non- livestock production, where these costs are clearly identified (e.g., cash crop expenses, forestry or horticultural expenses, costs associated with a separate business such as contracting, poultry, fitch farming or horse breeding) •Repairs and maintenance of all farm buildings except buildings associated with pig production •Depreciation on all farm buildings •Depreciation and repairs and maintenance on plant primarily used in producing secondary (dual) livestock products or non livestock enterprises (e.g., depreciation on milking machines, shearing plant, machinery used in crop production) •Outward freight from the farm •Deductible share of car expenses •Accounting and legal fees, consultancy fees, rates and general farm (non livestock) insurance •Interest, rent and bailment fees (Note that the lease of livestock, but not the bailment of livestock, is included in partial absorption costs.) •Livestock purchase costs (these are treated sepa- rately within the cost of production formulae.) 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 •Imputed costs of labour or livestock depreciation (other than actual depreciation associated with the High Priced Livestock Scheme) •The livestock owner may apportion the cost of wages, salary or management fees paid (which are tax-deductible) over all the farming operation on a fair and reasonable basis. This would apply regard- less of whether the payment was made to an indi- vidual, a partner, a shareholder-employee or anyone else. These expenses could be apportioned to the following activities: -activities excluded from partial absorption costs, such as accounting and administration; -other farm enterprises, such as forestry and cropping (see “Allocation of Costs to Non- Livestock Enterprises” below); -specified livestock production Partial absorption costs worked out by excluding the above expenses can be classified as direct production costs, since they don't include the overhead costs of operating a farm business. This net cost represents the minimum cost of producing livestock; it must be included in the total livestock production costs. A livestock owner can also choose to include any or all of the above costs. 4.2Allocating Specific Costs to Livestock Types If any costs included in the partial absorption cost total clearly belong to one group or type of livestock, the taxpayer should allocate these costs directly to that livestock group. Costs such as stud fees for a sheep flock should be assigned directly to the rising one year group of sheep. All pig production costs should be assigned directly to pigs. Allocating these specific costs directly will reduce the total of partial absorption costs which must be shared between the livestock types. Taxpayers should allocate all livestock purchase costs directly to the age group and type of livestock con- cerned. The only exception is the cost of breeding sires, if the taxpayer is using the herd scheme for any live- stock of that type. When a taxpayer is using the herd scheme for a livestock type, s/he must include all breeding sires of that type in the herd scheme unless they are subject to the high-priced livestock scheme. The forms provided by Inland Revenue have specific sections for the costs directly allocated to any livestock type, including the cost of any stock purchases. Show all other costs which are to be included in column one of Form One (Undivided Partial Absorption Costs Form). This form is reproduced at the back of this Appendix. 4.3Allocating Costs to Non-Livestock Enterprises Many farms have enterprises which are not related to livestock farming (e.g., cash cropping and forestry). Although these guidelines allow exclusion of identifi- able costs associated with these enterprises, some of the costs are not separately recorded. These may include vehicle expenses, fertiliser, wages, repairs and mainte- nance, etc. Taxpayers should allocate these costs between the livestock and non livestock enterprises on a fair and reasonable basis. This approach includes allocation based on logbooks and other records, or allocation on an area basis (e.g., where 20 hectares of cash crops are grown on a 100 hectare farm, then 20% of the undi- vided costs may be allocated to cash cropping). Alloca- tion on the basis of gross receipts will not be accepted. Once a taxpayer has settled on an allocation basis, s/he can make an adjustment to the cost categories con- cerned in column three of Form One (reproduced at the back of this Appendix). A taxpayer cannot apportion PAC costs on a crop s/he is producing for consumption by livestock on the farm (e.g., hay, silage, feed grain crops). If a taxpayer is carrying forward feed supplies (other than growing feed crops) to a future income year s/he can apportion the costs of those supplies, providing the supplies are valued in the end of year accounts. 4.4Example of an Undivided Partial Absorption Costing Form One excludes any costs allocated directly to a livestock type, or which are allowed as exclusions from the costings as listed under “Costs to be Taken into Account” above. Taxpayers can record details of adjustments made (including actual exclusions, assign- ment of specific costs, private use adjustments, and the method for allocating costs to non livestock enterprises) on the back of this form. Keeping details of the basis for any allocations will maintain consistency between years, and will help with any questions during an Inland Revenue audit. Taxpayers can expand the expenditure categories on the form to incorporate any other cost items which should be included, and any other additional categories which they wish to include. There is an example of Form One completed for a hypothetical farm on pages 4 and 5. 5.Apportioning Costs between Livestock Types Section 3 of this appendix sets out Guidelines for identifying the costs of producing livestock. •Specific costs associated with particular livestock types should be directly assigned to those types. •Specific costs associated with non-livestock produc- ing enterprises or activities should be removed from the livestock costs. •Costs that arise partly from livestock activities and partly from non-livestock activities should be continued on page 6 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 Undivided Partial Absorption Costs (Form One) Farm: Example FarmYear Ending: 31 March 1993 Farm ExpensesAmountPrivate UseAllocated toCommentAdjusted PAC (Business only)AdjustmentLivestock $Y/N%$ Wages10,000N85Crop and Forest 15%8,500 Managerial salary5,000N502,500 Animal health2,100N1002,100 Breeding (general)100N100100 Electricity1,200Y90Crop 10%1,080 Feed purchased2,000N1002,000 Hay making400N100400 Silage making3,000N1003,000 Feed crops grownN0 Fertilser9,500N90Crop 10%8,550 Lime200N100All pastoral200 Seeds400N100Crops excluded400 Freight inwards800N100Estimated800 Weed and pest500N100Excludes crop500 Vehicles4,000Y85Crop and forest 15%3,400 Fuel2,700Y85Crop and forest 15%2,295 Repair.maintenance5,500N85Crop and forest 15%4,675 Administration0N00 Livestock insurance500N100Not split by type500 Depreciation1,400N100Pastoral only1,400 Other: (1)New fence1,400N100Deduction claimed1,400 (2)Scrub clearance600N100Deduction claimed600 (3)Contracts600NForestry Exp.100 (4) (5) (6) Total$51,900$44,500 (PAC) Completed example of Form One.

This will leave a total undivided cost which is the Partial Absorption Cost of producing livestock - shown as total \[PAC\] on the form. This undivided \[PAC\] must be apportioned between the specific livestock types and age groupings for sheep, cattle, deer, goats and any other livestock owned or grazed for which a livestock unit conversion is available (e.g., horses). The system of apportioning production costs to the different livestock types (sheep, cattle, deer and goats) is based on the equal treatment of these livestock types. The assumption underlying this approach is that specific livestock of these types and ages can be expressed in terms of LSUs. This is the widely accepted method of measuring farm carrying capacities and performance, and overcomes difficulties in comparing different types of livestock. The common definition of a LSU is: One LSU is equivalent to one ewe producing one lamb to weaning age and an average of 5 kg of wool. It has a live weight of about 55kg and, on average, consumes 520 kg of DM per year in achieving its production cycle. Based on this definition of a livestock unit, conversions are made for all other ages, types and classes of speci- fied livestock. See Form Two at the back of this Appen- dix for a full list of these coefficients. 5.1Calculating Livestock Units and Numbers You can use Form Two (reproduced at the back of this Appendix) to calculate the LSU equivalents for live- stock. There is a completed example of this form on pages 8 and 9. The main points of the method are: 1.The layout of the form is important in calculating the number of livestock units associated with growing livestock. 2.You should use the preset livestock unit coefficients unless you have a good case for adopting different indices (These are detailed on the third page of Form Two at the back of this Appendix). 3.Taxpayers do not have to assign livestock units to purchased livestock except in such circumstances where this treatment seriously distorts the allocation of costs between livestock types. However, taxpay- ers may allocate a proportion of the full livestock unit coefficient according to the time they keep purchased livestock on the farm in an income year. 4.There is a livestock unit coefficient for dairy-bred bobby calves which are purchased and reared. This coefficient accounts for the period between purchase and weaning, after which there is no further allocation required (this is consistent with the treatment of other purchased livestock). Taxpayers must include dairy bred bobby calves that they purchase in the beef cattle section of Form Two. 5.Taxpayers may assign livestock units to non- specified livestock carried on the farm (e.g., horses). Any livestock which is grazed but not owned should also be included, with an adjustment to livestock units to account for the proportion of the year they were on the farm. 6.Homebred rising one year stock are counted on a survival to sale basis. 7.For each specified livestock type included in Form Two, the totals calculated represent the following: Total \[A\]is the number of rising one year stock which passed through the farm that year. Total \[B\]is the number of growing livestock older than one year, plus other adult stock purchases which passed through the farm that year (total \[BB\] is a separate total for rising three year male non-breeding beef cattle) Total \[C\]is the total LSUs associated with rising one year stock in that year. Total \[D\]is the total LSUs associated with growing livestock older than one year in that year. (Total \[DD\] is a separate total for rising three year male non-breeding beef cattle) Total \[E\]is the total LSUs carried on the farm in that year. These are the important indices used to allocate the undivided \[PAC\] between livestock types and age groups for that income year. 8.All livestock that a taxpayer owns (except livestock subject to bailment, lease or a share-farming agree- ment) must be included whether or not they have been grazed on or off the farm. 9.Male non-breeding cattle in the rising three year and older class carried on dairy farms must be accounted for as beef cattle. 10.Where a taxpayer purchases nurse cows during the year for rearing bobby calves, these are to be entered under the beef cattle section with a LSU co-efficient of 4.0. 5.2Breeding Sires - Treatment under Self Assessed Cost As mentioned in section 4.2 above, where a taxpayer values some livestock of any type under the Herd Scheme (section 86D of the Act), then s/he must account for all breeding sires of that livestock type under the Herd Scheme at the end of that income year (unless they are subject to the high-priced livestock scheme). This means that the taxpayer must exclude the cost of any breeding sires purchased in that income year from the Self Assessed Cost calculations. This rule from page 3 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 prevents double counting the cost of sires under this scheme where a taxpayer intended to value them under the Herd Scheme anyway. The number of sires pur- chased must also be excluded from the calculation (Form Two). This treatment applies to each livestock type separately. 5.3High Priced Livestock - Exclusion If a taxpayer buys any livestock which must be valued under the provisions of the High Priced Stock Scheme (section 86I of the Act), s/he must exclude them from the Self Assessed Cost calculations in the year of purchase. Both their number and their cost price must be excluded. Any specified writedown (depreciation) arising in any year from livestock valued on the High Priced Stock Scheme will be allocated as a cost of production to the rising one year group of livestock of that type. 5.4Transfer of High Priced Stock to Self Assessed Cost Under the provisions of the High Priced Stock Scheme, an animal is depreciated until its book value is equal to or less than the herd value (National Average Market Value under section 86G of the Act). In the year in which an animal's written down value will reach NAMV, the taxpayer should stop accounting for it under the high priced stock scheme. If the taxpayer still owns the animal at the end of the income year, s/he should account for it under the Herd Scheme if s/he is using that scheme for any other livestock of that type. If the taxpayer is not using the Herd Scheme for that livestock type, and all of the animals older than one year of that type are being valued under Self Assessed Cost, then the taxpayer should account for the animal under this option. The animal must be included as a normal purchase in the calculation at a deemed cost equal to the NAMV for its age class in the income year concerned. This treatment will allow the full writedown from the High Priced Stock Scheme to the SAC cost for that year. 5.5Dual Product Multipliers The calculations include allowances to exclude the cost of producing wool, fibre, milk and velvet. These allowances are called dual product multipliers.

All of the necessary figures will already be entered in the dairy section of Form Two. Follow the steps in the formula on Form Three to complete the calculation. The following table is an example of the dairy dual product multiplier for an example farm. Dual Product Multiplier - Dairy Cattle Use the following indices and formulae to calculate the Dual Product Multiplier for dairy cattle. The dairy cat- tle section of Form Two contains all the indices. a = no. of homebred calves weaned70 b = average LSU per cow bred from6.5 c = opening number of rising 1 yr heifers40 d = opening number of rising 1 yr male cattle5 e = opening number of breeding cows180 f = opening number of breeding bulls1 Complete the following calculations 1.a x ( b + 0.5 ) = \[L\] 2 70 x ( 6.5 + 0.5 ) = \[L\]= 262.5 2 2.(c x 4.3) + (d x 4.7)= \[M\] (40 x 4.3) + (5 x 4.7)= \[M\]= 195.5 3.(e - a) x b= \[N\] (180 - 70) x 6.5= \[N\]= 715 4.

All multipliers are calculated on a weight of production basis, and should be used as stated. There is no dual product multiplier for dairy bred bobby calves which are purchased. The dual product multipliers for dairy cows and dairy goats or sheep apply to the rising one and two year groups of these livestock. 5.6Allocation of Undivided \[PAC\] Use the following formula to allocate the undivided PAC between livestock types and age groups.

All these forms are reproduced at the back of this Appendix. \[PAC\] x \[C\] \[E\] x \[K\] = amount allocated Where: \[PAC\]is the total of the undivided costs of livestock production calculated on Form One; \[C\]is the LSU total for rising one year group of a livestock type as calculated on Form Two (This variable is \[D\] and \[DD\] for older age groupings); \[E\]is the total LSUs carried on the farm in that income year as calculated on Form Two. \[K\]is the dual product multiplier. This formula is part of the final step in calculating the average cost per head for an income year. There are examples of its use in the following section of this Appendix. 6.Calculating the Average Cost Per Head Calculating the average cost per head is the final step in the Self Assessed Cost calculation. This calculation involves the following: 1.Share of undivided \[PAC\] adjusted by the dual product multiplier; plus 2.Specific costs allocated to that age grouping of livestock adjusted by the dual product multiplier; plus 3.Purchase costs of any stock bought for that age grouping of livestock; plus 4.Opening book value growing livestock in the age groupings older than the rising one year group; divided by 5.The number of animals in that age grouping which passed through the farm in that income year as calculated on Form Two. There are two examples of this calculation on pages 12 and 13, which are based on the data in the examples on pages 4 and 5 (representing Form One) and pages 8 and 9 (representing Form Two). These examples are for rising one year and the maturing age groupings of sheep. These calculations are the same as those for other livestock types, including the special group of rising 3 year old male, non-breeding beef cattle. The forms to use in these calculations are: Form Three:Rising one year group for sheep, cattle, deer and goats. Form Four:Maturing age grouping all livestock types for sheep, cattle, deer and goats. Form Five:Rising 3 year old grouping of male non- breeding cattle. All these forms are reproduced at the back of this Appendix. The examples on pages 12 and 13 calculate (hypotheti- cal) average costs per head of: rising one year sheep$13.08/head maturing groups of sheep$19.94/head These are the costs which would be used to value those age groupings of stock on hand at the end of the income year. The same calculations are made using the appro- priate forms for each of the other livestock types and age groupings owned. Dairy cattle and beef cattle must be calculated separately. 7.Splitting Age Groupings into Separate Inventories The age groupings contained in these guidelines are the minimum requirements. Taxpayers may increase the number of groupings they use. Farmers who have substantial livestock trading policies may wish to do this, particularly if they buy and sell any stock in the same year, or if they buy growing male cattle. Farmers may also wish to separate adult wether flocks from their adult ewe flocks. We have not prepared any special forms for this separation of inventory groups. Instead, farmers can make this calculation on Forms Two to Five simply by filing in extra copies of the same forms. For example, a farmer may wish to separate stock destined for breeding purposes from true trading stock, and identify them separately as stock on hand at the end of the income year. The livestock unit Form Two would have the sheep section filled in twice: •Once for the stock in each age grouping which are destined for breeding purposes; and •Once for the true trading stock in each age grouping. Then, the farmer would complete two copies of Form Three, with specific costs and purchases assigned to the appropriate groups. 8.Inventory Requirements If a farmer is going to value mature livestock of mixed ages and years of intake under Self Assessed Cost (or National Standard Cost), s/he must use an inventory control system. The minimum requirement is the average cost inventory system (described in this section), but farmers can use more sophisticated inventory systems. Such systems include FIFO (First In, First Out), and full livestock tracing. The usual guide- lines for these inventory systems should be applied for livestock valued at cost. 8.1Average Cost Inventory System This system simply calculates an average closing cost for all the mature mixed age livestock valued at cost. from page 7 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 The method of calculation is described in formula form as follows: Average Cost = ((a - b) x c) + ((e - (a - b)) x d) (per head)e Where: ais the opening number of mature livestock; bis the sales and deaths of mature livestock during the income year; cis the average cost of livestock calculated for the previous year; dis the average cost of this year’s intake of maturing livestock (1-2year age group except for fattening male cattle); eis the closing number of mature livestock. The formula averages the cost of surviving inventory livestock at the end of the income year with that year’s new intake of livestock. The following example demonstrates this procedure. The opening number of mature sheep is 4,000, at an average cost of $20. During the year, 1,000 are sold or die. The closing number of mature sheep is also 4,000, and the calcu- lated cost of the new year’s intake is $24 per head. The averaging method takes the 3,000 surviving inventory at the end of the year, and averages their cost with the 1,000 sheep entering the flock that year. Using the formula, the calculation is: Average=((4,000 - 1,000) x $20) + ((4,000 - 1,000)) x 24) Cost4,000 =(3,000 x $20) + (1,000 x 24) 4,000 =84,000 4,000 =$21 per head This average cost of $21 per head is then used to value all of the mixed age sheep on hand at closing balance date in that income year. Farmers can apply this average cost on a class-by-class basis (the same average cost for each class), or they can apply it to the whole of that inventory as a single group. A simpler layout of this same calculation is: Surviving number (opening number less sales and deaths: 4,000 - 1,000)=3,000 Total value of surviving number (3,000 @ $20)=$60,000 New intake this year (4,000 - 3,000)=1,000 Total value of new intake (1,000 @ $24)=$24,000 Total Closing value=$84,000 Average cost per head ($84,000/4,000 sheep)=$21 This example shows how to calculate stock values using the average cost inventory system. This is the minimum standard of inventory system for use with either Self Assessed Cost or National Standard Cost. Farmers may change the inventory system they use without advising Inland Revenue, providing they follow the normal consistency rules that generally apply to inventory systems. 8.2Opening Inventory Costs in First Year of SAC (or NSC) Use When a farmer changes from any other option to Self Assessed Cost (or National Standard Cost), his/her opening inventory values in the year of change will be deemed to be the closing values of those livestock in the previous year. If the farmer uses the average cost inventory system, s/he must calculate an average opening cost per head. If s/he uses a FIFO type system, s/he should phase out the opening values over a period of years in this order: 1.Breeding sires; 2.Mixed age male non-breeding stock; 3.Oldest female age classes in order. 9.Using SAC in Association with other Valuation Options The following rules relate to the use of Self Assessed Cost (SAC) in association with other valuation options. These rules are contained in the appropriate sections of the Income Tax Act. 1.If a farmer uses SAC, s/he cannot use National Standard Cost (NSC) in that business in the same income year. 2.A farmer must notify Inland Revenue two income years before changing valuation options between SAC and NSC (section 85A of the Act). 3.A farmer can use SAC in association with the herd scheme, market value or replacement price. Where s/he uses market value or replacement price, she must use it to value a complete inventory age grouping, for any livestock type for which the option is to be used. 4.Whenever a farmer uses SAC as an option for any livestock, s/he must make the calculation according to these guidelines on a whole farm basis. S/he must then use the average cost per head thus calculated to value those stock on hand at the end of the income year which are to be valued under the SAC option. 5.Where a farmer is using SAC in association with the herd scheme, s/he must include all breeding sires of that type of livestock in the herd scheme, and completely exclude any purchase costs of those breeding sires from the SAC calculation. 10.Sharemilking Arrangements In agreements in which the sharemilker does not own the milking herd, the livestock owner will calculate SAC for livestock as if the share of the milk proceeds paid to the sharemilker were wages. Thus, the remuneration that the sharemilker receives would be included as wages in the partial absorption costs continued on page 14 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 Costs to Rising One Year - All Livestock Types (Form Three) Farm:Example FarmYear Ending: 31/3/93 Livestock Type:Sheep (Not Merino Breed) Use the following formula to calculte the cost per head of rising one year livestock of this type.

The dual product multiplier would account for the proportion of wages paid which was associated with milk production. In agreements in which the sharemilker owns the stock, SAC would be calculated using the partial absorption costs actually incurred by the sharemilker. In agreements in where there is mixed ownership of stock, SAC would be calculated on a whole farm basis incorporating all partial absorption costs incurred by either party to the agreement. If this was not satisfac- tory to either party and the full partial absorption costs were not disclosed, then they could not use SAC. 11.People who may not use Self Assessed Cost These taxpayers may not use Self Assessed Cost: •owners of bailed stock; •owners of leased stock; •non-farming parties to a sharefarming agreement. 12.Feedlot Operations Operators of feedlots who purchase livestock for intensive finishing before sale or slaughter may use average or actual purchase costs of livestock on hand at the end of any income year to value these livestock. No allocation of other costs of production is required, this being consistent with the treatment applied to other livestock purchases within these guidelines. 13.Livestock Valuation Forms The following pages contain the guideline forms for completing the calculation of the costs of livestock production.

(2)A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note is a financial arrangement in which the holder of the Note provides money to a company, and the debt is discharged at a future date by the issue of shares (or stock) in that company only. Interest may be payable for the period between the issue of the Note and conversion into shares. Such payments are called Coupon Interest payments. (3)As a share is an excepted financial arrangement under section 64B of the Act, only the coupon interest payments and amounts attributed to those payments by this determination are regarded as income or expenditure for the purposes of calculat- ing accrual income or expenditure. (4)Determination G5B prescribes the method to be used when calculating for accrual purposes the income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note. It also details which amounts are to be included for this calculation, and which are attributable to an ex- cepted financial arrangement. (5)Determination G5B differs from Determination G5A by providing a method for allocating coupon interest payments between seller and purchaser when a Note is sold part way through an interest period. The seller is to calculate interest that accrues before the date of sale (on a straight-line basis) and that amount is treated as the buyer’s acquisition price. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) and (e) section 64E(6) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 3 Scope of Determination Except where its application is specifically excluded in another determination, Determination G5B applies to every Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note which: (1)is entered into on, or after, the date of publication in the Gazette (however, it does not apply to notes which are issued pursuant to a binding contract entered into before the date of publication), and (2)meets the following criteria: (a)conversion into shares of a company is at a predetermined ratio; and (b)coupon interest payments, if any, are payable at regular intervals of not more than 12 months; and (c)coupon interest payments are of equal amount, or are set in relation to a market interest rate indicator (if this condition is not satisfied because of the issue date or conversion date of the Note, but the rate at which the payment is calculated is consistent with the other coupon interest payments required under the Note, this determination shall apply as if the condition were met); and (d)at the date of issue of the Note, the market value of the underlying shares amounts to at least 80% of the acquisition price of the Note; and (e)the Note is not part of another financial arrange- ment. 4 Principle (1)A Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has both debt and equity components. It can be regarded alternatively as: (a)a loan to a company with repayment in shares (debt component); or (b)a forward purchase of shares (in which case the holder of the Note is buying a share of a business and has equity in it). The accruals regime is not intended to deal with equity, and therefore classifies a share (equity in a business) as an excepted financial arrangement (see section 64B). (2)As a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note has this dual character, when calculating income/ expenditure in relation to the Note it is first neces- sary to separate the debt and equity components of the Note. (3)This determination specifies that, apart from the coupon interest payments and amounts attributed to those payments by this determination, all amounts relate to the underlying shares (equity component), and will not be dealt with under the accruals regime (sections 64B to 64M) when calculating assessable income. (4)Income and expenditure in respect of the Note is calculated by pro-rata daily apportionment of the coupon interest payment to income years. (5)For the purposes of this determination it is assumed that any change in the market value of the shares Appendix B - Accrual Determinations continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 (3)For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a mean- ing different from that given by its definition. 6 Method (1)Amounts to be included when calculating income or expenditure with regard to a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note: (a)In respect of income, gain or loss, or expendi- ture, and also of any other consideration receiv- able by the holder or payable by the issuer, the amounts taken into account to calculate income/expenditure consist of: (i)coupon interest payments; (ii)amounts attributed to coupon interest pay- ments as set out in subclause 6(3). (b)In respect of the acquisition price, the amounts to be included when calculating income/expendi- ture are those attributed to coupon interest payments as set out in subclause 6(4). (2)The income derived or expenditure incurred in respect of a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note shall be calculated by daily apportionment of the coupon interest payments to income years. For the method, see Determination G1A: Apportionment of Daily Income and Expenditure. (3)If a Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note on which interest is payable is sold part way through an interest period, then it is necessary to apportion the coupon interest payment between the seller and the purchaser. The seller is allocated interest, on a daily straight line basis, that accrues before the date of sale. (See Example C). Note: If the coupon interest payment is not known until after the date of sale, it shall be assumed to be equal to the coupon interest payment for the previ- ous period (adjusted for any difference in the length of the period). (4)The portion of the sale price thus attributed to accrued interest and allocated to the seller is, in turn, treated as the purchaser’s acquisition price of the financial arrangement. If the purchaser later receives the coupon interest payment for the sale period, then this acquisition price may be immedi- ately offset against the amount received when calculating the amount of income derived from the financial arrangement in that year. (See Example C). 7 Example Example A On 13 September 1987 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 12% payable half- between the issue date of the Note and the conver- sion into shares is due to the equity component. Therefore the difference in share price can be ignored when calculating income and expenditure. 5 Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires: (1)Expressions used, except the expression “income year”, have the same meaning as in section 2 and section 64B of the Income Tax Act 1976. (a)The “Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976. (b)“Coupon Interest Payment” means any amount payable on the Note by the Note issuer (bor- rower) to the Note holder (lender) other than payments relating to the redemption or conver- sion of the Note. (c)“Income Year” (i)When a taxpayer furnishes a return of income under section 15 of the Act for an accounting year ending with a balance date other than the 31st day of March, “income year” means the period of twelve months ending on that balance date. (ii)For any other person, “income year” means the year ending 31 March in which the income has been derived or expenditure has been incurred by that person. (d)“Mandatory Conversion Convertible Note”, or “Note” means any debenture, bond, certificate, document, Note or writing issued or given by a company: (i)which provides evidence that the company is indebted to the holder of the Note, whether for a loan to the company, money subscribed to the company or any other liability of the company (whether or not the amount for which the company has issued the Note is secured over the undertaking or any of the assets of the company); and (ii)which provides for the debt to be discharged only by the issue of shares in the capital of the company. This may be pursuant to a trust deed. (e)“Underlying Shares” in relation to a Note means the shares or stock into which the Note is convertible, or in which it may be redeemed or paid. (2)A determination to which Determination G5B refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determina- tion made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is taken to be extended to the new determination. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 yearly in arrears. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13th September 1988 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The coupon interest payments are made as follows: 13 March 1988$6.00 13 September 1988$6.00 (a) Year ended 31 March 1988 Coupon payment 13/3/88$6.00 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/9/88 (There are 18 days between 13 March and 31 March 1988, and 184 days between 13 March and 13 Sep- tember 1988) 18/184 x $6.00$0.59 Income/Expenditure$6.59 (b) Year ended 31 March 1989 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjust- ment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($12.00) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($6.59) As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the issue price and sharemarket value can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes). Therefore, in this example “b” has a value of zero. Income/Expenditure= a - (b + c) = $12.00 - (0 + $6.59) = $5.41 Example B On 13 November 1992 a convertible Note is issued for $100 with an interest coupon of 10% payable half- yearly in arrears, with the exception of the first period which is 5 months. The Note is mandatorily convertible on 13th October 1994 to 10 shares in the issuing company. The market value of each share at issue date is $9.00. By conversion date this has risen to $15.00. Both the issuer and the holder use a 31 March balance date and apply Determination G1A on a 365 day basis when apportioning daily income and expenditure. The coupon interest payments are made as follows: 13 April 1992$4.15 13 October 1992$5.00 13 April 1993$5.00 13 October 1993$5.00 (a) Year ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/93 There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 138 are in the year ended 31 March 1993 138/151 x $4.15$3.79 Income/Expenditure$3.79 (b) Year ended 31 March 1994 Apportionment of Coupon Payment due on 13/4/93 There are a total of 151 days in the first period. Of these, 13 are in the year ended 31 March 1994 13/151 x $4.15$0.36 Coupon Payment due on 13/10/93$5.00 Apportionment of coupon payment due on 13/4/94 There are a total of 182 days in the period between payments. Of these, 169 are in the year ended 31 March 1994 169/182 x $5.00$4.64 Income/Expenditure$10.00 (c) Year ended 31 March 1995 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjust- ment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied: a = sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($13.79) As all amounts other than the coupon payments are attributable to the underlying shares, the price and share market values can be ignored for the purposes of calculating income and expenditure. This effectively gives the Note an acquisition price of nil (for accrual purposes), hence in this example “b” has a value of zero. Income/Expenditure= a - (b + c) = $19.15 - (0 + 13.79) = $5.36 Example C The original holder of the Note described in Example B sells the Note on 20 December 1992, for $120, to a new holder who holds the Note to maturity. The sale of the Note takes place part way through an interest period, so it is necessary to apportion the coupon interest payment between the seller and the purchaser. The coupon interest payment for this period amounts to $4.15. Using a straight-line apportionment, $1.01 of the $4.15 is attributable to that portion of the period ending continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 138/151 x $4.15$3.79 From this, the holder can subtract the acquisition price$1.01 Income/Expenditure$2.78 (b) Year ended 31 March 1993 As for Example B Income$10.00 (c) Year ended 31 March 1994 As the Note matures in this year the base price adjust- ment (section 64F of the Act) is required. The formula a - (b + c) is applied: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($19.15) b = acquisition price ($1.01) c = income/expenditure in previous years ($12.78) Income/Expenditure= a - (b + c) = $19.15 - ($1.01 + $12.78) = $5.36 This determination is signed by me on the 22nd day of January in the year 1993. R D Adair Deputy Commissioner of Inland Revenue from page 25 20 December 1992 during which the Note is owned by the original holder. ($4.15 x 37/151. There are 151 days in the coupon period, and there are 37 days from the beginning of the period until the day that the Note is sold.) This amount of $1.01 is income to the original holder and acquisition price to the new holder. The original holder would be considered to have sold the equity portion of the convertible Note for $118.99. (a) Income for the Original Holder: Year ended 31 March 1993 Since this is the “final Year” of the arrangement from the point of view of the original holder, the base price adjustment is applied, using the following values: a = the sum of all amounts paid ($1.01) b = acquisition price c = income/expenditure in previous years ($0) Income= a - (b + c) = $1.01 - (0 + 0) = $1.01 (b) Income for the New Holder: Year ended 31 March 1993 Apportionment of coupon payment 13/4/93 There are a total of 151 days in the first period.

The market price for September 92 contracts at 1/5/92 was 93.13, and for December was 92.98. The margin column states the unrealised profit in terms of margin deposited, and variable margin accumulated and eroded. Therefore, the transaction of 20 bought BBC futures contracts on 12/12/91 has an unrealised profit of $54,062.80. Merchant Bank has an unrealised profit of $49,774.60 for the September 92 maturity, and $51,666.80 for the December 92 maturity, giving a total of $101,441.40.

(2)Subclause 6(5) of this determination refers to a Subscriber Screen Broadcast that quotes prices for Futures Contracts or Option Contracts. Such a service is commonly provided by companies such as Reuters, Telerate and Bloomberg LP. The following are examples of Subscriber Screen Broadcast pages provided by Telerate New Zealand Limited and Reuters New Zealand Limited: (a) This is an example of a Subscriber Screen Broadcast page provided by Telerate New Zealand Limited. It shows price information for the three year T-Bond futures contract traded on the Sydney Futures Exchange. Two maturities are quoted - the September 1992 contract, and the December 1992 contract. The market price for the September 1992 three year T-Bond futures contract is 93.58 (or 6.42%) being the LAST price at which trades occurred. (b) This is an example of a Subscriber Screen Broadcast provided by Reuters New Zealand Limited, relating to the same Futures Contract as in paragraph 7(2)(a) above. The market price for the September 1992 three year T-Bond futures contract is 93.58 (or 6.42%), being the LAST price. (c) This is a different example of a Subscriber Screen Broadcast page provided by Reuters New Zealand Limited. It shows market prices for a Eurodollar Futures contract maturing in December 1989 as traded on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. The market price of the contract is 91.70, being the last traded price and identified by the description “LAST” (as distinguished from “LAST 1”, “LAST 2” etc.). The closing price for the previous trading day is 91.68. This determination is signed by me on the 22nd day of January in the year 1993.

Any income or expense relating to a variable rate financial arrangement must be accrued. Determination G26 sets out two alternative methods by which this should be done, and explains the circumstances in which each should be used. A variable rate arrangement may be a floating rate arrangement or a reviewable rate arrangement. Floating rate arrangements are those where the Interest rate is reset periodically according to a predetermined formula. The formula links the Interest rate to an indicator rate such as the bank bill or interbank rate. Reviewable rate arrangements are those where the Interest rate is set periodically in line with market rates. Any change in the Interest rate reflects and is consistent with changes in market Interest rates. The most common form of reviewable rate loan is a mortgage where the Interest rate is subject to periodic review by the lender. (2)The income or expense in relation to a variable rate arrangement could consist of: (a)Periodic Interest payments as determined from time to time; (b)A premium or discount on the issue or face value of the arrangement; (c)Fees paid or received in relation to the arrange- ment. These amounts must be accrued. (3)The methods provided in this determination sepa- rately accrue: (a)Periodic Interest on a daily basis over the income year to which it relates; (b)Any discount or premium and fees over the term of the arrangement, on either a straight line basis (Method A) or a yield to maturity basis (Method B). (4)The critical factor in deciding whether Method A or Method B applies to an arrangement is the size of the premium or discount (including fees) relating to the arrangement. (a)Method A applies to financial arrangements where there is a small (or no) discount or premium. These are arrangements where the discount or premium and fees (non-contingent fees with a limit of 2% of the core acquisition price, plus contingent fees) is less than 2% of the average amount of principal outstanding over the term of the arrangement. (For a full definition see clause 5 - Interpretation). (b)Method B is of general application, and may be applied to any variable rate financial arrange- ment within the scope of this determination. (5)Method A permits the spreading of fees and pre- mium or discount over the term of a financial arrangement on a straight line basis, in proportion to the principal outstanding. The simplest case of Method A occurs where the principal is fixed throughout the term. In that case, the premium or discount and fees are spread on a straight line basis over the term of the arrangement. (6)Method B can be applied regardless of the amount of fees and premium or discount. It requires the fees and premium or discount to be spread on a yield to maturity basis. Since the future cashflows are not known, the actual yield to maturity rate cannot be calculated, but must be estimated. This is done by using the initial Interest rate (or price or index) and assuming that this rate will apply throughout the term of the financial arrangement. The spreading of fees and premium or discount may be done on either a per Period basis or a per income year basis. To calculate the yield to maturity, Method B uses either Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method or Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods and G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method. (7)It is important to note that in both Method A and Method B there is no recalculation or respreading of fees and discount or premium when there is a change in Interest rate, price, or index. The spread- ing is done only once, at either the date of acquisi- tion or issue as the case may be. (8)Interest is calculated separately for each period (or income year) depending on the actual Interest rate applying in the Period (or the Periods within that income year). (9)A holder of a variable rate financial arrangement to which this determination applies may bring any fees or premium received at the date of issue of the financial arrangement into income at that time. (10)Those taxpayers to whom section 64C(2A) of the Act applies should use Determination G24: Straight Line Method. 2 Reference This determination is made pursuant to section 64E(1)(b) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 3 Scope Determination G26 shall be applied to any variable rate financial arrangements where: (a)All of the amounts payable (other than the principal, any discount or premium, and any fees) are either: (i)set periodically according to a predetermined formula. That formula must link the amounts payable to economic, commodity, industrial, or financial indices or prices, or banking rates, or general commercial rates; or (ii)set periodically by reference to market interest rates; and (b)The amounts of principal (including any fees and any premium or discount) and the times or intervals at which they are to be advanced and repaid, are known, or are able to be determined, or can reason- ably be anticipated, as at the first balance date after issue or acquisition. (c)Interest is paid at least annually. Determination G26 provides two alternative methods acceptable for the purposes of section 64C(3) of the Act. (Note: A determination to which Determination G26 refers may be changed or rescinded by a new determi- nation made by the Commissioner. In such a case, a reference to the old determination is taken to be ex- tended to the new determination.) 4 Principle (1)The income deemed to be derived or expenditure deemed to be incurred by a person in a Period (or income year) is calculated by adding together: (a)The amount of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period (or income year); and (b)The amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or income year). (2)Method A and Method B find and then allocate the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest to each Period (or an income year) of the financial arrange- ment. Once this amount has been allocated, the amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or income year) is added to it. This gives the income or expenditure for each Period (or income year) of the financial arrangement. (a)Method A may only be applied to Small Dis- count or Premium Financial Arrangements. It results in an allocation to each Period propor- tionate to the amount of principal outstanding in that Period, and the length of that Period. (b)Method B may be applied to other financial arrangements. It assumes that the rate, price or index known to apply in the first Period applies to all subsequent Periods. The Act and determi- nations are used to spread the Total Finance Charges over the term of the financial arrange- ment. The assumed Interest content of the Total Finance Charges in each Period (or in each income year) is then subtracted. The yield to maturity method or other permissible method would be used for calculation purposes. 5 Interpretation (1)In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires- Expressions used have the same meanings as in the Act and where a word or expression is given a particular meaning for the purposes of sections 64B to 64M of the Act, it shall have the same meaning as in this determination. “the Act” means the Income Tax Act 1976: “Interest” does not have the meaning given in section 2 of the Act. Rather for the purposes of this determination it means any periodic payment in relation to the financial arrangement, to the extent intended to provide a return to the lender on the sums provided to the borrower. It does not include fees, discounts, or premiums, or payments effecting a reduction of principal. “Period” means a term commencing immediately after a payment is payable or receivable, and ending when the next payment is payable or receivable. Where the Period is longer than one year, the Period is deemed to comprise one or more Periods each of one year followed (or preceded, at the option of the holder or issuer as the case may be) by a Period of less than one year. The duration of the financial arrangement should be evenly divided into Periods, which may be measured in days, weeks, fortnights, months, quarters, half years, or years. If an even division is not possible, then the remainder should be treated as a partial Period, and expressed as a fraction of a full Period. m x n o where m = the number of days in the partial Period n = number of full Periods in a year o = number of days in a year For example, if all other Periods are measured in months then a Period of 5 days would be treated as 5 x 12 = 0.1644 of a month 365 There must be no more than two partial Periods in any financial arrangement. continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 “Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrange- ments” means a financial arrangement to which this determination applies, in respect of which - (a)The only variable parts of an amount payable comprise Interest which: (i)is payable at yearly or more frequent inter- vals; and (ii)is calculated on the amount of the principal outstanding from time to time since the previous Interest payment (or since the date of issue or acquisition if that is later); and (b)The amount of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest (ignoring whether it is a positive or negative amount) is not more than the product of: (i)Two per cent; and (ii)The expected term of the financial arrange- ment calculated in years and fractions of a year; and (iii)The time-weighted average amount of principal that is reasonably expected to be outstanding during the expected term of the financial arrangement. Clause 7 of this determination provides examples which show whether or not a financial arrangement is a Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrange- ment. “Total Finance Charges” in relation to a financial arrangement means- (a)For an issuer, the total of all amounts payable by the issuer less the total of all amounts receivable by the issuer, pursuant to the financial arrange- ment; (b)For a holder, the total of all amounts receivable by the holder less the total of all amounts payable by the holder, pursuant to a financial arrangement. Any fees payable in relation to the financial arrange- ment must be reduced by the amount of item z as defined in sections 64BA(2) or 64BA(3) of the Act. “Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest” in relation to a financial arrangement means the Total Finance Charges excluding all amounts of Interest payable or receivable. (2)For convenience, words and phrases defined in this determination are indicated by initial capital letters, but the absence of a capital letter shall not alone imply that the word or phrase is used with a mean- ing different from that given by its definition. 6 Method (1)A person may apply Method A to Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangements, and Method B to any other financial arrangement. In order to deter- mine whether Method A can be applied, use the criteria outlined in the Interpretation clause of this determination. (2)Method A shall be applied in respect of Periods. Method B may be applied either in respect of income years or Periods. (3)The proviso to paragraph (a) of section 64C(3) of the Act allows for another method, similar to those in this determination, to also be used. (4)Once a method has been selected for a financial arrangement, that method must be applied until that financial arrangement matures or is remitted, sold, or otherwise transferred by the person unless the prior consent of the Commissioner to adopt another method is obtained. (The Commissioner’s consent may be given conditionally). (5)A person who: (a)is a holder; and (b)who receives a premium or fee on the issue or acquisition of a financial arrangement may elect to include that fee or premium in the income derived by that person in the income year of issue or acquisition. (6)The formula x + y is used to calculate the income derived or expendi- ture incurred by a person in a Period (or an income year) in relation to the financial arrangement. In this formula: xis the amount of Total Finance Charges Exclud- ing Interest allocated to that Period (or to that income year); and yis the amount of Interest payable or receivable in that Period (or that income year). (7)Method A and Method B differ in the method used to calculate the value of x. (a)Under Method A x = a x b x c d where, ais the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be; bis the length of the Period (b = 1 if the Period in question is a full Period, or, for a partial Period, b = a fraction calculated in accord- ance with the formula given in the clause 5 Interpretation); cis the amount of principal outstanding during the Period; dis the sum of all items (b x c) calculated in respect of every Period; from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 (b)Under Method B x = e - f Since, in a variable rate arrangement, the rate, price, or index varies during the term of the arrangement, the assumption is made that the rate, price or index that applies to the first Period after the date of issue or acquisition applies to all Periods of the financial arrangement. Using the assumption: eis the income derived, or the expenditure incurred, for a Period (or income year); and fis the Interest deemed to be payable by the issuer or receivable by the holder as the case may be. The yield to maturity method is used in accord- ance with the Act and determinations to decide the value of e. (8)Amounts calculated using this determination should be apportioned between income years using Deter- mination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. 7 Examples Example A (illustrating Method A) On 12 February 1991 a company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for 5 years, at an interest rate of bank bill plus 0.75% p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The notes are issued at a discount of 5%. The borrower is a New Zealand company. Contingent fees of 2.5% of $10,000 are payable by the borrower; there are no non- contingent fees. There is no change in the principal outstanding over the 5 years. The average principal outstanding is therefore $10,000, both overall and within each half year Period. (a)Before calculating the amount of expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower over the term of the arrangement, it is first necessary to determine whether Method A or Method B is to be used. For Method A to be used, the arrangement must satisfy the criteria for a Small Discount or Premium Financial Arrangement (see clause 5 Interpretation). In this example, the Total Finance Charges Exclud- ing Interest payable by the borrower are calculated as follows: $ 10,000principal payable + 250fees paid - 9,500 principal received a = 750 Ignoring sign, $750 is less than the amount which determines whether or not Method A can be used, calculated as follows: 2% x the expected term of the financial arrangement calculated in years and fractions of years (5) x the average principal outstanding ($10,000) 2% x 5 x 10,000 = $1,000 So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b)The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower in a specific Period is calculated using the formula x + y (i)“x” is the amount of Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period. Using Method A x = a x b x c d where a =the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer or receiv able as the case may be; b=the length of the Period =1 throughout the time of the financial arrangement, as all of the Periods are the same length (half a year) c=the amount of principal outstanding during the Period; =$10,000 in all Periods. d=the sum of all items (b x c) calculated in respect of every Period; =1 x $10,000 x 10 (as there are 10 half year Periods); =$100,000. Therefore, (ii)y is the amount of Interest payable or receivable in the Period. Therefore, in this example, y =Interest calculated at the bank bill rate plus 0.75%. (iii)Therefore, the expenditure incurred by the borrower in each half year would be: x + y ($75 + Interest calculated at the bank bill rate plus 0.75%) This expenditure would be spread using Determina- tion G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expendi- ture on a Daily Basis. If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have derived similar amounts of income. continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 Example B (a further illustration of Method A) On 12 February 1991 a company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for five years at an interest rate of bank bill plus 0.75% p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The notes are issued at a discount of 4.5%. The bor- rower is a New Zealand company. $2,000 of the face value of the notes is to be repaid on each anniversary of the issue. There are no fees. The length of each Period is measured in half years, so b = 1 throughout. The average principal outstanding over the five years is: (10,000 + 8,000 + 6,000 + 4,000 + 2,000) = $6,000 5 (a)Decide whether Method A can be applied. The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the borrower are equal to: $10,000principal payable +0fees paid - 9,550principal received (after discount) a =450 Ignoring sign, this is less than: 2% x 5 (years) x 6,000 (average principal outstand- ing) = $600 So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b)Calculate the value of x The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest: Half YearPrincipalSum ofAllocation PeriodOutstanding(b x c)a x b x c b = 1d $$$ 110,00010,000 75 210,00010,000 75 3 8,000 8,000 60 4 8,000 8,000 60 5 6,000 6,000 45 6 6,000 6,000 45 7 4,000 4,000 30 8 4,000 4,000 30 9 2,000 2,000 15 10 2,000 2,000 15 Total60,000450 (i)y = Interest on the principal outstanding in the half year at the bank bill rate plus 0.75% p.a. (ii)The expenditure incurred by the borrower in each half year Period would be: x (calculated in accordance with the above table) + y This expenditure would be spread using Determina- tion G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expendi- ture on a Daily Basis. If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have similar amounts of income. Example C (another illustration of Method A) This is similar to Example B, but issued at a premium, and seen from the holder’s viewpoint. It is somewhat artificial, in order to illustrate a point. On 12 February 1991 a company borrows $10,000 for 5 years at an interest rate of bank bill plus 2% p.a. payable half yearly in arrears. The money is raised by issuing notes at a premium of 5%. The purchaser is a New Zealand company. Contin- gent fees of 2% are payable by the issuer to the pur- chaser (holder). $2,000 of the face value of the notes is to be repaid on each anniversary of the issue. The length of each Period is measured in half years, so b = 1 throughout. The average principal outstanding over the five years is: (10,000 + 8,000 + 6,000 + 4,000 + 2,000) = $6,000 5 (a)Decide whether Method A can be applied. The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable to the lender are equal to: $ 10,000principal receivable + 200fees received - 10,500 principal paid a = -300 Ignoring sign, this is less than: 2% x 5 x 6,000 = $600 So Method A of this determination may be applied. (b)The income deemed to be derived by the holder in a Period is calculated using the formula x + y (i)Calculate the value of x The following table sets out the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest: Half YearPrincipalSum ofAllocation PeriodOutstanding(b x c)a x b x c b = 1d $$$ 110,00010,000 -50 210,00010,000 -50 3 8,000 8,000 -40 4 8,000 8,000 -40 5 6,000 6,000 -30 6 6,000 6,000 -30 7 4,000 4,000 -20 8 4,000 4,000 -20 9 2,000 2,000 -10 10 2,000 2,000 -10 Total d =60,000a = -300 Note: x is negative because a premium has been paid. from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 (ii)y = Interest on the principal outstanding in the half year at the bank bill rate plus 2% p.a. (iii)The income derived by the holder in each half year Period would be: x (calculated in accordance with the above table) + y This income would be spread using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. Example D (illustrating Method B on a Period Basis This example uses Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method. A New Zealand company issues notes with a face value of $10,000 for a term of 3 years at a discount of 10% ($1,000). The Interest rate is equal to Libor plus 1% p.a., and Interest is payable half yearly in arrears. There are no fees. The Interest rate is 10% in the first Period after issue. Assuming that this interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 14.21% p.a., calculated at half yearly rests. (a)Decide whether Method A can be applied. Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest are equal to: $ 10,000principal payable + 0fees paid - 9,000principal received (after discount) a = 1,000 Ignoring sign, this is more than: 2% x 3 (years) x 10,000 (average principal outstanding) = $600 Because the Small Discount or Premium criteria are not met, Method A may not be applied. (b)The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the borrower in a Period is equal to x + y. (i)Calculate the value of x (Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest allocated to that Period) x = e - f Method B assumes that the Interest rate applying in the first Period (10% in this example) applies throughout the financial arrangement. “e” is the Total Finance Charge. This is calculated using Determination G3: Yield to Maturity Method (or G10B in conjunction with G11A). The yield to maturity rate is 14.21% p.a. (See table for the value of e in each Period.) “f” is the Interest that would be payable by the borrower if the rate that applied in the first Period after the date of issue applied to all Periods of the financial arrangement. Since the initial Interest rate is 10% in this example, f = 500 for each Period. (ii)y = the actual Interest paid in a Period. Values for this example are shown in the table below. (iii)The expenditure deemed to be incurred in each Period using Method B is calculated in the following table: PeriodTotal Finance ChargesInterestTotal FinanceActual InterestActual InterestTotal Expenditure (assuming 10% p.a. interest)(at 10% p.a.)Charges ExcludingRate % p.a.Payabledeemed to be (Note 1)(Note 2)Interestincurred efx = e - fyx + y 1 640 500 14010 500 640 2 649 500 14911 550 699 3 660 500 1609 450 610 4 671 500 1719 450 621 5 683 500 1838 400 583 6 697 500 1978 400 597 4,0003,0001,0002,7503,750 Note 1:Based on a yield to maturity of 14.21% p.a. calculated using Determination G3 and an interest rate of 10% p.a. through- out Note 2:10% is the rate applying in the first Period after issue continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.7 - Appendices - March 1993 Whole dollars and minor adjustments have been made to aid readability.

That Determination allows for the use of results other than those calculated using the Yield to Maturity Method, provided they do not result in a difference of more than $5 per period. The total expenditure is confirmed as: $ 1,000discount (x) + 2,750 interest actually payable (y) $ 3,750 (Note: In practice the expenditure in the final income year would be determined using the base price adjustment in section 64F of the Act.) The expenditure for each Period would be apportioned using Determination G1A: Apportionment of Income and Expenditure on a Daily Basis. If the fees were payable to a holder who was a New Zealand taxpayer (but not a cash basis holder), this taxpayer would be deemed to have derived similar amounts of income. Example E (illustrating the application of Methods A and B to a reviewable rate loan) A company borrows $1,000,000 for 5 years. The loan will be repaid on a table mortgage basis over the 5 year period with yearly interest reviews. The initial interest rate is 14.5% pa. A fee of $10,000 is charged when the loan is drawn down. The company is a New Zealand taxpayer and the issuer in relation to the financial arrangement. For the purposes of this example, the total expenditure incurred has been calculated using both Method A and Method B. (a)Method A The Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest payable by the issuer equals: $ 1,000,000principal payable + 10,000fees paid - 1,000,000 principal received a = 10,000 Ignoring the sign, this is less than: 2% x 5 x 653,736 (average principal outstanding) = $65,373 Therefore Method A may be applied. The expenditure deemed to be incurred by the issuer is equal to x + y (i)Calculate the value of x. The following table sets out the cashflows in relation to the arrangement (based on an initial interest rate of 14.5% pa) and the allocation of the Total Finance Charges Excluding Interest to each income year on a straight line basis, as allowed for in Method A.

In example D and E, Determination G3 was used to calculate the yield to maturity rate, which was then used to calculate e (Total Finance Charges), for each Period. In the present example, Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods is used in conjunction with Determination G11A: Present Value Based Yield to Maturity Method to calculate the yield to maturity rate and e for each income year. Example F is similar to example D. On 1 March 1992 a New Zealand investor purchases, for $9,000 a 3 year note with a face value of $10,000 maturing 1 March 1995. Interest at Libor plus 1% pa, is payable half yearly in arrears. Fees of 2% of the face value are payable by the borrower to the investor on issue. The investor balances on 31 March and elects to use a 365 day basis. The Interest rate is 10% pa in the first Period after issue. Assuming that this Interest rate holds throughout the term of the notes, the yield to maturity is 15.12% pa, calculated at half yearly rests. This allows for the 2% fees, and uses the net purchase price of 9,000 - 200 = 8,800. Income deemed to be derived during an income year is calculated using the formula x + y. (a)Method A of this determination cannot be used because the Small Discount or Premium Criteria are not met. That is, 2% x 3 (years) x 10,000 (average principal outstanding) = 600 which is smaller than the discount plus fees of $1,200.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Qualifying Companies - Market Values for QCET Purposes This article sets out Inland Revenueís position on ìmarket value of assets and liabilitiesî for the purpose of calculating Qualifying Company Election Tax. We don't expect companies to get formal valuations. Any suitably qualified person (such as a director, the company accountant, or an independent person) can value the assets and liabilities, so long as there is a reasonable estimate of each item's market value. We will accept the book value with any necessary adjust- ment. Example A company owns some land which is valued in the Balance Sheet at $100,000 (as per 1989 Government Valuation). The current market value of the land could be quite different to this figure. Anybody with experi- ence in property sales would be able to give a reasonable estimate of market value. Private company shares Shares in a private company could require a different valuation method. The overriding principle in valuing shares is that we are trying to work out a hypothetical price that a willing but not anxious buyer and a willing but not anxious seller would agree on. There are three well-recognised methods that Inland Revenue will accept to determine the value of shares in private and unlisted companies. In complex cases, you may need to consult text books or previous court cases which deal with the valuation of shares. 1. Notional Liquidation Method Under this method, the notional liquidation value is ìan estimate of the sum which the shareholder could expect to receive if the company assets were liquidated and the company wound upî. This is the formula for calculating the value of the shares: Assets\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ less Liabilities\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Net Assets\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ less Tax on Profit\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Sub Total\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ less Tax on shareholder distributions \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ less Liquidation Costs\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Sub Total\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Adjustment for Profit on Liquidation \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Net worth\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ The net worth divided by the number of shares will give the value per share. When calculating the hypothetical price for shares, you will need to make an appropriate allowance for these items: (a) Assets should be at estimated market value - book value with a reasonable adjustment will be accept- able (as mentioned above); (b) Income Tax and GST payable on profit from last balance date to date of valuation of shares; (c) Dividend tax or imputation credits attached which would be paid on the liquidation of the company; (d) The costs of a notional liquidation of the company (including cost of selling assets); and (e) A reasonable profit to the purchaser on the transac- tion - adjustment in the range of 15†-†33 % This method is appropriate for valuing all shares in a family company (i.e. where they are not held at arm's length) and majority shareholdings in other companies. Typical companies valued this way would be ìfarmî and ìpropertyî type companies. 2. Capitalisation of Future Maintainable Tax Paid Profits Under this method, the value of the shares is calculated from Capitalisation of Future Maintainable Tax Paid Profits at the generally accepted rate of return. The formula is: Future Maintainable x Capitalisation Rate Tax Paid Profit The initial guide to Future Maintainable Tax Paid Profit (FMTPP) figure is the past earning capacity plus adjustments for non-recurring excessive or inadequate allowances for expenses such as shareholders salaries and interest paid on advance accounts, with an allow- ance for tax paid. Abnormal years should be adjusted, with emphasis given to the most recent years. Other special factors include: (a) differing amounts of capital employed over the period of examination; (b) inclusion of income from funds not required for maintenance of normal profits; (c) change in management; (d) the case of a new business which had not reached full production capacity; (e) any other vital or anticipated change affecting past profits. When considering the rate of return, a satisfactory rate would be that received from a gilt-edged security plus a risk for private investment, range between 10 - 20%. It would be at a rate higher than dividend yield. This method is appropriate in valuing all shares in a family company (i.e. those not held at arm's length) and majority holdings in other companies. Typical compa- nies are sellers of goods or services in the industrial/ wholesale/retail sector. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Summary Valuing shares in a private company is not always an easy task. Court cases have shown that even the experts disagree. What Inland Revenue is aiming for is a simple calcula- tion to be lodged by the valuers (generally 1-2 pages will be sufficient), showing that they have used one of the accepted valuation methods and used reasonable values, allowances, percentages etc, to arrive at a fair value. If companies supply this information it will help reduce the amount of checking that we carry out. With more complex valuations, some negotiations with Inland Revenue valuers may be needed. We are happy to discuss any aspect of share valuations with share valuers. The contact person at your local Inland Revenue office is a Senior Investigating Accountant. Qualifying Companies - Crediting QCET to the ICA Summary This item establishes that the Qualifying Company Election Tax (QCET) that a closely held company pays when it elects to become a Qualifying Company is ìincome tax paidî, so it should be credited to the company's Imputation Credit Account (ICA) under section 394D(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Background QCET is an ìentryî tax levied on a company when it enters the Qualifying Company regime. The company must pay QCET on amounts that would be taxable distributions to shareholders if the company was wound up. Under the Qualifying Company regime, cash dividends that a Qualifying Company pays to its shareholders are either fully imputed or exempt. A dividend is exempt to the extent that it exceeds the amount of imputation and dividend withholding credits attached to it, divided by the company tax rate. Cash dividends and bonus issues will have imputation credits attached to the maximum available from the ICA and dividend withholding payments account. The amount of income tax that a company pays on income it derives in the imputation year is one of the credits that section 394D (1)(a) requires to be recorded in the ICA. If ìincome tax paidî includes QCET, this would increase the amount of fully imputed dividends that must be distributed from the ICA before the company can pay exempt dividends under the Qualify- ing Company regime. The Law Section 393K(1) says that a company that elects to become a QC ìshall be liable to pay a special tax by way of an income tax known as \[QCET\]î. Section 393L provides for QCET to be paid in the same manner as income tax, and to be included with income tax as a non-deductible item under section 106(1)(f). Further, it says that QCET (and any interest for its late payment) is to be treated as if it were income tax levied under section 38 of the Income Tax Act 1976, (except for specified parts of the Act - none of which are relevant to the treatment of ICAs). QCET (and late payment interest) can therefore be treated as ìincome taxî for the purposes of the ICA provisions, unless those provisions themselves preclude such a treatment. Section 394D in Part XllA states which amounts must be credited to the ICA and requires a credit to be recorded in the ICA for any amount of income tax the company pays on income it derives during the imputa- tion year. Nothing in that section or in that Part of the Act prevents QCET from being credited to the ICA. Thus where section 393M(3)(b) requires ìthe balance of the companyís imputation credit account ....î to be used in the formula for calculating the amount of imputation credit to be attached to a dividend paid by a Qualifying Company, that balance should include QCET that the company pays when it elects to enter the QC regime. Application of Policy This policy applies to both ìordinaryî QCET (at 33%) and the concessional transitional year QCET (at 7.5%) for those closely held companies that elect to become Qualifying Companies by 31 March 1993. Reference:Sections 393L, M and U, 394D Income Tax Act 1976 3. Dividend Yield Under this method the required dividend yield on both the paid up value of a share and the dividend payable on that share determines the market price of the share. The formula is: †††% dividend yield required††† x par value = market value % dividend paid on par value1of share Par value means the nominal value of a share. In most cases this equals the paid-up value of the share. You will need to make an allowance for partly paid-up shares. You can get an indication of an appropriate dividend by checking listed shares for companies engaged in a similar activity. For example, if you were valuing shares in a private provincial newspaper you might check the dividend yield on Wilson & Horton shares. This method is appropriate for calculating the value of minority shares in (non-family) private companies and unlisted public companies. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Policies We're Reviewing Several people have asked Inland Revenue if we will be changing our policy on: ï Gift Duty on dispositions of property between compa- nies (covered in Public Information Bulletin No.96 of October 1978) ï Deductibility of interest on farm houses (covered in Technical Rulings Chapter 51.5.1). We are reviewing these policies, and we will ask for comment from interested parties before we finalise any policy changes. Any policy changes will apply from a future date - either the date we publish the policy or another specified date. The existing policies will continue to apply until we release any policy changes. Shareholder-Employees and FBT on Company Vehicles Introduction This item confirms Inland Revenueís policy and record- keeping requirements for Fringe Benefit Tax when a shareholder-employee has restricted private use of a company vehicle. Background The availability of a vehicle for private use is a fringe benefit. That benefit is subject to FBT for the number of days the vehicle is available for private use. Some shareholder-employees have been uncertain what records they must keep when they have chosen to restrict their private use of a company-owned vehicle. (TIB Vol 1. No 3. Appendix E deals with the situation where an employee owns a vehicle and either leases it to the employer, or is reimbursed for business mileage.) Policy ï Inland Revenue generally assumes that a shareholder- employee who has access to a company vehicle has unrestricted use of it for private purposes, particularly if s/he has a controlling interest in the company. ï We will assume the vehicle is available for private use unless the company can claim that availability has been restricted, or unless the vehicle is actually unavailable at any time for one or more days, (i.e. due to mechanical breakdown). ï The company may show that a vehicle's availability is partly or completely restricted by: (a) showing details of the restriction, (b) confirming that the shareholder-employee is aware of the restriction, (c) maintaining a vehicle logbook recording both business and private mileage on a daily basis, and (d) producing the vehicle logbook on request as evidence that the restriction has been complied with. ï The company may show that the vehicle was actually unavailable for use for one or more days by: (a) recording in the vehicle logbook the date(s) and reason(s) why the vehicle was unavailable; (b) producing the vehicle logbook on request as evidence that the vehicle was unavailable and that the employee didn't use it during that period. ï When Inland Revenue considers claims that a com- pany vehicle is not available to shareholder-employees for private use, we will particularly look at these factors in the context of the taxpayerís situation: (a) The degree to which the taxpayerís home is connected to the business as a work base, (e.g. areas used for home office or workshop, home as registered office of company, business related telephone usage at home, etc.); (b) The availability and actual use of other transport, including privately owned vehicles and public transport. Examples 1. Unlimited Private Availability Mary has a controlling shareholding in Placeville Books Ltd. She is the only employee of the company. The companyís registered office is at the bookshop in Placeville, although she has an office in her home where she does the books for the business and keeps the company records. She uses the company vehicle for business related travel. She also uses it without restric- tion for private purposes. The GST inclusive cost price of the vehicle was $30,000. The value of the fringe benefit for the income year is 24 % of that price: $30,000 x 24% = $7200 The vehicle is available every day in the income year, and so the whole amount will be liable for tax. The taxable value of Maryís fringe benefit is $7,200. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) records. The company owns a car, which is used primarily for business purposes. May owns a vehicle privately. Mayís home telephone number is listed on her business cards and she frequently travels directly from her home to visit clients outside normal business hours. On behalf of the company, May has written a letter to herself (as the employee), which states that the vehicle may only be used for private purposes on weekdays. A copy of this letter is in the company files. In her capac- ity as employee, May received this letter and has retained it for reference. May maintains a log book in the car recording both the business and private mileage on a daily basis. The logbook helps her to confirm that private use of the vehicle is restricted to the specified times. The GST inclusive cost price of the vehicle was $30,000. The value of the fringe benefit for the income year is 24 % of that price: $30,000 x 24% = $7200 The vehicle is available for private use five days in every week throughout the income year. That proportion of the value will be liable for tax. The taxable value of Maryís fringe benefit is 5/7ths of $7,200, or $5142.86 ReferencesHO 10.F.15.1 Technical Rulings 67.3.4; 67.12.3 Tax Treatment of Employee Home Telephone Costs Summary If an employer pays for an employee's home telephone cost, one of two possible tax liabilities will arise: ï If the employee is liable for the cost of the telephone, but the employer pays it, the employee is liable for income tax on any amount that the employer pays which is not an exempt reimbursing allowance. The employer must deduct PAYE from such amounts. ï If the employer is liable for the cost of the telephone, the proportion of the rental which relates to private use will be subject to Fringe Benefit Tax. We originally stated Inland Revenue's policy on the income tax treatment of these situations in Public Information Bulletin No.137 (July 1985), and on GST treatment in TIB Volume 2 No.3 (October 1990). The following information summarises and clarifies these earlier statements. This policy also applies to the cost of mobile telephones, pagers, fax machines and computer connections sup- plied by employers to their employees at home. Income Tax - Employee liable for telephone account This situation will arise where the account and directory listing are in the employee's name. The employee is principally liable for the cost of the telephone (this will still be so even if the number is listed in the directory as part of the employer's listing, or otherwise advertised as an after hours number for the employer). In many cases, the telephone number will be listed in the directory under both the employer's and the employee's name. Where the employer reimburses the employee for, or otherwise pays the employee's home telephone costs, the payment is monetary remuneration as defined in section 2 of the Income Tax Act 1976, so the employer must deduct PAYE. In this situation, the employer will not be liable for FBT on the payment. If Inland Revenue is satisfied that all or part of the reimbursement or payment by the employer is justified for business purposes, then that part of the amount will be exempt from income tax in the hands of the em- ployee. Section 73 of the Income Tax Act allows for this exemption. 2. No Private Availability Mark has a controlling shareholding in Markís Catering Company Ltd. He operates his business from home using his kitchen and an office. The registered office of the company is at Markís home in Placeville. Mark is the only permanent employee of the company. The company has a delivery van which is parked at Markís home. Mark owns a car in his private capacity. On behalf of the company, Mark has written a letter to himself (as the employee), which states that the delivery van is not to be used for any private purposes. A copy of this letter is in the company files. In his capacity as employee, Mark received this letter and has retained it for reference. Mark maintains a log book in the van recording the business mileage on a daily basis, so that he can confirm that there has been no private use of the van. Mark has no FBT liability in relation to the delivery van, since he can show that it is not available for private use, and that it has not been used for private use. 3. Limited Private Availability May has a controlling shareholding in Placeville Kitchens Ltd. She is the only employee of the company. The companyís registered office is at her home in Placeville. She has an office in her home where she does the books for the business and keeps the company continued on page 5 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) their employer's behalf. The following information summarises and clarifies this information, especially as it applies to reimbursement of home telephone costs. (See the earlier item for more information.) ï Employers who are registered persons may claim GST input tax credits on rental and toll costs that they pay on employees' home telephones, to the extent that: (a) the private phone is used for business purposes, and (b) the employee is reimbursed for actual expendi- ture. ï The employer may not claim an input tax credit if s/he pays the employee a regular allowance, since in this case the employer doesn't incur any GST . There is no direct link between the payment and the actual expenditure. ï The tax invoice requirements of section 24 of the GST Act must be met. Specifically - - The employer must hold the original statement - Where the employer reimburses only part of the invoice amount, s/he must keep details of the amount of that reimbursement - If the invoice from the telephone service provider is for over $200 and is addressed to the employee rather than the employer, Inland Revenue will accept it as long as it meets all the other require- ments of section 24(3) of the GST Act. If an employer pays for the cost of an employee's home telephone, this will normally meet the requirements of section 20 of the GST Act. The employer can claim the input tax credits if s/he is a registered person. Reference:HO†10.A.8.2; 10.A.8.4; 10.F.15.1; GST†A.5.1 Stamp Duty on Forest Sales Summary This item confirms Inland Revenueís policy on the stamp duty treatment of forest sales. Stamp duty is payable on the capital value of both trees and land when selling and purchasing a forest, whether or not the Agreement for Sale and Purchase expresses the values separately. Because some agreements for the sale and purchase of forests give separate values for the land and the trees, some taxpayers think that stamp duty should only apply to the land value. They contend that the trees should be treated like an annual crop and not be subject to stamp duty. Policy Both land and standing timber are covered by the definition of ìlandî in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. This means that the value of the land and of the standing timber are both subject to Stamp Duty, even if they are specified separately in the Agreement for Sale and Purchase. Stamp duty and income tax treatments The stamp duty treatment of forestry differs from the income tax treatment. Stamp duty applies to instruments (documents) dealing with interests in land. These use the common law treatment of land interests, which from page 4 Income Tax - Employer liable for telephone account Where the employer contracts directly with the tel- ephone service provider, payment of the rental and toll accounts is a fringe benefit. Any amount that cannot be justified as an exempt allowance will be subject to FBT. In this situation, the employee will not be liable for income tax on any amount the employer pays. Income Tax - Exemption In both situations, whether Inland Revenue is satisfied that the reimbursements or payments are justified will be a question of fact. Factors we will consider are the type of business that the employer is running, the seniority and responsibilities of the employee, and how much the phone is used for business purposes outside normal office hours. Income Tax records that employer must keep Employers must keep a schedule of employees for whom they pay the rental of a home telephone. This schedule must be kept with FBT and PAYE records, and it must contain these details: ï employee's name and address ï amount of employer contribution to telephone cost ï statement of the employment-related use of the telephone GST - Clarification of earlier TIB article TIB Volume Two, No.3 (October 1990) dealt with the GST treatment of expenditure that employees incur on 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Valuation of Land Act 1951. This means it includes all trees growing or standing on the land in question. Stamp duty on the sale of a forest is therefore levied on the value of both the land and the trees. Comparison of Stamp Duty Treatment of Timber-cutting Rights It is useful to compare the stamp duty treatment of timber-cutting rights with that of forest sales. Timber cutting rights may constitute: (a) a leasehold interest in the land; (b) a licence (deemed a lease - section 8(c) of the Act); (c) a legal or equitable profit a prendre, whether under common law or the Forestry Rights Registration Act 1983. All such interests are liable to lease duty under the Act, as if they were leasehold interests in land. This is consistent with an acceptance that the forests to which they relate are part of the land. Conclusion When land and the forest on it are sold, stamp duty is levied on the value of both the land and the standing timber. Examples 1. Woodlot Ltd enters into a contract to purchase a forest block planted in three year old pinus radiata. The Agreement for Sale and Purchase itemises the value of the transaction as follows: Land Value:$48,000 (plus GST) Tree Value:$102,000 (plus GST) Total Value:$150,000 (plus GST) $168,750 (inc. GST) Stamp Duty (Conveyance Duty) of $2,626.00 is levied on the GST inclusive total value at 1% for the first $50,000, 1.5% for the second $50,000, and 2% on the balance. 2. SilviCo Ltd purchases the registered forestry right in a block of land planted in four year old eucalyptus botryoides with the intention of milling them for hardwood in twenty five years. The purchase price is $23,000, (plus GST). The annual payment for the forestry right is $3,000 (plus GST). Stamp duty of $230.00 is levied on the purchase price. References: H.O.9.4.; 9.6. treats trees growing on land as part of that land. An exception is where land is sold subject to timber-cutting rights - these rights are then subject to lease duty. The common and general law distinction between forests and crops applies for stamp duty purposes because the definition of ìlandî in the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 (ìthe Actî) does not displace this common/general law treatment - unlike the income tax treatment of forestry operations. Forestry and Property Law Common law recognises that forests are typically managed on a long term basis to maximize wood production. Therefore when trees that are sold remain in the ground for the benefit of the purchaser, they are treated as part of the land to which they are attached (Marshall v Green (1876) 1 CPD 35 and in CT v Kauri Timber Co (1899) 17 NZLR 696 approved in Kauri Timber Co v CT (1840-1932) NZPCC 636 \[1913\] AC 721). This differs from annual crops and other ëshort termí produce (including fruit trees, vines and other plantings cultivated for their crop), which are treated as chattels and are transferable separately from the land. This distinction is reflected in the stamp duty treatment of instruments evidencing transactions in those property rights. Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 Section 10(a) in Part II of the Act creates a liability to pay stamp duty to the Crown on conveyances and leases of land. Section 2 of the Act defines ìlandî to include buildings, appurtenances and improvements, together with any estate or interest in land (whether legal or equitable, corporeal or incorporeal). Since this is an inclusive definition, the Land Transfer Act 1952 (which regulates the creation and transfer of estates and interests in land) is relevant. It defines land to include ì... plantations, ... and all trees and timber thereon or thereunder lying or being, unless specially excepted.î Part III of the Act says how to calculate the stamp duty liability created under Part II, and that for this purpose ìlandî has the same meaning as in the Valuation of Land Act 1951. That Act defines ìlandî to mean ìall land ... and all trees growing or standing thereonî. Part III of the Act quantifies the same liability that has been created by section 10(a), so the meaning of ìlandî in the Act must include the meaning given it by the 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Taxation of Clubs, Societies, etc Restatement of Inland Revenue's Policy Summary This item reaffirms Inland Revenueís policy on the taxation of clubs, societies, and other similar non-profit organisations. We have received many enquiries about our policy on taxation of these groups. This is partly because we published a new information booklet - ìClubs and Societies - a tax guide for all clubs, societies, non-profit bodies, associations, and other groupsî (IR†254) in July 1992. Restatement of Policy Inland Revenue has consistently adopted the policy that clubs and societies are not assessable on member transactions. These are also known as trading ìwithin the circle of membershipî. Due to the level of interest in this issue, we are reaffirm- ing this longstanding policy. Our policy is that clubs and societies are not assessable on member transactions, or on non-member transactions that meet certain criteria. These criteria are that: a) the transactions are conducted on premises under the control of the particular non-profit organisation; and b) the non-member transactions are indistinguishable from member transactions; and c) the relevant activities are conducted substantially for the enjoyment and participation of members. In practice this policy is limited to non-members who are bona fide guests, members of other clubs enjoying reciprocal rights, and potential members being intro- duced to the facilities. The policy recognises the practical problems of differen- tiating between member and non-member transactions. It also reflects previous advice to non-profit organisa- tions that Inland Revenue would not seek to tax transac- tions within the ìcircle of membershipî, such as bar takings. Examples of the type of transactions to which the policy applies are bar and kitchen takings, raffles and other fundraising conducted primarily with members, and proceeds from gaming machines after allowing for gaming machine duty. Generally, these transactions meet the criteria listed above. The policy does not extend to transactions with non- members that can clearly be distinguished. Examples of these include rental of facilities and interest income. There are specific exemptions within the Income Tax Act 1976 that may apply to clubs and societies. For example, section 61(34) exempts the first $1,000 of income derived by any society, association, or organisa- tion which is a non-profit body. Section 61(30) exempts income derived by an amateur sports promoter. Both sections only apply where members are prohibited from obtaining any private gain. This item is a reaffirmation of our current policy. All policy statements may be subject to amendment at a later stage. However, we will continue to apply this policy at least until the end of the 1993/94 income year.

We've published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts.

We apply several tests laid down by the general law to work out the correct employment status of staff. They include: • Control - who controls how and when the work is done, who has the right to suspend or dismiss, and who is responsible for quality and pricing; • Integration - is the type of work or the way it is done the same as work per- formed by other staff who are employees? Is the work an integral part of the employer’s business? • Independence - does the worker supply all the necessary tools? Does s/he work from home? Is s/he free to work for other people as well? • Intention - how are the payments for the work made? Did the worker carry out the same activity as a self-employed person (or an employee) in the past? Is the worker being treated as self-employed? continued on page 9 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) • Economic reality - does the type or nature of the business justify employing an independent contractor? Overall, we look at who has control over the work done, and how and where it is done. If the answer is the employer then the worker is almost certainly an employee. Employers who attempt to opt out of their PAYE obligations by putting staff on contract should ensure that those staff actually meet the tests outlined above and are in fact contractors. Employers may face claims for PAYE not deducted plus additional tax if Inland Revenue considers that the staff are actually employees. The Tax Education Office Newsletter No.63 (November 1992) reproduces Inland Revenue's checksheets for determining self-employed or employee status. These also appear in our “Self-employed or an employee?” booklet, which will be available shortly. Reference: HO.TPAH115 Treatment of Income Received by Trade Unions and Employer Organisations Section 61 - Incomes exempt from tax: A trade unionist asked whether trade unions and employer organisations are liable for tax on income they receive. Before 1 April 1992 trade unions and employer associations were considered friendly societies, so any income they earned from within the circle of their membership was exempt from tax under section 61(23). At that time the friendly society definition in the Income Tax Act included any society incorporated under any Act relating to industrial unions, industrial associations, or trade unions. From 15 May 1991 employer associations and trade unions ceased to qualify as friendly societies, since the Employment Contracts Act 1991 repealed the Labour Relations Act 1987 from that date. The Employment Contracts Act provided that any organisation or association that was previously registered under the Labour Relations Act would become an incorporated society registered under the Incor- porated Societies Act 1908. Since the Incorporated Societies Act didn't relate specifically to industrial unions or associations, or to trade unions, all of these groups ceased to qualify for the friendly society tax exemption for income de- rived from within the circle of their membership. As a transitional measure, section 61(23A) exempted income earned between 15 May 1991 and 31 March 1992 by trade unions, employer organisations, and associations registered (or deemed to be registered) under the Labour Relations Act. This exemption didn't apply to income these groups earned from business carried on outside their circle of membership. From 1 April 1992 all income of these organisations became assessable. They could qualify as “non-profit bodies”, in which case $1,000 of their income is exempt if they meet the requirements of section 61(34). To qualify for this ex- emption, an organisation would have to establish that: (a) no proprietor, member or shareholder received any profit or gain from the organisation; and (b) its governing rules prohibit distribution of money or any property to these people.

The interest will be deductible under section 106 (1)(h)(ia) if the company uses the loan to replace capital which it used to earn assessable income. The test for deductibility is satisfied if the interest is payable in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. The article on pages 14 - 18 of TIB Volume Three, No.9 gives full information on this topic. Reference: HO.TPPO3O Depreciation on Computer Equipment used on Board Research Vessels Section 108 - Depreciation Allowance: A taxpayer asked about the correct depreciation rate for computer hardware on board research vessels. The correct rate for computer hardware is 20% of the diminishing value (“DV”). On 16 December 1991 the Government announced the introduction of a 25% loading which applies to current depreciation rates. This means that all qualify- ing assets (including computer hardware) purchased and first used between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) qualifies for the loading. Tax- payers can claim depreciation deductions at one and a quarter times the normal rate for any particular class of asset. For example - Computer hardware bought on 1 January 1992 with a depreciation rate of 20% DV would be subject to the loading. This increases the applicable depreciation rate to 25% DV. We are currently reviewing Inland Revenue's depreciation rates because of the new depreciation regime in the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No.11). We will publicise the results in an upcoming TIB as soon as they are available. Reference: H.O.TPP042 Income of a Relieving Teacher from the United States Section 242 - Income Subject to Tax in New Zealand: An American relief teacher who was employed by a school in New Zealand for one year applied for a refund of taxes paid while he was in this country. He based his refund claim on what he called a “mutually reciprocating agreement” between the United States and New Zealand. Income derived in New Zealand is subject to tax in New Zealand. In some cases there may be relief from tax in New Zealand under a Double Taxation Agree- ment between New Zealand and the other country in question. The Double Taxation Relief (United States of America) Order 1983 does not contain any specific reference to the taxation of teachers. However, Article 15 does contemplate the taxation in New Zealand of income earned from depend- ent personal services (generally meaning income from employment) performed in New Zealand. continued on page 11 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) In this case the tax paid will not be refunded as the income is derived from dependent personal services performed in New Zealand. However, if the teacher wanted to check that the correct amount of tax was deducted, he could file a tax return in New Zealand. Reference: H.O.TPPO17 Non-Resident Receiving Income Section 316 - Requirement to furnish Statements of Non-Resident Withholding Tax (NRWT) Deducted: A non-resident taxpayer received non resident with- holding income. He asked whether Inland Revenue had to send him a NRWT certificate showing the tax deducted. Inland Revenue’s Non-Resident centre in Dunedin verifies NRWT certificates, then returns them to the “payer”. That payer should in turn return the certificate to the recipient, although there is no legal requirement for the payer to do so. Reference: HO.TPPOO3 Resident Withholding Tax on Government Stock Section 327 - Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) Deductions: An investor asked why the maturity proceeds of his Government Stock investment had withhold- ing tax deducted, and when he could claim the RWT deducted. The Reserve Bank issued stock at tender in July 1987 for $18,378 with a face value of $19,000. This means the stock was issued at a discount of $622. The taxpayer (investor) acquired the stock at a later stage. The interest or coupon rate was 14% per annum payable every six months. This amounted to gross interest of $1,330 half-yearly. The net interest paid was $1,010.80 after deducting withholding tax of $319.20 (24 cents in the dollar). When the stock matured in July 1992, the taxpayer expected to receive the face value of $19,000 plus a half-yearly net interest payment of $1,010.80, making a total of $20,010.80. The amount he received on maturity was $19,861.52, as $149.28 withholding tax was deducted from the discount of $622.00 at the date of issue. Withholding tax was deducted from both the half yearly interest payment and the discount, as interest for RWT purposes specifically includes a redemption payment (that is, a discount). The investor can claim a credit in his return for the withholding tax deducted from the July 1992 half yearly interest payment and for the withholding tax deducted from the discount on issue of the stock. Reference: HO.TGC100FF Qualifying Companies' Imputation Credit Accounts Section 393M - Dividends from Qualifying Company: An accountant asked whether a credit balance in an Imputation Credit Account (“ICA”) is affected when a company elects to become a qualifying company. He also asked whether Inland Revenue would have any objections if a company paid dividends to clear any credit balance in its ICA before electing to become a qualifying company. The credit balance in the ICA is unaffected by the election to become a qualifying company. In addition, the 66% shareholder continuity requirement to carry forward imputation credits does not apply to qualifying companies. from page 10 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Inland Revenue has no objections if a company wants to pay dividends to elimi- nate its credit ICA balance before it elects to become a qualifying company. However, this action is not generally necessary because if dividends are “un- paid” and there are sufficient ICA credits, they will not attract qualifying com- pany election tax (“QCET”). For example: If the Appropriation account has $67.00 and the ICA has a $33.00 credit, under the QCET formula provided in section 393K, the calculation would be: ( $67 + $33 - 0 - 33/.33 ) x 0.33 = 0 Therefore no QCET would be payable. In the 1992-93 transitional year any dividends paid to clear the ICA must have been paid, distributed, credited or dealt with in the shareholder's interest or behalf before the start of that income year - that is, before 1 April 1992. When calculating QCET, remember that the ICA will be affected by any tax payable or refundable for a previous year (section 393K(2)(e)). Also, paying QCET will raise a credit in the ICA. Reference: HO.TPAH127 Unused Dividend Imputation Credits Converted to Loss to Carry Forward Section 394ZE - Credit of Tax for Imputation Credit: A shareholder in a com- pany asked whether any unused portion of any dividend imputation credit could be refunded to her in cash. The imputation credit attached to a dividend is available as a tax credit for offset against the shareholder’s income tax liability. Section 394ZE(3) specifically pre- vents excess imputation credits from being refunded to a shareholder. This is because the imputation credit is part of the income tax that the company has paid, so it cannot be directly refunded to the shareholder. This is why any excess in a particular year must be converted into a tax loss and carried forward for offset against future income. Reference: HO.TPAH128 Election to meet Dividend Withholding Payment Liability by Reducing Loss Section 394ZN - Election Procedure: A company asked whether the Commis- sioner could allow an extension of time for it to elect to meet its dividend with- holding payment liability by reducing its losses. Section 394ZN requires an election to be made within 20 days of the end of the quarter in which the company received the dividend. (This is the same time limit that the company has to pay the dividend withholding payment.) The legislation does not allow the Commissioner to give an extension of time, so the company must elect within the 20 days if at all. If the company does not elect or pay the dividend withholding payment within this time limit, additional tax will be charged under section 394ZN(4). Reference: HO.TPAH119 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Charge of Aiding and Abetting against Practitioners where Taxpayers fail to furnish a Return Section 416 - Offence not to furnish returns: A practitioner asked whether Inland Revenue would take legal action against practitioners whom taxpayers allege have failed to furnish a return on their behalf. The offence of failing to furnish a tax return is an absolute liability offence. This means that even if a taxpayer engages a practitioner to file his/her return, the taxpayer remains ultimately responsible for filing the return. If a taxpayer fails to file a return Inland Revenue may take action against the agent under the aiding and abetting provisions (see IRD v Thomas (1990) 12 NZTC 7,005 at p.7,011). However, we will consider each case on its own merits. We cannot use the aiding and abetting provisions against a practitioner merely as a back-up where we have been unsuccessful in gaining a conviction against a defaulting taxpayer. Reference: HO.TPAH101 Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Building Permit Fees Section 10 - Value of Supply of Goods and Services: A taxpayer asked Inland Revenue to confirm that the local City Council was correct in charging GST on their building permit fees. Section 8 of the GST Act requires registered persons to charge GST on any sup- ply (except exempt supplies) of goods and services in the course or furtherance of their taxable activities in New Zealand. Section 6 includes the activities of a local authority in the definition of taxable activity. This means the Council must register for GST and charge GST on the supply of building permits. Reference: H.O.TPP025 Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1968 First Farm Stamp Duty Exemption Section 22B - No Conveyance Duty Payable on Conveyance of First Farm: A farmer asked whether his wife’s interest in their present farm should be com- bined with his own, for the purpose of working out whether they qualified for the first farm exemption from Conveyance Duty. The value of their combined interest in their present farm exceeded $150,000. To qualify for the exemption, the person to whom the farm land is conveyed must not hold, or previously have held, any “substantial interest” in farm land (a “substantial interest” is one with a value of over $150,000). A person will not qualify for the exemption if his/her spouse holds or has held any substantial interest in farm land. Under this Act a husband and wife are treated as one person when determining if they have jointly held a substantial interest in farm land. It is not their single and separate interests that must be considered in determining whether a sub- stantial interest in a first farm applies (see Case M20 (1990) 12 NZTC 2 129). In this case the taxpayers cannot claim the conveyance duty exemption for a first farm because they already have a substantial interest in farm land.

Summary:This case concerned expenditure on developing farming and rental properties. The taxpayer’s development costs were only preparatory to an income earning process; they weren't in the course of the process. Nevertheless, Judge Barber considered the taxpayer had purchased the properties for the purpose of resale, and that they were held on the revenue account. This meant that any expendi- ture incurred on the properties was deductible. Facts:A lecturer reduced his teaching position from full time to part time to spend more time developing his farming and rental properties. His primary income over the relevant period was derived from lecturing. There was no farming income other than small amounts from grazing and from the rental of a beach house. The Commissioner only allowed deductions to the extent of that income. Although the objector spent considerable time and money in developing the 2 farm properties (1.05 and 28.8 Ha respectively), they were never viable economic units. He later sold one of them at minimal profit. The other was on the market at the date of the hearing. The objector maintained that he undertook all his activities on the properties for business purposes with the intention of making a profit. Since the relevant period, he had moved to another area, bought and sold 20Ha as a potential lifestyle block, and then purchased another 68Ha block. Throughout the relevant period he had appraised other properties for purchase and development but had been unable to obtain finance to purchase them. Decision:The expenditure on developing the farming and rental properties was only preparatory to an income earning process. Under old principles, it would not have been deductible. However, since the objector acquired the properties with a purpose of resale, the Authority applied the Inglis and Stockwell decisions. The Authority held that the objector’s expenditure on the farm properties must be regarded as being in respect of circulating capital held on the revenue account. Accordingly, the expenditure on the circulating capital was deductible. Comments:The Commissioner is appealing this case.

Facts:The salesman worked for a firm of real estate agents and was paid on a commis- sion only basis. The expenses he claimed were primarily motor vehicle expenses, depreciation, telephone and seminar expenses, and his Real Estate Institute subscription. Decision:Judge Willy held that the salesman’s position with his employer was not materi- ally different from those of the licensed salespersons in the case Challenge Realty Ltd v CIR (1990) 12 NZTC 7212.

Facts:This was an appeal by the taxpayers from a judgment of the Court of Appeal. The taxpayer assigned part of his share of income from a professional partner- ship to his family trust. The question before the Privy Council was whether the assignment of income was effective to transfer the tax liability from the taxpayer (the partner in the firm) to the trustees of the family trust (the assignee). Decision:The Privy Council upheld the Court of Appeal's judgment. Their Lordships were in complete agreement with the conclusion that the income is derived by the person whose personal exertion earns it. Therefore, they held the deed of assign- ment to be ineffective in transferring the tax liability to the assignee. Note that by implication, their Lordships accepted that there may well be a valid assignment of income and transfer of tax liability to an assignee where a part- ner's right in a professional partnership depends upon a proprietary interest in the partnership, and not on personal exertion. continued on page 17 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) Their Lordships, after reaching the conclusion that the assignment was ineffec- tive, did not find it necessary to deal with arguments on the proper construction of section 10 or the application of section 99.

The assessments were based on funds deposited in the taxpayer’s bank account by another party. Facts:P deposited a large sum of money in the taxpayer’s personal account over a three year period. The taxpayer claimed that P had approached him to deposit money in the ac- count for safe keeping. P claimed that he was an employee of the taxpayer and that the money belonged to the taxpayer. Decision:The issue was who the income belonged to. In making his decision, Judge Barber had to assess the credibility of the oppos- ing evidence from the taxpayer and P. On the balance of probabilities, the tax- payer was held to have acted as a trustee for P. The deposits had not been de- rived from his business. Judgment was fully in favour of the taxpayer.

The cases were put forward as test cases to resolve an issue that was com- mon to all members of that Federation. Private Treaty Wool Merchants purchase wool directly from farmers, both at the farm and at the merchant’s store. They purchase all types of wool from farmers, including poorer qualities and small quantities of wool. The issue in this case was whether wool is a secondhand good for the purposes of the GST Act. If it is, then the wool merchants would be able to claim an input tax credit for all wool they purchase from non-registered persons. There have been several amendments to the definition of secondhand goods since the GST Act was enacted in 1985. However, the wool merchants claim that wool falls within the present definition of “secondhand goods”. They argued that the definition has lost its ordinary meaning and has taken on a technical meaning because of the purpose of the input tax credit mechanism. This argu- continued on page 19 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) ment was based on the premise that GST is a neutral tax for business and is only borne by the ultimate consumer. They also argued that the meaning of the present definition was no different from the meaning of the original definition in the enacting legislation. They considered the amendments to the definition to be merely machinery provisions without substantial effect. Decision:The High Court confirmed that the taxpayers’ claim for an input tax credit should have been disallowed. Judge Greig rejected the taxpayers’ argument that the definition had taken on a technical meaning due to the input tax credit mechanism. Instead, he held that the legislation singled out secondhand goods for special treatment. If the inten- tion had been otherwise, then the phrase secondhand goods would not have been used. The Judge did not accept that the amendments to the definition were merely machinery provisions without subsequent effect. He concluded that the history of the legislation effectively repealed the original descriptive provision and replaced it with the ordinary meaning of the phrase. Comments:This case is notable for its interpretation of the term secondhand goods. It also provides a useful discussion of the legislative history of the “secondhand goods” definition in the GST Act. We do not know whether the taxpayers will be appealing this decision.

However, at this stage the notices should not be drawn too widely nor should they seek to obtain tax advisers’ advice on the conduct of the investigation or their client’s position. Further, the Commissioner cannot demand the delivery of the documents to the officers of the Inland Revenue Department. Facts:After investigating a taxpayer, Inland Revenue issued notices under section 17, requesting information from the taxpayer’s accountant and solicitor. These notices were sent more than a year after assessments had been made and ob- jected to. The accountant and the solicitor refused to comply with these notices. They sought a judicial review of the Commissioner’s decision to issue the notices on the following grounds: from page 18 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.8 (April 1993) (a) Whether the Commissioner can use section 17 notices to obtain further information after an assessment or in contemplation of litigation; (b) Whether the request to produce “all” documents complied with section 17 when only a limited number of documents were being sought; (c) Whether the notices were outside the scope of the section since they pur- ported to require production of the appellant’s documents rather than the company’s documents; (d) Whether the Commissioner can require the documents to be delivered to the Inland Revenue Department. The High Court decided for the Commissioner on the first three issues, but found in favour of the applicants on the fourth issue. The Applicants appealed this decision on all three points and the Commissioner cross appealed on the fourth point. Decision:The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal of the Applicants and dismissed the Commissioner’s cross appeal. In delivering their judgment, the Court of Appeal concluded: (a) Notices may be used to acquire further information after the assessment process or in contemplation of litigation. (b) Depending on the stage of the investigation, the Commissioner must take care not to draw notices too widely. The Court may intervene if the notice is too broad and is established as not relevant to the investigation. (c) Generally, tax advisers' opinions and advice on the conduct of the investiga- tion and the client’s position after the investigation has commenced are not relevant to the Commissioner’s inquiries. This information should generally be excluded from section 17 notices. (d) The Commissioner cannot stipulate a place where the documents should be delivered. It is sufficient for the taxpayer to produce the information at his/her own premises. Comments:This decision will not be appealed.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) New Tax Legislation Several Revenue Acts were enacted on 1 April 1993. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1993 amends the Income Tax Act 1976. It results from the passing of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No 11), which contained the new depreciation regime. The remaining six Acts resulted from the Taxation Reform Bill (No 6) which was introduced into Parliament in December 1992 : The Income Tax Amendment Act (No 2) 1993 amends the Income Tax Act 1976. Among the more significant reforms contained within it are: ï new rules governing the deductibility of business entertainment expenditure ï a new regime for the valuation of livestock for tax purposes ï changes to the existing regime for the taxation of international income ï better structured and simplified legislation for the calculation of provisional tax ï taxation of lump sum retiring allowances as income ï a new tax treatment of the profit and interest elements of hire purchase agreements ï amendments to the dividend definition ï a number of other remedial issues The Estate Duty Abolition Act 1993 amends the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 by abolishing Estate Duty on the estates of people dying on or after 17 December 1992 The Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1993 amends the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 The Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1993 amends the Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 1993 amends the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 The Child Support Amendment Act 1993 amends the Child Support Act 1991 Contents Estate Duty Abolished ......................................... 2 Depreciation .......................................................... 2 Provisional Tax ................................................... 11 Tax Treatment of Business Entertainment Expenditure ......................... 14 Foreign Investment Fund Regime ................... 23 Non-Dividend Repatriations ............................ 33 Changes to the CFC Regime ............................. 34 Western Samoan Tax Credit Scheme .............. 35 Livestock Valuation ........................................... 36 Retiring Allowances ........................................... 37 Hire Purchase Agreements ............................... 38 Dividend Definition ........................................... 42 Consolidation ...................................................... 46 FBT and Promissory Notes ............................... 47 FBT and the $75 Exemption .............................. 48 Overfunded Employer Superannuation Schemes Excluded from Life Insurance Taxation Regime ........................................... 48 Pre-Accrual Financial Arrangements of Superannuation Funds and Life Insurance Companies ..................................................... 49 Family Support Tax Credits ............................. 49 Accident Compensation Levy, Earner Premium and Employer Premium - Year when Deductible ...................................................... 50 Local Authority Trading Enterprise Definition ....................................................... 50 Southland Electric Power Supply .................... 51 Unit Trust and Group Investment Fund Redemptions .................................................. 51 FBT Anti-Avoidance Provision ........................ 51 Imputation Credits Attached to Notional Dividends ....................................................... 52 Rebate for Gifts of Money - Charitable Donee Status for five Organisations .......... 52 Tax Status of New Zealand Conservation Corps and Access Training Allowances ... 52 Annual Confirmation of Rates ......................... 52 Minor Amendments ........................................... 53 GST on the Export of Secondhand Goods ...... 53 Recovery of GST ................................................. 54 GST-Zero-Rated Goods ..................................... 54 Road User Charges and GST ............................ 54 Disclosure of Information to Social Welfare for Determining Entitlement to the Community Services Card .......................... 54 Computer-Generated Assessments ................. 55 Student Loan Scheme Amendments ............... 55 Child Support: Transfer of Cases from Liable Parent Contribution Scheme ....................... 55 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Estate Duty Abolished Estate Duty Abolition Act 1993 Estate duty has been abolished on the estates of people dying on or after 17†December 1992. On 17 December 1992 the Government announced that estate duty would be abolished from that date, and that amending legislation would be included in the next taxation reform bill. This legislation has been passed, so no Estate Duty is payable on the estate of anyone who dies on or after 17†December 1992. There will therefore no longer be a requirement for grants of administration to be sent to Inland Revenue, or for administrators to file statements with the Depart- ment. In the interim, Inland Revenue has been releasing grants of administration on the basis of an undertaking by the administrator that sufficient funds will be withheld from any distribution to beneficiaries to enable the payment of estate duty if the legislation was not enacted. These arrangements will obviously no longer apply, and Inland Revenue will not be enforcing any of the undertakings provided. Application Date The legislation generally applies from 17 December 1992. The amendment which removes the obligation on Registrars of the Court to send grants of administration to Inland Revenue applies from 1 April 1993. Depreciation Sections 107A - 108O, 111 and 117, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The new depreciation regime is based on the Valabh Committeeís recommendations, and achieves a number of important goals. First, it strengthens the taxpayers' rights by introducing a clear statutory base for the regime. Deductions are now a statutory entitlement; they are no longer at the Commissioner's discretion. For the first time, the criteria under which rates are set and the right of taxpayers to apply for a different rate are set down in statute. Secondly, the regime includes a number of new features to reduce the compliance costs that taxpayers face. For most assets, taxpayers will be able to choose be- tween diminishing value and straight line methods of depreciation. Another new feature of this regime is the pool method of depreciation, under which a taxpayer can depreciate a number of low value assets collectively rather than individually. The facility to write off asset purchases of less than $200 is included, and taxpayers may also apply to write off the remaining value of assets which can no longer be used. Thirdly, certain intangible assets and land improve- ments have been brought into the depreciation regime. A permanent 20% loading is available for new assets purchased after the start of the 1995-96 income year. A transitional regime applies before then, under which assets purchased between 1 April 1993 and the end of the 1994-95 income year can be depreciated at either the new economic rate or the rate set under the previous regime. If the asset is new, the rate under the old regime will include the 25% interim loading. Application dates Because the new depreciation regime achieves a number of different objectives, there are several application dates. For standard balance date taxpayers, all sections of the new regime come into force on 1†April 1993. All aspects of the regime are therefore available to these taxpayers except section 108F, which requires assets acquired in the 1995-96 and subsequent years to be depreciated at the economic rate, with a 20% loading for eligible assets. For intangible assets, all aspects of the new regime come into force on 1 April 1993, regardless of a taxpay- er's balance date. Early balance date taxpayers can apply all aspects of the regime from the start of their 1993-94 income year, except those sections which relate to the application of the economic rate. Those sections come into force on a strictly 1†April 1993 basis for all taxpayers. The consequence of this is that early balance date taxpayers will be depreciating all assets under the provisions of the new regime from the start of their 1993-94 income year, but must depreciate at the rates which the Commissioner currently allows. The excep- tion to this rule is assets acquired after 1 April 1993, which may be depreciated at the new economic rate. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Late balance date taxpayers There are special provisions so that late balance date taxpayers are not disadvantaged. These taxpayers may choose to depreciate assets acquired after 1†April 1993 at the economic rate. However, the other provisions of the regime are not available to these taxpayers until the start of their 1993-94 income year. Statutory entitlement for depreciation - section 108 The core provision of this regime provides that any depreciable property shall be depreciated in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Depreciable property is property which, if used to produce assessable income, can be depreciated. It is defined in detail in section 107A. Generally speaking, depreciable property is all the property which the Commissioner has previously allowed to be depreciated under the Act. It is property which declines in value, but does not include land or property for which a deduction is otherwise available under the Act. Certain intangible assets can now be depreciated (see discussion elsewhere) as can certain land improvements. Depreciable land improvements are listed in the 21st Schedule and depreciable intangible assets in the 22nd Schedule. No depreciation deduction may be made in the year property is sold. This is because for most types of assets, a final adjustment must be made under section 117 in the year of sale. There is an exception to this rule for assets for which no final adjustment is made under section 117 - buildings and schedule depreciable property (see discussion elsewhere). The depreciation deduction is now mandatory - taxpay- ers cannot defer it or claim only part of it. The section applies regardless of section 106(1)(a), which disallows any deduction for loss of capital. Calculating the deduction - section 108A A number of formulae are used for calculating deduc- tions for depreciation in different circumstances. The basic formula is: a x b x † c† 12 where a is the depreciation rate b is the adjusted tax value (if using the diminishing value method) or cost (if using the straight line method) c is the number of months in the income year during which the taxpayer held the property. This increases or reduces the deduction both when the asset was only owned for part of the year, and when the taxpayerís income year was shorter or longer than 12 months. Adjusted tax value is a fundamental concept in the new depreciation regime. In section 107A, adjusted tax value is defined as base price minus aggregate deductions. For assets owned at the end of the 1992-93 income year, base price will generally be the tax book value at the end of that year. For assets acquired after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year, base price will generally be cost. In some cases, base price will be market value. This happens if the asset was not depreciable when the taxpayer first owned it, but becomes depreciable some time after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year. This rule does not apply to buildings or schedule depreciable property. Example 1 Tracey Paku bought a car in 1991 for $10,000. In July 1993 she leaves her job as an accountant and sets up in business as a driving instructor. She intends to use her car in the business. The base price of the car is its market value in July 1993 - $8,500. To calculate adjusted tax value, deduct the aggregate deductions from the base value. Aggregate deductions are all those depreciation deductions that would have been taken if the property had been used wholly for deriving assessable income from the time which base value was determined. ï For property used in a business at the end of the 1992- 93 income year, this calculation begins to run from the start of the 1993-94 income year. ï For property bought after the end of the 1992-93 income year, the calculation runs from the date on which the property was bought. ï For property originally not depreciable but brought into a business in New Zealand after the start of the 1993-94 income year, the calculation runs from the beginning of the month in which the property became depreciable. Example 2 Andrew Marks Movers own a bulldozer which at the end of the 1992-93 income year had a tax book value of $80, 000. The rate is 25% diminishing value, and the bulldozer was owned for the entire 1993-94 income year. The calculation is therefore: 25% x $80,000 x 12 = $20,000 12 AMM will therefore claim a deduction of $20 000 on account of the bulldozer. At the beginning of the 1994-95 income year, the new adjusted tax value will be $80 000 - $20 000 = $60 000. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) nism, and if all non-business use of property is subject to fringe benefit tax then no further apportionment is required for depreciation purposes. The formula for this property is d x †f† g where: d is the amount of deduction calculated using the formula a x b x c/12 f represents the total of units for which the property was used for business use, (and where appropriate, the number of units the property was not actually used but was available for business use) g represents the total units for which the property was either actually used or was available to be used. This formula requires an apportionment to be made between business and other use. Any units of measure- ment which seem appropriate can be used, such as days, months, or kilometres. However, the units chosen must be units which measure the different uses accurately. Example 5 Mr OíDeals is a self-employed car dealer. He owns a caravan and in 1993 he used it as a sales office for 8 months while a new office was being built. His family took the caravan on holiday for one month in the summer. For the rest of the year the caravan wasn't used at all. At the start of the income year the caravan had a written-down value of $3,500, and because it was bought before 16†December 1991 the appropriate diminishing value rate is 20%. First, applying the formula a x b x c/12 $3500 x 20% x 12/12 = $700. Second, applying the formula d x f/g Item f is: 8 months as sales office; ††3 months not used but available for the busi- ness; 11 months total Applying the formula d x f/g $700 x 11/12 = $642 The deduction for depreciation is therefore $642. Note that this section does not apply to property being depreciated under the pool regime, which has its own set of rules. Depreciation methods - section 108B This deals with the application of the three different depreciation methods. All tangible property may be depreciated using either the straight line or the dimin- ishing value method. This includes property which was originally depreciated under the legislation in force before the start of the 1993-94 income year. Depreciable from page 3 Example 3 Andrew Marks Movers purchase a new bulldozer on 16 September 1993 for $200 000. Assuming AMM elect to use the interim rate (see discussion below) the applicable depreciation rate is 25%. If AMM is a standard balance date company, the bulldozer was owned for 7 months of that income year - Septem- ber through to March. No apportionment is required for the ownership for only a part of September. The calculation is: 25% x $200,000 x †7† = $29,167 12 The depreciation claim is therefore $29,167. The new adjusted tax value at the start of the 1994-95 income year is $200 000 - $29 167 = $170,833. The adjusted tax value of the property may itself be the deduction if this value is so low that applying the formula would result in a deduction greater than the adjusted tax value. There is special provision for depreciable property that is a motor vehicle to which sections 106B to 106E apply. These are motor vehicles owned by self-employed people or partnerships who must keep a logbook to establish the proportion of business to private use. These taxpayers are required to apply the formula: d x e where d is the amount of deduction calculated using the a x b x c/12 formula e is the proportion of business to private use calculated in accordance with sections 106B to 106E. Example 4 Ms MacReal is a self-employed salesperson. She has calculated under sections 106B to 106E that her car is 85% used for business purposes. The carís opening tax book value is $18,000, and she owns it for the entire 1993-94 income year. She bought the car second-hand in 1992, so the applicable depre- ciation rate is 20%. First, applying the formula a x b x c/12: $18,000 x 20% x 12/12 = $3,600. Second, applying the formula d x e: $3,600 x 0.85 = $3,060. The deduction for depreciation is therefore $3,060. However, the adjusted tax value of the car reduces by the full $3,600 to $14,400. There is also an apportionment calculation for other mixed-use property. Note, however, that this does not include use for which fringe benefit tax is payable. Fringe benefit tax is itself an apportionment mecha- 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) intangible property can also be depreciated using either method provided it is not fixed life intangible property, which can only be depreciated using the straight line method. The following chart shows equivalent straight line and diminishing value rates. For some assets, the precise rate used will not appear on the chart.

A container bought between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 will also be eligible for the interim loading of 25%. This brings the diminishing value rate to 18.75%. To find the alternative straight line depreciation rate: 1. find the nearest rate to 18.75% in the diminish- ing value rate column of the chart above - which is 19% 2. ascertain the equivalent straight line rate - which is 12.5%. A taxpayer who elects to use the straight line or dimin- ishing value method in any particular year may not change methods after filing that year's tax return, but can make a different election in a subsequent year. If a taxpayer elects to pool property, that property must be pooled for as long as that taxpayer owns it, so an election to pool is effectively permanent. If a taxpayer switches any property from the diminish- ing value method to the straight line method, it must be depreciated under the straight line method by writing off in equal annual instalments the adjusted tax value at the time of switching to the straight line method. Taxpayers in this situation must use adjusted tax value instead of cost as the base for the straight line method so they don't get an unfair advantage by switching methods partway through an assetís life. Example 7 A taxpayer bought a jet boat at the beginning of the 1990-91 income year for $20,000. At the end of the 1992-93 income year, it had been depreciated down to $10,240, and the taxpayer decided to switch to the straight line method. The equivalent straight line rate to 20%†DV is 13.5%. Applying the straight line method requires 13.5% of $10,240 to be deducted in each year the taxpayer continues to use the straight line method. A taxpayer may also elect to depreciate property using the pool depreciation method. This method is discussed later in this article. A taxpayer elects which depreciation method to use simply by applying it in that year's tax return. Rates of depreciation - sections 108C, 108D, 108E, 108F, 108G, 108H The rates of depreciation available to an asset owner depend on both the type of asset and the time at which it was bought. The date on which a binding contract to buy the asset was entered into may also be relevant. The chart on the next page sets out the relevant rate regime: continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) from page 5 Pre-interim rate is the rate the Commissioner allowed under the regime in force before 1 April 1993. It does not include the 25% interim loading. Interim rate is the rate the Commissioner allowed under the regime in force before 1 April 1993, and includes the 25% interim loading which applied to eligible New Zealand new assets acquired after 16 December 1991. Both the pre-interim and interim rates include the additional allowance for assets used in multiple-shift applications. Economic rate is the rate set by the Commissioner under section 108C of the new legislation. These rates have been specified by the Commissioner by determina- tion. These determinations will be similar in legal effect (although not similar in form) to the determinations issued by the Commissioner for the purposes of the Accruals Rules. The rate the Commissioner initially calculates is a diminishing value rate, which is rounded to the nearest banded rate. Banded rates are set out in Appendix B. The formula for calculating rates is: †1† 1 - residual value n cost where ìnî in the exponent is the estimated useful life in years. Residual value is the greater of estimated residual value and 13.5% of cost. Estimated residual market value is defined as the market value of the property at the end of its useful life, based on an assumption of normal and reasonable maintenance. Estimated useful life is defined as the time over which property might be expected to be useful in earning income, having regard to wear and tear and obsoles- cence. Example 8 The Commissioner ascertains that, on average, motor vehicles which carry up to 12 passengers: ï are typically used in businesses for 5 years; and ï are typically sold at the end of that five years for an amount equal to 25% of original cost So, a motor vehicle bought for $30,000 will be sold at the end of five years and can be expected to be sold on average for $7,500. applying the formula: †1† 1 - †7,500† 5 30,000 gives a diminishing value rate of 24.2%. In accordance with section 108C, this rate will be rounded to the nearest band as set out in the Schedule. In this case, the closest rate is 26%. The Commissioner may set a single depreciation rate for a number of similar types of depreciable property where it appears appropriate, having regard to the individual rates for those different types of property and the reduction in compliance costs that will be achieved. For example, the Commissioner may have calculated that the appropriate depreciation rate for passenger motor vehicles under 2000cm 3 was 26%, and the appropriate rate for passenger motor vehicles over 2000cm 3 was 24%. Instead of requiring a distinction to be drawn between these two types of motor vehicles, the Commissioner may choose to set a single rate of 26%. The Commissioner may issue a determination which changes the economic rate for an asset at any time.

Generally, a provisional rate will lapse when the Commissioner issues an applicable general rate. The approach to setting provisional rates is similar to that for special rates. The Commissioner will take the data supplied by the taxpayer to the extent that it is accurate, and apply the diminishing value formula. The Commissioner will decline to issue a provisional rate if: ï insufficient information has been provided to enable him to calculate a rate; or ï a general rate already exists; or ï a general rate is in the process of being determined and will be set within the next six months. Pool method of depreciation - section 108J The pool method of depreciation is aimed at reducing compliance costs, by allowing taxpayers to depreciate low value assets collectively rather than individually as under the other provisions. Where appropriate, this section acts in substitution for some of the other depre- ciation provisions. Only poolable property can be depreciated under this regime. Poolable property is property with a value less than the maximum pooling value, whether by costing less than the maximum pooling value or by having been depreciated individually to an adjusted tax value which is less than the maximum pooling value. Maximum pooling value will generally be $2,000, but taxpayers may apply for a higher maximum pooling value for specific assets. Because there are no apportionment provisions in the pooling regime, poolable property must also be property which is used wholly in the business or is subject to fringe benefit tax. The globo accounting method is no longer available under the new regime. Any property that was accounted for under the previous regime using the globo account- ing method should be pooled, along with all other items in that globo account. Formula for Deductions The formula for calculating depreciation under the pool method is: a x b + c x †d† 212 where: a is the diminishing value rate of depreciation applica- ble to all items included in the pool in the income year (if items with different rates were included in the pool at any time during that period, this is the lowest of those diminishing value rates); general determination, the legislation prevents the Commissioner from reducing the rate for assets which are already owned. The economic rate may also be a special rate set on request from a taxpayer. This procedure is discussed elsewhere in this TIB. Economic rate plus loading is simply the economic rate discussed above with the addition of the 20% permanent loading. This loading is calculated by multiplying the economic rate by 1.2, so the 10% straight line rate becomes 12% when the loading is added. Section 108E sets a special depreciation rate for interna- tional passenger jet aircraft. Special and provisional economic rates of depreciation - section 108I There are two situations where the Commissioner will issue economic rates at a taxpayer's request. When issued, those rates may be specific to a taxpayer or expressed to apply more widely. Special economic rates will be issued to a taxpayer who can show the Commissioner that an asset the taxpayer owns depreciates at a rate which is greater or less than the general economic rate. When setting a special rate, the Commissioner applies the same diminishing value formula set out above. However, the Commissioner will use figures supplied by the taxpayer for cost, life, and residual value if the Commissioner is satisfied that they are accurate. Note that under the formula the residual value will always be a minimum of 13.5%. The Commissioner will not issue a special rate if: ï insufficient information has been provided to enable him to calculate a special rate; or ï the general economic rate is currently being reviewed, and a new rate which is at least equal to the rate in the special rate application will be issued within the next six months; or ï the rate calculated does not differ from the banded rate by at least half the difference between the already applicable general rate and the next highest or lowest band. For example, the general rate set for an asset might be 18% DV. The next highest DV band is 22%. A special rate application will therefore have to produce a rate of at least 20% before the special rate will be issued. Where a special rate has been issued and the circum- stances which applied when the rate was issued subse- quently change, the Commissioner may revoke the special rate determination and either issue a new determination at a different rate or issue no new deter- mination, which will require the asset to be depreciated at the general rate. Provisional economic rates are available for assets for which no general rate has been set. These are likely to continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The applicable depreciation rate is 12%, as the lowest rate applying to assets in the pool in the year. applying the formula rate x opening value + closing value x months 212 12% x $87,000 + $101,000 x 12 212 = 12% x $94,000 = $11,280 So the depreciation deduction for the scaffolding pool is $11,280. Different pools may be set up for the same type of assets. This may be useful where, for example, different rates apply because of different acquisition dates, or the assets are used in different locations and separate records are desired. Note that the pooling regime does not allow the amount of any assessable income derived on disposal to be restricted to the amount of depreciation actually de- ducted. Taxpayers should therefore be wary of including in a pool any asset which is likely to ultimately be sold for more than its original cost. There is also provision for the situation where all the assets in a pool have been disposed of but the pool still has a positive value. The remaining value of the pool is then deductible. Write-off of depreciable property that can no longer be used - section 108K There is a new provision which allows taxpayers to apply to the Commissioner for a determination stating that a deduction can be claimed for the remaining adjusted tax value of property (other than buildings) that can no longer be used. Taxpayers must satisfy the Commissioner of certain criteria before he will issue the determination. These criteria are: ï that the property is no longer used by the taxpayer; and ï that the costs of disposing of the property are greater than any consideration that would be derived from disposing of it. The Commissioner will also consider whether the property could be used by someone else in a business. A write-off claimed under this section effectively becomes the depreciation deduction for the year, so no other depreciation deduction can be claimed. If a taxpayer subsequently sells property that has been b is the pool's adjusted tax value at the beginning of the income year, or nil if the pool did not exist at the beginning of the year; c is the adjusted tax value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation for that year); d is the number of whole or part calendar months in the taxpayerís income year. This formula is built around the concept of calculating depreciation for the ìaverage valueî of the pool. Acquisition and Disposal of Pool Assets Where a taxpayer elects to include an item of poolable property in a pool, the adjusted tax value of the pool is increased by the cost of the property (if the item was included in the pool immediately upon acquisition) or by the adjusted tax value of the item (if the item was previously accounted for separately). Where an asset is disposed of, the adjusted tax value of the pool is reduced by the consideration received. If no consideration is received - such as if the asset is dumped or lost - then no reduction is made. If the consideration received is greater than the value of the pool, then the adjusted tax value of the pool is reduced to nil and the excess is assessable income. Even if the pool still has assets in it, no further deduction can be claimed unless the pool has further assets added and therefore returns to a positive value. Example 9 High and Steady Ltd are scaffolding contractors. At any time, they own roughly $100,000 worth of scaffolding. They buy new items regularly to replace items which are lost or wear out. The rate for scaffolding under the previous regime was 12.5% diminishing value including the 25% interim loading. The rate for scaffolding under the new regime is 12%. HSL decide to pool all scaffolding in one pool at the new rate. At the end of the 1992-93 income year, the collec- tive book value of all scaffolding is $87,000. The opening value of the pool is therefore $87,000. In the 1993-94 income year, the following events take place: May 1993 $10,000 spent on new scaffolding August 1993 $4,000 received from insurance company for scaffolding stolen off site January 1994 $8,000 spent on new scaffolding closing value of the pool is therefore:$ 87,000 add purchases $ 18,000 $105,000 deduct disposals $ 4,000 closing balance$101,000 from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The depreciation rules applying to intangible assets vary according to whether or not they are fixed life intangible property (FLIP). An intangible asset is a FLIP if, on its purchase or creation, it can reasonably be expected to have an economic life which is the same as its legal life. The depreciation rate for FLIPs is self-assessed by the owner under section 108G. The formula to be used for the calculation is: 1†††††† Legal Life Legal life is a defined term which means the remaining life of the asset under the statute or contract which gives the asset its life. In determining the length of the legal life it must be assumed that any automatic rights of renewal are taken up, provided the only action needed is the payment of a pre-determined fee. The formula gives a straight line depreciation rate and the straight line method is the only depreciation method that can be used for FLIPs. FLIPs will not be eligible for the 20†percent loading applying from the 1995/96 income year. Example 10 A patent for a new type of electric motor is pur- chased on 1 May 1993 for $100,000. The patent was granted on 1 May 1991 for an initial period of 4 years, with automatic rights of renewal that will enable it to run to 1 May 2007 if it is renewed when required. As far as can be ascertained at the time of purchase, the patent will remain valuable until the end of its legal life. The depreciation rate to be used by the purchaser is: †1† = .7 or 7% 14 A $7,000 deduction for depreciation can therefore be claimed each year. If the patent becomes obsolete before the end of its legal life, the owner can apply to write off the remaining book value under the provisions of section 108K. Depreciable intangible assets which can be expected to have an economic life which is shorter than their legal life (economic life intangibles), such as software, are not FLIPs. The Commissioner determines their depreciation rate using the same method that is applied to all tangi- ble depreciable assets. Unlike FLIPs, economic life intangibles can be depreci- ated using a diminishing value or straight line deprecia- tion rate They can also be pooled, and will be eligible for the 20†percent loading applying from the 1995/96 income year. Taxpayers can also apply for a special or provisional depreciation rate for economic life intangi- bles. When a taxpayer develops an intangible asset rather than purchasing it, any scientific research costs remain written off under a determination made under this section, section 117 will apply so that the proceeds of the sale up to cost will be assessable. Deduction for low-value assets - section 108O From the 1993-94 income year onwards, the statutory $200 deduction provided under the new regime replaces all taxpayer-specific concessions allowed by the Com- missioner under the previous regime. Taxpayers can claim a deduction for the cost of assets acquired for $200 or less provided that: ï they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same deprecia- tion rate applies, unless the consideration for the entire purchase is less than $200; and ï the assets will not become part of property that is depreciable - for example, expenditure on materials to build a new wall in the taxpayerís factory; and ï the cost of those assets is not deductible under another provision of the Act. Where any property for which a deduction has been claimed under this provision is sold, the entire sale proceeds are assessable. Assets accounted for using standard value and replacement value methods These methods are not carried forward into the new regime. Assets held at the end of the 1992-93 income year which were depreciated using these methods must be dealt with under the new regime by depreciating the book value at the relevant new rate. These assets may also be pooled. Intangible assets Intangible assets are now included in the depreciation regime. This means the cost of some intangible assets can be capitalised and depreciated. Previously, some intangible assets such as patents and premiums paid for the lease of land had their own specialist sections of the Income Tax Act which allowed deductions. The cost of most other intangible assets was non-deductible. The types of intangible assets which can be depreciated are limited to those listed in the new 22nd Schedule to the Income Tax Act. The 22nd Schedule can have extra asset types added if they meet these criteria: ï they have a finite useful life that can be estimated with a reasonable degree of certainty on their creation or acquisition; and ï they have a low risk of being used in tax avoidance arrangements once made depreciable. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The major initiative in the new provision is the provi- sion of a clear statutory basis for claiming of a loss on sale. The deductibility of the costs of disposal is also expressly provided for. A formula is provided for apportioning the gain or loss on sale of any property that has been used partly for business use and partly for other use. This formula apportions the gain or loss in the same proportion as the depreciation deductions were apportioned. One other new feature is the treatment of assets which become no longer depreciable. This will happen if, for example, a business asset becomes used entirely for non- business purposes. In the income year the asset leaves the business, an apportionment calculation will be carried out under the ordinary provisions. If, at the end of the following year, no depreciation is claimable for that year (because the asset was wholly outside the business), the asset will be deemed to have been dis- posed of for a consideration equal to market value on the first day of that year. There are special provisions dealing with the disposal of intangible assets (see earlier commentary on intangible assets). Schedule depreciable property There is special provision for schedule depreciable property. Schedule depreciable property is petroleum drilling rigs, support vessels for offshore petroleum drilling rigs, and support vessels for offshore petroleum production platforms. Because of the special nature of this property, the calculation under section 108A is done on a daily rather than a monthly basis. No adjustment is made on dispo- sition or exit from the tax base under section 117 for schedule depreciable property. Repairs and maintenance Repairs and maintenance were previously deductible under section 108. The provision under which this deduction could be claimed has not been carried forward into the new regime. Expenditure on repairs and maintenance is deductible from the 1993-94 income year onwards under the ordinary provisions of the Act. Expenditure will there- fore have to satisfy the test under section 104, and is subject to the denial of a deduction for capital expendi- ture in section 106(1)(a). The main consequence of this change is that alterations which do not increase the value of the asset must be capitalised and depreciated. Expenditure on improvements Taxpayers have two basic choices when dealing with the depreciation of capital expenditure on improvements to depreciable property. The expenditure can be either from page 9 deductible under section 144 (which has been amended to clarify this intent). Since intangible assets are not disposed of in the same way as other assets, a special provision has been added to the definition of disposal in the new section 117(10). The provision (in 117(10)(a)(iv)) deems a disposal to include any event which has the effect of stopping the rights that make up an intangible asset from ever being able to be exercised. Example 11 A taxpayer purchases for $1,000 a 5 year franchise which consists of the right to use a secret process and the right to use a trademark. The franchiser supplies the materials to use in the process. After 3 years the franchiser is declared bankrupt and no new materials can be purchased. The intangible asset is a FLIP and has a self assessed depreciation rate of 20%. After 3 years, $600 worth of depreciation has been claimed so the adjusted tax value of the rights held by the franchisee is $400. Since the rights can never be used again, they are deemed to be disposed of and the $400 can be written off. However, a disposal is also deemed (in 117(10)(b)) to not include the disposal of intangible property where it is part of an arrangement to replace it with property of the same type. This is to prevent taxpayers writing off the cost of software that is sent back to the seller in return for a heavily discounted price on a later version. In effect, the original software has just been upgraded. The cost of the upgrade can be added to the cost or book value (depending the depreciation method being used) of the original version. Sections 83, 137, 139, 142 and 143 are existing tax provisions dealing with intangible assets which have had consequential amendments made to them. Deduc- tions allowed under these sections for the purchase or creation of intangible assets ceased on 31†March 1993. Intangible assets created or purchased after 31†March 1993 (and for which a deduction is not otherwise available) can be depreciated under the new deprecia- tion regime. Gain or loss from disposition of depreciable property - section 117 As part of the depreciation reforms a new section 117 has been enacted, although the policy changes in this area are relatively minor. Section 117 applies to the disposition of depreciable property and to software (sold to an associated person) for which a deduction has been claimed, but it does not apply to property depreciated using the pool deprecia- tion method. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) consistent with the new depreciation regime, which attempts to set out the rights and obligations of taxpay- ers in as transparent as possible a manner. The new section 111 has the same effect as the previous section outlined above, except that it can only be applied to transactions between associated persons. The new section 111 applies to transactions taking place from the start of the 1993-94 income year. Transfers between commonly owned companies Inland Revenueís administrative practice under the previous depreciation regime was to permit transfers between 100% commonly owned companies at tax book value. With the enactment of the new depreciation regime this practice needs to be reviewed. We are currently preparing a draft policy statement on this issue, which we will send to interested parties for consultation when it is completed. In the meantime, the existing administrative practice will continue. Other minor issues covered in the Act ï a number of sections which set out special rules for depreciating certain assets are repealed. These sections were no longer of any legal effect, and in the main provided special incentives. ï the 20% permanent loading available from the 1995- 96 income year is also available for expenditure on land improvements used for farming, agriculture, or forestry, and improvements in relation to aquaculture (amendments to sections 128A, 128B, and 128C). added to the cost of the depreciable property and depreciated as part of that property, or it can be sepa- rately capitalised and treated as a separate asset. Expenditure on improvements can only be depreciated from the month in which the improvement was first used or became available to be used. Consequently, in the year in which expenditure on the improvement is made, the depreciation calculation for an improvement to an asset will be different from the depreciation calculation for the asset itself. From the beginning of the following income year, taxpayers have two choices. If the straight line method is being used, the cost of the improvement should be added to the cost of the asset for depreciation purposes, and the adjusted tax value of the improvement should be added to the adjusted tax value of the asset. If the diminishing value method is being used, the adjusted tax value of the improvement should be added to the adjusted tax value of the asset. Alternatively, the improvement may continue to be depreciated as a separate asset. This approach will be useful if the rate applying to the improvement is different from the rate applying to the asset. Sale of depreciable property between associated persons Section 111 has been repealed and replaced with a new section which is restricted in its application to transac- tions between associated persons. Section 111 in its original form was an anti-avoidance section under which the Commissioner could restrict the deduction that a transferee could claim to the amount of deduction which had been previously allowed to the transferor. The latitude of discretion allowed the Commissioner was widely viewed as unsatisfactory, and it was not Provisional Tax Sections 375-391, 398A, 413A, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction A whole new Part XII of the Income Tax Act has been introduced, to apply from the 1994/95 income year. This new provisional tax regime is a combination of changes to the provisional tax interest regime - to reduce scope for tax deferral, and minor changes to address problems with the current regime. As well, the new Part XII simplifies the provisional tax legislation itself. Summary of main changes Use of money interest will apply from the first provi- sional tax instalment date for taxpayers with over $30,000 residual income tax (RIT). The $30,000 threshold recognises that deferral occurs mainly amongst large provisional taxpayers. The rate of interest on overpayments will be different from that applying to underpayments. The Government has decided that as far as is feasible, provisional tax use of money interest will be aligned with market interest rates to reduce fiscal risk. Where one interest rate applies to both under- and overpayments of provisional tax some taxpayers have incentives to overpay their liability while others have incentives to underpay. The rates will be set by Order in Council. Use of money interest paid to taxpayers will be assess- able. Correspondingly, use of money interest charged to taxpayers will be deductible, subject to the normal deductibility provisions. Inland Revenue will deduct continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) New regime in detail The new provisional tax regime is described below in greater detail. We will publish a further TIB item explaining the application of the new regime section by section closer to the application date. Structure of legislation A new Part XII was inserted instead of amending the existing Part XII, to give the legislation a simpler and more coherent structure. The structure of the legislation is embodied in sections 377 to 390. Section†377 sets the total amount of provi- sional tax payable. This total amount is calculated under section†377 where provisional taxpayers pay tax on an uplift basis. Where taxpayers estimate or the Commis- sioner makes a determination, the total provisional tax is still set under section†377. However, the total provi- sional tax payable is calculated under section†378 where taxpayers estimate or under section†379 where the Commissioner makes a determination. Once the total amount of provisional tax payable is set, section†380 determines whether provisional tax is payable in one, two or three instalments. Provisional tax is payable in one, two or three instalments for new provisional taxpayers and in one instalment where provisional taxpayers with over $300,000 of RIT have less than $2,500 of RIT in the previous year. Section 380 determines the amount of provisional tax payable on an instalment date. This is calculated using the total provisional tax payable under section 377 and the number of instalments determined under section 380. Section 381 provides that taxpayers can make further payments of provisional tax should they wish. Sections 383 to 385 apply additional tax where taxpay- ers incorrectly pay an instalment or underestimate their residual income tax at the third instalment date. Sections 386 to 390 contain other various offsetting provisions that allow taxpayers to credit provisional tax against their own income tax liability and the provi- sional tax liability of other taxpayers. Provisional tax payments Under the new provisional tax regime, any taxpayer with residual income tax greater than $2,500 is a provisional taxpayer. Provisional taxpayers must pay tax: ï in three instalments, if their RIT was greater than $2,500 in the previous income year. (Note that a targeted refund provision has been introduced to cover cases where last yearís RIT is not known with cer- tainty, causing taxpayers not to know they have an obligation to pay provisional tax for the current year); or ï in one instalment (the third instalment date), if a provisional taxpayerís RIT was less than $2,500 last year but more than $300,000 this year (and the taxpayer is not a new provisional taxpayer); or from page 11 Resident Withholding Tax (RWT) from assessable interest in accordance with that regime. The legislation increases the grounds for remission of underestimation penalty to include unforeseen fluctua- tions. The expanded part of the remission provision applies to compulsory estimators (taxpayers whose RIT exceeds $300,000) who have an unforeseen fluctuation of twenty percent or more in their tax liability for an income year, when the fluctuation occurs after the third instalment date for that year. Summary of minor changes The application of the requirement for taxpayersí estimates to be ìfair and reasonableî has been strength- ened. The Commissioner will have a new power to amend estimates retrospectively after the income tax liability is assessed. Taxpayers will now have a right to object to this and any estimates that the Commissioner makes during the income year. The legislation provides for a fairer underestimation penalty. The current penalty is a two step process. The first step is to see if the taxpayerís estimate is less than 80 percent of RIT, and the second determines the amount of penalty. The penalty is capped by reference to last yearís RIT where a taxpayer is a voluntary estima- tor. The following changes to the penalty have been made: ï Determination of whether taxpayers have underesti- mated is based on the higher of what they paid and what they estimated. This prevents the penalty applying where taxpayers pay more but do not bother to update their estimate. ï Underestimation penalty will only apply to provi- sional taxpayers who had an obligation to pay provi- sional tax. It will not apply to those who estimate their liability when they were not required to do so. ï The penalty calculation will be based on the greater of what a taxpayer estimated or paid (rather than simply what was paid, which is the current position). TSCC recommendations not implemented A number of the recommendations of the Tax Simplifi- cation Consultative Committee (TSCC) have not been implemented. These not implemented are that: ï the provisional tax payment dates move to the 20th of the month ï the terminal tax date be moved for IR†3 and IR†5 taxpayers ï a seasonality provision be introduced ï non-individuals are always provisional taxpayers ï taxpayers can elect to be provisional taxpayers. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) before the third instalment date). However, the interest regime can apply to new provisional taxpayers with over $30,000 RIT from the first instalment date occurring after the 30 day exemption has expired. So, in effect the provision is tied to the new interest regime rather than the provisional tax payment system. Provisional tax interest regime Non-natural persons will be subject to interest where RIT for the current year is greater than $2,500. Where their RIT is less than or equal to $30,000, two way interest will apply from the third instalment date. If their RIT is greater than $30,000, they will be subject to interest from the first instalment date (or possibly the second or third instalment dates if they are new provi- sional taxpayers - see below). Natural persons will be subject to the new interest regime from the first instalment date where RIT for the income year is greater than $30,000. Where they have $30,000 or less RIT they will only be in the interest regime where they estimate, and then only from the third instalment date. Natural persons who are trustees will be subject to interest and qualify for interest on their trustee income as if they were not natural persons. An adjustment has been made to the provision paying interest to taxpayers who paid provisional tax because they expected to be provisional taxpayers, but who turn out not to be. Taxpayers must now have: ï reasonably expected to be provisional taxpayers ï made an estimate of their RIT by the third instalment date ï paid an amount of not less than $2,500 as if it were provisional tax ï been able to be a provisional taxpayer had their RIT exceeded $2,500 ï had RIT exceeding $2,500 last year. Interest will be calculated as currently specified except that it will be assessable or deductible (as explained above), and Inland Revenue will deduct Resident Withholding Tax from interest on provisional tax overpaid. There is no requirement for taxpayers to deduct RWT from interest paid to Inland Revenue (this requirement has been applied retrospectively). A deduction for interest charged is claimable in the year the tax is assessed or reassessed. Application date The regime applies from the 1994/95 income year. ï in either one, two, or three instalments, where the taxpayer is a new provisional taxpayer (see New provisional taxpayer provision below). Where a taxpayer does not estimate, the amount of provisional tax payable on the first and second instal- ment dates is either: ï one third of 105 percent of last yearís RIT; or ï one third of 110 percent of the RIT of the year before last, where the taxpayer has an extension of time arrangement and has not furnished last yearís return by the instalment date. At the third instalment date taxpayers who have not furnished the previous yearís return must either estimate or guess at 105 percent of last yearís RIT (because that tax return has not been filed). Taxpayers have the right to estimate their liability at any time on or before the third instalment date for an income year. However, they must estimate by the third instalment date if their RIT for an income year exceeds $300,000. The payment rules of the new regime are the same as those of the old system, except that a targeted refund provision and a new provisional taxpayer provision have been introduced. Targeted refund provision A provision has been introduced to provide specifically for a refund of provisional tax paid where provisional taxpayers turn out not to be required to pay provisional tax. This provision addresses the problem of uncertainty where provisional taxpayers have not furnished last yearís tax return and so could not be certain last yearís RIT exceeded $2,500 (and thus whether they have to pay provisional tax). They can pay provisional tax and get that tax back when they furnish the previous yearís return. (Under current rules it is possible that money may not be refunded by the Commissioner until termi- nal tax date for that income year.) This provision applies from the 1992-93 income year. New provisional taxpayer provisions A new provisional taxpayer provision applies to non- natural persons who commence a taxable activity during an income year. It provides that new provisional taxpayers must pay provisional tax on those instalment dates which occur on or after 30 days after they com- mence their taxable activity. As they can choose to pay on the basis of last yearís RIT plus 5%, payment will normally only occur where they have RIT over $300,000 (since these provisional taxpayers must estimate on or 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Tax Treatment of Business Entertainment Expenditure Sections 106G, 336N, 336P, 336S, Income Tax Act 1976 Section 21, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Introduction The Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 and the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1993 enact changes to the tax treatment of business entertainment expenditure. The new regime provides that the deduct- ibility of business entertainment expenditure will be limited to 50 percent. Background The Government announced in the 1992 Budget its plans to make changes to the tax treatment of business entertainment expenditure. Such expenditure would still be deductible, but the private benefits - assumed to be 50 percent - would be subject to Fringe Benefit Tax (FBT). For those outside the FBT regime (sole traders, partner- ships and trusts with no employees) 50 percent of business entertainment expenditure would be made non- deductible. The legislation reflecting this decision was later intro- duced into Parliament. As a result of the many submis- sions received on the issue, changes were made to the proposed legislation in the select committee process. The main change was that instead of imposing FBT on the private benefits of business entertainment, the deductibility of business entertainment expenditure has been limited to 50 percent. The legislation provides a broad definition of entertain- ment and several specific exclusions to the definition (see section 106G(1), (2) and (3)). The treatment of entertainment allowances and entertainment facilities is specified in subsections (4) and†(5). Subsection (6) identifies a number of exemptions or partial exclusions to the definition. The Commissionerís discretion is included in subsection (7). A number of amendments are made to section 336N, thereby modifying the FBT regime. Section†336P, which deals with the value of a fringe benefit arising from expenditure incurred on fares, accommodation and sustenance, will not include the provision of entertainment. Associated GST changes are included in the GST Amendment Act. Inter-relationship between non- deductibility and FBT FBT will apply where entertainment is provided to employees for their consumption or enjoyment at their discretion outside the course of their employment duties. Otherwise, the 50 percent deductibility rule will apply (except where the expenditure is specifically excluded from the regime). Definition of entertainment The new legislation defines entertainment as: ï food; ï beverages; ï recreation; and ï accommodation or travel for the purpose of providing any of these. Recreation is widely defined as being active or passive participation in sports, games, physical exercise, or artistic, cultural, social, or leisure pursuits or amuse- ment. Where accommodation or travel is connected with or undertaken for the purposes of facilitating the provision of food, beverages or recreation, 50 percent of the deduction claimed pursuant to section 104 will be denied. For example, a client is taken on a chartered fishing trip. It is considered that the dominant purpose of the expenditure is to provide recreation. The expenditure incurred in relation to the trip will therefore be subject to partial denial of deductibility. Accommodation or travel associated with attendance at a business related conference will not be subject to the entertainment regime as the dominant purpose of the expenditure is business related. Where the accommodation or travel expenditure has dual purposes (both for entertainment and business related purposes) the dominant purpose may be deter- mined by considering the time devoted to each purpose. For instance, travel is undertaken to attend a two day event where business discussions occur over half a day and sightseeing and recreational activities occur over the remainder of the event. In this example the domi- nant purpose would be entertainment related. The facts of each case will determine the dominant purpose of the expenditure. Note that before expenditure can be considered as entertainment expenditure it must be deductible in terms of section 104. These entertainment expenditure provisions will not make non-deductible expenditure deductible. Exclusions The following are excluded from the definition of entertainment, and the expenditure incurred will be fully deductible. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The entertainment must be provided in circumstances where the public (or any broad section of the public) are invited or intended to use, consume or enjoy the enter- tainment and none of the following has a greater opportunity to use, consume or enjoy the entertainment than members of the public generally: ï clients, customers, or suppliers of the people provid- ing the entertainment; ï employees of the people providing the entertainment (or of people associated with them); ï people associated with those providing the entertain- ment or with employees of either; ï any other special class of person as determined by the Commissioner. The Commissioner will make rulings on a case by case basis. For example, motoring journalists invited to the product launch of a new car may be classified as a ìspecial class of personî. Similarly, dignitaries such as MPs and trade representatives from diplomatic missions invited to an exporting initiative may be representative of a special class of persons. In determining whether a group of persons is a special group, the Commissioner will have regard to common characteristics of persons invited and the type of function or activity. Expenditure on entertainment provided at a function or activity available to the public or any broad sector of the public will be fully deductible. For example, a barbecue at a hardware store or a fashion show in a shopping mall will be fully deductible. A ìbroad section of the publicî means a significant portion of the public; the entertainment must not be provided to an exclusive group. For example, where an invitation to a trade display is sent to all members of the construction industry the event would qualify for the exclusion, as the members of the construction industry qualify as a broad section of the public. However, an invitation to a group of joiners would not qualify. If a publicly advertised event is directed at joiners, the event, because it is open to the public, is excluded. If the entertainment provided at the function or activity is not available to the public or a broad section thereof, a special exemption applies (see the discussion on the promotion/advertising exemption where not to a broad sector of the public, below). Samples Samples of goods and services, being entertainment provided to clients or customers (not including employ- ees, employees of associated persons or associated persons) in the course of a business for the purpose of promoting or advertising such goods and services, are excluded. In the case of goods, the samples must be either: Market value Entertainment provided for market value in the ordinary course of a business which consists of the provision of entertainment is excluded. This means that expenditure incurred by businesses providing entertainment in the ordinary course of its business to paying customers will continue to be fully deductible. For example, expenditure incurred by restaurants in providing meals to patrons will continue to be fully deductible. Assessable income Entertainment which is assessable income to the person to whom it is provided is excluded. Taxable client entertainment allowances, for example, will continue to be taxable in the hands of the recipient and fully deductible to the provider. As well, food and beverages provided to employees that are currently taxable under section 72 will be fully deductible. For example, meals provided to a farm labourer as part of board and lodgings will be fully deductible. Off-shore entertainment Entertainment consumed or enjoyed outside New Zealand is excluded. Under this exclusion, all expenditure which is incurred on entertainment which is consumed off-shore will be fully deductible. Allowances paid to reimburse expenditure on off-shore entertainment will be fully deductible. Taxable allow- ances will still be fully assessable to the recipient For income tax purposes, ìNew Zealandî includes the territorial waters (within the 12 mile limit), and the air space above, but not generally the waters of the Exclu- sive Economic Zone (within the 200 mile limit). Therefore, any entertainment which takes place outside the territorial waters will be fully deductible. Entertain- ment on a cruise ship from Auckland to Sydney, for example, will be consumed outside New Zealand and there will be no need to apportion entertainment between that enjoyed within New Zealand and that enjoyed outside. Business entertainment enjoyed on pleasure craft which sail in New Zealand waters will usually be treated as being consumed in New Zealand, unless there is evidence to indicate that the entertainment was con- sumed outside territorial waters. Promotional activities Also excluded is entertainment which is provided as a merely incidental part of a function or activity which has as its dominant purpose the promotion or advertis- ing to the public (or to any broad section of the public) of: ï a business, or ï goods or services provided in the course of carrying on a business. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) example, if a business usually provides coffee, tea, milk and sugar for employees, but also provides, say, biscuits at meetings and for clients, the cost of the biscuits will be fully deductible. Morning and afternoon teas provided away from the employerís premises are also excluded if they are consumed by the employee in the course of employment or business. For example, morning and afternoon teas provided on a building site, to a consultant working in a clientís office or at a conference are included in the exclusion. Refreshments need not be served at mid morning or mid afternoon to qualify for this exclusion. For example, the cost of coffee and tea provided to nurses on a night shift is fully deductible. Dining facilities A reasonable amount of food and non-alcoholic bever- ages provided to or consumed by any person, including clients and suppliers (other than at a party, reception, or other social function), in a canteen, dining room or similar facility (whether temporary or permanent) is excluded. The facility must be on the premises or at a work place and operated wholly or principally for the purpose of providing food and non-alcoholic beverages on working days to employees. It must also be open to all employees working at the same location on an equal basis. The exclusion would also apply where, for example, an employer operates from two locations, and at one location a canteen is available for all staff from both locations. This exclusion makes the costs of subsidised cafeterias fully deductible provided that they are open to all employees. It applies to both temporary and permanent facilities such as in-house cafeterias and cafeterias on building sites. Meals purchased from such facilities but consumed elsewhere are also excluded. The exclusion does not apply to executive dining rooms, as they are not open to all employees. Incidental entertainment A reasonable amount of food, beverages or recreation provided or consumed where the ordinary business consists of the provision of such food, beverages or recreation for market value to the public is excluded. The food, beverages or recreation must be enjoyed on the premises as an incidental part of employment duties or business activities. For example, light meals provided to a kitchen hand or the entertainment enjoyed by a security guard at a concert would be excluded from the entertainment definition. What constitutes an incidental part of employment duties or business activities will depend upon the situation. Generally the exclusion will apply where a business provides entertainment as part of its business activities and employees consume an insignificant part of that entertainment, at negligible cost to the employer, from page 15 ï not consumed at the time provided (for example, a postal sample), whether provided at a function or elsewhere; or ï if consumed at the time provided, consumed in the course of a function or activity which has as its principal purpose the promotion or advertising of such goods (for example, wine at a wine tasting would be excluded). An example of entertainment which is not deductible as a sample is when a publican informally provides a drink to a client. Samples of services, such as free attendance at an aerobics class, are also fully deductible. The sample must be a small part or quantity intended to show what the product is like. The cost to a wine shop, for example, of holding wine tastings will be fully deductible, but if the wine shop were to provide a case of wine to a valued customer, this would not be considered a sample, but a gift. However, if the case of wine were provided to a wine merchant to distribute as samples then the exclusion would apply. Any associated items, such as cheese provided at a wine tasting, would not be a sample of a wine makerís business. In most cases, however, wine and cheese would be provided in the course of a promotional activity, and could be fully deductible. The eligibility of this exclusion will depend on the circumstances in which the sample is made available and the manner in which the sample is intended to be used. Accordingly, the exclusion will depend on the facts of each case. Morning and afternoon teas A reasonable amount of food and non-alcoholic bever- ages ordinarily and regularly provided as a morning or afternoon tea to employees or as a light refreshment (other than at a party, reception or other social function) of similar quantity and quality as morning or afternoon tea is excluded. Light refreshments would include food and beverages that could reasonably be expected to be provided as morning and afternoon tea. The food and beverages must be enjoyed on the employerís premises or at the employeeís work place, or at a conference, seminar, convention, education course, or similar event attended as part of the recipientís employment or business. This exclusion ensures that the costs (for items such as coffee, tea, milk, sugar and water coolers) of ordinary morning and afternoon teas are fully deductible. Fur- ther, so long as any facilities provided are used more than 50 percent for the provision of morning or after- noon tea, and/or any of the other exclusions, the regime will not apply to the costs of these facilities. The exclusion covers all ìmorning and afternoon teasî which fall within the ordinary meaning of the term. For 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) event, whether or not in conjunction with a meal, is excluded. A speakerís fees are therefore excluded. Expenditure incurred in providing associated travel and accommoda- tion for the speaker would also be excluded. If, however, the speech was incidental to recreational activity, for instance, the travel and accommodation would be considered to be predominantly associated with enter- tainment. Any entertainment provided to a speaker would be 50 percent non-deductible. The exclusion would not apply to recreation provided by an after dinner speaker at a corporate golf tournament. Employment duties Recreation (or incidental accommodation or transporta- tion) enjoyed where the recreation constitutes part of a personís employment duties or business activities (other than a merely incidental part) is excluded. Under this exclusion, gym fees incurred by a profes- sional sportsperson or a self employed aerobics instruc- tor, for example, are fully deductible. Although it could be argued that, say, an office worker is more efficient if fit and healthy, it is not part of an office workerís employment duties to attend a gym. To qualify for this exclusion, the recreation must be necessary to carry on the personís job. Such expenditure would be subject to FBT as it is outside the course of employment duties and would be enjoyed at an employ- eeís discretion. Waiting rooms A reasonable amount of recreation provided in a waiting-room or reception area to occupy a personís time pending a consultation or meeting is excluded. For example, the cost of providing magazines in a doctorís waiting room will be fully deductible. Exemptions Exemption for meals while travelling on business There is a $25 per person per day exemption for food and beverages consumed while travelling in the course of deductible business travel. The $25 is GST exclusive where the taxpayer is GST registered and is entitled to claim full GST on inputs. The exemption applies to both expenditure incurred and allowances paid. If the $25 is exceeded, only 50 percent of the amount above $25 will be deductible. For the exemption to apply, the person must be travel- ling or have travelled and received an allowance or a reimbursement of expenditure for any meals consumed. Further, the travel must not be for the purpose of enjoying or consuming entertainment i.e. travel to a business lunch. in the course of performing their employment duties. The entertainment must be enjoyed on the premises. Light meals provided by a hotel to all staff, including desk staff, will, for example, fall within this exclusion, provided the criteria of the exclusion are met. In many cases the meal to hotel staff will fall within the dining facility exclusion. Reviewers A reasonable amount of food, beverages, recreation, or accommodation or transportation enjoyed by a person for the purpose of enabling the person to review the entertainment for a paper, magazine, book, or other medium for sale or distribution to the public is ex- cluded. For example, the cost of giving movie tickets to a movie reviewer and the costs incurred by a restaurant critic will be fully deductible. The paper, magazine or book in which the review appears need not be for sale; it may be a free publica- tion, but it must be produced for distribution to the public. For example, the costs incurred by a community newspaperís food critic will be fully deductible. Travel Food, beverages or recreation enjoyed merely as an incidental part of transportation on an aircraft, train, bus, or ship are excluded. The transportation must be open to members of the public. Excluded, for example, are in-flight meals. Also excluded are food, beverages or recreation provided in waiting rooms and lounges such as the Koru and Golden Wing Clubs. Subscriptions to the Koru and Golden Wing Clubs will continue to be fully deductible and not subject to FBT as they are associated with employment duties. Not excluded is transportation provided for the purpose of providing or enjoying food, beverages or recreation, such as the costs of taking clients on a fishing trip. Charity entertainment Entertainment provided to members of the public for the relief of poverty, illness, disability or other disadvan- tages is excluded. For example, the cost to a supermarket of donating food to a food bank will be fully deductible, as will the cost of sponsoring a childrenís Christmas party at a hospital. Charities are generally not subject to tax and therefore entertainment provided by charities generally will not be affected by the new regime. If, for example, an employer pays for an employee to attend a charity ball, the expenditure is 50 percent non- deductible, since the entertainment is being provided to the employee, who is not a charity. Speakers Recreation in the form of a speaker at a conference, seminar, convention, educational course, or similar continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) can be aggregated to cover the period of absence. For example, a $250 exemption would apply to expenditure incurred on meals consumed while travelling on business for ten days. Daily calculations are not required to be made. Promotion/advertising exemption where not to a broad sector of the public Where a promotion is not made to the public it will still be deductible to the extent that it does not exceed the greater of $500 or $25 per attendee. Employees or associated people who have attended are not included in the number of attendees. An example would be a product launch which is restricted to certain clients. Incidental food and bever- ages are provided to the 25 attendees to a value of $725. Five staff are also present at the promotion. The non- deductible portion of the promotion will be $50 calcu- lated as follows: Total cost of entertainment$725 less exempted amount (being the greater of $500 or 25 X $25) $625 $100 Non deductible amount $100 x 50% = $50 deductible amount =$675 Multiple $25 exemptions It will be possible for one employee to qualify for two $25 exemptions per person per day, as each of the $25 exemptions stands alone. For example, an employee attends a one-day training seminar which qualifies as an eligible conference. The conference organiser provides lunch, which has a value of $10 per attendee. The employee also stays overnight and receives a $75 non-taxable allowance for meals. The employer will be able to claim the $25 exemption for the meal provided at the conference. Consequently, the $10 will be fully deductible. A $25 exemption will also apply to meals consumed while travelling on business for both calendar days. Accordingly, the first $50 of the non-taxable meal allowance will be fully deductible. The remaining $25 of the allowance will be subject to the 50 percent non- deductibility rule. Sponsorship Expenditure incurred for the purpose of providing sponsorship is specifically excluded from the entertain- ment regime. The expenditure must be incurred for the principal purpose of promoting or advertising the sponsorís business or goods and services provided by the spon- sorís business to the public. The extent to which the sponsorship provides entertain- ment benefits to a group of clients, customers, employ- ees or associated persons will be subject to 50 percent from page 17 Where an employee entertains a client while travelling on business the $25 exemption will only apply to the meal consumed by the employee. Where two employees are travelling on business and one employee pays for the meals consumed by both, the employer will be entitled to two $25 per person per day exemptions. The exemption applies to employees and self employed persons while travelling on business. For example, a travelling salesperson lives in Auckland and travels to Wellington on business for one day. While in Wellington the salesperson incurs meal expenses of $40. The deductible amount will be $32.50 (being $25 + 50% of the remaining $15). Alternatively, a meal allowance might be paid to a Wellington based auditor while visiting a client in Lower Hutt, and the $25 exemption would apply. This exemption would not apply to the provision of an overtime meal while not travelling. Eligible conference exemption The first $25 of expense per person per day of providing food or beverages at an ìeligibleî conference will be deductible to the recipient. A conference is any conference, seminar, convention, educational course, or similar event. This would include a meeting and teleconference. To qualify as ìeligibleî a conference must have a continuous duration of four hours or more (not includ- ing meals, recreation, and rest breaks such as morning and afternoon tea), and must not: ï be held principally for the purpose of promoting or advertising; or ï be held for the purpose of giving or receiving infor- mation about the business, or goods and services to customers or suppliers (A seminar to provide business information to employees would be eligible); or ï be held principally for the purpose of entertainment. It is anticipated that conference organisers will detail the value which is fairly and reasonably attributable to entertainment at a conference. However, if this figure is not provided then the employer should base it on the value fairly and reasonably attributable to the entertain- ment, based on similar market values. An example would be a business running a five-hour training seminar for its staff. Morning and afternoon teas and lunch are provided, occupying one hour. The cost of the food and beverages is $100, and 10 people attend. As the conference qualifies as eligible, the food and beverages provided will be fully deductible because the amount provided falls under the $25 per attendee threshold. The $25 per person per day exemptions for meals while travelling on business and while attending an eligible conference apply for each calendar day. The exemptions 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Entertainment facilities Any deductible expenditure or loss incurred and any depreciation deduction claimed in relation to an enter- tainment facility will be subject to 50 percent non- deductibility. Consequently, rates, interest, cleaning costs and electricity, for example, may be 50 percent non-deductible. Costs incurred in the provision of entertainment in an entertainment facility are not incurred in respect of the facility and, therefore, are not attributable to it. How- ever, these costs are still subject to 50 percent deduct- ibility. For example, the cost of meals provided on a yacht are independent of the costs of maintaining the yacht. An entertainment facility is defined as any: ï permanent or temporary building or other structure; or ï boat and yacht; or ï aircraft; ï vehicle; or ï land; used principally for the provision of entertainment, being food, beverages, or recreation. Consequently, 50 percent of the costs of a corporate box at Eden Park, for example, will be deductible. In calculating the costs incurred and depreciation deducted in respect of an entertainment facility, any equipment associated with the facility should be in- cluded. For example, the costs incurred and deprecia- tion deducted in respect of a kitchen would include the stove, dishwasher, fridge, and other equipment associ- ated with a kitchen. A facility that is used for other purposes (including excluded purposes) will not be considered an entertain- ment facility where entertainment is incidental to those other purposes. For instance, where monthly staff drinks are provided in a staff cafeteria used principally for the provision of food and beverages on working days to all employees (exempt entertainment), the staff drinks (entertainment) are incidental to that principal purpose. The cafeteria would not, therefore, be considered to be an entertainment facility and no attribution of deduct- ible costs and depreciation is required. Where, however, a room is principally used for social club activities, for instance, the room would be consid- ered an entertainment facility. Commissioner’s discretion The Commissioner has the discretion to determine, having regard to the market value of the entertainment, the extent to which any expenditure is incurred on entertainment. This discretion will be applied where the entertainment expenditure has not been reasonably and fairly calculated. deductibility. Consequently, where the organisers of a motor race, for instance, provide a corporate box available only to sponsors and their invited guests, in reciprocation for the sponsorship, the costs incurred in the provision of the corporate box will be only 50 percent deductible to the sponsor. Expenditure incurred in the provision of sponsorship will, therefore, require apportionment where reciprocal entertainment benefits are provided. The costs incurred by the organiser, for instance, will determine the amount of the expenditure subject to 50 percent non- deductibility. If the costs are not easily identifiable, the market value of the benefits could be used as a proxy. Where the organiser does not incur any costs in the provision of reciprocal entertainment benefits their value will be nil. For example, a theatre is unable to sell all tickets for a particular play and gives the unsold tickets to a sponsor. However, if a sponsorship agreement requires a number of tickets to be given to the sponsor their market value will be 50 percent deductible. For example, an indi- vidual sponsors a particular tour by the local orchestra and ten tickets to a particular recital are required to be given to the sponsor. The sponsorship is $5,000 and the value of the tickets is $400, so 50 percent of the ex- penditure incurred in relation to entertainment ($400) is non-deductible. The remaining amount of the sponsor- ship is fully deductible. A deduction may, therefore, be claimed for $4,800. Where, for instance, accounting services are provided gratuitously to the orchestra, unless reciprocal entertain- ment benefits are provided, the services are not subject to the entertainment regime. Allowances If a non-taxable entertainment allowance such as a meal allowance is paid, and is not specifically excluded from the regime, 50 percent of the allowance will not be deductible to the employer. Non-taxable entertainment allowances will be subject to the $25 exemptions. Where a general non-taxable allowance comprising both entertainment and non-entertainment components is paid, 50 percent of the amount relating to the entertain- ment component will be non-deductible. The calculation of the amount attributable to entertainment will be made by the employer. This calculation is based on a reason- able apportionment with regard to the expenditure which is expected to be incurred on entertainment by the employee. In determining the entertainment component of a general non-taxable allowance, taxpayers have to indicate how the breakdown has been arrived at. Such information will have been provided to the Commis- sioner when applying for a determination on the non- taxable status of the allowance. Accordingly, any entertainment element would be identifiable. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The value of a fringe benefit which arises from expendi- ture incurred by an employer on fares, accommodation or sustenance where an employee takes leave or a vacation while on business travel has been amended to exclude entertainment. Any entertainment benefits which are treated as ìotherî benefits will be subject to the FBT exemption of $75 per quarter per employee, which has been capped at a maximum of $450 per quarter per employer. Entertainment facilities liable for FBT The entertainment regime will not apply where FBT is payable for an entertainment facility. The expenditure or loss on that facility will, therefore, continue to be fully deductible. Situations may arise where an entertainment facility may be subject to non-deductibility and FBT. For example, a yacht may be available for use by employees at their discretion outside their employment duties and is also used to entertain clients. Based on the facts of the case, costs will need to be apportioned between FBT and non-deductibility. Record keeping requirements All forms of entertainment expenditure will need to be identified within accounts so that the new legislation can be complied with. Inland Revenue recommends that businesses keep working papers which identify the following types of expenditure, to assist in complying with the new rules: ï details of food and beverages that have been provided other than in an in-house dining facility which is open to all employees; ï a breakdown of all costs associated with conferences and seminars, including food and beverages, accom- modation and the facility hire where applicable. Other necessary details are the names of the persons who attended, the business they represent and the duration of the conference/seminar; ï the entertainment portion of non-taxable allowances; ï details of meal allowances paid to employees while travelling on business, showing who travelled, the purpose of the trip and the dates/times involved; ï where entertainment expenditure is incurred in promoting or advertising, records showing that the promotion was open to the general public; ï where a promotion is not open to the general public and exceeds $500 or $25 per attendee (whichever is the greater), the names of all persons who attended (for the exemption to apply). Expenditure should be separately identified in relation to conferences/seminars, meal allowances while travel- ling on business and promotions and advertising. This will assist taxpayers in applying the appropriate exemp- tions. from page 19 For example, negotiations may be made with a motelier resulting in food and beverages provided without a specific charge in lieu of a higher room rate. In this case the entertainment expenditure has not been reasonably and fairly calculated having regard to the substance of the transaction and equivalent market values. Conse- quently the expenditure incurred on the accommodation will be reassessed by the Commissioner and the extent to which the expenditure is incurred in relation to entertainment determined. Where, however, a complimentary meal is provided by a motelier, for instance, no expenditure is incurred by the recipient and the meal will not, therefore, be subject to the regime. Fringe Benefit Tax The changes to the tax treatment of entertainment expenditure have resulted in a number of changes to the FBT regime. In most circumstances entertainment expenditure will be 50 percent non-deductible. However, any benefit that is considered to be entertainment (or would have been if not excluded) which employees may consume or enjoy it at a time which is at their discretion, and is not in the course of employment duties, will be subject to fringe benefit tax. This accordingly brings the following examples into the FBT system: ï subscriptions to golf clubs; ï subsidised groceries sold to employees by supermar- kets; ï gyms in workplaces (if access to the gym is limited to certain hours its use is still at the discretion of the employee); ï subsidised gym memberships. Where expenditure is subject to fringe benefit tax, the expense will be fully deductible. Some examples of areas that will not be subject to FBT but to the 50 percent non-deductibility rule are: ï staff Christmas parties (whether at work or not); ï subsidised drinks for staff at work, because they are not enjoyed at a time which is at employeesí discretion. As a result of these changes, the following exemptions from FBT have been removed: ï membership subscriptions; ï in-house benefits (only those which are entertain- ment); ï benefits provided to an employee for the purpose of enabling the employee to entertain customers or clients, as this now falls within the 50 percent non- deductibility rule. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Allowances To the extent that a non-taxable allowance is paid for the provision of entertainment that amount is subject to the regime. Apportionment is, therefore, required where an allowance is paid for entertainment and other forms of expenditure. The de minimis rules may apply. Amusement Amusement is included in the definition of recreation, the provision of which is deemed to be entertainment. Board meeting lunches The provision of food or drink at a board meeting will be subject to the regime unless it is taken or provided in a qualifying in-house dining facility. Where an em- ployee or director is attending a board meeting while undertaking deductible business travel, the $25 exemp- tion will apply. The eligible conference exemption may also apply. Business lunches Business lunches unless taken in a qualifying in-house dining facility are subject to the regime. See also client meals. Business training sessions Any entertainment provided at such a session is subject to the regime, excluding the provision of morning and afternoon tea, (and may be subject to the $25 exemption for an eligible conference). Business travel Business travel will not be subject to the regime unless the principal purpose of the travel is to facilitate enter- tainment. Cafeterias or canteens The provision of a cafeteria or canteen is specifically excluded from the definition of entertainment if it satisfies the criteria for an in-house dining facility. Charity shows Any entertainment expenditure incurred for the relief of poverty, illness, disability or other disadvantages is exempted from the changes. For example, expenditure on a childrenís hospital Christmas party is exempted. Tickets to a charity ball, however, are not exempt as the recipient of the entertainment - the employee - is not a ìcharityî. Christmas parties Christmas parties provided to employees and/or clients are subject to the entertainment regime rather than the FBT regime. Client meals Client meals are subject to the regime unless taken in an in-house dining facility. Goods and Services Tax The entertainment regime will also affect the treatment of GST. Input tax credits for entertainment expenditure will continue to be claimed in each taxable period as usual. However, when entertainment expenditure is calculated for income tax purposes a deemed supply of entertain- ment will arise and GST output tax will be payable by a registered person on the non-deductible amount. A deemed supply of entertainment will not apply to registered persons who are not subject to non-deductibil- ity for income tax purposes. A deemed supply will generally only arise where an expense is subject to 50 percent non-deductibility. The only exception is non-taxable allowances, as an input tax credit is not usually claimable for allowances. The adjustment is based on the amount of non-deduct- ible entertainment expenditure. The deemed time of supply of entertainment will be the date on which the tax return is required to be filed pursuant to the Income Tax Act, therefore including any extension of time arrangements. In calculating the assessable income of any registered person, no deduction shall be allowed for the GST output tax liability on this deemed supply of entertain- ment (see Section 140B). Application date The new entertainment regime will generally apply to expenditure incurred on or after 1†April 1993. The regime will affect 1993/94 income tax returns for businesses with early or standard balance dates. It will affect 1992/93 income tax returns for businesses with late balance dates. The regime will apply from 17 December 1992 where expenditure is incurred on or after that date for the purposes of facilitating entertainment enjoyed on or after 1 April 1993. Any prepayment of entertainment expenditure will, therefore, be subject to the regime. Examples The following are illustrative examples of how various types of expenditure might be treated. Note that in each case it will be the factual situation that will be relevant. Accommodation Accommodation is deemed to be entertainment where incurred in connection with, or for the purposes of facilitating the provision of food or drink or recreation.

Foreign Investment Fund Regime Sections 245R to 245RN, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction A new foreign investment fund (FIF) regime has been enacted. The new regime extends significantly the definition of an interest in a FIF and gives taxpayers four options for calculating a FIF income or loss. There are also rules for dealing with any change of method for calculating a FIF income or loss, and entry into or exit from the regime. The principle objective of the FIF regime is to tax currently the income earned by FIFs to the extent of the interests held by New Zealand residents. In conjunction with the controlled foreign company (CFC) regime, the FIF regime ensures that foreign income earned by foreign entities on behalf of New Zealand residents is subject to New Zealand tax. The FIF regime manifests the Governmentís policy that New Zealand residents be taxed on their world-wide income. The FIF and CFC regimes provide a mechanism for attributing the income of a foreign entity to a New Zealand resident who has an interest in that entity. The effect of the FIF and CFC regimes is that the same tax burden is borne by a New Zealand investor on income earned from investing in a foreign entity as on income from a New Zealand based investment. The previous FIF regime was enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.5) 1988. This regime, which never permanently came into force, has now been repealed. Because the previous FIF interest definition was very complicated, with a resultant inability of many investors to determine whether their interest in a foreign entity constituted a FIF interest, the former FIF regime was continually deferred. The main difficulty with the old FIF interest definition was its incorporation of an active/passive income distinction. This distinction has not been maintained in the new, simplified and wider FIF interest definition. The previous regime was also criticised because, by offering only the comparative value method to calculate a FIF income or loss, it assumed that the market value of FIF interests could be obtained by investors in all cases. This was not always possible. The new regime allows investors a choice of four methods to calculate their FIF income or loss. The new FIF regime applies to all FIF interests held by New Zealand residents on or after 1†April 1993. The new regime also applies to FIF interests acquired after 2†July 1992. Definition of an interest in a FIF - section 245RA(1) The following types of interest held by a person in a foreign entity are treated as an interest in a FIF, unless one of the exemptions listed below applies: ï An interest in a foreign company (including a foreign unit trust). ï An entitlement to benefit as a beneficiary or member of a foreign superannuation scheme. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) ï An interest in a foreign life insurance policy (this does not include a life insurance policy offered or entered into in New Zealand by a non-resident life insurer). Exemptions - section 245RA(2) An interest in a FIF does not include: ï A 10 percent or greater income interest in a CFC. ï An interest in a foreign entity that is: - resident and liable to income tax in a country that is specified in the Fifteenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act (i.e., a ìgrey listî country); and - not a foreign superannuation scheme or a foreign life insurance policy; and - not deemed to be a FIF by virtue of being speci- fied in Part C of the Sixteenth Schedule. ï An interest in an employment-related foreign super- annuation scheme (discussed further below). ï The aggregate interests in all FIFs held by a natural person with a cost of $20,000 or less (de minimis rule). Such small investors will not therefore be subject to the requirements of the FIF regime. This exemption applies to all FIF interests, including interests in foreign life insurance policies and foreign superannuation schemes. ï An interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person from deriving any income in New Zealand currency or realising the interest for New Zealand currency (locked-in currency exemption). This exemption is limited to three circumstances: - Where the interest was acquired before 2 July 1992; or - Where the interest was acquired before the holder first became a New Zealand resident; or - Where the interest was acquired before the exchange controls were imposed by the country in which the foreign entity is located. ï Interests in foreign life insurance policies or foreign superannuation schemes acquired by natural persons before they become resident in New Zealand for the first time. This exemption is limited to a period of four income years. (This exemption is intended to apply to new migrants to New Zealand and, in particular, to employees who are on temporary secondment to New Zealand.) Life insurance policy death benefits which a person was entitled to before 2†July 1992 or before becoming resident in New Zealand are also exempt from the FIF regime (section†245RB(7)). Part C of the new Sixteenth Schedule to the Income Tax Act allows for the naming of foreign entities or classes of foreign entities which will be deemed to constitute interests in FIFs. Such entities, if they are resident in a grey list country, will not be covered by the grey list exemption from the FIF regime. (No foreign entities have been listed as at the date of enactment of the new Sixteenth Schedule.) Interests in foreign superannuation schemes and foreign life insurance policies do not qualify for the grey list exemption because of the concessionary tax treatment for the superannuation and life insurance industries in all grey list countries. For example, superannuation schemes resident in Australia are taxed at 15 cents in the dollar. The new definition of an interest in a FIF represents a substantial improvement from a simplification view over the previous definition, which required investors to have an intimate knowledge of a foreign entity in order to determine whether they had an interest in a FIF or not. The new FIF definition does not contain an active/ passive distinction, which was also a feature of the former definition. Employment-Related Foreign Super- annuation Schemes - section 245R(1) A personís interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme is exempt from the FIF regime. An interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme is defined as a natural personís entitle- ment to benefit from a foreign superannuation scheme to the extent to which the entitlement is attributable to services performed when the person was not resident in New Zealand, where: ï The entitlement to benefit arises through employment (including self-employment). ï The amount contributed to the scheme was calculated to: - have a fixed relationship (e.g., a percentage) to the personís employment or self-employment income; or - provide benefits that bear a fixed relationship to the personís employment or self-employment income (except to the extent the benefits are adjusted for inflation only). ï Contributions to the scheme were made only by or on behalf of the person, any employer or any former superannuation scheme of the person. ï The future benefits of the person under the scheme are not assignable (except under a matrimonial property arrangement) or able to be surrendered or charged against so as to forgo future benefits in exchange for current property (unless due to ill health or permanent incapacity). ï The person cannot withdraw from the scheme before retirement without a substantial loss of entitlement for doing so (unless due to ill health, permanent incapac- ity, a transfer to a similar superannuation scheme or a transfer under a matrimonial property arrangement). from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Deemed Rate of Return Method - Section 245RE The DRR method for calculating FIF income or loss involves applying a deemed rate of return to the book value of a personís FIF interest. The DRR method will probably be used in those cases where the investor has insufficient information about the FIF to use any of the three other calculation meth- ods. This is likely to be in cases of interests in foreign life insurance policies and foreign superannuation schemes. The FIF income or loss of a person using the DRR method is calculated using the formula: a x b where - a is the book value of the interest at the end of the previous income year. b is the rate of return prescribed by regulation. The book value of a FIF interest at the end of an income year is calculated by the formula: f + g - h + i + j where - f is the book value of the interest at the end of the previous income year if the DRR method was used (in any other case nil). g is the aggregate of all expenditure incurred during the income year in acquiring the FIF interest. h is the aggregate of all gains (including proceeds of sale) derived from the FIF interest during the income year. i is the FIF income or loss in the income year calcu- lated using the DRR method. j is the aggregate of all amounts which are assessable income derived from the FIF interest in the income year under section 245RI (being the excess of any FIF distributions over the income calculated using the DRR method). Where a FIF interest is disposed of, the difference between the book value of the interest and the sale proceeds must be recognised as FIF income or loss. Where the proceeds of sale reduce the book value to an amount less than nil (indicating that inadequate amounts of income had previously been returned) this amount is treated as FIF income. Conversely, where all interests in a FIF are disposed of and the proceeds of sale reduce the book value of the interest to an amount greater than nil (indicating that excessive amounts of income had previously been returned) a deduction is allowed for this amount. This wash-up requirement is designed to ensure that persons using the DRR method are treated similarly to those persons who are required to use the CV method for calculating their FIF income or loss. Methods of calculating FIF income or loss - Sections 245RD - 245RG In order to increase flexibility and simplify compliance, the new FIF regime contains four methods of calculat- ing FIF income or loss: ï Comparative Value (CV) method ï Deemed Rate of Return (DRR) method ï Accounting Profits (AP) method ï Branch Equivalent (BE) method The choice of four calculation methods under the new FIF regime is a substantial improvement over the previous FIF regime, which offered only the CV method of calculating FIF income or loss. By offering four different methods of calculating FIF income or loss the new regime takes account of the different types of FIF interests and investors. Comparative Value Method - section 245RD It is anticipated that this method will be the principal method used to calculate FIF income or loss. Briefly, the method taxes the increase or decrease in the value of a personís interest in a FIF over an income year, as a surrogate for the underlying income accumulated by the FIF. Under the CV method, a person's FIF income or loss is calculated on the last day of the person's income year, using the formula: (a + b) - (c + d) where - a is the market value of the personís FIF interest at the end of the income year. b is the aggregate of all proceeds derived from the sale of a FIF interest and any distributions derived from the FIF interest. c is the market value of the interest at the end of the preceding income year. d is the aggregate of all expenditure incurred by the person in acquiring the FIF interest during the income year. Where a person calculates FIF income or loss using the CV method, no dividend or assessable income is deemed to be derived under the other provisions of the Income Tax Act. However, this rule is subject to section 245RI under which aggregate dividends in excess of total FIF income may be assessable (discussed below in the transitional issues section). The acquisition cost of a FIF interest also cannot be claimed as a deduction outside the FIF regime, nor can the interest be treated as trading stock (section 245RB(6)). The treatment of FIF interest holding costs will be governed by the general provisions of the Income Tax Act. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) This adjustment on sale does not apply to natural persons whose aggregate FIF interests have a book value of $100,000 or less, and where any gain on disposition would not have been assessable income for such persons outside the FIF regime. In the case of an acquisition or disposition of a FIF interest during an income year, the income year is divided into two notional income years which are both subject to the DRR method. When the first notional year ends and the second notional year begins is determined by the date of acquisition or disposition of the FIF interest. The prescribed rate of return applying to each notional year is adjusted according to the number of days in each. Where a person calculates FIF income or loss using the DRR method, no dividend or assessable income or acquisition deduction or trading stock treatment can arise under any other provisions of the Income Tax Act (section 245RB(6)). As noted above with the CV method, this rule is subject to section 245RI (under which aggregate dividends in excess of total FIF income may be assessable). Accounting Profits Method - Section 245RF Under the AP method, FIF income or loss is calculated by the formula: a x b where - a is the personís income interest percentage calculated as if the FIF was a CFC. b is the net after-tax accounting profits of the FIF for the accounting period. Under the AP method a taxpayer can elect to use a simplified measurement of income interest method, which involves measuring an income interest at 31 March only instead of at the end of each quarter (as required under the CFC regime). Any such election is binding for that FIF interest in subsequent years. Where a person incurs a FIF loss in excess of the economic or financial loss suffered by the person, the amount of the FIF loss is limited to the amount of the actual economic or financial loss. The branch equivalent tax account (BETA) regime has been extended to apply to FIF income calculated under the AP method (section 245RH). Credits arising under the FIF regime will be subject to the same jurisdictional ring-fencing as CFC credits. The BETA regime applies as if: ï the FIF income were attributed foreign income; and ï the FIF were a CFC; and ï the FIF interest of the holder were an income interest. Branch Equivalent Method - section 245RG FIF income or loss calculated under the BE method uses the same rules (with some modifications) as are em- ployed to calculate branch equivalent income or loss under the CFC regime. The BE method is an exact determination of a FIFís income or loss under New Zealand tax rules. The other FIF income or loss calcula- tion methods can therefore be viewed as proxies for the BE method, which represents the most accurate calcula- tion of a FIFís income or loss. The BE method, how- ever, requires the investor to have more information about a FIF than the other methods. FIF income or loss is calculated under the BE method using the formula: a x b where - a is the income interest percentage of the FIF interest holder for the accounting period calculated under section 245D as if the FIF was a CFC. b is the branch equivalent income or loss of the FIF for the accounting period calculated under section 245J as if the FIF was a CFC. Where a person incurs a FIF loss in excess of the economic or financial loss suffered, the amount of FIF loss is limited to the amount of the actual economic or financial loss. The CFC regime foreign tax credit rules apply to FIF income calculated under the BE method. The BETA regime is also extended to FIF income calculated under the BE method (section 245RH). Restrictions on choice of calculation method - section 245RC(1)-(7) General rules Subject to certain restrictions, anyone with FIF interests may elect to use any of the four methods of calculating FIF income or loss by furnishing their returns with the chosen method or methods. However, a taxpayer must have suitable information about a FIF interest in order to use a particular method. A person who has interests in different FIFs may use different calculation methods for those interests. Where a person has two or more interests in the same FIF, the person must use the same calculation method for that FIF. An exception to this rule is where a personís interests in the same FIF are of different classes and using the same calculation method for all classes of interest is not possible under the regimeís provisions. In this case, calculation methods may differ between different classes of interest but not within the same class of interest. Where a person with a FIF interest is not required to use one particular calculation method and does not elect to from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) ï the net after-tax accounting profits include any extraordinary items; and ï the person has no reason to believe that the net after- tax accounting profits of the FIF do not fairly repre- sent the net after-tax profits for the accounting period; and ï the Commissioner has not concluded that the net after-tax accounting profits do not fairly represent the net after-tax profits of the FIF for the accounting period; and ï the FIF is not included in Part D of the Sixteenth Schedule of entities for which the AP method cannot be used. BE Method The BE method may only be used where the following requirements are met: ï the FIF is a company; and ï the person can provide to the Commissioner, if requested, sufficient information to allow the Com- missioner to verify the FIF income or loss calculations using the BE method. Change of calculation method - section 245RC(8)-(10) In certain circumstances it is possible for a person to change the calculation method for a FIF interest in a succeeding period. There are restrictions on changing methods in order to prevent persons from gaining a tax advantage by choosing the method that would produce the lowest FIF income or highest FIF loss in a particular income year or accounting period. General Rule A person must continue to use the same calculation method for a FIF interest in successive periods, except in certain cases: ï where it is mandatory to change to a new method in a succeeding period; or ï where a person is permitted to use a different calcula- tion method in a succeeding period. Mandatory Change of Method Existing Method No Longer Practicable To Use A person must change from the AP, BE or CV methods where it is no longer reasonably practicable for the person to use any of these methods in the succeeding period because it is not possible to: ï obtain information sufficient to continue to use the AP method or any of the AP method requirements (e.g., that net after-tax accounting profits are calculated under generally accepted accounting principles) are no longer satisfied. use any particular calculation method, the following default sequence takes place: ï AP method deemed to have been elected. ï If AP method not practicable, then CV method. ï If CV method not practicable, then DRR method. The restrictions on the use of each calculation method are set out below. CV Method As with all other calculation methods, there must be suitable information available for a person to use the CV method. Principally, the market value of a FIF interest needs to be able to be ascertained at the end of each income year. It was mainly for the reason that this market value information could not always be obtained under the former FIF regime that the other calculation methods were developed. DRR Method The DRR method may only be used: ï where it is not reasonably practicable for the person to use the CV method (because the person cannot ascertain the market value of the FIF interest at the end of the income year) or the AP method; or ï by a natural person whose FIF interests do not have an aggregate market value of more than $100,000; or ï where a person has made no election and cannot use the AP or CV methods; or ï where the person used the DRR method previously, and is required to continue to use the method under section 245RC(8). AP Method The AP method may only be used where the following requirements are met: ï the FIF is a company listed on a recognised exchange or interests in it are offered widely to the public for subscription or purchase; and ï the net after-tax accounting profits of the FIF are calculated under generally accepted accounting principles of the country in which the FIF is resident; and ï the net after-tax accounting profits are detailed in financial statements which are: - sent or made available to shareholders in the company; and - readily available to interested members of the public; and - audited by a chartered accountant (or accountant of equivalent standard in the FIFís country of residence) who has given a standard audit opinion (without any qualifications) to the effect that the financial statements represent the income and financial position of the FIF and; continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) ï obtain information sufficient to continue to use the BE method or to provide to the Commissioner (if re- quested) sufficient information to allow the Commis- sioner to verify the BE method calculations. ï ascertain the end-of-year market value of the FIF interest so as to be able to continue to use the CV method. Change from DRR Method A person must change from the DRR method where: ï the person was entitled to use the DRR method (under section 245RC(3)(b)) because that person is a natural person, whose aggregate market value of FIF interests did not exceed $100,000, and s/he ceases to be entitled to use the DRR method because his or her aggregate FIF interests exceed the $100,000 thresh- old; or ï the person had to use the DRR method under the default provision (section 245RC(7)) and the default provision ceases to apply because the person elects to use a different method or the AP or CV methods become practicable to use. Voluntary Change of Method Change to BE Method A person may change to the BE method from another calculation method where: ï Notice is given to the Commissioner: - In such form as the Commissioner may allow; - Specifying the reasons for the change; - Before the beginning of the accounting period or income year in which the change will take effect (unless the Commissioner allows a different period of notice); and ï The person is electing to change to the BE method for the first time for that FIF interest (except where the Commissioner permits a change to the BE method for the FIF interest on more than one occasion because there is a change of circumstances (e.g., a significant shareholding change) and the Commissioner consid- ers that altering the incidence of income tax was not the primary purpose or effect of the subsequent change). Change from BE Method A person may change from the BE method to another calculation method where: ï Notice is given to the Commissioner: - In such form as the Commissioner may allow; - Specifying the reasons for the change; - Before the beginning of the income year or accounting period in which the change will take effect (unless the Commissioner allows a differ- ent period of notice); and ï The person is changing back to the calculation method the person used for the FIF interest immedi- ately before using the BE method; and ï The person has not previously elected to change from the BE method for that FIF interest, except where the Commissioner considers that: - the subsequent change is preceded by a change in factual circumstances (e.g. a significant shareholding change) which significantly alters the ability of the person to obtain information sufficient to use the BE method; and - altering the incidence of income tax was not the primary purpose or effect of the subsequent change. Change by Natural Person A natural person may change to any available calcula- tion method where: ï S/he gives notice to the Commissioner: - In such form as the Commissioner may allow; - Specifying the reasons for the change; - Not later than the end of the income year (or end of the FIF accounting period) preceding the income year (or accounting period) at the end of which the change takes effect; and ï The aggregate market value of the personís FIF interests does not exceed $100,000 at the end of the income year (or end of the FIF accounting period) preceding the income year (or accounting period) at the end of which the change takes effect. Consequences of change of calculation methods - section 245RM Where a person changes the calculation method for a FIF interest from the: ï AP or BE methods to CV or DRR methods; or ï CV or DRR methods to AP or BE methods - there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the interest at market value at the beginning of the FIF accounting period. In the case of a person changing the calculation method for a FIF interest from the CV method to the DRR method there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the interest at market value at the beginning of the taxpayerís next income year. In the case of a person changing the calculation method for a FIF interest from the DRR method to the CV method there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition of the interest at book value (calculated under section 245RE(5)) at the beginning of the taxpayerís next income year. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) value of the property at the time of the acquisition. This rule only applies where the person acquiring the FIF interest applies the CV or DRR methods to that interest. Property becoming a FIF interest Where a person holds property which becomes a FIF interest as a result of any section 245RA(2) exemption ceasing to apply, the following treatment applies: ï If the person uses the CV or DRR methods in relation to the FIF interest, there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition at market value of the property at the time of its change in status; or ï If the person uses the AP or BE methods for the FIF interest and the change in status occurs during the FIF accounting period, the FIF income or loss will be apportioned according to the number of days in the accounting period in which the property is not a FIF interest. Property ceasing to be a FIF interest Where any property ceases to be a FIF interest as a result of any of the exemptions in section 245RA(2) commencing to apply, the following treatment applies: ï If the person used the CV or DRR methods when the property constituted a FIF interest, there is a deemed disposition and reacquisition at market value of the property at the time of its change in status; or ï If the person used the AP or BE methods when the property constituted a FIF interest, and the change in status of the property occurs during the FIF account- ing period, the FIF income or loss is apportioned according to the number of days in the accounting period in which the property is not a FIF interest. Calculating FIF income or loss - section 245RB Certain general rules apply with regard to the amount and timing of FIF income or loss: ï A person's FIF income or loss calculated under the CV or DRR methods is treated as being derived or incurred in the income year for which it is calculated. ï A person's FIF income or loss calculated under the AP or BE methods is treated as being derived or incurred in the person's income year in which the accounting period of the FIF ends. ï No FIF income or loss can arise to the extent to which a person holds a FIF interest while not resident in New Zealand. ï Any amount of FIF income or loss calculated for a FIF interest that a person holds while resident in New Zealand is treated as income with a New Zealand source, regardless of any subsequent change of residence. As already noted, where a person calculates a FIF income or loss under the CV or DRR methods (except to Entry into and exit from FIF regime - section 245RL There are certain rules applying to a series of circum- stances in which a person enters into or exits from the FIF regime. These circumstances are: ï Where a person becomes a New Zealand resident ï Where a person ceases to be a New Zealand resident ï Where a person dies ï On the disposition of a FIF interest for nil or inad- equate consideration ï On the acquisition of a FIF interest for nil or inad- equate consideration ï Property becoming a FIF interest because an exemp- tion ceases to apply ï Property ceasing to be a FIF interest because an exemption begins to apply. Here are the rules applying to these circumstances: Person becoming a New Zealand resident Where a person becomes a New Zealand resident and any property held by the person constitutes a FIF interest, there is a deemed acquisition at market value of the property at the time the person becomes a New Zealand resident, but only where the person uses the CV or DRR methods. Person ceasing to be a New Zealand resident A person with a FIF interest who ceases to be resident in New Zealand, and who uses the CV or DRR methods, is deemed to have disposed of the property constituting the FIF interest at market value at the time the person ceases to be a New Zealand resident. Deemed disposition on death Where a person with a FIF interest dies, there is a deemed disposition of the property constituting the FIF interest at market value at the time of death. This deemed disposition only applies where the deceased used the CV or DRR methods. Inadequate consideration received on disposal of FIF interest A FIF interest holder who disposes of any property which constituted the FIF interest for nil or inadequate (i.e. below market value) consideration, is deemed to have derived consideration equal to the market value of the property at the time of the disposition. This rule only applies where the person used the CV or DRR methods for the FIF interest disposed of. Inadequate consideration paid on acqui- sition of FIF interest A person who acquires any property which constitutes a FIF interest for nil or inadequate consideration (or on an in†specie distribution from a company or trust) is deemed to have paid consideration equal to the market continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) the extent that section 245RI applies): ï the person will not be treated as having derived any assessable income under any other provisions in the Income Tax Act; and ï the person will not be allowed a deduction under any other provision of the Income Tax Act for the acquisi- tion cost of the FIF interest (e.g., no deduction allowed for interest on money borrowed to acquire a FIF interest); and ï the FIF interest cannot be treated as trading stock. Change of Accounting Year - section 245RB(8)-(10) A person whose FIF income or loss is calculated under the AP or BE methods may elect, with the Commission- erís approval, to base the calculation on a new account- ing period of the FIF where that accounting year has changed. If the election is approved, the accounting period of the fund is deemed to commence on the day after the last day of the previous accounting year. One of the factors which the Commissioner may consider when deciding whether to approve a change of accounting year election is whether the election (if approved) would result in a deferral of tax liability on FIF income. Conversion into New Zealand currency - section 245RB(11) and (12) If a personís FIF income or loss is calculated under the AP method, the net after-tax accounting profits are calculated in the currency in which the FIF prepares its financial accounts (or, if no such accounts are prepared, in the currency of the country in which the FIF is resident). These net after-tax accounting profits are converted into New Zealand currency at the average over the accounting period of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month falling within the accounting period. A person may elect that this procedure shall not apply to that person in which case the person would be required to convert any receipts into New Zealand currency when they are derived. Where a personís FIF income or loss is calculated under the CV or DRR methods, any gain or expenditure or loss is converted into New Zealand currency at the average over the income year of the close of trading spot exchange rates for the fifteenth day of each complete month falling within the personís income year. Again, a person may elect not to apply this procedure. These currency conversion procedures are designed to reduce compliance costs. Treatment of FIF losses - sections 245RJ and 245RK General rules: Deductibility of FIF losses - section 245RJ FIF losses calculated under the AP, CV or DRR meth- ods incurred by a person in an income year or carried forward to that income year are aggregated and can be: ï set off against any FIF income (except FIF income calculated under the BE method) derived by that person in that income year; or ï where the Commissioner is satisfied that the balance of the FIF loss does not exceed the aggregate FIF income (excluding FIF income calculated under the BE method) derived in any previous income years, the person is entitled to offset that FIF loss against other assessable income. The aggregate prior year FIF income is reduced by the amount of that loss for the purposes of the subsequent operation of the provision. Deductibility of BE method loss FIF losses calculated under the BE method are subject to the CFC regime loss rules. Accordingly, any FIF loss of a person calculated under the BE method will be ring- fenced to the jurisdiction that the FIF is resident in and set off against FIF income (calculated under the BE method) derived by that person in that jurisdiction only. It will also be possible to set off such FIF losses against the attributed foreign income of a CFC resident in the same jurisdiction. Conversely, the attributed foreign loss of a person in relation to a CFC will be able to be set off against FIF income (calculated under the BE method) derived by that person in the same jurisdiction (section 245M(1)). FIF loss carry forward rules The rules applying to the carry forward of FIF losses are substantially similar to those contained in section 188: ï If a FIF loss cannot be set off in the year it is incurred it can be carried forward to the succeeding income year. ï Where FIF losses incurred in two or more income years are carried forward, those losses must be set off in the same order as they were incurred. ï If a company incurs any FIF loss, the requirements of section 188 must be satisfied (for example, those relating to shareholder continuity) in order for that loss to be carried forward by the company (the FIF loss is deemed to have been incurred on the last day of the income year). Commissioner’s determination of FIF loss Where a person has furnished a return showing a loss that cannot be fully set off in that income year the from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Deferral of FIF tax liability - section 245RN In certain circumstances some taxpayers will be able to elect to defer their FIF income tax liability until they have received income from their FIF interests in cash (including proceeds of sale). This concession will be subject to use of money interest being paid on the amount of deferred tax. The option is targeted at certain small investors and is designed to alleviate the cash flow difficulties such investors may experience from being taxed on an accrual basis. The requirements of this deferral option are: ï It is limited to a natural person who has a FIF tax liability in an income year from FIF interests acquired before 2 July 1992 or before the person first became a New Zealand resident. ï The person cannot realise the FIF interest, or would be subject to a significant economic loss if s/he did dispose of the interest. ï The personís assessable income for the income year (after deducting the aggregate of the total income tax payable by the person and the FIF income) must be less than $20,000. ï The person elects, by notice in writing to the Commis- sioner in such form as the Commissioner allows, to defer the payment of an amount of tax in the income year calculated by the formula: a x †b† c where - a is the person's total income tax payable in the income year. b is the person's FIF income in the income year. c is the person's total assessable income in the income year. ï The amount of tax deferred is subject to the use of money interest regime. ï The amount of any use of money interest imposed is itself deferred. ï Payment of the amount of tax (and use of money interest) deferred is suspended until the earliest of when: - the person disposes of the FIF interest; or - the FIF interest ceases to exist; or - the person is able to realise the FIF interest without significant economic loss. ï The amount of tax deferred is reduced by the amount of any cash distribution received by the person during the term of the investment. Entertainment expenditure Expenditure incurred by a FIF on entertainment con- sumed or enjoyed outside New Zealand will not be Commissioner shall make a determination of the personís FIF loss and the amount of any FIF loss that can be carried forward to a later income year. The Commissioner shall give notice of a determination of a FIF loss or a FIF loss carried forward to the person. Such notice may be included in a notice of assessment made under section 29(1) or a notice of determination of loss made under section 29(2). Exemption for dealers from FIF loss rules Where a person in an income year has incurred a FIF loss from an interest calculated under the AP, CV or DRR methods, and the person acquired the FIF interest: ï As part of a business which comprises or includes dealing in such interests; or ï For the purpose of deriving a gain on disposal of the interest; or ï As part of an undertaking or scheme entered into or devised for the purpose of making a profit - the loss is not subject to the FIF regime and instead is treated as if it were a loss incurred in gaining or produc- ing assessable income. Exemption from FIF loss rules for certain natural persons A natural person who has carried forward a FIF loss to an income year, and whose foreign entity interests are not subject to the FIF regime in that income year because of the application of section 245RA(2)(d) ($20,000 de minimis), may set off that carried forward loss against the assessable income derived from those interests. Company grouping loss rules - section 245RK A company which has FIF losses (including carried forward losses) calculated under the AP, CV or DRR methods may offset them against any FIF income (except FIF income calculated under the BE method) derived by another company in the same wholly-owned group as the loss company. The general requirements of section 191A apply to any grouping of FIF losses with certain modifications (e.g., the non-application of the part-year loss grouping provisions). A company's FIF loss calculated under the BE method is subject to the loss grouping rules (including ring- fencing) under the CFC regime. If the CFC require- ments are met, the FIF loss may be offset against the attributed foreign income or FIF income (calculated under the BE method) derived in the same jurisdiction by another company in the same wholly-owned group as the loss company. Conversely, a company's attributed foreign loss will be able to be offset against FIF income (calculated under the BE method) derived in the same jurisdiction by another company in the same wholly- owned group (section 245N(1)). continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) subject to the new restrictions (enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993) on the deductibility of entertainment expenditure. Disclosure - section 245W Any person with a FIF interest must disclose to the Commissioner in the prescribed form and with the person's return of income for the income year: ï the existence and nature of the FIF interest; and ï any other information as may be required by the Commissioner in respect of that interest for the purposes of the administration of the Income Tax Act. Application date and transitional treatment - sections 245RI, 245RL and 245Y The new FIF regime applies to all FIF interests held by New Zealand residents on 1†April 1993. It also applies to FIF interests acquired after 2†July 1992 (1992 Budget night, when the new FIF regime was announced). The new FIF regime will therefore apply, at the earliest, in the 1991/92 income year for taxpayers with a 1991/ 92 balance date ending after 2†July 1992, (i.e., between 3†July 1992 and 30†September 1992 inclusive) and who acquired a FIF interest after 2†July 1992. Any FIF income or loss, or income or loss arising on the deemed reacquisition of property on 1†April 1993 pursuant to section 245RL(1)(d), which is derived or incurred in an income year ending on or before 31†March 1993, will be deemed to be derived or in- curred in the 1993-94 income year. However, a FIF loss incurred in the 1992-93 income year from FIF interests acquired after 2†July 1992 will, where a person so elects, not be deemed to be incurred in the 1993-94 income year (section 245Y(10)). Generally, FIF income or loss will only need to be taken into account for provisional tax purposes from the 1993- 94 income year. Transitional Rules for Interests Acquired before 2 July 1992 If a person acquired a FIF interest before 2†July 1992 and disposes of that interest before 1†April 1993, the person is deemed never to have held that interest (except to the extent that the property is reacquired) and accordingly no FIF income or loss will be derived or incurred in respect of that interest. If a FIF interest acquired before 2 July 1992 is held on 1 April 1993, and the holder is using the CV or the DRR methods of calculating FIF income or loss, the holder is deemed to have disposed of the property constituting the FIF interest on 31†March 1993 and to have reacquired it on 1†April 1993 for a consideration equal to: ï the market value of the property on 31 March 1993; or ï where the holder so elects, the cost of the property. Additionally, the interest holder is deemed never to have held the interest before 1†April 1993 for the purposes of calculating FIF income or loss. Where a FIF interest acquired before 2†July 1992 is held on 1†April 1993, and the interest holder uses the AP or BE methods, then for the purposes of calculating FIF income or loss: ï the interest holder is deemed never to have held any interest in the FIF in any accounting period of the FIF that ended before 1 April 1993; and ï where any accounting period commences before and ends after 1†April 1993, the amount of FIF income or loss is reduced by an amount calculated by: a x †b† c where - a is the FIF income or loss calculated under the AP or BE methods. b is the number of days in the accounting period that occurred before 1†April 1993. c is the number of days in the accounting period. Any gain (other than from a disposition) which would have been assessable had the FIF regime not been enacted (i.e., without regard to section 245RB(6) under which a person using the CV or DRR methods is deemed to derive no assessable income (other than FIF income) from a FIF interest) is deemed to be a dividend where: ï the interest holder uses the DRR method; or ï the interest holder (using the DRR or CV methods) has elected under section 245RL(1)(d) to use cost as the initial value of the interest at 31 March 1993 (for an interest acquired before 2 July 1992) - to the extent that the aggregate gains exceed the net FIF income derived. Refund of tax paid under previous FIF regime Section 52 of the Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 provides that taxpayers who had actually paid income tax on FIF income before the retrospective deferral of the previous regime in 1991 will be refunded the tax, notwithstanding section 394M, which limits refunds of tax to the amount of the credit balance in a taxpayerís imputation credit account. from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Introduction Section 245GA subjects all non-dividend repatriations made after 2†July 1992 to Foreign Dividend Withhold- ing Payments (FDWP) or income tax. Background Since 1 April 1988 New Zealand has subjected all foreign dividends received by a New Zealand resident company to a 33 percent withholding tax obligation called FDWP. The amount of foreign dividend income received by New Zealand residents has declined since the introduc- tion of FDWP. This is due in part to Controlled Foreign Companies (CFCs) repatriating profits to New Zealand in non-dividend forms to avoid incurring an FDWP liability. For example, a CFC used to be able to repatriate its profits to New Zealand by: ï lending money to its parent or an associated company in New Zealand ï purchasing property in New Zealand ï injecting capital into or purchasing equity in an associated New Zealand company. The Government announced in the 1992 budget that it would seek to impose FDWP on non-dividend transac- tions which may be in substitution for dividends. Key issues The regime will only apply to taxpayers who have an income interest of 10 percent or greater in a CFC for any accounting period. FDWP (for companies) or income tax (for individuals) will be payable on specified repatriations of the CFC. Specified repatriations are the lesser of: ï the CFCís increase in investment in New Zealand property; and ï the amount of unrepatriated income of the CFC. The increase in investment in New Zealand property is the excess of the investment in New Zealand property as of the last day of the CFCís accounting period over the amount measured on the later of the end of the CFCís immediately preceding accounting period and 2†July 1992. Unrepatriated income of the CFC basically consists of revenue and certain reserves that have not been returned to the shareholders. New Zealand property New Zealand property of a CFC is the aggregate of: ï tangible property (which includes real property) situated in New Zealand ï shares or options over shares in companies which are resident in New Zealand and are associated with the CFC ï the balances of any loans and other financial arrange- ments lent by the CFC to any person resident in New Zealand and associated with the CFC. Exclusions from New Zealand property Certain transactions are removed from the ambit of the regime. They are: Tangible property Tangible property will not include the following: ï property disposed of by the CFC by the later of 364 days after the date of acquisition, and nine months after the end of the accounting period of the CFC in which the acquisition occurred. ï property situated in New Zealand for less than 365 days in total. The value of any tangible property will be reduced by the net principal balance of third-party indebtedness incurred to acquire or improve the property secured by a lien on the property. Loans New Zealand property will not include loans made by the CFC to associated persons resident in New Zealand where the loan is reasonably expected and does in fact mature within 365 days of when it is issued. FDWP or income tax incurred on loans will be refunded if such loans are repaid within five years. In calculating the balance of any loan outstanding, and where there are loans both from the CFC to the New Zealand parent and from the New Zealand parent to the CFC, the outstanding balances of the loans may be aggregated and netted off, so that FDWP is only payable on the net balance of the outstanding loans. Where a loan is in a foreign currency, the loan should be converted to New Zealand dollars on the date which it was issued. Pre-existing Business New Zealand property will not include ownership of tangible property or a company if such property or company represents a component of a pre-existing operating business of the CFC and no associated person resident in New Zealand is engaged in the same line of business. Anti-Avoidance Rules Anti-avoidance rules have been introduced to address situations where taxpayers may try to structure transac- Non-Dividend Repatriations Section 245GA, Income Tax Act 1976 continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) b is the aggregate, at the end of the accounting period of the CFCís ï paid-up capital; and ï share premium account, excluding ï amounts resulting from bonus issues by the CFC except to the extent that such bonus issues were dividends derived by a person resident in New Zealand; or ï Reinvestment directly or indirectly of CFC distribu- tions after 2 July 1992 except to the extent to which such distributions resulted in dividends derived by a person resident in New Zealand; c is the aggregate of specified repatriations of the CFC for accounting periods preceding the accounting period in question ending after 2 July 1992 adjusted by any amended assessments made by the Commis- sioner. Due date for paying FDWP For companies, FDWP incurred on specified repatriations is due at the time FDWP would be due for a dividend the company received six months after the later of: ï the end of the accounting period of the CFC in which the attributed repatriation is calculated, or ï 1 April 1993. For other taxpayers, the dividend will be deemed to be derived at the later of the end of the CFC's accounting period and 1 April 1993. A taxpayerís domestic losses can be used to offset any FDWP or income tax payable. We will publish a more detailed explanation of the non- dividend repatriation legislation in a future Tax Infor- mation Bulletin. This will explain the legislation for the underlying foreign tax credit regime (announced by the Government in December 1992) when it is enacted. Application Date The regime will apply to all non-dividend repatriations made after 2 July 1992. from page 33 tions to defeat the purposes of the legislation. These include: ï Where a loan is made to an associated person and specifically guaranteed by the CFC, the loan shall be deemed to have been made by the CFC, regardless of whether such loan is made by a related person and regardless of whether such loan is made by a person resident in New Zealand. ï A loan made to an associated person resident in New Zealand and funded directly or indirectly through back-to-back loans (regardless of whether such back- to-back loans are routed through unrelated persons) from one or more associated persons with the CFC , shall be deemed made by the CFC. ï Rules have been inserted to treat rolled-over short- term loans as long-term loans. ï Short-term drops in outstanding loan balances are ignored around the last day of the CFCís income year if the circumstances indicate such fluctuation was incurred to avoid the effects of the legislation. ï Loans paid within five years but which are substituted in whole or part by another loan are treated as not maturing within five years. Unrepatriated Income FDWP (for companies) or income tax (for individuals) will be payable on the lesser of the CFCís increase in investment in New Zealand property and the amount of its unrepatriated income. Unrepatriated income of a CFC is calculated using the following formula: a - b - c where a is the aggregate shareholdersí funds of the CFC at the end of the accounting period (measured under gener- ally accepted accounting principles of New Zealand). Changes to the CFC Regime Sections 245A-Q, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The CFC regime has been amended. The changes include the removal of France from the grey list, the addition of some new concessions to the 16th Schedule, the introduction of a de facto control test, the deferral of full implementation of the CFC regime until 1 April 1993 and the setting of a new control interest level. Background The intent of the CFC regime is to subject foreign source income earned by New Zealand residents to the same level of New Zealand tax as income earned domestically. The Government has stated that it would review the regime to ensure that this policy intent is achieved. As a result the following amendments have been made. 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Key Issues The CFC regime will operate in all countries other than those on the ìgrey listî (the 15th Schedule) from 1 April 1993. The CFC regime has been operating with respect to CFCs resident in ìblack listî countries (the 17th Schedule), which are generally tax havens, since 1988. The 17th Schedule was designed as an interim measure. The grey list has been amended to exclude France from 1 April 1993. Otherwise the grey list is confirmed as the current list of countries. The exemption from taxing earnings of companies resident in grey list countries (the 15th Schedule) applies to both the CFC and FIF regimes. The original grey list included Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. The government has made a commitment to review the income tax laws of foreign countries at regular intervals based on the criteria announced in the 1992 Budget. The following concessions have been specified in the 16th Schedule effective from 1†April 1993. ï In the case of Australia, any special allowances, reliefs or exemptions relating to offshore banking units. ï In the case of Canada, any special allowances, reliefs, or exemptions relating to international banking centres. ï In the case of the Federal Republic of Germany, any special allowances, reliefs, or exemptions relating to regional located investment in the former German Democratic Republic or in West Berlin. ï In the case of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, any special allowances, reliefs, or exemptions relating to activities carried on in enterprise zones. Any person with an income interest in a CFC that has taken advantage of a listed (16th Schedule) concession in a grey list country must calculate attributed foreign income on its interest in the CFC. The definition of a CFC has been changed from a foreign company in which five or fewer New Zealand residents own 50% or more, to a foreign company in which five or fewer New Zealand residents own more than 50%. The new control rule was introduced so that a 50/50 joint venture between New Zealand resident and non-resident partners would be excluded from the CFC regime. A two tier de facto control test has been introduced so that where a foreign company is effectively controlled by five or fewer New Zealand residents, it will be a CFC. The first part of the de facto test deems a foreign company to be a CFC if at any time during the account- ing period a single New Zealand resident holds a control interest in the CFC equal to or greater than 40%. The exception to this is where another person that is not a New Zealand resident nor associated with the New Zealand resident that would otherwise be deemed to control the foreign company, has a control interest in the foreign company equal to or greater than the control interest of the New Zealand resident. The second part of the de facto control rule states that a foreign company will be deemed to be a CFC if there is a group of five or fewer New Zealand residents who have the power to control the exercise of the share- holder decision making rights. The purpose of the de facto control rules is to prevent New Zealand residents from decontrolling CFCs to avoid the requirements of calculating the income of the CFC under the branch equivalent method. It is also necessary to prevent abuse by taxpayers who do not have legal control of a CFC but exercise actual control. Application Date These amendments apply from 1 April 1993. Western Samoan Tax Credit Scheme Sections 245K, 293, 394ZM and Schedule 17A, Income Tax Act 1976 Taxpayers will not be able to claim foreign tax credits for taxes paid to Western Samoa on income derived on or after 9†March 1993, except for credits relating to wages and salaries. On 2†March 1993 Western Samoa passed legislation which enables foreign companies to claim in their home jurisdictions a foreign tax credit for Samoan tax which, in substance, has not been paid. Section 293 of the Income Tax Act allows New Zealand residents a credit for tax paid in a foreign jurisdiction on income that is taxable both in New Zealand and in the foreign jurisdiction. On 9 March 1993 the Minister of Revenue announced the Governmentís intention to enact legislation to ensure that no one would be able to utilise the Western Samoan scheme at the expense of the New Zealand tax base. Section 293 has been amended to disallow any foreign tax credit for income tax paid in a country specified in a new Schedule 17A to the extent that the income tax is paid on the types of income specified in the Schedule. A new Schedule 17A has been inserted in the Income Tax Act. The only country that was specified in this Schedule on its enactment was Western Samoa. The non-recognition of Western Samoan tax credits applies to all Western Samoan income tax except income tax on salary or wages. Similar amendments disallowing tax credits for income tax paid in countries specified in Schedule 17A have been made to the controlled foreign company and foreign dividend withholding payment regimes, as a credit for foreign tax paid is separately allowed for in those regimes. These amendments apply from 9 March 1993. 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Livestock Valuation Sections 86-86L, 175, 185A-E, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The Government reform of the way livestock are valued for tax purposes has been enacted. The trading stock scheme has been repealed and a national standard cost scheme introduced. The herd scheme has been made more flexible and a new adverse event income scheme has been introduced. Background A discussion paper on the valuation of specified live- stock for taxation purposes was released in December 1991. The Ministers of Revenue, Finance and Agricul- ture then established a Livestock Valuation Consultative Committee to review the discussion paper. The Com- mittee's key aims were to: ï examine the need to replace the trading stock scheme with a national standard cost scheme and the feasibil- ity of doing so; ï consider the merits of introducing a method by which livestock owners can use their own costs to value livestock; and ï examine the herd scheme and the high priced stock scheme. The Government released the Committeeís report on 2†September 1992. It contained Government decisions on the Committeeís recommendations. The legislation arising from those decisions was included in the Taxa- tion Reform Bill (No.6) 1992. The new regime applied from the 1992/93 income year, except in the case of the new adverse event income equalisation scheme, which applies from 1†April 1993. Outline of new regime Livestock valuation options The trading stock scheme is repealed, as it is an inap- propriate method of valuing livestock, and a national standard cost scheme has been introduced. National standard cost is based on national average cost of production rather than market values, the basis of the trading stock scheme. Under the new national standard cost scheme, a farmer applies a national standard cost value to homebred stock, while purchased stock are valued at their pur- chase price. The average of these costs is applied to stock on hand at yearís end to derive a closing value. Broadly speaking this approach is used to determine to value of rising one year and rising two year immature stock (and rising three year in the case of male non- breeding cattle). Once livestock reach maturity the cost assigned to a particular animal is held until the animal is sold or dies. Taxpayers will be able to move stock between national standard cost and the market value/replacement price options on a yearly basis for each inventory group (e.g., rising one year, rising two year, mature stock). National standard cost cannot be used in conjunction with the actual cost option, and movement between national standard cost and the cost option and vice versa will require two yearsí notice. The Government considers the herd scheme to be the most important valuation scheme and that its treatment of the herd as a capital asset is now well accepted. Thus much work was undertaken on improving the scheme. Until now the scheme required farmers to value their stock at 100 percent of the national average market values, which are set by Order in Council. The resultant increases in the value of the herd were tax free, while decreases were not deductible. This position has changed as the new legislation introduces herdstock ratios, to allow farmers to value their herd livestock in the range of 90 percent to 130 percent of the national average market values (depending on valuation) so as to take into account regional, breed and quality variations. The herd scheme has been further amended to allow some stock to be valued under the herd scheme and some under an alternative valuation option, such as national standard cost. Where the herd scheme is being used a taxpayer will be allowed to value increases in stock numbers in any class under the herd scheme or some alternative valuation method or option. Animals in the alternative valuation option can be moved to the herd scheme on an animal by animal basis at the farmerís discretion. However, the requirement that two yearsí prior notice be given to exit from the Herd Scheme will continue. Taxpayers will continue to be able to choose to use cost price, market value or replacement price to value their livestock. The high priced livestock scheme has been amended by increasing the current minimum value of a high-priced animal from $100 to $500. The entry levels have also been raised to require that the purchase price be five times the higher of this yearís or last yearís national average market values. The rates of depreciation applying to high-priced livestock can now be set by the Commissioner in accordance with the principles which apply to depreciable assets generally. Taxpayers will be able to write stock down on a straight line or diminish- ing value basis but will not be able to switch between these two options. Transitional provisions A comprehensive transitional spread of income over five years has been introduced. This will cover income arising from the movement from the trading stock scheme, the cost/market value options to another scheme and the adoption of a herd value ratio. 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Adverse event income equalisation scheme An adverse event income equalisation scheme has been introduced which restricts deposits to income arising from an adverse event but allows easier withdrawal of deposits than the present income equalisation scheme. Non-legislative changes to livestock valuation The current method of calculating national average market values will be replaced. A trial comparing the accuracy of a survey of livestock valuers and a survey covering the main livestock sales periods will be undertaken to establish which system more accurately reflects market values. Values will not be released until June in any year. The Commissioner has issued simplified self assessed cost guidelines, effective from the 1991/92 income year, Detailed information to follow We will publish a detailed discussion of the new livestock valuation regime in a future Tax Information Bulletin, together with information on the forthcoming national standard cost scheme determination. The new regime applies from the 1992/93 income year. The adverse event income equalisation scheme applies from 1 April 1993. Retiring Allowances Sections 2, 68, 336N Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction All retiring allowances paid on or after 1 January 1994 will be fully taxable as income of the recipient. This new tax treatment will apply whether the payment is made in a single lump sum or in instalments. Background Retiring allowances are currently taxed inconsistently, dependent solely on the method of payment. Those payments made in a lump sum are taxed as fringe benefits and the retiring employee pays no tax. How- ever, if the employee chooses to take the allowance in instalments as paid leave, this is taxed as income. The change brings consistency to the taxation of similar kinds of payment made by employers to employees. The same policy was applied to redundancy payments last year. During the Select Committee stages it was considered that the original period of notice to 1 April 1993 may not be sufficient. An amendment was made which put the proposed application date back to 1 January 1994 to allow people approaching retirement to make any necessary adjustment. Key issues Section 68 of the Income Tax Act will be repealed with effect from 1†January 1994. This will mean that all retirement payments paid by an employer to an em- ployee will be taxable in full to the employee. This will be the case whether the payment is made in one lump sum or in instalments. Such payments are extra emolu- ments so they will be liable for an initial PAYE deduc- tion of 28 cents in the dollar. Fringe Benefit Tax Lump sum retirement allowances have been removed from the definition of fringe benefit in the Income Tax Act. From 1 January 1994, employers will not have to pay Fringe Benefit Tax on any part of a retirement payment to an employee. Earner Premium Accident Compensation Earner and Employer Premium will not have to be deducted from retiring allowances. This will apply from 1 January 1994. Payments before 1 January 1994 The existing tax treatment will continue to apply to all retiring allowances until 1†January 1994. Note that the provisions of section 68 only apply if the retiring payment is: ï made in a single lump sum payment; and ï made in respect of the employeeís employment or service; and ï in the form of a bonus, gratuity or retiring allowance, other than a redundancy payment. If the payment falls within the definition of a redundancy payment in section 68 of the Income Tax Act (i.e. the position has become superfluous to the requirements of the em- ployer) the payment must be taxed under the provi- sions for redundancy; and ï made on the termination of the employment or service being the occasion of the employeeís retirement continued on page 38 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) being granted income support benefits. However, retiring allowances will not be taken into account for the purpose of determining the rate of payment of any benefit. Application Date The measure applies to all retiring allowances paid on or after 1 January 1994. Hire Purchase Agreements Sections 64B, 64BA, 64E, 76A, 222A, 222F and 222G, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction From 1 April 1993 the tax treatment of hire purchase agreements will be similar to that of sales of goods financed by a loan from the seller. The gross retail profit on sale will be recognised in the year of sale and interest over the period will be recognised on an accru- als basis. Transitional provisions have been made for agreements entered into before that date. The new legislation replaces the policy statement published in TIB Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992) and gives effect to the Governmentís policy on hire purchase agreements consequent upon the Valabh Committeeís report. It brings such agreements within the accrual rules in sections 64B to 64M of the Income Tax Act 1976. Accordingly, hire purchase agreements fall into two categories: ï hire purchase agreements entered into before 1 April 1993; and ï hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1†April 1993. Hire purchase agreements entered into before 1 April 1993 Background In the absence of transitional rules there would have been confusion about the appropriate treatment of pre- 1†April 1993 hire purchase agreements. Transitional provisions have been inserted into the Income Tax Act 1976 as a new section 76A. These will apply to all pre-1†April 1993 agreements which have not previously been terminated or expired. The implica- tions of the new section 76A for hire purchase agree- ments entered into before 1 April 1993 are set out below. Spreading provision Section 76 provides for tax adjustments to be made following the discovery of specified incorrect accounting practices. It also allows taxpayers to spread any conse- quent increase in assessable income that exceeds $1,000 over the year of adjustment and three other income years. The new section 76A makes similar provisions for previously unreturned retail profit on goods sold under a hire purchase agreement. This transitional rule only affects the vendorís treatment of the gross profit margin on goods sold under hire purchase agreements; it doesnít affect the purchaserís treatment of the notional interest content. A vendor may elect to spread the remaining unreturned profit reserve from goods sold under pre-1†April 1993 hire purchase agreements over the lesser of the remain- ing life of the agreement or over the year of adjustment and the three succeeding years. The unreturned profit element is returned on a due and receivable basis over that time. The section defines two terms: ïìFull retail profitî is the difference between the cash price as defined in section 2(1) of the Credit Contracts Act 1981 and cost price as defined in s222A(1); and ïìUnreturned retail profitî means any portion of full retail profit which has not been included in assessable income as at 1†April 1993. There is a notional ìyear of adjustmentî which is effectively the taxpayer's income year in which 1 April 1993 falls, and any unreturned retail profit on agree- ments entered into before 1 April 1993 shall be deemed to be income derived in that year of adjustment. Accord- ingly, for taxpayers with early or standard balance dates, the year of adjustment is their 1993/94 income year. For taxpayers with late balance dates the year of adjustment is the 1992/93 income year. (Section 76A(2)) Application of section 76A Where a taxpayerís assessable income increases in the year of adjustment by $1,000 or more from the unreturned profit amount, the taxpayer must notify the Commissioner of that increase (Section 76A(3)). from page 37 Social Security Act Amendments Amendments have also been made to the Social Security Act as a result of the change to the taxation of retiring allowances. Retiring allowances are to be included in the definition of ëaverage incomeí for the purpose of calculating the high income earner standdown. People earning above the average wage who receive a retiring allowance will be required to look to savings before 39 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Where a taxpayer has to notify the Commissioner of an increase of $1,000 or more in assessable income due to the recognition of unreturned profit, and is continuing to carry on business, that taxpayer may, by an irrevoca- ble notice in writing, advise the Commissioner of an election to allocate that increase - ï on a due and receivable basis (as at present) to the year of adjustment and two immediately subsequent income years; and ï where at the end of that period there is any remaining outstanding balance due the whole of that outstanding balance will be assessable in the third immediately subsequent income year. This will apply to pre-April 1993 hire purchase agreements with a remaining term of more than 3 years (Section 76A(4)). Amounts which have been allocated to income years in accordance with the above are deemed to be derived in those particular years, and not in the year of adjustment. However, the Commissioner may cancel any such allocation, in which case any unassessed amount will be assessable for income tax in the year in which the allocation was cancelled. A taxpayer who is required to notify the Commissioner of the increase as described above must also notify the Commissioner in writing, with the income tax return for the year of adjustment, of - ï the aggregate amount of the unreturned retail profit required to be added in that year; and ï where the taxpayer elects to spread forward the unreturned profit, the further amounts which will be returned in the three immediately succeeding income years (Section 76A(5)). If a taxpayer has adopted a non-standard accounting year, every reference to income year shall be a reference to the appropriate non-standard accounting year, with any necessary modification (Section 76A(6)). Hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1 April 1993 Background Title to goods sold under a hire purchase agreement does not legally pass until the last payment under the agreement is made. However, most of the risks and rewards associated with ownership pass from the vendor to the purchaser on the date they enter into the hire purchase agreement. The Valabh Committee recommended that a finance lease regime (which would incorporate hire purchase agreements) should replace the existing specified lease regime. It proposed a regime which recognised that the economic substance of finance leases (including hire purchase agreements) comprises both an asset sale and a money lending transaction. However, at this stage, the new regime recently enacted is limited to hire purchase agreements and does not extend to the slightly wider class of finance leases dealt with by the Valabh Committee. Treatment under the new regime is in line with the existing treatment of specified leases which by definition effectively included hire purchase agreements. However, the spreading methods in the accrual regime are superior to those outlined in the specified lease regime. The calculation of accrual income and expenditure in the accrual regime is generally on a yield to maturity basis, though under certain circumstances the straight line method may be used. The asset sale and money lending aspects of a hire purchase agreement are dealt with respectively by amending the Income Tax Act 1976 to: . exclude hire purchase agreements from the specified lease regime (by amending s222A) and insert new sections 222F and 222G that deal with the sale and purchase elements of hire purchase agreements when they are entered into and when they expire or are terminated; and . amend sections 64B, 64BA and 64E to bring hire purchase agreements within the accrual rules and to integrate hire purchase agreements with the accruals regime. These amendments are both explained below. The deemed sale and purchase of assets under hire purchase agreements Section 222F defines the various elements of a hire purchase agreement. Most of these terms have their ordinary meaning but several terms have been specifi- cally defined for the new regime. ìLesseeî, in relation to a hire purchase agreement means any person who obtains from a lessor (typically the lender who holds the hire purchase agreement) the use of or the right to use the hire purchase asset under the hire purchase agreement: ìLesseeís acquisition costî in relation to a hire pur- chase asset, means the aggregate of: . the acquisition price for the hire purchase agreement as determined under section 64BA(3), and . the amount of any expenditure or loss incurred by the lessee in preparing and installing the hire purchase asset for use (unless the lessee can deduct such expenditure or loss under any provision other than section 108). In most cases an asset's acquisition price will be its cash price plus any non-contingent fees (such as a non- refundable application fee) paid by the borrower under the agreement. ìLessorî in relation to a hire purchase agreement means any person who grants to a lessee the use of or the right to use a hire purchase asset under the hire purchase agreement. In most cases, the lessor is likely to be the lender who holds the hire purchase agreement. continued on page 40 40 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Transfer of ownership to lessee A lessee may acquire ownership of a hire purchase asset at the end of the hire purchase period. Where the lessor was deemed to have sold the asset to the lessee at the start of the agreement, the transfer of ownership to the lessee at the termination or expiry of the hire purchase agreement will not constitute either a further disposition by the lessor or further acquisition by the lessee (Section 222G(4)). Non-application: Section 107, which provides for certain expenditure to be added back on sale of a previously leased asset, does not apply to a lessee in a hire purchase agreement. (Section 222G(5)) Accrual Regime and Hire Purchase Agreements The interpretation section of the accruals regime (Section 64B(1)) is amended initially by removing hire purchase agreements from the definition of an ìEx- cepted Financial Arrangementî. This amendment brings hire purchase agreements within the ambit of the accruals regime. New definitions of ìhire purchase agreementî, ìhire purchase assetî and ìhire purchase paymentî are cross- referenced to the definitions in the new section 222F. The lessor in relation to a hire purchase agreement, (also defined in section 222F) is included in the defini- tion of ìholderî. Meaning of terms “core acquisition price” and “acquisition price” To apply the accrual rules it is important to determine the ìcore acquisition priceî and the ìacquisition priceî of a hire purchase agreement. To this end section 64BA(1) has a new paragraph (ca) which provides a method for determining ìcore acquisition priceî for a hire purchase agreement in a similar manner to other financial arrangements. This will similarly allow determination of the ìacquisition priceî. Determinations Section 64E(1) has been amended by inserting a new paragraph to permit the Commissioner to determine the method for determining the discounted value of the hire purchase payments. Assignments of hire purchase agree- ments While hire purchase agreements have been excluded from the accrual rules until now, assignments of income from hire purchase agreements are already subject to the accrual rules, through paragraph (c) of the definition of ìfinancial arrangementî in section 64B(1). An assignment gives rise to a new financial arrange- ment at the time it is entered into. This is similar to the treatment of assignments of trade credits (often referred to as factoring). Since a new financial arrangement is from page 39 ìLessorís disposition valueî in relation to a hire purchase asset, means the acquisition price for the hire purchase agreement, determined under section 64BA(2). For most assets, the acquisition price will be the cash price of the asset less any non-contingent fees paid to the lessor (such as a non-refundable application fee). ìHire purchase agreementî has the meaning in section 2 of the Hire Purchase Act 1971, including any assignment of an agreement, except to the extent that the subject of the agreement is livestock or bloodstock. Deeming provisions Section 222G deems a lessor to have sold a hire pur- chase asset at the start of a hire purchase agreement for the lessorís disposition value (as described above), and deems the lessee to have purchased the asset at the lesseeís acquisition cost (as described above). (Section 222G(1)) The lessee, not the lessor, is entitled to claim any allowable depreciation on the asset. The tax treatment that would apply at the expiry or termination of a hire purchase agreement depends on whether title transfers to the lessee at that time. The new section 222G deals with situations where ownership reverts to the lessor at the expiry or termina- tion of a hire purchase agreement (a hire purchase agreement might be terminated early because of default by the lessee or the lessee buying out of the contract). It also deals with situations where title is acquired by the lessee at the termination or expiry of a hire purchase agreement. In any case where a lessee (or associated person) does not acquire ownership of a hire purchase asset at the end of the agreement's term the lessor is deemed to have purchased the asset at the expiry of the hire purchase agreement. Amendment of lessor’s valuation Where ownership reverts to the lessor who - . disposes of the hire purchase asset or hires it to a different person under another hire purchase agree- ment; or . where the hire purchase asset is subject to another hire purchase agreement, and the lessor surrenders the hire purchase asset, - the amount of the consideration will be: . reduced by the amount of any payment by the lessee (or any associated person) to the lessor as a conse- quence of such disposal, hire purchase agreement or surrender; or . increased by the amount of any payment by the lessor (or any associated persons) to the lessee or the person associated with the lessee as a consequence of such disposal, hire purchase agreement or surrender (Section 222G(3)). 41 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) created by the assignment, there is no need to recompute the core acquisition price of the hire purchase agree- ment. Instead, the person who holds the hire purchase agree- ment and who assigns the income stream from the agreement is deemed to issue a new financial arrange- ment to the assignee of the income from the hire purchase agreement (the person receiving the assign- ment is the holder of the new financial arrangement created by the assignment). Both parties calculate a base price adjustment on the new financial arrangement to compute their accrual income when that arrangement matures or is otherwise sold. The Valabh Committee has recommended modifications to clarify the application of accrual rules to assignments of income. The amendments proposed by the Committee are aimed at ensuring rules such as the base price adjustment work smoothly in relation to assignments. The Government is currently considering those propos- als. Application dates The transitional arrangements in section 76A apply to any year of adjustment as defined and the three succeed- ing income years. For taxpayers with standard and early balance dates the year of adjustment is the 1993/94 income year. For taxpayers with late balance dates it is the 1992/93 income year. The accrual provisions in sections 64B, 64BA, and 64E, and the provisions of sections 222A, 222F and 222G apply to all hire purchase agreements entered into on or after 1†April 1993. Examples of how the accrual rules apply to hire purchase agreements Example 1 Assume the following facts for a hire purchase transaction: Vendorís balance date:31 March Maximum face value of financial arrangements held by the vendor during the year: $1,000,000 (accordingly, interest income may be accrued on a straight line basis). Date of Transaction:5 September 1993 Cash Price of the property subject to the agreement:$1,000 Deposit paid by the purchaser:$ 100 Amount loaned by way of the hire purchase agreement:$ 900 Term of the hire purchase contract:24 months Interest rate on the loan: compound rate of 20% p.a. payable monthly in arrears Hire purchase payments:$45.81 24 equal monthly payments of $45.81 representing payment of interest and principal computed on a declining balance basis. Calculation of Income under the Agreement The hire purchase contract spans three income years of the vendor. Assume that the vendor adopts a 365 day basis for allocating income from the agreement. The relevant details for each income year are: Year EndingPeriod of HP Contract Days 31/3/945/9/93-31/3/94207 31/3/951/4/94-31/3/95365 31/3/961/4/95-5/9/95158 Income from the agreement is spread on a straight line basis in accordance with accruals determina- tions G1A and G24 as follows: Initial deposit$ 100.00 24 payments of interest and principal of $45.81 per month$1,099.44 Total consideration received$1,199.44 Less acquisition price $1,000.00 Net income from contract$ 199.44 Interest to the holder under the agreement is allocated to income years as follows: Year ending 31/3/94 (207 days)$56.55 Year ending 31/3/95 (365 days)$99.72 Base Price Adjustment (year ending 31/3/96) The base price adjustment at the termination of the contract on 5/9/95 is calculated using the following formula: a - b - c where: a is the amount of consideration received by the holder in respect of the contract ($1,199.44); b is the acquisition price of the contract ($1,000); and c is the net amount on which the holder has previously been subject to tax. The amount recognised in the previous two income years is $156.27 (being the sum of $56.55 and $99.72). On this basis, a - b - c is $43.17. That amount is returned in the taxpayerís 1995/96 income year. continued on page 42 42 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Year EndingIncome in Period 31/3/94$92.01 31/3/95$99.36 As before, income allocated to the year ending 31/3/ 96 (the year in which the arrangement matures) is calculated using the base price adjustment: a - b - c a is the amount of consideration received by the holder under the contract ($1,199.44); b is the acquisition price of the contract ($1,000); and c is the net amount on which the holder has previously been subject to tax. ($191.37 being the sum of $92.01 and $99.36). On this basis, the income attributable to the 1995- 96 income year under the base price adjustment is $8.07. Dividend Definition Section 4, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Several changes have been made to the dividend definition, most of which relate to the transfer of benefits by a company to corporate associates of its shareholders. Generally, under section 4(1)(l) a distribution is a dividend if (a) it is made by a company to a person associated with a shareholder of the company; and (b) it would have been a dividend if the distribution had been to a shareholder of the company. The dividend is derived by the associate (by virtue of section 4(7)). The Bill creates a category of transactions which are excluded from the operation of section 4(1)(l). It provides that where a benefit flows from a company to downstream companies (or to certain other associated corporates) no dividend arises provided several condi- tions are satisfied. Although this is the major change to the associated person dividend rules, several other changes have been enacted and these are outlined below. All of the amend- ments take effect from 1 April 1993. Removal of proprietary company restriction The first amendment is that section 4(1)(l) is no longer restricted to proprietary companies. It applies to all companies. De Minimis rule New section 4(14) excludes the application of section 4(1)(l) where a company allows an associated company to use its property, provided that the amount of dividend that would otherwise have arisen from the use of such property does not exceed $10,000. This provision does not apply to concessional interest loans provided by a company to an associated corporate. Section 4(14) targets transactions which are not excluded by section 4(13) - which is discussed below. No double taxation of dividend income New section 4(15) prevents double taxation of dividend income except where this is expressly provided. Section 198 is one section under which double taxation may occur. Benefits passing between certain associated corporates excluded from dividend definition The most significant change is the introduction of new section 4(13). Section 4(13) excludes from the scope of section 4(1)(l) benefits passing between certain associated corporates. The three examples below explain how the provision operates. Because new section 4(13) is complex and most easily understood through the use of examples, there are further examples in subsequent pages. In these from page 41 Example 2 The facts in this example are the same as those in example 1 except that income from the hire pur- chase agreement is calculated on a yield to maturity basis. (The vendor holds financial arrangements in excess of $1 million). Cash price of the property subject to the agreement:$1,000 Amount ìloanedî by way of hire purchase agreement$ 900 Term of hire purchase agreement:24 months Interest payable on the loan: compound rate of 20% payable monthly in arrears. Based on this information, it is possible to construct a schedule spreading income to each income year calcu- lated on a yield-to-maturity basis in accordance with accruals determination G3: 43 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) examples, all companies are resident in New Zealand and have standard balance dates unless otherwise stated. Downstream Transactions The first and second examples illustrate the principle that where a benefit passes from a company to a down- stream corporate associate no dividend arises except where a shareholder of the company owns more than 10% of the associate other than through the company. In example 1, a benefit passing from Subsidiary 1 to Joint Venture Co. does not give rise to a dividend. Example 1 Subsidiary 2 is a wholly owned subsidiary of Subsidiary 1 which is in turn wholly owned by Parent. Subsidiary 1 owns 50% of Joint Venture Co. (the other 50% is owned by an unrelated person). Subsidiary 1 passes a benefit to Joint Venture Co. Section 4(1)(l) does not apply to the transaction in example 1 because the conditions in paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 4(13) are satisfied. Those conditions are discussed below, focusing on example 1. (a) The recipient of the benefit must be a company - JV Co. satisfies this requirement. (b) The provider of the benefit must either have (i) a voting interest in the recipient, or (ii) be associated with a company that has a voting interest in the recipient. These voting interests can be direct or indirect. S1 has such an interest in JV Co. (c) The recipient does not hold a voting interest in the provider of the benefit - JV Co. does not hold a voting interest in S1. (d) This applies only where the provider of the benefit has no voting interest in the recipient, and therefore does not apply in this example. For a discussion of this provision see example 3 below. (e) No person holds both an interest in the provider of the benefit and an interest of more than 10% in the recipient of the benefit. For the purposes of deter- mining whether the 10% threshold is exceeded, interests held by the provider in the recipient are not traced through to the shareholder of the provider (see the words beginning ìdetermined as if....î in (ii)(A) and (B) respectively). In the above example, therefore, interests held by S1 in JV Co. are not attributed to Parent (or shareholders of Parent) in calculating whether Parent (or its shareholders) owns more than 10% of JV Co. A dividend does arise in example 2 when a benefit is passed from S1 to JV Co. Example 2 Benefit passing from S1 to JV Co. does give rise to a dividend Parent owns 100% of S1 which owns 100% of S2. S1 and Parent have a 50% interest each in JV Co. S1 passes a benefit to JV Co. In example 2, paragraphs (a), (b)(i) and (c) are satisfied but (e) is not: Parent holds an interest in S1 and an interest of more than 10% in JV Co. (ignoring Parentís interest owned through S1.) The concluding words in paragraph (e) - ìdetermined as if sections ... related company)î are required to ensure that it is not necessary in applying (e) to trace through to the natural person shareholders of a company. The test in paragraph (e) can be applied at any level in a chain of companies - that is, in example 2, ìno personî could refer to Parent itself or the shareholders of Parent Co. The words in brackets ì(with the exception of the related company)î add a further complication and are discussed in relation to example 4a below. The transaction in example 2 therefore gives rise to a dividend derived by JV Co. (which is exempt under section 63(2K) because JV Co. and S1 are in the same commonly owned group). Although the dividend is exempt, imputation credits are required to be attached at the benchmark rate. Transactions between other associated corporates One critical amendment to section 4(13) - the insertion of paragraphs (b)(ii) and (d) - was made at Select Committee stage. Where the company providing a benefit to a corporate associate has no voting interest in the associate, but is associated with a company that has such an interest (such associated company being ìthe related partyî), no dividend arises provided that, if the benefit had passed instead to the related party, no New continued on page 44 44 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) a. S2 makes a low interest loan to JV Co. Paragraphs (a), (b)(ii), (c), (d) and (e) are satisfied. In terms of paragraph (e), S1 owns an interest in S2 and more than 10% of JV Co but if we choose S1 as ìthe related companyî S1 is excluded from the operation of (e) . If S1 is ìthe related companyî in this example, Parent (and the shareholders of Parent) do not fall foul of (e)(ii) because, under (ii)(A) and (B), interests in JV Co. are held by ìthe related companyî (S1) and are not traced through to Parent. In this example, Parent can also be ìthe related com- panyî (the legislation permits any corporate associate of the provider to be ìthe related companyî but once that company is chosen as the pivot, other contenders (such as S1) are not ìthe related companyî. (If Parent is chosen as the related company: Parent holds an interest in S2 and more than 10% of associate but is specifically excluded from the operation of (e)). If P is ìthe related companyî, S1 does not breach (e)(i) and (ii), because S1ís interests are attributed to the related company for the purposes of paragraph (e). This is achieved by the words in brackets at the end of paragraph (e). b. Parent Co passes a benefit to JV Co. Paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c) and (e) are satisfied and the transaction is therefore excluded from the dividend definition. In relation to (e), shareholders of Parent Co own an interest in Parent Co, but not in the associate JV Co (because the shareholdersí interests in the associate that are held through Parent Co. are ignored - see subparagraphs (e)(ii)(A) and (B)). Example 5 Parent Co. owns 100% of Subsidiary 1 which owns 100% of Subsidiary 2. a. Subsidiary 1 makes an interest free loan to Subsidiary 2 Paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c) and (e) are satisfied and therefore the transaction does not give rise to a divi- dend. In relation to paragraph (e), Parent and its shareholders hold an interest in S1 but no interest in S2 as interests in S2 held by S1 are ignored for the purposes of deter- mining whether Parent has a greater than 10% interest in S2 (see subparagraphs (e)(ii)(A) and (B)). from page 43 Zealand tax consequence would have arisen. This is illustrated in example 3 on the next page. Example 3 A owns Parent which owns 100% of S1 and 90% of S2. L has a 10% shareholding in S2. S1 and Parent are a wholly owned group of companies. S1 makes a low interest loan to S2. Because the loan could pass from S1 to Parent without triggering an assessable dividend or a FDWP liability (under section 63(2K), the dividend is not assessable income of Parent), no dividend arises in relation to the loan from S1 to S2. The rationale for this principle is that, if a benefit could flow from S1 to Parent without a New Zealand tax consequence (because, for example, it is an exempt dividend) and from Parent to S2 without a tax consequence (because it is not a dividend), the benefit should be permitted to pass tax free directly from S1 to S2. Associated party transactions - further examples Exclusions from dividend definition The transactions outlined in examples 4 to 6 do not give rise to a dividend. (Note, however, that in relation to examples 4 and 5, even if the transaction had given rise to a dividend, it would have been exempt under section 63(2K), but subject to the imputation benchmark dividend rules.) Example 4 Parent owns 100% of S1, which owns 100% of S2 and 50% of JV†Co. The remaining 50% of JV†Co is owned by an unrelated person. 45 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) b. Parent makes an interest free loan to Subsidiary 2 Paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c) and (e) are satisfied and therefore no dividend arises. In terms of paragraph (b), Parent has a voting interest in S2 - this provision includes indirect voting interests. As above, in relation to paragraph (e), Parent holds an interest in S1 but no interest in S2 as interests in S2 held by S1 are ignored in calculating Pís interest in S2. Cross border transactions Example 6 US Co. owns 100% of both UK Co. and NZ Co. Only NZ Co. is resident in New Zealand. a. US Co. makes an interest free loan to NZ Co. As paragraphs (a), (b)(i), (c) and (e) are satisfied, the transaction does not give rise to a dividend. In terms of paragraph (e), the shareholders of US Co. have an interest in US Co. but no interest in NZ Co. because the interests held by the provider of the benefit (US Co.) in the associate (NZ Co.) are not attributed to shareholders of US Co. b. UK Co. passes a benefit to NZ Co. Paragraphs (a), (b)(ii), (c), (d) and (e) are satisfied and therefore no dividend arises. In relation to paragraph (d), concessional interest on a loan from UK to US Co. would not be a dividend which is assessable income of US†Co. under New Zealand tax law (see section 242(c)). In relation to paragraph (e), US Co. (ìthe related companyî) holds an interest in the provider (UK Co.) and more than 10% of the associate (NZ Co.) but is excluded from the operation of (e). Shareholders of US Co. hold an interest in UK Co. but no interest in NZ Co. as, under sub-paragraphs (e)(ii)(A) and (B), shares held by US Co. in NZ Co. are not held by shareholders of US Co. Dividend provisions apply The transactions outlined in examples 7 to 11 give rise to a dividend. Example 7 Parent Co. owns 100% of Subsidiary 1, which owns 100% of Subsidiary 2, which in turn holds 100% of Subsidiary 3. Subsidiary 3 makes an interest free loan to subsidiary 1. Paragraphs (a), (b)(ii) and (d) are satisfied. However, the transaction breaches paragraph (c) - the associate (S1) holds an interest in the company provid- ing the benefit (S3). A dividend therefore arises to S1 to the extent of the interest foregone on the loan (by virtue of the combined effect of sections 4(1)(e), 4(1)(l), 4(7), 4(10) and 4(11)). The dividend is exempt to S1 under section 63(2K) but, under the general imputation provisions, credits are to be attached to the dividend at the benchmark rate. Example 8 Individual A owns 100% of Company B and Company C. Co. B disposes of property to Co. C for no considera- tion. The transaction satisfies neither paragraph (b) nor paragraph (e). A dividend arises to Co. C through the interaction of sections 4(1)(c), 4(1)(l) and 4(7)). As in example 7, the dividend is exempt under section 63(2K) but subject to the imputation benchmark rules. Example 9 A owns 100% of Company B which owns 100% of Company D and 80% of Company C. T owns 20% of Company C. continued on page 46 46 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) UK Co. makes an interest free loan to NZ2 Co. for six months (the loan is therefore not an attributed repatria- tion). NZ1 is ìthe related companyî under paragraph (b)(ii). The transaction breaches paragraph (d) - NZ1 would have a dividend withholding payment liability in relation to the interest shortfall if the loan was made by UK Co. to NZ1 Co. The transaction therefore gives rise to a dividend, in respect of which NZ2 Co has a dividend withholding payment liability. Consolidation Section 191N, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Several amendments have been made to the provisions in section 191N relating to dispositions of property within a consolidated group. They have been made because of the new depreciation regime and to correct a technical problem. Background Under the new depreciation regime, 1992-93 deprecia- tion rates are grandfathered for depreciable property acquired under a binding contract entered into before 16†December 1991. A new concept of pooled property is also introduced for depreciation. These amendments impact on the consolidation regime. Generally, a consolidated group is able to transfer depreciable property, together with other types of property, with deferred income tax consequences. A deferral is achieved through the deemed transfer price, which is generally the tax book value as opposed to market value at the time of transfer. The amendments to the consolidation provisions incorporate the grandfathering treatment of certain depreciable property and provide for a deemed transfer price of pooled property transferred intra-group. Key issues New subparagraph (ca) of section 191N(1) has been inserted to ensure that where depreciable property acquired under a binding contract entered into before 16†December 1991 is transferred intra-group, the depreciation rates prevailing for the 1992-93 income year continue to apply. The new depreciation regime permits depreciation of property on a pooled basis. Section 191N(1)(d) provides for the pool of property to be transferred at its adjusted tax value where the whole pool is transferred intra- group. Where only part of the pool of property is transferred, the lower of the market value of the part of the pool being transferred or the adjusted tax value of the whole pool is the deemed transfer price. Section 191N(2) is consequentially amended as a result of the amendments to subsection (1). from page 45 Co. C makes an interest free loan to Co. D. The transaction breaches paragraph (d). Company B is the related company. If Co. C made an interest free loan to Co. B, Co. B would receive an assessable dividend equal to the interest that would have been payable on the loan had a market rate of interest been applied to the loan (section 4(1)(e) and 4(10) and 4(11)). A dividend therefore arises to Co. D (by virtue of sections 4(1)(e), 4(1)(l), and 4(7)). Cross border transactions Example 10 NZ1 Co. owns 100% of UK Co. and NZ2 Co. Only NZ1 Co and NZ2 Co are resident in New Zealand. 47 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) The provision in section 191N(4) allows a nil base price adjustment to be made on the transfer of financial arrangement within a consolidated group. The purpose of the nil base price adjustment is to allow the transferee to step into the shoes of the transferor. This purpose is frustrated where the taxation of coupon payments made to the transferor prior to the transfer is deferred to later income years. The amendment to section 191N(4) makes the necessary technical correction to ensure this deferral of income does not result. Application dates The amendments to section 191N(1), (2) and (4) take effect with the introduction of the consolidation regime from 1 April 1993, so for standard and late balance date groups, they will apply for the 1993-94 income year. For early balance date groups, they will apply for the 1994- 95 income year. FBT and Promissory Notes Sections 336N and 336O, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction The FBT regime has been amended to widen its applica- tion to include loans made by the use of promissory notes and other similar financial arrangements. Background Some employers have been avoiding paying FBT on low interest loans by using promissory notes in lieu of such loans. Arguably, this type of financial arrangement did not fall under the old definition of loan used in the FBT provisions. Key Issues The definition of loan in section 336N(1) has been amended to include a payment given in return for a promissory note or any other capital amount advanced under a financial arrangement (not being an excepted financial arrangement). A definition of owing has been added to section 336N(1) to ensure that the amounts advanced to em- ployees by the use of promissory notes and other similar financial arrangements are deemed to be owed. A definition of prescribed interest has also been added to clarify the calculation of FBT on low interest loans. In relation to a low interest loan, prescribed interest is the amount of interest that would have accrued on that loan during the quarter or income year (which depends on the time period used by the taxpayer for the calcula- tion of FBT) had the interest been calculated on a daily basis using the relevant prescribed rate of interest (or non-concessionary rate of interest for loans made before 31 March 1985). Subsection (2) of section 336O, which deals with the calculation of FBT payable on a low interest loan, has been amended to clarify its operation and to deal with other financial arrangements, including promissory notes. FBT is normally payable on the difference between the interest actually accrued by an employee under a loan and the prescribed interest. In the case of financial arrangements with no interest payments, such as promissory notes, the interest accrued is substituted for the income, if any, that would have accrued to the employer using the yield to maturity method, as used in the accruals regime. Example An employee sells a promissory note, with a face value of $1,000 and a term of five years, to his/her employer for $800. Assume the prescribed rate of interest is 10†percent. FBT is payable on the difference between $1,000 x 10% ($100) (if calculated on a yearly basis) and the income accruing to the employer using the yield to maturity method. The figures are as follows: PrescribedYTMDifference InterestIncome Year 1$100$36.51$63.49 Year 2$100$38.18$61.82 Year 3$100$39.92$60.08 Year 4$100$41.74$58.26 Year 5$100$43.65$56.35 In many cases promissory notes are sold at face value so there is no income accruing to the employer and no yield to maturity calculation is required. FBT will be payable on the total amount of the prescribed interest in such cases. Application Date The change in the FBT regime applies from the quarter commencing 1 April 1993. 48 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) FBT and the $75 Exemption Section 336S, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Changes have been made to the $75 exemption for ìotherî fringe benefits, limiting the number of employ- ees to whom it applies and the value of the exemption. Background The FBT regime previously allowed an exemption to all employees (including shareholder-employees) of the first $75 of ìotherî benefits provided in a quarter. ìOtherî fringe benefits are those other than motor vehicles; low interest loans; subsidised transportation; retirement allowances and contributions to superannua- tion funds; sickness, accident and death benefit funds; and insurance premiums. ìOtherî fringe benefits does not include sundry benefits provided at the workplace. Key issues The $75 exemption per employee per quarter for ìotherî fringe benefits (such as subsidised or free goods and services, entertainment benefits) have been changed as follows: ï The exemption has been capped at a maximum exemption of $450 per quarter. This means that an employer may claim $75 per employee per quarter up to $450 per quarter. For employers who filed an annualised or income year FBT return, the maximum exemption is $1,800. ï If the value of the ìotherî benefits provided or granted to an employee in a quarter exceeds the $75 exemp- tion, then the exemption does not apply. For exam- ple, if the value of other benefits to an employee in a quarter is $110 then this value is subject to FBT. Previously, the value of $110 would have been reduced by the $75, its taxable value being $35. If the value of all ìotherî benefits to employees (including shareholder-employees) exceeds $450 per quarter then the full value is subject to FBT, notwith- standing that the value of ìotherî benefits to an employee may be less than $75 in the quarter. Application date These changes will apply from 1 April 1993 for those who file returns on an annual or quarterly basis. In the case of an employer who files on an income year basis this change will affect 1992-93 FBT returns in respect of benefits provided on or after 1†April 1993. Overfunded Employer Superannuation Schemes Excluded from Life Insurance Taxation Regime Sections 36 and 204Q, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Sections 36 and 204Q of the Income Tax Act and section 23 of the Superannuation Schemes Act have been amended to clarify the tax status of overfunded employer-sponsored superannuation funds. The existing subsection (4) of section 204Q excludes employer-funded superannuation schemes from the provisions of the life insurance taxation regime. Some employers have been able to suspend contributions to a scheme because the scheme has a large surplus. There has been some concern that such schemes would not be eligible for the relief provided by section 204Q. Key issues Employer-sponsored superannuation schemes will be excluded from the life insurance taxation regime even where they do not meet employer contribution require- ments by reason of being overfunded. The Government Actuary retains the discretion to determine whether a fund qualifies for exclusion. In addition, the objection procedure in situations where a superannuation fund objects to a decision by the Government Actuary as to whether or not it meets the criteria for exclusion from the life insurance regime has been clarified. Such an objection will be made under section 23 of the Superannuation Schemes Act, and not under the Income Tax Act. This provides for consist- ency of administration, as many other matters of concern to superannuation schemes are under the supervision of the Government Actuary. Application date The amendment regarding the tax status of over-funded employer-sponsored schemes will be effective from the start of the income year commencing 1†April 1991. 49 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Pre-Accrual Financial Arrangements of Superannuation Funds and Life Insurance Companies Sections 204C(1), 225A(3) and 232B, Income Tax Act 1976 These sections have been amended to clarify the treat- ment of pre-accrual financial arrangements. The amendments confirm the intent of the sections by making it explicit that the income calculations should take into account any repayments of principal. The amendments take effect from 17 December 1992 (the introduction date of the amending legislation). Family Support Tax Credits Sections 374A to 374N, Income tax Act 1976 Introduction Amendments have been made to enable Inland Revenue to take over the payment of Family Support and Guar- anteed Minimum Family Income (GMFI) for non- beneficiaries, with effect from 1†April 1993. The Department of Social Welfare (DSW) will continue to pay Family Support to beneficiaries. Previously Inland Revenue assessed Family Support and GMFI for non-beneficiaries, but DSW paid the credits to both beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries. As a result of a governmental review of the Family Support system, Inland Revenue will now pay Family Support and GMFI to non-beneficiaries. The first payment will occur on 13 April. Key issues A number of amendments have been made to the Family Support and GMFI legislation. The process whereby the Commissioner issues a certifi- cate of entitlement has been altered. Previously the Commissioner determined entitlement and issued a certificate of entitlement to the recipient and to DSW. Now the Commissioner will determine the Family Support and GMFI entitlement and issue a certificate of entitlement to the recipient. He will also retain a copy of the certificate of entitlement, in electronic form. For shared custody cases, the minimum time for which a parent must have the care of a child in order to qualify for Family Support has changed from 4 weeks out of every 12, to one third of the time throughout the income year. References in the legislation to the Social Security Commission have been replaced with references to the Director-General of Social Welfare. The provisions in the legislation which provided for the Director-General to deliver Family Support to non- beneficiaries (sections 374G(11) and 374I(1)) have been repealed. Where the Commissioner pays Family Support or Family Support and GMFI to non-beneficiaries, he will be required to issue by 20 April, following the end of the income year, a certificate stating the combined amount of Family Support and GMFI received during the previous income year. The references to pay day in the legislation have been altered to ensure that the pay day is the day fixed by the Commissioner for the payment of Family Support and GMFI. The day was previously fixed by the Social Security Act. The Commissioner will pay Family Support and GMFI on a fortnightly basis. Fortnightly payments of Family Support and GMFI will be paid directly into bank accounts. It is a requirement that applicants for Family Support and GMFI provide details of a bank account with one of the following financial institutions: ï any registered bank within the meaning of the term in section 2 of the Reserve Bank Act 1898; ï any private saving bank; ï any building society; ï Public Service Investment Society; ï any bank within the meaning of the Banking Act. Losses from a qualifying company which are attributed to a shareholder of that company cannot be offset against assessable income for Family Support and GMFI purposes. The definition of the term full time earner in section 374E(1) is amended to ensure that a person who is receiving continued compensation under section 138 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance Act 1992 will still qualify as a full time earner for GMFI purposes. References in the legislation to the Family Support declaration have been altered to refer to a Family Support statement. This change was necessary because the Family Support declaration was not a true declara- tion in terms of the Oaths and Declarations Act 1957 (a true declaration has to be witnessed). Application date These amendments apply with respect to the income year commencing on 1 April 1993 and subsequent income years. 50 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Accident Compensation Levy, Earner Premium and Employer Premium - Year when Deductible Section 140A, Income Tax Act 1976 There are two amendments to section 140A, which deals with how accident compensation levy, earner premium and employer premium should be accounted for. These amendments clarify who the section applies to and when a deduction can be claimed. First, subsection (3) has been amended to make it clear that self-employed taxpayers can claim a deduction for earner premium from income other than salary and wages and to prevent private domestic workers from claiming a deduction. This amendment applies to premiums that become due and payable in the 1992-93 income year and any subsequent year. Secondly, subsection (5) has been inserted to stop a double deduction for the payment of levies or premiums from being claimed, which can occur if they were originally accounted for on the wrong basis. The amendment is necessary because some taxpayers are still incorrectly claiming a deduction for their levies or premiums in the year before they are payable, rather than the year they are payable. The effect of adjusting such claims has, in recent cases, been able to be negated because of the 4 year reassessment time limit. Effec- tively, a double deduction is allowed for the most recent year unable to be reassessed. The amendment ensures that from 1 April 1993 a deduction for any premium or levy cannot be claimed a second time if it has already been (wrongly) claimed in a year that cannot be re-opened. Local Authority Trading Enterprise Definition Section 61(2A), Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction Airport companies, port companies and energy compa- nies are no longer excluded from the local authority trading enterprise (LATE) definition for the purposes of the local authority income tax exemption. Background Local authorities are liable for tax on all income derived from LATEs. The Income Tax Act uses the LATE definition contained in section 594B of the Local Government Act 1974. This definition, while generally including all companies under the control of a local authority, specifically excludes airport companies, port companies and energy companies. Key issues A new section 61(2A), relating to the local authority income tax exemption, has been enacted in the Income Tax Act. Several provisions in the former section 61(2A) have been omitted from the new provision as they are no longer necessary in light of the new local authority definition in section 2 of the Income Tax Act which was enacted in April 1992. Local authorities are now liable for tax on any income they derive from airport companies, port companies or energy companies which are under their control. The reason these companies are excluded from the LATE definition in the Local Government Act is to prevent them being subject to the LATE regulatory regime in addition to their own sector-specific regulatory regimes. The exclusions were not designed for Income Tax Act purposes. As long as any airport company, port company or energy company remains under the control of a local authority, it would be anomalous (in comparison to the tax treatment of income derived by local authorities from other companies under their control) to exempt local authorities from tax on income derived from these specific types of companies. Accordingly, the current exclusion of these types of companies from the LATE definition in the Local Government Act will not apply for the purposes of the income tax exemption for local authorities. Application date For income derived by local authorities from port companies or airport companies, the amendment applies from 1†April 1993. For income derived from an energy company, the amendment applies from 1 July 1992. A number of former MEDs which were corporatised before the Energy Companies Act came into force on 1 July 1992 have been deemed by that Act to be energy companies since that date. These companies also used to come within the LATE definition until an amendment (enacted on 17†December 1992) retrospectively removed them from the LATE definition with effect from 1 July 1992. The reason for this amendment was that the relevant companies would otherwise have been subject to both the LATE regulatory regime and the Energy Companies Act regulatory regime. The application date for this Income Tax Act amendment brings former MEDs which were corporatised ahead of the Energy Companies Act back into the LATE definition for Income Tax Act purposes only, with effect from 1 July 1992. These companies will therefore always have remained in the LATE definition for income tax purposes. 51 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Southland Electric Power Supply Section 197C, Income Tax Act 1976 Introduction An amendment restores the income tax liability of the Southland Electric Power Supply (SEPS) with effect from 1 November 1989. SEPS inadvertently fell out of the income tax net from 1 November 1989 as a result of amendments to non-tax legislation. Background SEPS comprises the undertaking of the former Southland Electric Power Board. Under the Southland Electric Power Supply Act 1936 the boardís assets and liabilities were transferred to the Crown, which has up to the present time conducted the undertaking of the former board. SEPS became liable to income tax from the 1987-88 income year along with Electric Power Boards and MEDs. In 1989 the local authority definition in the Local Government Act was amended as part of the then major reorganisation of local government. This affected the Income Tax Act because of the reference in that Actís local authority definition to the local authority definition in the Local Government Act. The amend- ment had the inadvertent effect of removing the liability of SEPS for income tax from 1 November 1989. Key issues Section 197C of the Income Tax Act, which relates to the taxation of energy trading operators (i.e., Electric Power Boards and MEDs), is amended so that it applies to the Crown acting in its capacity of carrying on the undertaking of the former Southland Electric Power Board. It is also expressly provided that the public authority income tax exemption will not apply to the Crown acting in its SEPS capacity. There is also a minor amendment providing that one of the deeming provisions applying to energy trading operators shall not apply to the Crown acting in its SEPS capacity. No person other than the Crown will be affected by these amendments. Application Date The amendment restoring the income tax liability of SEPS applies from 1 November 1989 (being the date when SEPS inadvertently fell out of the income tax net). The other amendments apply from the 1987-88 income year, being the year when SEPS and other electrical supply authorities became liable for income tax. FBT Anti-Avoidance Provision Section 336X, Income Tax Act 1976 The FBT anti-avoidance provision has been strength- ened from 1 April 1993. When taxpayers are involved in an FBT avoidance arrangement, the Commissioner can now deem: .one person involved in the arrangement to be the employer; and .any other person involved to be the employee; and .the benefit being passed from the deemed employer to the deemed employee (or what would have been the benefit had the arrangement not been entered into) to be provided by virtue of the employment of the deemed employee. Section 336X has also been amended so that it is clear that it will apply when avoidance is only one of the purposes of an arrangement, so long as avoidance is not merely an incidental purpose. Unit Trust and Group Investment Fund Redemptions Section 63(2H), Income Tax Act 1976 The exemption for dividends paid on redemptions of units in a unit trust from the trust's fund manager and redemptions of interests in a Group Investment Fund (GIF) from the GIF's trustee or manager has been extended for one year. Dividends will now be exempt if they are paid before 1†April 1994. The exemption applies to widely-held investment funds and will also apply to ìsecond-tierî unit trusts and group investment funds that are vehicles for investment primarily by unit trusts, group investment funds or superannuation funds that are widely-held investment vehicles. 52 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Imputation Credits Attached to Notional Dividends Sections 394U, 394ZA, 394ZC, 394ZE and 394ZP, Income Tax Act 1976 The legislation governing the imputation regime has been amended to ensure that the imputation credits attached to notional distributions made by statutory producer boards and co-operative companies can be used by the recipients of the distributions. A drafting error had created some uncertainty. Sections 394U, 394ZA, 394ZC, 394ZE and 394ZP have been amended with effect from 1 April 1993. The formula for calculating a notional dividend used in sections 394U and 394ZA has been altered so that it does not include the amount of the credit attached to the dividend. Section 394ZC has been amended to make the imputation credits attached to notional dividends assessable. Sections 394ZE and 394ZP have been amended to make it clear that taxpayers receiving notional dividends are entitled to a tax credit when the credit attached to the dividend is not assessable because it was derived before 1 April 1993. Annual Confirmation of Rates The rates of income tax for the 1992-93 income year have been confirmed. The rates are the same as those applying for the 1991-92 income year. Tax Status of New Zealand Conservation Corps and Access Training Allowances Section 61(57), Income Tax Act 1976 Section 61(57) has been amended to provide a tax exemption for the training allowances paid to New Zealand Conservation Corps workers. The exemption takes effect from the inception of the Conservation Corps programme and is removed for training allow- ances derived after 30 June 1993. The tax exemption for Access training allowances is also removed for allow- ances derived after this date. The removal of the tax exemption for the training allowances means that PAYE will have to be deducted from those payable after 30 June 1993. Rebate for Gifts of Money - Charitable Donee Status for five Organisations Sections 56A and 147(2), Income Tax Act 1976 Five new organisations have been granted charitable donee status. The organisations are: ï Community Action Overseas (Oxfam NZ) ï The Winston Churchill Memorial Trust ï The Fred Hollows Foundation (NZ) ï Christian Blind Mission International (NZ) ï Four Sherpa Trust Donations to these organisations will now be allowed as a rebate for individual taxpayers under section 56A, or as a deduction for public companies under sec- tion†147(2). Donations to the first three organisations will qualify for the 1992-93 income year. Donations to the Christian Blind Mission International and the Four Sherpa trust will qualify for the 1993-94 income year. 53 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Minor Amendments Definition of salary and wages - Section 2, Income Tax Act 1976 The definition of salary and wages is amended to include continued compensation provided under section 138 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. This amendment applies to income derived in the 1992/ 93 income year. Private Domestic Worker - Section 17, Income Tax Act 1976 Section 17 of the Act is amended to require private domestic workers who account for their own tax deduc- tions to file an IR 3 return, which has provision for the calculation of ACC earner and employer premiums. The amendment applies to 1992/93 returns. Transitional Tax Allowance - Section 50C, Income Tax Act 1976 The definition of full time earner in the transitional tax allowance has been amended to ensure that recipients of continued compensation under section 138 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 can still qualify for the Transitional Tax Allowance. The amendment applies to tax on income derived in the 1992/93 income year. Assessable income - Section 65(2)(ca), Income Tax Act 1976 Compensation payments which were payable under the Accident Compensation Act 1982 and which are continued under section 138 of the Accident Rehabilita- tion and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 are included in assessable income for income tax purposes. The amendment applies to income derived in the 1992- 93 income year. Introduction An amendment provides that where goods are exported by a person who purchased them from an associated person, the consideration for the export sale will be deemed to be the purchase price of the goods to the associated person. Background The GST Act provides that in general exported goods are zero-rated. However, zero-rating does not apply where a secondhand goods input tax credit has been claimed by the person exporting those goods or by a person associated with the exporter. Where goods are exported and the exporter has claimed a secondhand goods input tax credit, GST is payable on the supply by the exporter. The consideration for the supply is generally deemed to be the amount of the purchase price to the supplier. This effectively means that the secondhand goods input tax credit is clawed back. GST on the Export of Secondhand Goods Section 10(4) of the GST Act 1985 Where the exporter has purchased the goods from an associated person, however, the consideration was previously deemed to be the greater of the purchase price to the exporter or the purchase price to the associ- ated person. Key issues The provision has been amended so that the considera- tion is now deemed to be the purchase price to the associated person. The provision is still an anti-avoidance mechanism but is now fairer, in that only the secondhand goods input tax credit is clawed back, and not any value added by the associated person. Application date The amendment applies from 1 April 1993. 54 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Recovery of GST Sections 1(3) and 42 of the GST Act 1985 The amendment ranks GST which is unpaid at the time of a bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership and due to the Comptroller of Customs with unpaid GST due to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in such situations. Section 42 of the GST Act provides for the ranking of GST due to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue in cases of bankruptcy, liquidation or receivership. GST ranks with unpaid PAYE. The amendment provides that GST which is levied under sections 12 and 13 of the GST Act and due to the Comptroller of Customs ranks equally with that due to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue at the time of bankruptcy, receivership or liquidation. An amendment to section 1(3) of the GST Act also provides that section 42 shall be deemed to be one of the Customs Acts in so far as it applies to the Comptroller of Customs. The amendment applies to GST due and payable by persons who go into bankruptcy, receivership or liquida- tion on or after 1 April 1993. GST-Zero-Rated Goods Section 11, Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Section 11 of the GST Act is amended to correct certain references. When paragraphs (aa)-(af) were added to section 11(1), the proviso to section 11(1) was not amended accordingly. This amendment rectifies this by including a reference to paragraphs (aa)-(af) in the proviso. The amendment applies from 1 April 1993. Road User Charges and GST Section 5(6B) of the GST Act 1985 An amendment provides that the Ministry of Transport (MOT) will return the GST on road user charges. GST on road user charges was returned to the Inland Revenue by New Zealand Post. As a result of the deregulation of the road user charges collection process, it is more administratively convenient for the MOT to return the GST on road user charges. From 26 April 1993, New Zealand Post will no longer be the sole collection agency for road user charges. As a result of the change in collection mechanism, the MOT will be returning the GST on road user charges to Inland Revenue. The amendment will apply from 26 April 1993. Disclosure of Information to Social Welfare for Determining Entitlement to the Community Services Card Section 13B, Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 The information disclosure provision has been extended to allow Inland Revenue to disclose additional informa- tion on Family Support recipients to the Department of Social Welfare (DSW). The current disclosure provision allows information held by Inland Revenue on Family Support recipients to be disclosed to DSW to determine eligibility for the Community Services Card. The supply of information enables the Community Services Card to be issued promptly to families who qualify. It also reduces the compliance costs associated with the card; information provided to Inland Revenue for Family Support purposes does not have to be sup- plied again to DSW. The additional particulars to be transferred to DSW are: ï the familyís estimated income at the beginning of an income year and its actual assessable income at the end of an income year; ï the familyís estimated entitlement to Family Support and GMFI during the year and the actual entitlement at the end of the year; ï the birth dates of the children. This information transfer conforms with the require- ments of the Privacy Commissioner Act 1991. The amendment applies from 1 April 1993, which is the date of assent of the Act. 55 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Computer-Generated Assessments Section 21D, Inland Revenue Department Act 1974 Section 21D has been added to the Inland Revenue Department Act. This section provides that, for the purposes of the Inland Revenue Acts, assessments and determinations made by a computer or other electronic means are to be treated as made by or under the properly delegated authority of the Commissioner. This amendment clarifies the validity of assessments and determinations made under FIRST, IRDís computer system. An amendment has also been made to section 21 of the Income Tax Act to clarify that default assessments made by FIRST are valid. These amendments apply from 17 December 1992. Student Loan Scheme Amendments Sections 2,32,35,41,90 and 98, Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 The Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 1993 made the following changes to the Student Loan Scheme Act: Interest write-off The interest write-off provisions have been changed to deny a write-off in any income year in which a loan is transferred to Inland Revenue for collection. This change was necessary because some loans will continue after 31†December, and thus fall into two ìloan yearsî. Repayment deductions The pay period from which employers must make repayment deductions has been changed from the first full pay period ending on or after 1†April 1993 to the pay period pay period ending on or after 1†April 1993. This change has been made to reduce compliance costs for employers by ensuring that the increased earner premium and any required repayment deductions both start in the same pay period. Non-residents The first year in which a borrower has to pay a non- resident repayment obligation has been changed from the year of departure to the income year following departure. A non-resident who returns to New Zealand (and regains residency status) will continue to pay a part-year non-resident repayment obligation, pro-rated to the number of days s/he was a non-resident. A change has also been made to ensure that loans taken out by persons who are non-resident at the time of borrowing come within the non-resident regime. Penal charge A minor drafting error in the definition of ìpenal chargeî has been corrected. Insolvency Act 1967 Section 90 of the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 inadvertently overrode a change made by the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. This has been corrected. Child Support: Transfer of Cases from Liable Parent Contribution Scheme Sections 9 and 261, Child Support Act 1991 Introduction An amendment corrects a drafting error in the Child Support Act 1991. Liable parents under the previous liable parent contribution scheme are required to pay child support, regardless of any remission allowed under the earlier scheme. Background The Child Support Act provides for the transfer of records from the previous liable parent contribution scheme. Where records were transferred in this way, custodians were deemed to have applied for child support. continued on page 56 56 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Owing to a drafting error, the relevant provision allowed records to be transferred only if the liable parent had been required to pay liable parent contribu- tions. Where the liable parent contribution had been reduced to zero, under the legislation as drafted the liable parent was not required to pay child support. The child support scheme is a totally new scheme, and it was never intended that decisions under the previous scheme should apply to it. The amendment, therefore, reflects the Governmentís original intention. Key issues Section 261 Transfer of cases from the previous scheme, where liable parent contributions had been reduced to zero, is ratified. Liable parents who had claimed exemption under the previous provision are required to pay child support. Section 9 Custodians who are social welfare beneficiaries are required to apply for child support. This ensures that the liable parent contributes to the cost of the benefit paid to support the family. Child support payments, up to the level of the benefit paid, are retained by the state, so that at least part of the costs of the benefit are recovered. Where a child support application is required from a beneficiary custodian, this could be requested only at the time the benefit application was made. A further amendment allows a child support application to be requested at any time. Appeals against child support liabilities Liable parents who are required to pay child support under the new provisions may consider the child support assessment is not appropriate in their particular circumstances. They can apply to the Family Court for a review. Application date These amendments apply from 18 December 1991, the date the Child Support Act was enacted. However, the amendments do not apply to any judgement given before the amendment was enacted, on 1 April 1993. from page 55 57 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 (May 1993) Due Dates Reminder May 5 PAYE deductions and IR 66ES for last 15 days of April 1993 due - ìlargeî employers only. 7 First instalment of 1994 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with January balance dates. 7 Second instalment of 1993 Provisional Tax due for taxpayers with September balance dates.

Volume Four, No.9May 1993 This Tax Information Bulletin deals with recent tax legislation. It covers these Acts: • Income Tax Amendment Act 1993 • Income Tax Amendment Act (No.2) 1993 • Estate Duty Abolition Act 1993 • Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1993 • Inland Revenue Department Amendment Act 1993 • Student Loan Scheme Amendment Act 1993 • Child Support Amendment Act 1993 There is a full list on page 1 of the changes resulting from these Acts. We haven't included “Questions we've been asked” or Legal case notes in this TIB because of time and space restrictions. These will return in future issues as usual. Finally, there is an appendix to this TIB which deals with the practical application of the new depreciation regime. This was mailed out sepa- rately before this TIB, so you should have already received it. Extra copies are available from your local Inland Revenue office.
ISSN 0114-7161 IRD Tax Information Bulletin - Appendix to Volume Four, No. 9 - April 1993 We've mailed this appendix separately in advance of the main Tax Information Bulletin, to get the depreciation information to you as soon as possible. We will post the main TIB to you shortly. Depreciation Introduction - why the Government introduced the new provisions A new depreciation regime was introduced on the recommendation of the Valabh Committee (a private sector Consultative Committee). There are now new economic depreciation rates, which result from a comprehensive review which Inland Revenue carried out. This review included an extensive mail survey, interviews with businesses and reports from registered valuers. The new rates are intended to: • Achieve fairness between different industries • Provide descriptions of asset classes which are sufficiently detailed to be relevant to each particular industry Application dates The new rates can be used for assets acquired on or after 1 April 1993. However you can choose the new rates or the existing depreciation rates for assets you acquire in the next two years. Depreciation on new assets acquired in the 1995-96 income year, and future income years, will generally be calculated using the new rates plus a 20% loading. Depreciation on used assets acquired from the 1995-96 income year onwards will be calculated using the new rates with no loading. Summary of contents Part One of this TIB appendix explains how depreciation works and the methods available. It also gives details about specific property and circumstances. Part Two sets out the rates to be used for assets you acquired before 1 April 1993. Part Three explains the rules relating to assets acquired during the two year transitional period. Part Four lists the rates to be used for calculating depreciation in the 1995-96 and future income years. When you calculate your depreciation deduction it is important to remember that the date you acquired an asset determines which rates are available to you. This appendix provides a general guide to depreciation. For a comprehensive guide to the legislation of the new depreciation regime as enacted by the Income Tax Amendment Act 1993, see the main part of TIB Volume Four, No.9. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 -

Appendix - April 1993 Part One - How depreciation works Chapter One - General 1.1 What depreciation is Depreciation is an allowance for tax purposes, to take account of the fact that assets used in a business eventually wear out or become out of date, even though they are maintained and repaired. This reducing value of assets is recognised for tax purposes by allowing a deduction against income for depreciation for the time the assets are used in a business. From the 1993-94 income year how much depreciation can be claimed, and which assets qualify, is determined by law. When the property is sold or disposed of, generally the difference (if any), between the sale price and the adjusted tax value is either a gain or a loss. This difference has to be accounted for in the year of disposal. 1.2 Assets that cannot be depreciated To claim a depreciation deduction on an asset, you must own it (or lease it under a specified lease - see section 5.2), and it must decline in value while you use it or have it available for use in your business. Some assets cannot be depreciated for tax purposes, and the reducing value of some other assets is calcu- lated in a special way. These assets include: ïtrading stock ïland ïfinancial arrangements under the accrual rules ïgoodwill. Until now intangible assets such as the right to use a trademark could not be depreciated. The rules for these types of assets have changed, as section 5.3 explains. 1.3 Records that you need to keep As with all tax matters you must keep good records of the purchase and sale of your business assets so that Inland Revenue can check that your deductions. You must keep your records for at least seven years unless you have approval from Inland Revenue to keep them for a shorter time. 1.4 GST implications If you are not registered for GST, you base your depreciation on the actual price you pay for an asset, including the GST component. If you are registered for GST, you can claim the GST component of an asset's cost price as an input tax deduction. In this case you claim depreciation on the GST-exclusive price that you actually paid for the asset. Chapter Two - Depreciation methods 2.1 Available methods There are three ways you can depreciate property; diminishing value, straight line and the pool method. From the 1993-94 income year onwards, depending on the type of property and its value, you may choose the method which best suits your circumstances and property. Before the 1993-94 income year, the method and rate you must use for a particular asset are shown in section 7.2 by the rate highlighted in the appropriate column. 2.2 Diminishing value method Using this method means that depreciation is calcu- lated each year by using a constant percentage of the propertyís adjusted tax value. This way your deprecia- tion deduction progressively reduces each year . Example Your office equipment cost $10,000 and the diminishing value depreciation rate is 33%. adjusted tax value at beginning of yeardepreciation Year 1$10,000$3,300 Year 2$ 6,700$2,211 Year 3$ 4,489$1,481 2.3 Straight line method This is when a constant percentage of the cost of the asset is deducted each year from its adjusted tax value. This method is sometimes referred to as the cost price basis. The amount of depreciation claimed is the same each year. Example For the same asset as in the above example, using the equivalent straight line depreciation rate of 24%, the depreciation is calculated as follows: adjusted tax value at beginning of yeardepreciation Year 1$10,000$2,400 Year 2$ 7,600$2,400 Year 3$ 5,200$2,400 2.4 Pool method The pool method allows a number of low-value assets to be grouped together (or pooled) and depreciated. Pooling is available for the 1993-94 income year onwards. Buildings cannot be pooled. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 To pool property the following criteria must be satisfied: (i) Value - the pooled asset must have a value equal to or less than the ìmaximum pooling valueî. This is currently set at $2,000. Assets which meet this criteria are: ï those which individually cost you $2,000 or less, or ï those which have been depreciated and their adjusted tax value has been reduced to $2,000 or less. You can apply to Inland Revenue for a greater maximum to be set. When deciding whether to allow a greater maximum, we will consider these things: ï whether the particular asset is similar to the other assets it would be pooled with ï whether your compliance costs would be reduced by allowing this asset to be pooled ï how often you buy and sell those assets. (ii) Assets in globo account - you may also pool assets which you depreciated in the 1992-93 income year using the ìglobo accounting methodî (a similar method to the new pool method). This is regard- less of whether their adjusted tax value exceeds $2,000. However if you decide to pool these assets, they must all be brought into the same pool. You will not be able to use the globo accounting method to depreciate assets from the 1993-94 income year onwards. (iii) Business use - all assets in the pool must: ï be used 100% for business, or ï be subject to FBT if their business use is less than 100%. If your assets (excluding buildings) meet these require- ments, you may pool any number of them and you may have as many pools as suit your circumstances and assets. Each pool is depreciated at a single rate using the diminishing value method. Because you must use the lowest single rate applying to any asset in the pool, you may decide itís best to only group assets with the same or similar depreciation rates. You can combine several pools at any time. However once you include an asset in a pool you can't generally isolate it from that pool at a later stage (An exception to this is where an asset must be isolated from a pool because it is used privately - see section 4.12 for more information). 2.5 Changing methods From the 1993-94 income year you can change the method you use to calculate depreciation of your assets from year to year, except when the asset is included in a pool. You may group any assets which have been depreciated using the straight line or diminishing value method to form a pool, or add them to an existing pool in any year, provided they meet the pool criteria. From the 1993-94 income year onwards you have the choice each year between using the straight line or diminishing value methods for non-pooled assets, regardless of when you bought them. However, once you've filed your tax return you can't change methods for that income year. When you change calculation methods, the value that you calculate depreciation on is the current adjusted tax value, not the original cost price of the asset. 2.6 Converting rates for assets owned before 1 April 1993 If you decide to switch from the diminishing value method to the straight line method (or vice versa) for assets owned before 1 April 1993, use the chart below. You can also use this chart to convert a special rate from diminishing value to straight line (or vice versa). Select the nearest rate in the column for the method used previously. The other column gives the rate for the alternative method.

There are fewer rates because the general rates are grouped into bands. You cannot use this chart for converting special rates; use the chart in section 2.6 for this. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Conversions for diminishing value and straight line rates - assets acquired after 1 April 1993 Banded DV Banded SLBanded DV Banded SL dep'n rate % dep'n rate %dep'n rate % dep'n rate % 21.52215.5 432618 643324 7.55.54030 9.56.55040 12863.563.5 1510100100 1812.5 2.8 Calculating depreciation under the pool method Depreciation is calculated on the average of the value of the pool for the income year, using the diminishing value rate. To average the value of the pool, add together the values at the beginning and at the end of the income year (before deducting depreciation) and divide by two. Example You have a pool of assets with an adjusted tax value at the beginning of the year of $18,000. During the year you purchase 3 assets for $2,000 each and include these in the pool. The value of the pool at the end of the income year (before deduct- ing depreciation) is $24,000. The pool value is: $18,000 + $24,000 = 21,000 2 The depreciation deduction is calculated as follows, assuming a diminishing value rate of 22%: average pool value$21,000 @ 22% DV= $ 4,620 adjusted tax value of pool$16,380 Where you create a pool during an income year (for example when you start business) the annual deprecia- tion is reduced to the number of whole or part calendar months the pool existed. Example Using the example above, if you started business on 15†May 1995 and assuming a 31 March balance date, the depreciation deduction would be calcu- lated as follows: $4,620 x 11 = $4,235 12 When the assets in the pool have different depreciation rates the lowest rate is to be used. This situation could occur when a variety of assets are included in a pool, for example the assets of a shop. Cash register 33% Electric sign 18% Fittings18% Furniture18% The rate for this pool is 18%. In a case such as this, you may decide to pool only those assets with the 18% depreciation rate and depre- ciate the cash register separately or as an asset in another pool. Another situation when this could happen is when the depreciation rate changes, for example, selected assets at an amusement arcade. Billiard tables purchased 30 June 199010% Billiard tables purchased 31 December 1993 15% The rate for this pool is 10%. Because of the different rates, you may decide not to group the new tables into the existing pool, but to create a new pool for them. Chapter Three - Depreciation rates 3.1 How rates are calculated Depreciation rates for assets are set by Inland Revenue. From 1 April 1993, the basis for calculating the diminishing value depreciation rate is set out in the formula below. Where it is appropriate, a single depreciation rate has been set for similar types of assets to simplify the calculation of depreciation. Once the rates are calcu- lated they are rounded up or down to the nearest band. The bands are shown in the chart in section 2.7 in the previous column. The depreciation formula is: †1† 1 -residual value n cost where ìnî in the exponent is the estimated useful life in years. The estimated useful life of an asset is the time over which the asset might be expected to be useful in earning income. This time is calculated taking into account wear and tear, exhaustion and technological, market and legal obsolescence. The estimate takes into account the period the asset is used by all its New Zealand business owners. Example You buy a brand new piece of equipment but itís your usual practice to sell that type of equipment after youíve used it for three years. However the business that buys it from you second-hand might use it for a further five years after which time it is scrapped. If this is typical of that type of equipment then the estimated useful life of this asset is eight years. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 The useful life for each asset-type has been determined after studying and averaging various asset profiles of all business users. It is listed with the economic rates in section†10.5 3.2 Residual value The residual value is the greater of an estimate of an assetís market value at the end of its estimated useful life or 13.5% of the cost. To estimate this value we assume that normal and reasonable maintenance is carried out on the asset during its use. 3.3 What rate to use The correct depreciation rate to use is largely depend- ent on when you acquired the asset. ï assets acquired before 1 April 1993 - Part Two of this appendix gives the rates for these assets ï assets acquired after 31 March 1993 and before the end of your 1994-95 income year - Part Three explains your options in choosing a rate ï assets acquired during your 1995-96 and future income years - Part Four explains the rules and lists the rates for these assets. 3.4 Special rates General depreciation rates have been calculated by taking into account the way assets are normally used. For example, the general rate for certain manufacturing machinery, which is normally used in two or three shifts a day, has been set to reflect this heavier usage. If you believe that something you own is used more heavily than is usual, you may apply in writing to Inland Revenue for a special rate. When calculating a special rate, Inland Revenue will use the formula in section 3.1 and take into considera- tion the depreciation rate used for that asset in your own financial reporting. We will only set a special rate when the special rate calculated comes at least half way between the banded rates set out in the chart in section 2.7. Example A taxpayer applies for a special rate for an asset which ordinarily has a diminishing value deprecia- tion rate of 18%. As the next banded rate is 22% (i.e., 4 points difference), to have a special rate set, the calculation must result in a rate of 20% or more (i.e. 2 points or more). Where you've had a diminishing rate special rate set and you choose to convert it to the straight line method (or vice versa), use the chart in section 2.6 to convert the rate. If you wish to apply for a special rate we will need this information in order to consider and calculate a special rate: ï reason(s) for the request for a special rate ï a description of the asset, including literature, pamphlets etc ï the cost of asset ï in what industry the asset is used, how it is to be used and the amount of use it will have ï the estimated useful life of the asset (see section 3.1 for more information about this.) ï the estimated residual value (see section 3.2 for more information about this.) ï the assetís depreciation rate used for your own financial reporting An application form will be available from Inland Revenue towards the end of May 1993. Inland Revenue will review the application and advise you within six months: ï whether the special rate you have applied for has been accepted ï whether a different rate has been determined ï whether your application for a special rate has been declined. If we decline an application you have objection rights. See section 3.6 for more information. When a special rate has been set because of particular circumstances and those circumstances change or cease to exist, Inland Revenue may withdraw the special rate. 3.5 Provisional rates Where an economic depreciation rate is not set for an asset you may apply for a provisional rate to be set. This could be necessary when an asset has been newly invented, or it has not been used in New Zealand before and it does not fit well with an existing asset descrip- tion. In these cases, you may apply for a provisional rate to be set. Provisional rates are applied for and calculated in the same way as special rates. See the previous section for details. The provisional rate will lapse once a general rate is set for a particular asset. 3.6 If we decline your application for a special or provisional rate Inland Revenue will decline an application for a special rate when ï the rate calculated is too close to the general rate (as explained in section†3.4) ï The general rate is under review ï You have not supplied enough information. We will decline an application for a provisional rate when: 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 ï a general rate applying to the asset already exists ï a general rate is in the process of being set ï you have not supplied enough information. You may object when Inland Revenue: ï declines to set a special or provisional rate ï revokes a special or provisional rate ï sets a special or provisional rate you donít agree with. If you want to object you may find the booklet ìObjec- tion Proceduresî (IR 266) useful since the objection procedures for income tax assessments are much the same as objecting to special or provisional rate deci- sions. Chapter Four - Adjustments 4.1 How to calculate depreciation when you first acquire an asset When either the straight line or diminishing value methods are used, depreciation can be claimed for each calendar month or part month the property is owned. Example You buy an asset on 27†January 1994 for $7,000. Assuming a 31†March balance date, the 1993-94 depreciation deduction, using diminishing value rate of 22% is calculated: 22% x $7,000 x †3 months† = $385 12 months Even though the asset was owned for only a few days in January depreciation for the entire month can be claimed. 4.2 When private assets become business assets Where a private asset becomes a business asset after the beginning of the 1993-94 income year, the value on which depreciation is first calculated is the market value of that asset at the time it is introduced into the business. Example You purchased a personal computer for $5,000 in 1993. In October 1995 you begin to use this full time in your business. The market value of the computer in October 1995 is $3,200. This is the value on which depreciation will be calculated in your 1995-96 income tax return. This rule does not apply to buildings. Sections 4.10 and 4.11 covers the situation where assets are used privately and in business. 4.3 When assets are added to a pool When an asset is added to an existing pool, the ad- justed tax value of the pool is increased by ï the cost price of the asset (if it's newly acquired), or ï the adjusted tax value of the asset (if it was previ- ously accounted for separately). The value of the additions is therefore taken into the calculations of the average pool value for the year. 4.4 When you dispose of assets When you sell or dispose of an asset (other than a pooled asset) for an amount different from its adjusted tax value, you must make an adjustment to account for the loss or gain. You cannot claim a deduction for depreciation in the year you dispose of an asset, except for buildings. Costs incurred in selling an asset, such as commission and advertising, can be deducted from the sale price before you work out the loss or gain on sale. The adjustment is generally made in the year of sale or disposal, except when the disposal is because business has ceased. Section 4.8 deals with depreciation when a business ceases. When a group of business assets is sold for a lump sum, Inland Revenue may determine the sale price for an individual asset included in the group. This determina- tion will usually be based on an apportionment of the sale price between the assets as agreed upon by the seller and buyer, or it may be based on an independent valuation. 4.5 When you make a loss on disposal When an asset is sold or disposed of (e.g. discarded through obsolescence) for an amount less than its adjusted tax value, the difference is allowed as a deduction in the income year of sale or disposal. This does not apply to buildings. If an asset is sold for less than its market value Inland Revenue can fix the sale price as the market value of the asset. Situations when this may occur is when you sell an asset to someone close to you or your business (for example, to a relative of a shareholder of the company). In this situation, the actual sale price may be ignored and the calculations made as if the property was sold for its market value. 4.6 When you make a gain on a sale If you sell an asset for an amount greater than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered on sale is assessable income in the year of sale. If the sale price is greater than the original cost price, the excess is a capital gain and is not taxable. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 Example Purchase price$15,000 Depreciation allowed as a deduction$ 3,000 Adjusted tax value$12,000 Asset sold for$16,000 Total gain on sale$ 4,000 Dep'n recovered - assessable income$ 3,000 Capital gain - exempt$ 1,000 There is an exception to this in relation to pool prop- erty, see section 4.7. 4.7 When you dispose of pooled assets When you dispose of pooled assets, the sale price must be deducted from the adjusted tax value of the pool before calculating depreciation for the next pool period. If the asset is dumped or lost the adjusted tax value of the pool is not reduced. Where deducting the sale price from the adjusted tax value of the pool makes the adjusted tax value negative, the balance will be treated as depreciation recovered and assessable income. The adjusted tax value of the pool will then be nil, and no further depreciation deductions will be allowed until new assets are added to the pool. Example 20 assets in the pool, adjusted tax value of pool on 30/9/94 =$34,000 15 assets sold on 30/10/94 for total of$36,000 Depreciation recovered$ 2,000 (This will be assessable income in 1994-95 income year) Adjusted tax value of pool on 31/3/95 (although 5 assets still remain in the pool)nil Once they are pooled, assets lose their individual identity, so any capital gain made on the sale of pool property cannot be separated from depreciation recov- ered. The entire proceeds of any sale of pool assets must be accounted for, and any gains are assessable income. Therefore, it may be a disadvantage to pool any asset which may subsequently be sold for more than its original purchase price. When all the assets in a pool are sold and the sale proceeds are less than the poolís adjusted tax value, the balance is deductible. Example Adjusted tax value$34,000 All assets sold for$26,000 Additional tax deduction$ 8,000 4.8 When you cease business When you cease business and the business property is not sold immediately or is kept for private use, the loss or gain must be accounted for using the market value of the asset as at the beginning of the next income year. The adjustment is made to the income tax return for the year after the business ceased, even where the loss or gain is not realised until a later income year. 4.9 If assets are lost or damaged You must take into account any insurance proceeds, indemnity damages or compensation payments you receive when assets are lost, destroyed or damaged. When an asset is damaged, and the insurance or other payments exceed the cost of repair, the excess must be deducted from the asset's adjusted tax value. An asset which is irreparably damaged is treated for depreciation purposes as though it were sold. The loss or gain on disposal is calculated by taking into account the adjusted tax value of the asset and the amount of the insurance or other payment. In most cases, fire and general insurance payments that a GST-registered person receives are subject to GST. In these cases, the GST component (that is, one ninth of the insurance receipt) is excluded when calculating the loss or gain. 4.10 Private use of motor vehicles When a motor vehicle is used for non-business pur- poses, and that use is subject to FBT, there is no requirement to adjust the depreciation deduction to exclude the private use. This is because FBT is itself an apportionment mechanism. However, self-employed people (including partners of partnerships) who use a business vehicle for private purposes must apportion the vehicle depreciation between deductible and non-deductible. The method used to calculate the apportionment for depreciation is the same applying to vehicle running costs. When an accurate and complete vehicle log book is kept, a factual apportionment can be made. Alternatively you may keep a record for 3 months to establish an appor- tionment which may then be used for three years, provided the business use of the vehicle does not change by more than 20%. Example A self-employed salesperson's car is used 85% for business purposes. The adjusted tax value at the beginning of the income year is $18,000 and it is used for business during the entire year. Assuming a depreciation rate of 26% the calculations are: Total dep'n $18,000 x 26% x 12/12 = $4,680 Deductible dep'n $4,680 x 85%= $3,978 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 The adjusted tax value at the end of the income year is $13,320, since the total depreciation must be taken into account, not just the deductible proportion. When a vehicle which has been used privately is sold, and either depreciation is recovered, or a loss is made on sale, an apportionment is necessary to exclude the private element. Example If the vehicle in the example above is sold for $15,000 the calculations are: Adjusted tax value$13,320 Sale price$15,000 Depreciation recovered$ 1,680 Apportionment for private use ($1,680 x 15%)$ 252 Assessable income$ 1,428 4.11 Private use of other business assets For working out the business use in relation to private use of assets other than motor vehicles, the type of measurement used will depend on the asset and the circumstances. The more common measurements are square metres for buildings, and time (i.e., hours, days, months) for assets used periodically. However any appropriate method can be used as long as it accurately calculates the apportionment. Example You use your house for business purposes as well as living in it. By calculating the area used for business in relation to the total area of the house, you work out that the use is 20% business and 80% private. Assuming the cost price is $150,000 and the straight line depreciation rate is 3%: Adjusted tax value at startAnnualAdjustment for Allowable of yeardepreciation private usededuction Year 1 $150,000 $4,500$3,600$900 Year 2 $145,500 $4,500$3,600$900 Year 3 $141,000 $4,500$3,600$900 Assets which are used privately cannot be pooled. 4.12 When pool property is used privately Where an asset stops meeting the 100% business test after it has been pooled, it must be isolated from the pool. At the time the asset is first used privately, for depre- ciation purposes it is to be treated as though it was bought and sold for market value. Example A pool with an adjusted tax value at 1 April 1994 of $18,000 includes an asset which on 5†December 1994 you start using for private purposes 20% of the time. The market value of the asset on 5†De- cember 1994 is $1,500 (i) Pool depreciation value at beginning$18,000 value at end ($18,0000 less deemed sale at $1,500)$16,500 $34,500 average pool value (divide by 2) =$17,250 assuming a rate of 22%, depreciation on the pool for the year will be:$3,795 (ii) Depreciating ex-pool asset separately, assuming a depreciation rate of 22% $1,500 x 22% x 4 months\* = $110 12 months \* (number of months from December 1995 to March 1996) total depreciation$110 less 20% personal use$ 22 deductible depreciation$ 88 total depreciation for 1995-96 income year$3,883 Chapter Five - Special rules for some assets 5.1 Buildings (i) Land and buildings Depreciation cannot be claimed on land. Where land and buildings are purchased and the price does not specify the cost of the buildings, the Government Valuation may be used for apportionment purposes as follows: Value of improvements x Purchase price Capital value (ii) Sale of buildings When a building is sold after 28 July 1988 for more than its adjusted tax value, the depreciation recovered is assessable income. The recovery is the smaller of: ï The original cost price of the building, less the adjusted tax value ï The sale price, less the adjusted tax value. This ensures that any capital profit made on the sale of a building is not included as assessable income. Losses made on the sale or disposal of buildings are not deductible. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 5.2 Leased assets (i) Specified leases A specified lease is a lease agreement which was entered into after 5 August, 1982, and which meets certain tests. The main test is that under the lease agreement the ownership of the asset passes to the lessee. With these types of leases, the lessee is treated as the owner and is entitled to the deduction for depreciation. Depreciation is based on the cost price of the asset to the lessor. When the lease is terminated the deemed sale price is largely dependent on the terms of the lease. (ii) Non-specified lease When the lease is not a specified lease, the owner (lessor) of the asset claims the deduction for deprecia- tion. 5.3 Intangible assets Certain intangible assets created or purchased on or after 1 April, 1993, now qualify for an annual deprecia- tion deduction. Intangible assets which qualify for a depreciation deduction are: ï Patents ï The right to use land ï The right to use plant and machinery ï The use of or right to use a copyright, trademark, design or model, plan, secret formula, process, or other like property ï Software (see section 5.4). The method of calculating depreciation for intangible assets depends on whether they are fixed life intangible property or economic life intangible property. Fixed life intangible property is intangible property whose life is limited by law or by contract to a number of years or months, and this period is expected to be the same as the estimated useful life of the property. The owner must use the straight line method to calcu- late depreciation. This means that the cost can be claimed evenly over the life of the asset. To calculate the straight line rate, divide 1 by the number of years (and part year, if applicable) and convert to a percent- age. Example Life of asset is 30 months ††††††1†††††† = .4 or 40% 2.5 years If a right to use a trademark is purchased for $5,000 for a thirty month period commencing 1†August 1994, the depreciation is calculated as follows (assuming a 31 March balance date): Year ended 31 March 1995 40% x $5,000 x 8/12 months =$1,333 Year ended 31 March 1996 40% x $5,000 x 12 months =$2,000 Year ended 31 March 1997 40% x $5,000 x 10/12 months =$1,667 Total depreciation over life of asset$5,000 For economic life intangible property (such as compu- ter software), Inland Revenue will set a diminishing value rate (which can be converted to a straight line rate). 5.4 Computer software Inland Revenue has been allowing an immediate deduction for the development of computer software. However, we now consider that some software is an asset which should be depreciated. It is proposed that from 1 July 1993 the following be capitalised and depreciated: ï Software purchases, including the right to use software ï Upgrading software to a new version ï Developing software ìin houseî. The depreciation rates proposed for software are a diminishing value rate of 40%, and straight line rate of 30% based on a life of four years. The final policy has not yet been announced. 5.5 Loose tools Loose tools means consumable items of the type that are left on the shelf or in a chest when not in use. It does not include electrical test equipment or specialised items or gauges. (i) 1992-93 income year and earlier The cost of the basic stock of loose tools and any additions to it was not deductible nor depreciable. Where a loose tool was replaced, the cost up to a maximum of $250 for any one item was allowed as a deduction in the year of purchase. Depreciation could be claimed on items costing more than $250. (ii) 1993-94 income year onwards With the introduction of the new depreciation rules the treatment explained above no longer applies. Purchases of loose tools in the 1993-94 income year and onwards are to be treated in the same way as other asset pur- chases. For loose tools costing $200 or less see section 5.6. Loose tools which cost more than $200 must be depreciated. The pool method (as described in section 2.4) is a particularly suitable method to use for these assets, although you may depreciate them individually. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 The book value of loose tools purchased before 1†April 1993 can be brought into the pool or depreciated separately. Where the cost of a replacement item has been allowed as a deduction and that item is later sold, the sale price, up to the amount of the original cost, is assessable income in the year of sale. 5.6 Assets costing $200 or less From the 1993-94 income year onwards the cost of assets acquired for $200 or less may be claimed as a deduction provided that: ï they are not purchased from the same supplier at the same time as other assets to which the same deprecia- tion rate applies (unless the entire purchase costs less than $200) ï the assets will not become part of property that is depreciable (for example, expenditure on materials to build a wall in a factory) ï the cost of those assets is not specifically deductible. Where any property for which this deduction has been claimed is later sold, the entire sale proceeds are assessable in the year of sale. 5.7 Assets which can no longer be used Where you have an asset which you can no longer use, you can apply to Inland Revenue to have the adjusted tax value written off as a deduction. To qualify for this write-off the cost of disposing of the asset must be greater than the price you would get if you sold it. Inland Revenue will also consider whether the asset could be used by someone else in a business. If we give approval for the adjusted tax value of the asset to be written off and you later sell the asset, the sale price up to the original cost is assessable income in the year of sale. Part Two - Assets Acquired before 1 April 1993 Chapter Six - Assets acquired before 1 April 1993 6.1 Rates applying The rates listed in section 7.2 apply to assets which you owned on or before 31 March 1993. The highlighted rate indicates the method that is to be used to calculate depreciation for the 1992-93 and earlier income years. From 1 April 1993 you may choose to depreciate the asset using an alternative method. Section 2.6 explains how to convert a rate from the diminishing value method to the straight line method, or vice versa. 6.2 Assets acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 A depreciation rate with a 25% loading applies to assets which meet certain criteria. These special rules came about as an interim measure before the full review of depreciation was completed. To qualify for the 25% loading the assets must either be new assets never used in New Zealand or imported second-hand assets used in New Zealand for the first time, and: ï acquired between 16 December 1991 and 31 March 1993 (inclusive) and ï used on or before 31 March 1994. The 25% loading does not apply to buildings or to imported used cars. The increased depreciation rate applies for every income year the asset is owned and used in business. Each year from the 1993-94 income year onwards you can choose between the straight line and diminishing value methods. If switching from one method to the other, convert the ordinary depreciation rate first (i.e. without the 25% loading) using the chart in section†2.6 and then add 25%. Example Ordinary rate10% DV Convert to Straight Line 7% Add 25% 1.8% Straight line rate with 25% loading 8.8% The rates incorporating the 25% loading where ap- plicable are listed in section 7.2 (columns 2 and 4). 6.3 Shift incentive Plant and machinery purchased before 1 April 1993 which is used in two or three shift operations qualifies for an increased depreciation rate. This incentive applies to new and second-hand plant and machinery and is available each year for the first five income years it is owned. Some assets are excluded from this incentive and these include: ï Motor cars, taxis, rental cars, ships, aircraft ï Loose tools and similar items ï Plant and machinery used in petroleum refining and aluminium smelting ï Plant and machinery operating 16-24 hours a day for which a higher than normal depreciation rate has not been fixed. This means that plant designed to operate continuously, such as refrigerators, lifts and boilers are excluded from the incentive. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Four, No.9 - Appendix - April 1993 The incentive is calculated: ï 2 shifts (i.e. average of 16 hours each working day) = ordinary depreciation plus additional 3% DV. ï 3 shifts (i.e. normally used for 24 hours each working day) = ordinary depreciation plus additional 6% DV. Example DVSL General plant and machinery rate 10% 7% Qualifying for 2 shift incentive13% 9.5% Qualifying for 3 shift incentive16% 11% When plant or machinery qualifies for the 25% load- ing, as explained in section 6.2,. the shift incentive is added to the depreciation rate, including the loading. Example DVSL General plant & machinery rate 10% 7% Including the 25% loading12.5% 8.8% Qualifying for 2 shift incentive 15.5% 11.3% Qualifying for 3 shift incentive 18.5% 12.8% Chapter Seven - Rates 7.1 Using the schedule Column 1shows the diminishing value (DV) rate. Column 2shows the DV rate including the 25% loading where applicable (see section 6.2 for details). Column 3shows the straight line (SL) rate. Column 4shows the SL rate with the 25% loading where applicable (see section 6.2 for details). SVmeans standard value. For specific assets a standard value has been negotiated with Inland Revenue. This value generally provides an average of the original cost. \*means that you have the option of using the following methods: ï replacement value ï annual value ï standard value Where you used one of these methods for depreciating your assets in the 1992-93 income year, to calculate depreciation for the 1993-94 and future income years you may: ï use the economic rates listed in sec- tion†10.5, or ï use the pool method as explained in section 2.4. High-indicates the method to be used for calc- lightingulating depreciation for income years 1992-93 and earlier
