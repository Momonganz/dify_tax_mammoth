Voting interest requires registered shareholding
================================================

2011 case note - group loss offset provisions require that for a person to have a voting interest, their shares must be registered on the company's share register.

Case

BHL v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Income Tax Act 2004

### Summary

The group loss offset provisions require that for a person to have a voting interest, their shares must be registered on the company's share register.

### Impact of decision

The decision has clarified the law as to what is required for parties to hold shares for the purposes of ascertaining whether a group of companies exists for the loss offset provisions.

### Facts

BHL challenged the Commissioner's assessments for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 years in terms whereof the Commissioner disallowed loss offsets claimed by BHL from BIJ under the group offset provisions of the relevant Income Tax Act ("ITA").

Prior to 2000, BHL had operated two businesses; a professional practice and a car restoration business. The professional practice was profitable and the car restoration business was not. Mr B owned 396,000 shares in BHL and his wife, Mrs B, owned 4000. In 2000, BHL transferred the car restoration business to BIJ which was owned in equal shares by Mr and Mrs B.

Once the accumulated losses in BHL had been used up, BHL attempted to offset losses in BIJ against its profits. However, to offset losses there must be a group of persons whose common voting interest in each company in aggregate is equal to or greater than 66%. The aggregate of Mr and Mrs B's voting interest in the two companies was for the relevant periods only 51%.

After this came to the attention of BHL, it alleged that in October 2000 Mr B had signed a share transfer form transferring 196,000 of his shares in BHL to Mrs B. It was alleged that the form had been lost and the share transfer had therefore not been effected.

Steps were then taken to rectify the problem. In October 2006, BHL's share register was amended to reflect Mrs B as holding 50% of its shares. However, because the matrimonial property agreement transferring the shares was not executed until November 2006, the Commissioner did not accept the share transfer was effective until then.

Next, Mr and Mrs B resolved that the share register be retrospectively rectified to show the transfer of shares to Mrs B as effective from October 2000. The Commissioner did not accept this.

Finally in January 2009, Mr and Mrs B obtained a Family Court declaration that between 2000 and 2006 the 400,000 shares in BHL were "relationship property" and equally owned by them. The Commissioner refused to accept that he was bound by the order.

### Decision

In dismissing BHL's challenge, the Court found that the group loss offset provisions require that for a person to have a voting interest their shares must be registered on the company's share register.

The Court held further that the fact that the shares were relationship property did not mean they were jointly owned. Mrs B is not presumed to be a 50% owner of the shares in BHL for the purpose of the group loss offset provisions.

As well, the Court was not satisfied that the Family Court had the power to make an order with retrospective effect. Even if it did, the order did not bind the Commissioner in the circumstances of the case. The Commissioner had not been a party to the Family Court proceeding.

Finally, the Court held that it would have made no difference if the share transfer form had been completed and was lost. This was because Mrs B could only acquire ownership of the shares for the purposes of the ITA by being recorded in BHL's share register as the owner. In any event, the evidence did not establish that any steps were taken in 2000 to effect a change to BHL's shareholding. The Court was satisfied that the share transfer form was not completed.

Ngā moni āwhina mahi - Ngā take ki ngā kaituku mahi Wage subsidy and leave support payments - Issues for employers
==================================================================================================================

What

The tax treatment and administration of the COVID-19 wage subsidy or leave support payments paid by the Ministry of Social Development.

Who

Employers

Employers may be eligible for a wage subsidy or leave support payment for their employees.

Where employers are paid a subsidy by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) there are tax implications to consider.

Income tax
----------

The income tax implications of the subsidies for the employer are as follows.

*   The receipt of the subsidy by an eligible business under section CX 47 is [excluded income](/api/glossary/item?id={8FDAC251-0D52-4B4D-949D-9123D625D195})
     (to the extent that the subsidy is passed on to the employee).
*   The employer will not be entitled to an income tax deduction for wages paid out of the wage subsidy under section DF 1(2).
*   The amount of wages paid in excess of the wage subsidy (amounts funded by the employer) are deductible as normal.

Any amount of the subsidy received that you do not pass on to the employee(s) is required to be repaid to MSD (following the criteria and declarations made at the time of applying). If the wage subsidy is not returned to MSD we may consider this as taxable income in which you will be required to include it in your income tax return and pay tax on it in the year it was received.

Example: Wage subsidy not returned to MSD

Employer receives a wage subsidy of $84,355.20. A total of $67,000 was passed on to employees in the 12-week period. The declaration at the time of applying for the wage subsidy required that funds not used to pay employees is required to be returned to MSD. If the excess ($17,355.20) is not returned to MSD, only $67,000 is treated as excluded income, the excess of $17,355.20 may be taxable income to the employer.

Repayments of the wage or leave subsidies
-----------------------------------------

Where an employer has claimed a subsidy and MSD subsequently requests this be repaid, the employer will be entitled to a deduction for the salary/wage expense which was previously non-deductible.

The additional deduction for salary/wage expense will occur in the year the salary/wages were originally incurred. To claim the additional salary/wage expense deduction, the employer can amend their net profit in myIR or ask us to amend their return.

Provide us with the following information

*   Explanation of the original treatment of the subsidy received
*   Salary/wage expense claimed
*   Amendment to be made
*   Evidence including details and amount of the repayment to MSD
*   Revised financial statements to support the change.

[See the 'Amending returns' page](/updates/news-folder/2020/amending-returns)

  

Example: Wage subsidy returned to MSD

Employer applied for and received a wage subsidy payment of $70,296 for 10 employees on 6 April 2021. The amount was passed on to the employees over the next 12 weeks with the necessary PAYE and other deductions made as required. The $70,296 was treated as excluded income in the financial statements. The total salary/wage expense for the year was $312,000. The amount of the wage subsidy required to be passed on was treated as a non-deductible expense therefore the employer only claimed a salary/wage expense of $241,704 for tax purposes.

MSD subsequently requests $5,659.20 ($2,829.60 x 2 persons) be repaid after identifying two staff were only entitled to the part-time rather than full-time wage subsidy. The excluded income amount will be reduced but that has no direct impact on taxable income, only the change to the salary/wage expense impacts the net profit. The employer will amend their return/request a s113 adjustment to increase the salary/wage expense by $5,659.20 from $241,704 to $247,363.20. This has an outcome of reducing the net profit by the repayment amount ($5,659.20).

GST
---

The employer will not be liable for GST on the subsidy received from MSD. The new legislation confirms that GST does not apply to these payments.

New legislation was required because ordinarily government grants and subsidies paid to GST-registered businesses are subject to GST under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985.

PAYE
----

Wage and leave subsidies should be passed on to the employee by the employer and processed as part of the employee’s normal wages. All employee deductions, including PAYE, KiwiSaver, Student Loans, child support are made as normal.

Deductions are to be calculated on the total wage (subsidy + employer-funded pay).

Whether employers top-up the subsidy with cash payments or annual leave is up to them to arrange with staff. If your employee's usual wages are less than the subsidy, you must pay them their usual wages. Any difference should be used for the wages of other affected staff.

If the initial 12-week wage or leave subsidy is paid to the employee as a single lump-sum there are likely to be tax consequences for the employee.

Employers should keep accurate records detailing the amount of the subsidy received and details of the employees it has been paid to. This will assist the employer if MSD or Inland Revenue request to review your payroll records.

[Visit the Employment NZ website for information about employment law](https://www.employment.govt.nz)

Suspending KiwiSaver contributions while receiving the wage and leave subsidies
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The subsidies should be processed as part of the employee’s normal wages and deductions of KiwiSaver contributions are made as normal.

Provided certain criteria are met, KiwiSaver contributions may be suspended where an employee is receiving a subsidy.

 

Example: Blue Sky Ltd

Blue Sky Ltd has 40 full time employees. It applied for the wage subsidy when it was first announced and received a payment from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) of $150,000 (as per the initial cap). As Blue Sky Ltd is now eligible for a wage subsidy of $281,184, MSD has made an additional payment of $131,184 to Blue Sky Ltd. Both payments are excluded income and will not be taken into account by Blue Sky Ltd when calculating its income tax liability. As the payment is a subsidy there are no GST implications on its receipt for Blue Sky Ltd.

The MSD payments are made to the employer to subsididise the gross payment of wages and therefore remain subject to PAYE and other usual employee deductions. Blue Sky Ltd is only able to pay its employee 90% of their regular wage, including the wage subsidy. The wage subsidy and (reduced) pay are processed by Blue Sky Ltd in the normal manner through its payroll system, and deductions such as PAYE and KiwiSaver are deducted from the payments, withheld by the employer and passed on to us.

Example: Food Bank Wellington

Food Bank Wellington is a registered charity which operates a small second-hand shop to help generate funds for the food bank it operates. Although there are volunteers who work in the second-hand shop, it also employs three part-time staff who are university students. The charity shop is not an essential business and will be closed for at least the next four weeks, during the Level 4 lock down. Food Bank Wellington applies for and receives a wage subsidy from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) of $12,600. Food Bank has no income tax or GST obligations in respect of the subsidy received.

Food Bank Wellington includes the wage subsidy from MSD in the pay of its part-time employees. With the wage subsidy it can continue to pay its employees while it is shut down. The subsidy is made as a gross payment from MSD and Food Bank Wellington withholds PAYE, KiwiSaver and student loan from the payments as it would with regular wages.

Example: Stef's Jet Skis Ltd

Stef's Jet Skis Ltd offers boat tours in Queenstown. It employs 5 full-time staff and 10 part-time staff. Its main customers are international tourists. As a result of COVID-19 it has seen a significant reduction in bookings and, with the closing of the borders, expects this to get worse over the coming months.

Stef's Jet Skis Ltd is eligible for the wage subsidy. When it applies for the subsidy, it receives a $75,158 lump sum payment from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Stef's Jet Skis Ltd is required to pass the subsidy on to its employees. It is not:

*   liable for income tax on the subsidy received as this is excluded income (providing the full amount is passed on to its employees)
*   required to account for GST on the subsidy received
*   entitled to an income tax deduction in relation to the portion of wages funded by the wage subsidy.

Stef's Jet Skis Ltd can now afford to pay its staff the equivalent of their regular wage. The subsidy is included and processed in the company’s ordinary payroll with the relevant KiwiSaver, child support, student loan and PAYE deductions withheld.

KOWHEORI-19 Ngā moni āwhina mahi - Ngā take ki ngā kaimahi ā-kiri Wage subsidy and leave support payments - issues for self-employed and other individuals
==========================================================================================================================================================

Self-employed persons and other individuals, upon application, may have been eligible for a Wage Subsidy Scheme payment paid by the Ministry of Social Development (MSD) if they had been affected by COVID-19.

Leave support payments for self-isolation as a result of COVID-19 were also available to self-employed persons/other individuals who satisfied the eligibility criteria and were prevented from working.

'Other individuals' are people who received a subsidy payment without tax deducted at source, for example: partners, trustees, non-PAYE shareholder-employees, Look-through company owners, students, and home-based childcare providers.

There are specific tax issues for the self-employed and other individuals to consider.

### Accounting for tax on the wage subsidy and leave subsidy payments

The COVID-19 wage subsidy and leave payments from MSD received by self-employed persons/other individuals are considered a compensation payment under section CG 5B and must be included as income in your IR3/IR3NR return:

*   in the 2020 year in the "Other income" box
*   In the 2021 year onwards in the “Government Subsidies” box.

For 2022 income tax returns, receiving a wage or  leave subsidy is no longer a requirement for filing an IR3. The wage and leave subsidy payments related to Covid-19 will be included on individual income tax assessments in the government subsidies box. You will still need to file an IR3 if you have other income that requires an IR3 return to be filed. If required to file an IR3, the wage and leave subsidies will pre-populate to the government subsidies box of the IR3 return.

You can find examples of various scenarios applying to self-employed persons and other individuals in Accounting for the wage subsidy - IR1251.

### Spreading of the subsidy payments

Where customers received the initial wage or leave subsidy payment which was for 12 weeks before 31 March 2020, as only 1 or 2 weeks would have related to the 2020 tax year it can be spread over the 2020 and 2021 income tax returns.

Similarly, if customers received the March 2021 (two weeks) wage subsidy payment prior to 31 March 2021, depending on the date received it may be able to be spread over the 2021 and 2022 income tax returns.

Example: Spreading the subsidy

Jenny applied for the initial wage subsidy and received payment ($7,029.60) on 24 March 2020.  Of the 12-week payment received, only one week relates to the 31 March 2020 tax year.  Jenny is required to return 1/12th of the payment ($585.80) in the 31 March 2020 income tax return.  The remaining 11 weeks ($6,443.80) is required to be returned in the 31 March 2021 income tax return.

Example: Subsidy received in single tax year

Adrian applied for the March 2021 wage subsidy. He received payment ($1,171.60) on 13 March. As the payment was for two weeks and this all falls into the 2021 tax year, he is required to include this full payment in his 31 March 2021 tax return. Nothing can be allocated to the 2022 tax year.

Example: Subsidy repaid in same tax year

John received a full-time wage subsidy payment of $7,029 on 3 April 2020. After review by MSD, it was determined he was only entitled to the part-time subsidy ($4,200). John was required to repay MSD $2,829. John repaid this amount on 1 February 2021. John will declare $4,200 ($7,029 - $2,829) in the Government Subsidies key point in his IR3.

Wairarapa tax agent helps IR enhance online services from the inside
====================================================================

**12 December 2017**

A team of five practising accountants is working at Inland Revenue to provide crucial advice on the design of its online services.

Wairarapa accountant Robert Royle from Greytown is one of those to climb over the other side of the fence and is on secondment for a few months to share his knowledge from the user’s perspective.

“I think it’s great that IR has recognised they didn’t necessarily understand how we work and has sought to correct this.

“We’ve been working hard to help IR staff understand about the day in the life of an accountant and I hope this information will be considered in future changes.”

![](/-/media/project/ir/home/media-releases/2017/wairarapa-tax-agent-helps-ir-enhance-online-services-from-the-inside/royle1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20210303221250&hash=7356BC360BD3F24D41E0E1F208C2AD23)

Greytown accountant Robert Royle - Image supplied

The secondment team has already influenced upgrades to the GST portal on myIR and now they have started system testing ahead of the rollout of the next round of changes in April next year.

These include introducing the Accounting Income Method (AIM), a new method for calculating provisional tax, as well as moving withholding taxes, fringe benefit tax, PAYE and gaming machine duty onto Inland Revenue’s new system.

Inland Revenue’s Deputy Commissioner for Transformation Greg James says the insights from the secondment programme have been immensely valuable.

“Tax agents and accountants are the most regular users of myIR so one of our biggest challenges is to make sure it’s making their work lives easier.

“Our developers are closely tracking our secondees as they move through the new system to make sure our intuition matches theirs’.

“The members of the secondment programme like Robert are making a real impact on the design of our services and we hope the fruits of their labour will benefit the rest of the tax agent community.”

Nearly 80 percent of accountants in a recent survey by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand (CA ANZ) said they are positive about their experiences with Inland Revenue over the last year.

“That’s pretty good during a time of great change,” says Mr James. “Hopefully we can improve on that next year by taking the feedback on board from the practising accountants on the secondment programme.”

Accountant Robert Royle says any enhancements he can influence while at IR will undoubtedly affect his day-to-day workflow back at his real job.

“Many of our processes are going to be automated by IR and that’s going to free us up to focus our time on more important tasks like advisory work.

“I now have a good idea where IR’s business transformation is headed and the changes facing our industry over the coming years.”

Waiver in terms of Section 24(6)(b) of the GST Act
==================================================

2007 case note – waiving the requirement for a tax invoice - associated parties, time of supply, price undetermined, time of test.

Case

Decision Number 4/2007

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985

### Summary

When requested to waive the requirement for a tax invoice under section 24(6)(b) of the GST Act the Commissioner must apply the two limbs of the test at the time he makes his determination. A waiver under section 24(6) cannot operate retrospectively.

### Facts

The Disputant, a partnership of two trusts purchased livestock from an associated entity, the W partnership. In terms of the deed of sale the settlement date was 31 March 2002 which was also the date possession passed. The sale price was to be determined by a valuation which was only obtained in November 2002. The time of supply was in the GST period ending 31 March 2002. Both parties were registered for GST.

Neither party accounted for the transaction until the W partnership issued a tax invoice on 31 March 2004. On 1 April 004 the Commissioner allowed the transfer of the GST input credit from the Disputant to the W partnership.

The result was that the W partnership had incurred use of money interest from the time of supply period (31 March 2002) until it issued a tax invoice (31 March 2004). On 31 March 2004 the Commissioner refused a request from the Disputant to make a determination in terms of section 24(6)(b) of the GST Act that a tax invoice was not required to be issued by the W partnership. If the Commissioner has allowed the request the Disputant would have been able to claim the input credit in the time of supply period and transfer it to the W partnership at that time, the result being that the W partnership would not have incurred use of money interest.

### Judgment

For unassociated persons section 9(6) deals with the situation where the consideration of goods has not been determined at the time of supply. In terms thereof the supply is deemed to take place when payment is due or received or an invoice is issued, whichever is the earlier. However, that section does not apply to associated persons.

In terms of section 20(2) an input tax credit can only be claimed when a tax invoice is supplied unless one of the exceptions apply, such as, where the Commissioner is satisfied a tax invoice is not required to be issued under section 24(6).

The W partnership had a duty to account for the supply in the period ending 31 March 2002 but was unable to as the price of the livestock had yet to be determined by valuation. It should have delayed the time of supply until the valuation had been received. The fact that the time of supply was in its control is relevant to the exercise of the Commissioner's discretion under section 24(6).

It is also relevant that the when the vendor received the valuation in November 00 it still did not issue a tax invoice, as is the fact that the Disputant never requested one.

On 9 October 2003 the W partnership asked the Commissioner to make a determination under section 24(6)(b) that a tax invoice was not required to be issued. The Commissioner had to apply a two step test. Firstly, he had to be satisfied that there were sufficient records to establish the particulars of the supply, or, that there would be at some future time be sufficient records thereof. Secondly, he had to be satisfied that it would be impractical to require a tax invoice be issued.

The Commissioner is required to determine the two limbs of the test at the time of his determination which was at 31 March 2004. The first limb of the test was satisfied as the valuation was completed in November 2002. In respect of the second limb no reason was given as to why it would be impractical to obtain a tax invoice as at March 2004 or October 2003, when the application was made. The details of the supply were known in November 2002. At the date of the request there was no practical reason why the Disputant could not obtain a tax invoice.

A waiver under section 24(6) cannot operate retrospectively.

Finally, the Commissioner did not breach section 6 or s 6A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 by failing to exercise his discretion in s 24(6) in favour of the Disputant.

Warranty payments paid by overseas manufacturers of motor vehicles to importers not exempt from GST
===================================================================================================

2005 case note - warranty payments from overseas motor vehicle manufacturers to importers not exempt from GST - contracts of insurance, supply, repair services.

Case

CIR v Motorcorp Holdings Ltd & Ors

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1986

### Summary

Warranty payments paid by overseas manufacturers of motor vehicles to importers to reimburse them for amounts paid to dealers for repair services on faulty motor vehicles before 1 August 2002 are not exempt from GST as contracts of insurance within section 5(13) of the GST Act.

### Facts

The appeal and cross-appeals concerned the imposition of GST on certain warranty payments in relation to imported cars. All respondents ("the car companies") purchase cars for import into New Zealand from overseas manufacturers. The car companies receive warranties from the manufacturers. The car companies on-sell the cars to dealers, and in turn provide their own warranties to the retail purchasers. When repairs are carried out on the cars under the warranty provided by the car companies, the dealers claim the cost from the car companies, who in turn claim either the full cost, or a portion of it, from the overseas manufacturers pursuant to the warranty from the manufacturer.

The subject matter of these proceedings was whether GST applies to payments received by the car companies from the overseas manufacturers pursuant to such warranties, prior to a legislative change exempting payments from 1 August 2002.

### Decision

Venning J found in favour of the car companies. He concluded the arrangements between the car companies and their manufacturers did amount to insurance contracts. He noted the car companies took on the obligation of the manufacturers to meet the manufacturer's warranty in New Zealand, and the arrangement had other features similar to an insurance contract. For instance the cars would not necessarily need repairing, so it was not certain any claim would be made. The Commissioner appealed.

### Decision under appeal

The Court of Appeal (McGrath Hammond and William Young JJ) allowed the Commissioner's appeal, for differing reasons. William Young J considered that section 5(13) was a red herring, as both sides agreed the subsection does not literally apply. His Honour considered the key question was whether there was a supply for the purposes of section 5(1), and rested his decision on a finding there was a supply of repair services, even though this issue had not been raised at first instance, rather than on whether or not the transactions were contracts of insurance within section 5(13).

McGrath and Hammond JJ found that the contracts before the Court were not contracts of insurance. Their Honours considered it is of great significance that the transactions are expressed to be "warranty" transactions, and that they operated as warranty claims, and not in line with procedures used in insurance claims. The court accepted that at a general level there was "indemnification" but noted that features one would expect to see in an insurance contract were distinctly absent. For instance, no policy was issued, and no premium was distinctly identified. No fund was created to meet future claims. There was no transfer of risk.

All members of the court dismissed the taxpayer's cross appeals. It was accepted the High Court had correctly found there was no contractual justification for the contention that the warranty payments were a refund of part of the purchase price paid for the motor vehicles.

We’ve helped customers file and pay on time and managed debt proactively
========================================================================

Many individuals, families, whānau and businesses are struggling through the volatility caused by the pandemic. Our people have continued to take an empathetic approach - if people could not pay on time we supported them to file their returns and assisted them in making arrangements to pay. We focused in particular on employers because they needed to file to qualify for the Wage Subsidy Scheme.

This year, 94.3% of filed returns were on time, compared to 93.2% last year, and 89.9% of tax payments were made on time, compared to 85.9% in 2019-20. These are strong indicators of people actively trying to comply with their obligations in difficult times.

Tax debt did increase this year. Excluding debt related to child support, student loans and Small Business Cashflow Scheme loans, it rose by 3.2% to $4.4 billion. This was not unexpected given the impacts of COVID-19, although as the table 'Tax debt as at 30 June ($ million)' below notes, there were a range of factors behind the increases in different kinds of tax debt.

Importantly, while the growth in debt has continued, it’s been relatively slow compared to the growth in revenue (see the table below). We collected $93.8 billion in tax revenue, a 21% increase from last year. That debt grew at a smaller rate was in part due to us re-commencing all debt-related activities from December 2020. For example, we worked closely with tax agents, who continued to assist their clients while we focused efforts on customers without an agent.

We've also provided personal relationship managers for large organisations to ensure they stayed on track with payments.

We encouraged customers to enter instalment arrangements to pay their tax debt if they could not pay in full, which they can easily set up in myIR. We know instalments work - 41% have stayed on track this year and have paid off $403 million. When we look back to the arrangements set up in 2019-20, 49% have been fully paid off.

Other targeted assistance has also been available, such as writing off child support penalties and identifying child support customers who needed to re-estimate their income throughout the year.

Tax debt gets written off for several reasons, including serious hardship, bankruptcy, liquidation or if the cost of collecting the debt is uneconomical. $812.8 million of debt was written off this year, compared to $411.6 million last year.

For the 2020 tax year, the threshold for write-offs was increased from $50 to $200. Two products made up 59% of the write-off value - GST was 29% ($239.4 million) and individual income tax was 30% ($244.8 million). This included $117.7 million in use-of-money interest and penalties remitted for customers whose ability to pay tax on time was significantly affected by COVID-19 and who had entered into instalment arrangements.

### Ratio of overdue tax debt to revenue ($ billion)

|     | Jun-2019 | Jun-2020 | Jun-2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total taxation (excluding child support, student loans and Working for Families) | $77.88 | $77.66 | $93.79 |
| Overdue debt (excluding child support, student loans, and Working for Families) | $3.49 | $4.08 | $4.19 |

### Assistance we provided for customer this year

*   Customers entered into 140,000 arrangements to pay a total of $3.7 billion in instalments. 57,000 of these arrangements were set up by customers themselves.
*   We set up 63,600 arrangements for child support customers to pay off their debt in instalments.
*   We suppressed use-of-money interest for 22,300 customers who had entered into instalment arrangements.
*   We remitted $117.7 million in penalties and interest for customers who were impacted by COVID-19, but still complying with instalment arrangements.

### Tax agents worked closely with us

Tax agents have worked closely with us to help develop our COVID-19 initiatives and to let their customers know about the range of support available to them.

A November 2020 survey gave positive feedback from tax agents on our response to COVID-19.

Overall, respondents to the survey by Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand and Tax Management New Zealand were very satisfied with the way our initiatives were rolled out and supported by our people.

“Remembering what the Government and Inland Revenue were confronted with back in March last year, including having to act fast and not knowing for sure what would work, the survey indicates the Government’s business response is as deserving of accolades as its health response” - John Cuthbertson, Chartered Accountants Tax Leader, New Zealand

Focus on tax debt
-----------------

### Tax debt as at 30 June ($ million)

|     | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | Change since 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Working for Families Tax Credits | $193.4 | $140.1 | $128.8 | $167.2 | $198.5 | 19% |
| GST | $825.6 | $814.9 | $1,180.6 | $1,550.0 | $1,523.0 | \-2% |
| Income tax | $1,556.2 | $1,651.3 | $1,609.8 | $1,742.6 | $1,585.0 | \-9% |
| Employment activities\* | \-  | \-  | \-  | $741.3 | $919.6 | 24% |
| PAYE and KiwiSaver\* | $336.2 | $417.3 | $517.1 | \-  | \-  | 24% |
| Other tax | $80.0 | $79.8 | $85.0 | $45.8 | $157.7 | 244% |
| Total debt | $2,991.4 | $3,103.4 | $3,521.3 | $4,246.9 | $4,383.8 | 3.2% |

\*The consolidation of employer deductions to an ‘employment activities’ account changes how we group tax debt. The lines marked with an asterisk are those tax types where we’re unable to compare debt with previous years

The 3.2% increase in debt has been caused by a range of factors.

*   As a result of COVID-19, income streams for many businesses immediately stopped, and there was pressure to pay fixed costs (such as rent and net wages to staff) rather than tax. We focused on employers and businesses filing timely and accurate payday information over collecting associated debt. This contributed to a 24% increase in employment activities debt (this is largely made up of PAYE and KiwiSaver debt).
*   The increase in employment activities debt was also influenced by large companies that were impacted by COVID-19, and which are now under instalment arrangements.
*   The increase in ‘Other tax’ debt reflects the finalisation of a high-profile audit case.
*   Automatic assessments for individual income tax brought more customers with debt into the system, contributing to growth in both income tax and Working for Families Tax Credit debt.
*   Our focus on supporting customers as they dealt with the impacts of COVID-19, and got used to our transformation changes, meant we did less proactive follow-up on unfiled returns and outstanding debt. We’ve now resumed this work.

### Child support debt as at 30 June ($ billion)

|     | 2017 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Total debt value | $2.736 | $2.259 | $2.208 | $2.151 | $1.366 |
| Penalties only | $2.119 | $1.662 | $1.608 | $1.553 | $0.726 |

As shown above, child support debt decreased by 36% this year, largely due to work we’ve done to prepare for moving child support services onto new systems later in 2021. We wrote off $998 million, which included writing off penalties to encourage liable parents to re-engage with their obligations.

### Student loan net repayment by overseas-based borrowers ($ million)

| 2016-17 | 2017-18 | 2018-19 | 2019-20 | 2020-21 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $214.8 | $221.3 | $206.3 | $211.6 | $199.4 |

We collected $1.5 billion in student loan repayments this year, up 1.2% from last year. Of the total repayments, $1.07 billion came through PAYE, down 2.3% from last year, and $427 million directly from customers, up 11.1% from last year.

At 30 June 2021, overdue debt was $1.72 billion, an 8.9% increase from 2019-20. This increase was driven by aged debt owed by overseas-based borrowers. This debt which we cannot write off, is difficult for us to collect.

We’re working differently
=========================

*   Our new tools, processes and capabilities are enabling us to work differently and more effectively. This helps us to be more customer-centric and improve the way we operate to benefit New Zealanders.
*   Nā ā mātou taonga mahi hou, ngā tukanga me ngā pūkenga, i āhei ai tā mātou mahi rerekē, whai hua ake ai hoki. Mā tēnei ka nui ake te aro ki ngā kiritaki, ka pai ake hoki ā mātou whakahaere hei huanga mō ngā tāngata o Aotearoa.

Over the past few years, we have changed pretty much everything we do to deliver better experiences for New Zealanders. Through transformation, we’ve invested in our people and systems, simplified things for customers, delivered a better customer experience and implemented new ways of working.

A modern, digital revenue system is in place
--------------------------------------------

The digital revenue system we set out to deliver at the start of transformation is now largely in place. Our multi-year programme is on track to be completed on budget and on time - by 30 June 2022. This year saw us complete all the changes to policy and legislation that frame and support the modernisation of the revenue system.

Our systems are more resilient - they handle 50% to 60% more transactions than previously, with peak loads up to 200% higher. For example, at the end of June each year, KiwiSaver providers apply for the government contribution on behalf of their members. In the first 5 days of July 2021, we processed the bulk of these claims - more than 2.6 million worth $904 million in total - and we’ve been able to pay out claims the next business day.

*   We’re seeing a range of efficiencies from our new systems and more automated processes. For example, the cost of processing employment information and income and GST returns has fallen significantly. It cost $1.86 this year, compared to $2.78 in 2019-20.
*   Overall, we're doing more with less. Our total spend excluding transformation this year was $50 million less than 2016-17.

The final customer-facing changes are being implemented in 2 releases during 2021.

*   Paid parental leave, unclaimed money, duties (including casino, lottery and totalisator duty, and the problem gambling levy) and New Zealand foreign trusts went live on new systems and processes in February 2021. These products are running smoothly with few issues encountered following go-live.
*   Child support services are scheduled to change over to our new systems and processes later in 2021. We’re also upgrading the online services that all customers use, notably myIR.

We continued to decommission more than 400 heritage systems. You can read more about our technology management.

Website expenditure - deductibility
===================================

This QB issued August 2000 clarifies the tax treatment of expenditure incurred in creating a website to be used in deriving gross income.

### Section BD 2, Income Tax Act 1994 - Allowable deductions 

A taxpayer has asked how he should treat expenditure incurred in creating a website to be used by him in deriving gross income.  (The same considerations could also apply if the taxpayer had contracted another person to create the website for him.)

A website is a collection of web pages or web files.  "Web" is an abbreviation for the "World Wide Web", the graphical part of the internet.  A web page is created using different programming languages (such as hypertext markup programming language ("HTML")).  The use of programming code such as HTML enables web pages to have a number of features, such as video files, sound files, and links to other sites.  A web browser interprets the code for graphical interface with a user's personal computer.  A web page is transferred to a user's computer via the hypertext transfer protocol ("HTTP").  A website resides on an HTTP server.

A website's development has a number of steps (that can be undertaken in any order), including acquiring a domain name - the site's internet address.  The site needs to be designed and programmed.  A website owner may wish to register the site with different internet search engines, and to embed search strings in the site.  The owner will also need to rent space on a web server.

The domain name of the website is generally acquired for a modest sum (less than $200).  However, in some cases acquiring the domain name may require substantial expenditure.  Expenditure incurred in acquiring a domain name is capital expenditure and non-deductible.  In terms of the applicable capital/revenue tests established by the courts such expenditure is of a one-off nature, gives rise to an enduring benefit, gives rise to an identifiable asset, and is part of the business structure of a taxpayer.  A domain name is not "depreciable intangible property" as defined in section OB 1, and listed in Schedule 17, of the Act.  As such, the expenditure incurred in acquiring the domain name is also not depreciable.

The HTML or other programming that makes up the website is an asset, being a computer software program.  The costs incurred in creating the website are appropriately categorised as capital expenditure.  In terms of the applicable capital/revenue tests established by the courts, such expenditure:

*   is of a one-off nature
*   gives rise to an enduring benefit
*   is part of the business structure of a taxpayer. 

As a capital asset, the costs of creating the website must be capitalised and may be depreciated.  To be depreciable, the software must be used in deriving gross income.  Consistent with other computer software, it may be depreciated at a rate of 50% diminishing value or 40% straight-line. 

This approach (of capitalising expenditure and depreciating it) is consistent with the views expressed by a number of commentators.  In an accounting context the view that capitalisation and amortisation is appropriate has been expressed by Dr Rachel Baskerville in "Web Sites - Lame Ducks or Golden Geese" _Chartered Accountants Journal_ (March 2000, page 62) and by Mr Craig Fisher in "Accounting for Web-sites" _Accounting, Corporate and Tax Alert_ (Issue 93, 5 June 2000, paragraph 200).  The approach of capitalising and depreciating is also consistent with the draft Australian Tax Office ruling TR2000/D6.

Ongoing costs of updating or adding to the information on a website are of a revenue nature, and are deductible when incurred if they meet the general test of deductibility in section BD 2(1).  It is a matter of degree as to whether expenditure is updating and maintaining a web site, and hence revenue, or a reconstruction or functional improvement to a website, which would be capital.  It is difficult to give general guidance on the distinction, as was noted (in a different context) by the Privy Council in _Auckland Gas Co Ltd v CIR_ (unreported, PC Appeal 32 of 1999, judgment 14 June 2000).  However, some examples can be given as to the distinction between the two categories in the context of websites.

Maintenance of a website would include the following:

*   Updating the content of a web page
*   Adding content to a web page
*   Correcting minor errors or bugs in a website, and
*   Minor style or format changes relating to matters such as font types, font sizes, colours and so on.

An upgrade of a website would include the following:

*   Adding new features to a website, such as adding a sales capability with credit card processing features
*   Adding extra pages to the website
*   Upgrading the version of the software used in the website, and
*   Completely changing the layout and functions of the website sufficient to be a reconstruction.

These examples are consistent with the distinction between maintenance and upgrade in the Commissioner's existing computer software policy statement (_Income Tax Treatment of Computer Software_ in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 4, No 10 (May 1993)).  The examples also reflect the fact that a website may start out as a very simple website with few features, and yet may be upgraded over time to be a complex e-commerce site with advanced features such as the ability to purchase goods and services online, with online credit card processing capability.  Just as the general capital/revenue principles apply to the original website (and the capital classification of that), any upgrade which adds new functions is also subject to those general principles and will also be on capital account.

The cost of renting space on an HTTP server is deductible; assuming the general test of deductibility is met.  The annual renewal fee for registration of a domain name is also deductible.  Such costs are of a revenue nature, because they are ongoing in the nature of a servicing charge, and are analogous to expenditure incurred in renting space in a building or in hiring goods.

We will deliver 100% of user need, using top down (user research)/bottom up (analytics) approach drawing on what we know from heritage and supplementing it with a robust process to ensure there no content gaps.

A separate workstream is underway to create a solution that meets the requirements of the users of tax technical data.(~8,000 pages) Low usepages (less than 250 views per annum) will be moved into a local repository if they’re not required to support a top-down scenario of use. (~100 pages) Elimination of pages that are duplicates, automatically generated content such as index, cover and folder pages, as well as all pages relating to events or campaigns in the past (~5,500 pages) Content from the remaining pages is being rewritten to accommodate for the cater for top-down customer requirements and core tasks (~400 pages) 10 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] This process has been elaborated based on the business goal of designing customer centric services which meet user needs and organisational objectives: Start with user research - identify the top tasks and pain points to prioritise the highest impact content on the heritage site. Study the analytics - bottom up analysis of traffic volumes to align with above. Align existing pages on heritage with the proposed new information architecture, to account for all existing pages on heritage. Reflect i-iii with user stories/tasks in the backlog. Collate a set of links from heritage which we do not propose to replicate on www rebuild. Consult with the business - engage product owners, segment leads, Technical Advisors and SMEs to validate approach and sign off content which is both in and out. Test with users - content will be prototyped, tested and refined throughout development with customers. Launch Beta content -publish content on the Beta, monitor traffic, contact centre calls and survey feedback to iterate and improve the UX. Measure performance against key business metrics and goals (satisfaction, effort and sentiment). —managing risk Content design process 11 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] The following measures will be taken, should it become apparent that content has been missed in the transition from heritage to new which is considered of high enough importance to any of our customer groups to warrant reinstating: —managing risk Plugging any content gaps Heritage will remove/delete all INC, WFF and CS content from go live. Heightened awareness in contact center to flag any call patterns relating to content which may have been missed in the transition so that, if deemed necessary, remedial action can quickly be taken. We will implement an online form which will allow users to alert us of any content they are seeking but have not been able to find. Customers will be encouraged to complete our feedback form and contact centres will be primed to field any calls relating to the content held on Beta. As with Beta 1.0, staff will be encouraged to contact the team via email to ensure we can quickly respond to any queries or concerns they may have. Test and evaluation phase Pre AprilGo Live Post April 12 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] —managing risk Robust monitoring & easy augment Local repository will hold approx 100 pages of ‘low value’ content Content gaps will be spotted and acted on quickly Depending on urgency and severity, we will aim to resolve within 1-3 days 13 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] 14 \[IN CONFIDENCE RELEASE EXTERNAL\] With the successful implementation of the \[Information redacted\] platform, dynamic content model, and reusable patterns and templates for Release 3, it is anticipated that the remaining products and domains will be much more straightforward to migrate from the heritage platform to the new.

What is a binding ruling?
-------------------------

A binding ruling is Inland Revenue's interpretation of how a tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person or item of property. This can be on any agreement, contract, plan or understanding (whether enforceable or not), including any steps and transactions that carry it into effect or it can be whether a person or item of property meets the requirements of tax law.

Binding rulings can provide certainty on the tax position for a wide range of transactions, from complex financing transactions to land subdivisions. Anyone can apply for a binding ruling on a transaction, but there are some restrictions on our ability to provide a binding ruling.

[Find out more about what we can rule on](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/what-we-can-rule-on)

If a binding ruling applies to a taxpayer, and they follow it, Inland Revenue is bound by it (provided that the facts are exactly as described in the ruling, and that the stipulated conditions are satisfied). A taxpayer is not required to follow the approach in the ruling.

A binding ruling does not remove the requirement to file an income tax return and pay any taxes. We're required by law to charge a fee for preparing a private or product ruling.

* * *

What is the purpose of a binding ruling?
----------------------------------------

Binding rulings help taxpayers comply with the law and to meet their obligations under the law. They provide certainty about how Inland Revenue will interpret how the law applies to a specific transaction, person or item of property.

They are especially useful where:

*   the law is unclear and there is more than one possible interpretation
*   new legislation applies to the transaction
*   the transaction is novel, sensitive or controversial
*   significant issues arise or may have a wide impact
*   the arrangement is a complex financing transaction.

* * *

Types of binding rulings
------------------------

There are five types of binding rulings.

*   Private rulings
*   Short-process rulings
*   Product rulings
*   Public rulings
*   Status rulings

### Private rulings

A private ruling gives a single taxpayer or group of taxpayers an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular arrangement, person or item of property. You must apply for a private ruling, and it is confidential to you and any other applicants.

A private ruling only applies to the person(s) named in the ruling. The facts must be exactly as described in the ruling and the person must satisfy any stated conditions.

**Advance pricing agreements (APAs)**

These are a type of private ruling. APAs represent a co-operative approach to addressing transfer pricing compliance. They can produce significant time and cost savings for both tax authorities and multinationals in comparison with an audit. APAs encourage up-front taxpayer compliance and early resolution of potential disputes. They offer a practical solution to complex cases with difficult facts and circumstances.

APAs are ideally suited to issues involving intangibles and specialised services which can result in a wide range of opinions as to pricing.

**[Find out more about APAs](https://www.ird.govt.nz/international-tax/business/transfer-pricing/practice-issues/advance-pricing-agreements)
**

Unilateral APAs can be issued in the form of a private ruling. Email [\[email protected\]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cfbbbdaea1bca9aabde1bfbda6aca6a1a88fa6bdabe1a8a0b9bbe1a1b5)
 for assistance.

An application fee of $322 is payable for a private ruling.

If any overseas travel is involved in completing an APA we will provide an estimate of such costs prior to travel being undertaken and seek to recover "out of pocket" costs (transport, accommodation and meals) on an actual and reasonable basis from the taxpayer.

Applicants for APAs must complete these forms which are available on the [Guides and forms](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/guides-and-forms)
 page:

*   Application for private ruling on transfer pricing arrangement – additional declaration (IR713A), and 
*   Application for private ruling (IR713).

### Short-process rulings

A short-process ruling is a quicker, less expensive type of binding ruling, if the taxpayer meets the following eligibility requirements:

*   the taxpayer must have an annual gross income of $20 million or less in the previous tax year.
*   the tax question must be about an amount of tax, duty or levy expected to be less than $1 million for the relevant year.

[Find out more about short-process rulings](https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/short-process-rulings)

### Product rulings

A product ruling is an interpretation of how the tax law applies to a particular “product” or "consumers" of a "product", that is entered into by several people on identical terms. For example, a product ruling could be given on whether delivery drivers are employees or independent contractors Product rulings can only be made where it isn't practicable to identify the relevant taxpayers and whose characteristics will not affect the content of the ruling.

A product ruling only applies to persons who transact as described in the ruling, and satisfy all stated conditions.

### Public Rulings

Public rulings interpret how a tax law applies to a specific type of arrangement that has a wide general application. If your circumstances match those in a public ruling and you meet all requirements in the ruling Inland Revenue is bound to follow it. You may apply it, but you are not required to.

 if you would like to suggest a tax interpretation topic of broad interest.

### Status rulings

If a relevant tax law is amended or repealed, the person who applied for an existing private or product ruling can apply for a status ruling on whether that amendment or repeal changes the way that the law applies in the private or product ruling.

Your tax code depends on your situation. Find out about tax codes for your situation or use the tool to work out which code is right for you.   

Tax codes for common situations
-------------------------------

You only have 1 main income, which is your highest income source. All other income is secondary income. Any tax code you select is based on the type and level of your expected annual income.   
  
Also, you may need to choose a new tax code if things change during the year. For example: 

*   you take out a student loan or pay it off 
*   you have a change in expected annual income 
*   you change jobs or start a second job.

[Secondary tax codes](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/tax-codes-and-tax-rates-for-individuals/secondary-tax-codes)

Your situation
--------------

### You’re getting paid parental leave payments (PPL)

If you’re getting PPL you choose a tax code just as you would with any other source of income. 

[Paid parental leave overview](/paid-parental-leave/overview)
 

### You have a student loan

If you have a student loan, you choose a tax code that tells your employer to deduct your repayments. Once you’ve paid off your loan, you need to choose a new tax code and tell your employer what it is.

### You’re getting ACC payments

If you’re getting ACC, you choose a tax code just like with any other source of income. Depending on how much you’re getting, ACC could be your main or secondary source of income.  
  
Your tax code with your employer may change depending on how much ACC pays you.

### You’re getting schedular payments

Use the WT tax code for income from schedular payments.

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

### You’re a casual agricultural worker

Use the CAE tax code if you are only doing casual agricultural work.

Casual agricultural workers do casual seasonal work on a day-to-day basis for up to 3 months. They earn no other income in this time. This group includes shearers and shearing shed-hands.

### You’re a recognised seasonal worker

Use the NSW tax code if you’re a recognised seasonal worker or hold a work visa as foreign crew of a vessel fishing New Zealand waters.

### Dividends and interest

You do not need a tax code for dividends or interest. Your payer will deduct resident withholding tax (RWT) for you.

[Resident withholding tax RWT](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/resident-withholding-tax-rwt)

### You’re helping with election day work

Use the EDW tax code for income from temporary work during a general election in New Zealand. The EDW tax code covers the 2-week period of advanced voting and election day. If you are working on the election outside this period, use the tax code best fits your circumstances as set out in the IR330.

### You’re receiving money from MSD

Are you receiving a main benefit from MSD? The income portion of an income tested benefit from MSD is always coded as M. This means any other income must have a secondary tax code.

### If you receive NZ Super

If you receive NZ Super, you can change your tax code through the Ministry of Social Development's website.

    *   where the relevant provision is or could be the subject of one of the determinations referred to above; or
    *   section RD 24 of the Income Tax Act 2007.

* * *

When we cannot rule
-------------------

Inland Revenue cannot make binding rulings on the Tax Administration Act 1994, or any matter relating to the administration of the tax system, including Inland Revenue's rights or obligation to exercise its powers in any of the following areas:

*   imposing or remitting penalties
*   inquiring into the correctness of any return or other information supplied by any person
*   prosecutions, or
*   recovering debt owing by any person.

Further, in some situations Inland Revenue is unable to issue a private or product ruling, as set out in the table below. If we determine that we are unable to rule because of one of these situations, we'll treat the application as though it had been withdrawn. In some of these situations, although we are unable to give a binding ruling, we may be able to assist by providing a non-binding indicative view.

| Situation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Not seriously contemplated | We cannot make a private or product ruling if, at the time the application is made or at any time before the ruling is issued, we consider that the taxpayer is not "seriously contemplating" entering into the arrangement. |
| Application contains insufficient information | We cannot make a private or product ruling if the applicant does not give us sufficient information. We'll ask for additional information if necessary, and if the information is not provided we can decline to make a ruling. |
| Facts and factual matters | Except in the international transfer pricing context (ie, where the ruling is an APA), we cannot make a private or product ruling determining a "proscribed question". "Proscribed question" is defined as meaning a question of:  <br><br>1.  whether facts are correct or exist.<br>2.  a person's purpose or intention, for the purposes of any provision of the Income Tax Act 2007 that expressly refers to a person's purpose or intention, other than as permitted by section 91CB of the Tax Administration Act 1994.<br>3.  the value of a thing.<br>4.  commercially acceptable practice, for the purposes of any provision of that Act that expressly refers to commercially acceptable practice.<br><br>As part of your application, you must provide all material facts. Where this is not possible, we can make or conditions or statements of facts as to future facts in the ruling itself.  <br>  <br>If the Commissioner issues you with a draft ruling containing a specified condition or material fact, you may be able to obtain a level of certainty through the factual review process. |
| Generally accepted accounting practice | We cannot make a private or product ruling if the application would require us to form an opinion on the application of generally accepted accounting practice. |
| Frivolous or vexatious applications | We cannot make a private or product ruling if the application is "frivolous or vexatious". "Frivolous" applications are not just ones that are "trifling" or "silly"; they include requests which could not possibly succeed, or which no reasonable person could treat as genuine. |
| Private or product ruling already exists | If a private or product ruling already exists on the application of a specific tax law to a particular arrangement, we cannot give another ruling on the same tax law for the same period covered by the existing ruling. However, a further ruling can be issued for subsequent periods or tax years if the arrangement continues after the duration of the previous ruling or is in relation to a different tax law. |
| Double tax agreement procedures | An arrangement may have tax implications in another country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement (DTA).  <br>We are able to rule on DTAs, unless the matter is (or should be) dealt with by the competent authority under a DTA. We'll consult with the competent authority before issuing a ruling concerning a DTA.  <br>We are unable to rule on an issue that is within the scope of a mutual agreement made under a DTA, or on the interpretation of a mutual agreement.  <br>  <br>For more information see [QB 08/03: Application for a private ruling or product ruling on an issue dealt with in a mutual agreement made under a Double Tax Agreement](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2008/qb-0803-application-for-a-private-ruling-or-product-ruling-on-an-issue-dealt-with-in-a-mutual-agreem)<br>. |
| The tax, duty, or levy is due and payable | We cannot issue a private ruling if the matter on which the ruling is sought concerns a tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy that is due and payable, unless we receive the application before the tax (excluding provisional tax), duty, or levy is due and payable. The correct way to challenge any tax assessed is through the disputes resolution and/or challenge process. |
| Assessment already made | We cannot make a private ruling if an assessment relating to the person, the arrangement, and a period or a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply, has been made. This includes where a taxpayer has filed a return, due to this being a self-assessment.  <br>  <br>For more information see [QB 08/01: Tax Administration Act 1994 - Section 91E(4)(f) and self-assessment](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2008/qb-0801-tax-administration-act-1994-section-91e-4-f-and-self-assessment)<br>.  <br>  <br>Again, in such cases, the disputes resolution process is the correct avenue to follow. The only exception to this is if Inland Revenue received the application before the assessment was made. |
| Subject to an audit or investigation | We cannot issue a private ruling if we are auditing or investigating how the taxation law applies to the person and to the arrangement for a period or for a tax year to which the proposed ruling would apply.  <br>  <br>For more information see [QB 07/05 - Ability to rule where the Commissioner is auditing or investigating - whether the Commissioner has a discretion to rule or is prohibited](/questions-we-ve-been-asked/2007/qb-0705-ability-to-rule-where-the-commissioner-is-auditing-or-investigating-whether-the-commissioner)<br>.  <br>  <br>Any disputes about subsequent assessments can be challenged through the disputes resolution process. |
| Notice of proposed adjustment | We are unable to issue a private ruling if the application relates to a person, an arrangement, and a tax type or separately identifiable issue that is the subject of a notice of proposed adjustment under the tax dispute resolution process. |
| Arrangement subject to an objection, challenge or appeal | If the arrangement on which the ruling is sought, or a separately identifiable part of the arrangement, is substantially the same as an arrangement that is subject to an objection, challenge or appeal, whether in relation to the applicant or any other person, we can decline to make a private or product ruling. |
| Debt exists for previous ruling | We can refuse to issue a private or product ruling to an applicant with an outstanding debt for a past ruling application. An applicant has an outstanding debt if they have not paid the amount stated on an invoice for an earlier binding ruling, on or before 60 days after the date stated on the invoice. |
| Resource constraints | We can decline to make a private or product ruling if we do not have sufficient resources to do so. This would normally only happen if a particular application required very extensive resources, or highly specialised expertise that was unavailable at the time of the application or in the foreseeable future. |
| Reconstruction | We can decide not to make a private ruling on how section GA 1 (Commissioner’s power to adjust) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies or would apply to an arrangement. |

Determinations
--------------

Generally, we are also unable to rule if an issue is or could be the subject of a determination in relation to a financial arrangement, petroleum mining, accrual expenditure, depreciable property, livestock, or record keeping.

In relation to the financial arrangements rules, we can issue taxpayer specific determinations on certain matters set out in the legislation (provided that no general determination applies). The matters that can be determined include:

*   how a spreading method applies to a financial arrangement
*   the method for determining what portion of the income or loss is solely attributable to an excepted financial arrangement
*   the method for determining the future value of property.

We may also be able to rule on some of these situations under section 91CC of the Tax Administration Act 1994. We treat applications for determinations in the same way as private rulings, except that they are published.

See **Application for determination relating to financial arrangements (IR735)** on the [Guides and forms page](/apply-for/apply-for-a-ruling/guides-and-forms)
.

See [Application and processing fees](/about/about-our-publications/about-determinations/application-and-processing-fees)
 for financial arrangements determinations.

Factual review
--------------

The Factual Review process has been established to enhance the utility of binding rulings in situations where a ruling is, or is likely to be, issued subject to a critical factual condition. The process will give taxpayers an opportunity to obtain a level of certainty from Inland Revenue regarding the likelihood that the condition will be satisfied.

When crediting is not payment
=============================

2017 case note - crediting to a shareholder's account, financial arrangement rules and base price adjustments.

Case

Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Leslie William Fugle \[2017\] NZCA 230

Legislative References

Subpart EH Income Tax Act 1994, ss 3 and 138G Tax Administration Act 1994, Determination G 12, District Court Rules 2014 r 9.6 and r 8.31, Court of Appeal (Civil) Rules 2005 r 53E(2)

### Summary

The Court of Appeal held that crediting an amount to a shareholder’s current account in respect of an existing liability in circumstances where there were insufficient funds for the shareholder to draw down the full amount, did not constitute the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement. Thus the arrangement had not matured under the financial arrangement rules (“FAR”) and a base price adjustment (“BPA”) was not triggered.

### Impact

This decision clarifies that crediting to a shareholder’s current account, when funds are not unreservedly at the disposal of the account holder will not constitute a final payment under the FAR so as to trigger a BPA.  
Note: This decision applies the old FAR which have been changed.

### Facts

A 1992 Settlement Deed provided that in consideration of Mr Fugle’s payment of $90,000, the Bank of New Zealand (“Bank”) assigned Mr Fugle a debt of $2,659,442.06 (plus accruing interest) owed to the Bank by Mr Fugle’s company, Bathos Properties Ltd (“Bathos”). This transaction is a financial arrangement to which the financial arrangements rule, in subpart EH of the Income Tax Act 1994 applied.

During the 2005 tax year, Bathos credited $2,659,442 to Mr Fugle’s current account.

Mr Fugle drew down $452,754 in the 2005 tax year; $1,064,364 in the 2006 tax year; and $751,475 in the 2007 tax year. The funds drawn down were used in part to support Mr Fugle and his family. Between 2001 and 2010, Mr Fugle returned no income and paid no income tax.

The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (“the Commissioner”) commenced an audit in July 2007 and financial statements for Bathos for the 2005, 2006 and 2007 years were prepared and provided to the Commissioner in 2010. In the financial statements the assignment of debt was credited, as a net sum in Mr Fugle’s current account.

Following the audit, on 10 October 2014, the Commissioner issued a notice of assessment of an additional amount of income of $2,569,442 in the 2005 tax year, derived as the result of a required base price adjustment upon the maturity of the financial arrangement with the crediting to Mr Fugle’s shareholder account.

Mr Fugle challenged the assessment on the grounds that there was no final payment and hence, no base price adjustment was required.

The Taxation Review Authority (“the Authority”) accepted the Commissioner’s argument that the Bathos indebtedness was paid by the crediting of the full amount of the debt to Mr Fugle’s shareholder account. This was on the basis that the funds were placed at Mr Fugle’s disposal and he was able to draw down against payment of that debt as and when he required. They held that it was not necessary for the full amount of the funds to have been immediately available to Mr Fugle. As the crediting of the entire amount of the debt was the last payment contingent upon the financial arrangement, the arrangement matured and a base price adjustment was required.

Mr Fugle appealed the Authority’s decision to the High Court.

The High Court held that the crediting to Mr Fugle’s current account in 2005 was not a payment; there was no sum of money to constitute a payment, but rather an assignment of debt. Consequently, there was no final payment under the FAR and a BPA was not yet triggered.

The High Court further held that the Authority erred in excluding evidence that had not been discovered to the Commissioner, and it accepted that that evidence proved the crediting to Mr Fugle’s account occurred much earlier than the 2005 tax year.

The Commissioner appealed.

### Decision

On the first issue, whether crediting in the 2005 tax year constituted payment for the purposes of the FAR, the Court of Appeal held that payment by crediting does not require the actual book entry in the current account to be made at the same time the act of payment is said to occur.

The Court of Appeal held that before there is payment, the company (here Bathos) would have had to have the full amount available to be drawn down by Mr Fugle in the normal course of business and in this matter, there was an implicit agreement between Bathos and Mr Fugle, that the assigned debt would be paid only as permitted by the available resources in the company from time to time. Payment in full was not made until the full amount was unconditionally available to be drawn down, and that did not occur in the 2005 tax year.

Consequently, the crediting of Mr Fugle’s shareholder’s account of an amount greater than the funds then available to Bathos was not the last payment contingent on the financial arrangement. Accordingly, the arrangement had not matured and a BPA was not triggered.

On the second issue, whether the Commissioner could raise an alternative argument that if no BPA was triggered, then Mr Fugle was required to return accrual income pursuant to one of the spreading methods under the FAR, the Court of Appeal held that because the Commissioner’s Statement of Position did not raise an issue to the effect that there was an obligation on Mr Fugle to spread income over the term of the arrangement, s 138G(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 precluded the Commissioner from advancing this argument.

The Court of Appeal noted that while the Authority may, on application, allow an applicant to raise new propositions of law and new issues at a challenge to a disputable decision, the Court of Appeal is not granted the same power.

Despite refusing to consider the substance of the Commissioner’s spreading method submission, the Court of Appeal at \[41\] of its judgment indicated that it did not endorse Cull J’s view in the High Court that the spreading method had no application because the payments were “principal” and not interest citing Sovereign Assurance Company Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2013\] NZCA 652, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-056 (“Sovereign Assurance”).

In Sovereign Assurance the Court of Appeal recognised the central purpose of the accruals regime as being to eliminate the orthodox distinctions between capital and revenue such that the regime takes into account all cash flows.

On the final issue regarding the admissibility of new documents before the Authority, the Court of Appeal, by its conclusion on the primary issue, rendered this matter academic and unnecessary to address.

Mr Fugle sought increased costs on appeal, submitting that the spreading method argument was obviously precluded under s 138G and was clearly wrong and had resulted in increased complexity.

The Court of Appeal held that although it declined to consider the spreading method argument, it did not determine the argument lacks merit. The argument was raised in both the Authority and in the High Court, but was not ruled upon in either instances, thus the Commissioner was entitled to press the point.

No increased costs were awarded.

When does derivation occur in relation to land sales with a deferred settlement, by business taxpayers who provide vendor finance?
==================================================================================================================================

QB (Jun 2004) considers when derivation occurs in relation to land sales with a deferred settlement by business taxpayers who provide vendor finance.

#### Section CD 1, Income Tax Act 1994 - Land transactions

A taxpayer has asked when does derivation occur in relation to land sales with a deferred settlement by business taxpayers who provide vendor finance?

In the course of considering this question the item in _PIB No. 106 - July 1980 - Sale of Land on Extended Terms_ was reviewed. The Commissioner no longer considers the statements in that item to be correct and it is formally withdrawn.

In relation to a sale of land, derivation generally occurs when a debt can be sued upon, which is usually also the time when the vendor loses their dispositive power. While this may be the same time as when the unconditional contract is signed, this will not always be the case. In considering the timing of derivation it is important to consider what gives the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income. For the majority of business taxpayers the accruals method of accounting, rather than the cash-receipts method, will be the most appropriate method to use, however there will be exceptions to this and the most important consideration is that the method of accounting used gives the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income.

Taxpayers should also consider whether the accrual rules apply when considering such sales where payment is deferred.

#### When are proceeds of land sales income?

Section CD 1 treats amounts as gross income where they are derived from the sale or other disposition of land:

(1)     Any amount derived from the sale or other disposition of land, being an amount to which this section applies, is gross income.

As section CD 1(1) sets out that income is derived when a sale of land takes place, it is necessary to establish what derivation is and when it occurs.

#### Generally what is derivation?

The generally accepted meaning of "derived" is as being something that is "obtained" or "got" or "acquired" as was discussed in _C of IR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd_ (1982) 5 NZTC 61, 200, and _FC of T v Clarke_ (1927) 40 CLR 246, 261.

Derivation occurs when income "comes home" to the taxpayer. Generally the cash or receipts method (where income is returned in the income year in which it is actually or constructively received) is used by private individuals who are salary and wage earners and some professionals. The accruals or earnings method (where income is returned in the income year in which all events which determine the right to receive income have occurred) is usually used by most business taxpayers.

_Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Executor Trustee and Agency Co of South Australia Ltd_ (1938) 63 CLR 108 ("_Carden's case_") is an important case on derivation and is frequently referred to in subsequent decisions. The case set out general principles of derivation which allow issues surrounding derivation in particular circumstances to be considered:

Income, profits and gains are conceptions of the world of affairs and particularly of business. They are conceptions which cover an almost infinite variety of activities. It may be said that every recurrent accrual of advantages capable of expression in terms of money is susceptible of inclusion under these conceptions. No single formula could be devised which would effectually reduce to the just expression of a net money sum the annual result of every kind of pursuit or activity by which the members of a community seek livelihood or wealth. But in nearly every department of enterprise and employment the course of affairs and the practice of business have developed methods of estimating or computing in terms of money the result over an interval of time produced by the operations of business, by the work of the individual, or by the use of capital. The practice of these methods of computation and the general recognition of the principles upon which they proceed are responsible in a great measure for the conceptions of income, profit and gain, and therefore, may be said to enter into the determination of definition of the subject which the legislature has undertaken to tax. The courts have always regarded the ascertainment of income as governed by the principles recognised or followed in business or commerce, unless the legislature has itself made some specific provision affecting a particular matter or question. (p 152)

Dixon J did not consider it possible to state which method of accounting will be appropriate in each and every set of circumstances, and the following passage from his judgment provides a principle which has been referred to in numerous cases to establish which is the correct method of accounting to use in a particular circumstance:

In the present case we are concerned with rival methods of accounting directed to the same purpose, namely, the purpose of ascertaining the true income. Unless in the statute itself some definite direction is discoverable, I think that the admissibility of the method which in fact has been pursued must depend upon its actual appropriateness**. In other words, the inquiry should be whether in the circumstances of the case it is calculated** **to give a substantially correct reflex of the taxpayer's true income**. \[emphasis added\] (p 154)

_FC of T v Dunn_ 89 ATC 4141 and _FC of T v Firstenberg_ 76 ATC 4141 also applied the principles espoused in _Carden's case_.

The cash or receipts method requires that income be returned for the income year in which it is actually received.  In _CIR v The National Bank of New Zealand_ (1976) 2 NZTC 61, 150 Cooke J (as he then was) observed that the cash method generally applies to most salary and wage earners, to private individuals who do not pursue a profession or business occupation, and to some professionals.

Generally, for business taxpayers, such as developers or real estate agents who provide finance for deferred property settlements, the method of accounting to be used is the accruals method. In _Carden's case_ Dixon J commented about the accruals method:

The foundation of the accruals system is the view that the accounts should show at once the liabilities incurred and the revenue earned, independently of the date when payment is made or becomes due. It is plainly not applicable to every pursuit by which income is earned. (p 157)

In _C of IR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd_ (1982) 5 NZTC 61, 200 ("_Farmers_") Pritchard J also commented on the accruals method of accounting:

The essence of the accruals concept in this respect is that both revenue and costs are accrued (that is, recognised as they are earned or incurred not as money is received or paid), matched with one another so far as their relationship can be established or justifiably assumed, and dealt with in the profit and loss account of the period to which they relate; provided that where the accruals concept is inconsistent with the 'prudence' concept the latter prevails. (p 61, 210)

The Court of Appeal decisions of _CIR v The National Bank of New Zealand_ (1976) 2 NZTC 61, 150 and _Fincon (Construction) Ltd v C of IR_ \[1970\] NZLR 462 also considered that the accruals method is generally the most appropriate for business taxpayers.

While the above cases set out the general principles of when the accruals method of accounting should be used, there are exceptions to the general rule that business taxpayers should use the accruals method of accounting.

_FC of T v Dunn_ 89 ATC 4141 considered _D & GR Rankine v Commrs of IR_ (1952) 32 T.C. 520 where it was concluded that the general rule was that the accruals method of accounting was the most appropriate for business taxpayers, however, it was also acknowledged that:

There will sometimes be great practical difficulty in putting a value upon credit items at a time when they are only future or contingent or perhaps conjectural, and a like difficulty may even arise in connexion with bad or doubtful debts - all of which necessitate suspense accounts and troublesome readjustments and reopening of accounts when credits or debits mature or become ascertainable in amount ... In all such cases no objection has been taken or could be taken to the common sense practical expedient of discarding the earnings basis in favour of the cash basis as the method of computation affording in the circumstances the best practicable approximation to the desired result.  (p 4149)

In _J Rowe & Son Pty Ltd v FC of T_ 124 CLR 421it was also acknowledged that the accruals method will not be the most appropriate method for all business taxpayers:

I do not doubt that in some cases money payable at a future date ought to be left out of account until it is received or perhaps until it falls due.  (p 438)

In each case the important question to ask, as propounded in _Carden's case_ and others, is which method will give the most true and accurate reflex of the taxpayers income?

#### In relation to land sales by business taxpayers who provide vendor finance, where payment is deferred, when does derivation occur?

Derivation generally occurs when there is a right to sue upon a debt. This will commonly, but not always, be when the vendor loses their dispositive power over the land. In relation to the timing of derivation it is important to consider what will give the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income. For some sales of land the timing of derivation and settlement will be the same, but for others settlement and derivation may occur at different times. While this item is concerned with the sale of land it should be noted that the general principles of derivation are the same for land, goods and services. Just as there may be exceptions to the general rule that business taxpayers should use the accrual method of accounting, if it does not give the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income, there can also be exceptions to the general rule that derivation occurs when there is a right to sue upon a debt if this does not give the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income.

_The right to receive income_

The need for there to be a right to receive income in order for the income to be "derived" was referred to by Barwick CJ in _Henderson v FCT_ 70 ATC 4016 ("_Henderson_"):

When the service is so far performed that according to the agreement of the parties or in default thereof, according to the general law, a fee or fees have been earned and it or they will become income derived in the period of time in which it or they have become recoverable. But until that time has arrived, there is, in my opinion, no basis when determining the income derived in a period for estimating the value of the services so far performed but for which payment cannot be properly demanded and treating that value as part of the earnings of the professional practice up to that time and as part of the income derived in that period.  (p 4020)

His Honour emphasised the point that until there is a right to receive income, derivation cannot be said to have occurred. For most business taxpayers, once everything has been done that is required for there to be a right to receive income or recover a debt, income will be "derived". This is the essence of the accruals method of accounting.

_Henderson_ has been discussed in the Full Federal Court decision of _Dormer v FC of T_ (2002) ATC 5078. _Henderson_ was distinguished on the basis that the accounting practice in _Henderson_ did not involve a change of business, unlike the facts in _Dormer_, and therefore the general principles from _Henderson_ are still considered to be good law.

_General cases concerning derivation_

_FC of T v Australian Gas Light Co_ 83 ATC 4800 ("_Australian Gas Light_") discusses several tests which have been put forward by the courts to state when income is derived, but the court concluded:

Helpful as these tests may be as signposts, each of them has been conceived in and applied to varied and contrasting circumstances. As signposts they indicate that invariably something more than provision of goods or services by the taxpayer is required. It is necessary to determine whether the consequence is that a debt has been created or whether the taxpayer is obliged to take further steps before becoming entitled to payment. (4,805)

The judgment in _Australian Gas Light_ highlights the fact that there are no firm rules which can determine the time at which derivation will occur in any given transaction. Instead it acknowledges that when derivation occurs is generally determined by the time when a debt can be sued upon, which will be affected by the particular facts of the case. The case is significant as it acknowledges that if further steps are required before the taxpayer is entitled to sue for a debt after a "sale" has taken place, then derivation will only occur once those steps have been taken and the taxpayer is able to sue for the debt.

The frequently cited case of _Arthur Murray (NSW) Pty Ltd v C of T_ 114 CLR 314 ("_Arthur Murray_"), which relates to the derivation of income from services is an example of an exception to the general rule that derivation occurs when there is a right to sue upon a debt. That case involved payment of tuition fees for dance lessons. Students paid in advance for a set number of lessons or a lifetime of lessons to be taken in a certain period. The taxpayer put these advanced fees into a separate account and only transferred the money for each lesson, once that lesson had been received. This was in the event that the tuition fees may need to be refunded if the lessons were not taken (even though there was no contractual obligation for the taxpayer to refund money, they had a practice of doing so). The court held that the fees were derived only when the money was transferred from the separate account to the taxpayer's general account.

Therefore in _Arthur Murray_ derivation was held to take place not when a debt was due, but when the necessary steps had been completed for the taxpayer to have a right to receive payment, even though the taxpayer had already received the money. This gave a more correct reflex of the taxpayer's income as the taxpayer did not have the right to use the money until it had fulfilled its side of the agreement and provided the dance lessons.

A case to note which qualifies the general rules on the timing of derivation of income is _BHP Billiton Petroleum (Bass Strait) Pty Ltd & Anor v FC of T_ (2002) ATC 5169. This case dealt with the situation when there is a bona fide dispute between the parties to a contract as to an amount owed.

_Land sale cases concerning derivation_

Cases that have specifically dealt with land sales adopt the same approach as the one taken in general cases concerning derivation. The Commissioner considers that the judgments in both _Gasparin v FCT_ (1994) 94 ATC 4, 280 ("_Gasparin_")and _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth_ \[1925\] NZLR 161support the concept of derivation generally occurring when there is an enforceable debt (which is different from there being an ability to sue for specific performance) and that this is generally the same time as the vendor loses their dispositive power over the property.

_Gasparin_ involved a taxpayer who was a builder and land developer involved in the subdivision of a piece of land into allotments. Settlement of the sales was subject to the "acceptance, deposit and registration of the plan of subdivision in the Land Titles Office on or before 30 July 1985". On or before 30 June contracts relating to nine of the allotments had been settled. The contracts relating to the remaining 64 allotments were settled in the following financial year. The taxpayer treated these 64 allotments as "closing stock on hand" for accounting and taxation purposes. The Commissioner disagreed and considered that because the sales had become unconditional on or before 30 July 1985, that the allotments had ceased to be trading stock and were actually "sales".

In _Gasparin,_ von Doussa J held that income was derived from the sale of the allotments which comprised their trading stock at the time of settlement (not when the contract became unconditional), when a debt accrued due from the purchaser to the taxpayer. It was held that the time when the debt arose was the critical consideration.

It was also held that each allotment remained trading stock on hand until settlement - as that was the time under the contract when the vendor taxpayer lost all dispositive power and the contingency that the sale would not proceed to completion had disappeared.

After considering other Australian authorities, von Doussa J concluded:

In my opinion it should be held that the joint venturers derived income from the sale of the allotments of land which comprise their trading sock not when the contracts became unconditional, but at settlement when a debt accrued due from each purchaser to the joint venturers.  **The critical consideration is the time when the debt arose**_._  \[emphasis added\]  (4288)

The judgment in _Gasparin_ referred to the New Zealand case of _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth_ with approval. In _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth,_ a contract for the sale and purchase of 747 acres of land had been entered into between the vendor Ruddenklau and the purchaser Charlesworth. A deposit on the purchase price of £200 was required to be paid. Possession of the land was then to be taken by Charlesworth on 7 January 1919 when a further £200 was payable. There were then specific dates set out for specific amounts to complete the purchase price to be paid. The purchaser paid the initial £200, but did not make any further payments, but remained in possession until October 1923 when he abandoned the property. Charlesworth argued that while he was liable to pay interest on the unpaid balance of the purchase-money up to 1 February 1923 (which was the date upon which the balance of the purchase price was to be paid according to the contract), he was not liable for any interest after that. Ruddenklau contended that until the contract was rescinded or completed the purchaser was liable to pay interest on the balance of the purchase price, so long as it remained unpaid.

In _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth_ it was stated:

As a general rule, on the failure or refusal of a purchaser to complete an executory contract for the purchase of land the vendor is not entitled to sue for the purchase money as a debt. He is entitled merely to sue for specific performance or for damages for the loss of his bargain. It is only when the contract has been completed by the execution and acceptance of a conveyance that unpaid purchase money may become a debt and can be recovered accordingly.  (p 164)

The judgment also discussed situations where a debt may arise earlier than the time of settlement and conveyance:

... a contrary intention is sufficiently shown in all cases in which by the express terms of the contract the purchase-money or any part thereof is made payable on a fixed day, not being the agreed day for the completion of the contract by conveyance. In all such cases the purchase-money or such part thereof becomes on the day so fixed for its payment, a debt immediately recoverable by the vendor irrespective of the question whether a conveyance has been executed and notwithstanding the fact that the purchaser may have repudiated his contract.  (p164)

This suggests that in relation to the sale and purchase of land, derivation can occur at a time earlier than settlement when a debt arises before that point. This conclusion is reached on the specific facts of the case which provided for set amounts to be paid on particular days with settlement occurring at a later stage. The Commissioner does not consider that this decision means that derivation occurs when a deposit is made on the purchase price prior to settlement, but rather it occurs when the contract provides for several payments to be made prior to settlement, and the purchaser may already have possession of the land.

The New Zealand Court of Appeal in _Hawkes Bay Power Distributions Ltd v CIR_ (1999) 19 NZTC 15,226 appeared to agree with the Australian decisions in _Australian Gas Light_ and _Gasparin_ that when derivation occurs (when a debt accrued due from the purchaser and could be recovered accordingly) will depend on the particular facts and circumstances of a case as well as the provisions of any contract involved. This confirms that the reasoning in _Gasparin_ is not confined to the Australian situation alone, but is also authoritative law, applicable in New Zealand, on the timing of derivation.

_Derivation in relation to deposits_

The timing of derivation in relation to deposits does not differ from the general principles relating to the timing of derivation. Generally, the existence of a deposit will not affect the timing of derivation. In line with ordinary principles, derivation still occurs when the income has "come home" to the taxpayer and there is an ability to sue upon a debt, or a right to receive the money. Only when the contract, under which the deposit was made, is settled and can be sued upon, does derivation normally occur.

If, for example there was a situation similar to that of _Ruddenklau v Charlesworth_ (referred to above) where the deposit was the first of several part payments of stipulated amounts as provided for in the contract to be paid on set dates, then the timing of derivation will most likely be affected as there is a right to each part payment and if the money is not paid, then there is a debt which can be sued upon.

Whether the deposit is refundable or not in the event of a contract not proceeding through to settlement will affect the timing of derivation. However this does not differ from the ordinary principles of derivation discussed earlier. If the deposit is to be retained regardless of whether the transaction is completed then it is income which has been derived. This does not means that the whole of the purchase price is derived - just the amount of the deposit made at the time. If the transaction did proceed, then the balance of the purchase price is derived when the contract is settled and can be sued upon.

#### Are there any exceptions to the general rules about derivation?

The cases of _Harrison v John Cronk & Sons_ \[1936\] 3 All ER 747 ("_Cronk_") and _Absalom v Talbot_ \[1944\] 1 All ER 642 ("_Absalom_") could potentially be seen as providing an exception to the rule that the accruals method of accounting is generally the most appropriate for business taxpayers. However the Commissioner considers that _Cronk_ and _Absalom_ do not deviate from the general principles of derivation. The cases do not disagree that generally, business taxpayers should return income on an accruals accounting basis, and as must be done in all cases, the particular circumstances and nature of the transactions were taken into account to give the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income. Rather, when the quite unusual facts and nature of the transactions in those cases were considered, the courts concluded that to apply the general principles would be inappropriate and the cash-receipts method of accounting was more appropriate. The decisions have limited application for future decisions unless very similar fact situations present themselves.

_Cronk_ involved a taxpayer building company which built and sold houses to purchasers of small means. A building society advanced to purchasers the whole of the purchase money to be repaid with interest in equal monthly instalments. Only part of the purchase money was paid to Cronk with the remainder retained by the building society as security in the event of default by the purchaser.

_Cronk_ appears to have been largely decided on its particular facts and the provisions of the contract that existed between the building society and the taxpayer. Lord Thankerton's judgment appears to accept the general principle that business taxpayers should generally return income on an accruals basis, but stated that in this instance it was not appropriate as the taxpayer was not going to receive payment for many years:

I am unable to agree with the view of the Commissioners and of Findlay J. that the whole of the purchase price should be brought into the account as a trading receipt at the time of sale.  (p 193)

In _Absalom_ the appellant taxpayer was a speculative builder who sold properties to purchasers of small means. The purchasers paid only a small deposit, with a building society advancing the greater part of the balance on first mortgage, and the taxpayer advanced the remainder of the balance on the security of a second mortgage under which the debt was repayable with interest by instalments over a long period of time.

In _Absalom_, Lord Atkin stated the general principle that business taxpayers use the accrual method of accounting:

No one doubts that in ordinary commercial practice where goods are sold on terms of ordinary commercial credit, three or six months or even more, traders are in the habit of treating the debt so created as part of the profits of the year in which the debt is incurred.  (p215)

However on the facts of this case and after consideration of the particular circumstances of the taxpayer's business, Lord Atkin concluded:

According to the Crown's contention it makes no difference whether the price of goods is to be paid forthwith or at the end of twenty years or by instalments over twenty years, and whether with interest or not, nor, apparently, is the possibility or probability of the debtor being unable to continue the payments over the whole period a matter to be taken into account. To my mind, to treat money to be paid in twenty years hence as producing a profit this year equal to money in fact paid this year is to produce a completely unreal conception of yearly profit, and I venture to think quite foreign to any commercial ideas on the subject.  (p215)

Lord Atkin's acknowledgement that the transaction in _Absalom_ was an extraordinary one conforms with the leading authorities in the area of derivation, such as _Carden's case,_ which emphasise that the nature of the business will be one factor which determines which method of accounting the taxpayer uses.

The principle taken from the majority judgments in _Absalom_ is that concern was had over the high risk that the builder would not receive payment, due to the purchasers being of "limited means" and the long period over which payments were to be made - therefore making it unfair that they should have to return the income at one time. The case states that the accruals method is generally the most appropriate method of accounting for business taxpayers however the nature and circumstances of the case (the high risk of non-repayment and the long period of time before receiving payment), meant that the accruals method of accounting was inappropriate.

Although the judgments in both _Cronk_ and _Absalom_ do not discuss the general principles of derivation at any great length, it is apparent the House of Lords did in reality apply the derivation principles to reach the conclusion as to which is the most appropriate method for the builder taxpayers in these cases.

It appears that it was a regular part of the business of the taxpayers in both _Cronk_ and _Absalom_ to sell properties to purchasers of limited financial means. Therefore, while the cases have unusual facts which do not entirely conform to the principles espoused in other cases, they do still fit within the framework.

The cases of _Farmers_, _National Bank_, _Gardner, Mountain and D'Ambrumenil Ltd v IRC_ \[1947\] 1 All ER 650, 29 TC 69 discuss the House of Lords' decisions in _Cronk_ and _Absalom_. These cases distinguished _Cronk_ and _Absalom_ on the basis that they were decided on the special facts of the cases and were not therefore able to be applied. However they were not overruled or considered to be bad law.

#### Timeframes for payment do not determine when business taxpayers should use the cash-receipts method of accounting

It is inappropriate to stipulate a fixed period of time at which point it becomes suitable for business taxpayers to use a cash-receipts method rather than an accruals method of accounting. To do so would be contrary to the principles espoused in cases such as _Carden's case_, _Fincon_, and _Henderson_, that the particular nature and circumstances of the transaction involved will determine the correct method of accounting.

While the length of time before repayment of a debt in a transaction would be one factor to consider in reaching a conclusion on the most appropriate method of accounting, other factors such as the likelihood of repayment, the creditworthiness of the debtor and the ability to value the debt are also relevant in reaching a conclusion. The Commissioner therefore considers that an exception to the general rule which only takes one factor into consideration is inappropriate.

It appears from the background to the item in _PIB No. 106_ that the two exceptions as to when derivation occurs for business taxpayers contained in the item (1. The agreement provides for a small deposit with the balance payable by instalments over a period greater than ten years; or 2. The vendor at the time of sale secures the unpaid consideration by a second mortgage which has a term greater than 10 years) were based on the cases of _Cronk_ and _Absalom_. The 10 year period appears to have been developed from the periods of time contained in those two cases, and the fact that the court in _Fincon_ had considered that payment being deferred for 6 years was not long enough to require the taxpayer to return their income on a cash basis rather than an accruals basis.

The Commissioner now considers that the adoption of an estimated time frame of 10 years, taken from the cases of _Cronk_ and _Absalom_ does not reflect the fact that those cases were very fact specific and it is unlikely that the House of Lords intended the time-frames thrown up by the facts of those cases to go on to form a general rule. Taxpayers should take care to note that if a section within the Income Tax Act 1994 stipulates the timing of derivation for that particular section, this will override the general principles of derivation taken from case law.

#### The impact of the accrual rules

The Commissioner considers that it is also likely that the accrual rules have an impact on business taxpayers who provide vendor finance to purchasers on deferred property settlements. These rules were enacted subsequent to the publication of the item in _PIB No. 106_.

The sale and purchase of property (including land), where receipt of consideration is deferred comes within the section EH 22(1)(b) definition of "financial arrangement" which is the first requirement in deciding whether a transaction is subject to the accrual rules. 

In addition, deferred sales by the taxpayers specified would not generally come within the definition of "excepted financial arrangement" in section EH 24(1), unless payment of the purchase price was deferred for a period of less than 93 days, as contained in the definition of "short term agreement for the sale and purchase of property".

As it appears such a sale of land is a "financial arrangement" it will be necessary for taxpayers involved in these financial arrangements to use a spreading method  over the period of the arrangement and calculate the base price adjustment when the financial arrangement comes to an end.  A spreading method must generally be used (except where a party to the financial arrangement is a cash basis person) to spread the return on the financial arrangement (the difference between income and expenditure which is deemed interest) over the term of the financial arrangement.

The base price adjustment is a kind of "wash-up" calculation to catch any amounts which have not been accounted for during the financial arrangement. In brief terms, the BPA formula in section EH 47 (consideration - income expenditure amount) requires the amount which is the lowest price the parties would have agreed on had the transaction not involved a deferred payment to be taken into account. Section EH 48 defines "consideration" and section EH 48(3) requires the "lowest price ... the parties would have agreed on ... if payment would have been required in full at the time the first right in the contracted property was transferred or the services provided for", to be taken into account under "consideration". Determination G17B provides the means to calculate the value that can be inserted into the BPA formula in these circumstances. Determination G17B has not been updated since the Division Two Accrual Rules were introduced, however section 90AA of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states that such determinations apply "in principle" until a new and relevant Determination is made by the Commissioner under section 90AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Section EH 26(1) gives the accrual rules priority unless another section of the Income Tax Act 1994 expressly states otherwise. Section EH 26(3) means that the accruals impact needs to be taken into account where the consideration paid for any property is relevant under any non-accrual section of the Income Tax Act 1994, and the value of any property transferred will need to be determined in accordance with section EH 48(3) of the Act.

As noted earlier, the item in _PIB No. 106_ was published prior to the enactment of the accrual rules, and so they were not taken into account when considering the appropriate approach in the area of sales were payment was deferred.

#### The reasons for withdrawing the item in PIB No. 106

The item in _PIB No. 106_ provides that a sale of land takes place (and therefore derivation occurs) when there is an enforceable contract and gives the example of an unconditional agreement for sale and purchase, stating that there is an enforceable contract at the time the agreement is signed by both parties.

The item also provides the two exceptions which are discussed above.

The Commissioner considers that the item in _PIB No. 106_ is inaccurate for the reasons elaborated on above and is therefore withdrawn.

#### Conclusion

The Commissioner considers that derivation occurs when a sale takes place and a debt arises which can be sued upon, and generally this will be the same time as the vendor loses their dispositive power. While a debt may arise at the time an unconditional contract is signed; this will not always be the case. When considering when derivation occurs it is important to consider what will give the correct reflex of the taxpayer's income.

The accruals method of accounting will generally be the most appropriate method for business taxpayers to use, and the cash-receipts method will generally be the method for private individuals who are salary and wage earners and some professionals. While these methods of accounting are generally appropriate for these two groups of taxpayers it is always important to consider and apply the method that gives the most true and accurate reflex of the taxpayer's income.

The accrual rules will generally need to be taken into account when considering sales where payment is deferred.

As a result of considering the question asked, the item in _PIB No. 106_ was reviewed, and the Commissioner no longer considers the statement in that item to be correct and it is hereby formally withdrawn.

When does the response period to issue a NOR start following the Taxation Review Authority’s decision that a NOPA should have been accepted out of time?
========================================================================================================================================================

2018 case note – CIR's Notice of Response was issued within the required response period – deemed acceptance.

Case

TRA 005/17 \[2018\] NZTRA 01

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 89AB, 89AC, 89H(2), 89K

### Summary

The Taxation Review Authority (“TRA”) concluded that s 89AC of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”) applied to this dispute and that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) Notice of Response (“NOR”) was issued within the requisite response period. Even if s 89AC was not applicable, the Commissioner’s NOR was issued within the response period under s 89AB (prior to amendment). Furthermore, even if it was not, there has been no deemed acceptance of the disputant’s Notice of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPA”) by the Commissioner under s 89H(2).

### Impact

Section 89AC specifies that when an initiating notice (such as a NOPA or statement of position) is filed late, the response period starts from the date of the decision of the Commissioner or the Court to accept the initiating notice out of time. This decision confirms that s 89AC applies to decisions made by the Commissioner or the Court since 24 February 2016, when the section came into force.

Similarly, the decision also confirmed that prior to the introduction of s 89AC, the wording of ss 89K(1) and 89AB(2) was not to be taken as meaning that the response period ran from the date the late NOPA was issued, but rather from the date of the decision to accept the initiating notice out of time.

Finally, the decision followed previous case law that there can be no deemed acceptance in these circumstances, as the NOPA is not valid until exceptional circumstances are found by either the Commissioner or the Court. As such, the ordinary dispute procedures in Part 4A of the TAA, such as deemed acceptance, are not applicable.

### Facts

The Commissioner issued a Notice of Assessment for the GST period ended 31 October 2008 on 16 April 2013. Almost two years later, the disputant issued a NOPA dated 30 March 2015 which included a request under s 89K to have the NOPA treated as if it had been given within the applicable response period.

By letter dated 29 April 2015, the Commissioner refused to accept the NOPA under s 89K. On 9 July 2015 the Commissioner was served with proceedings in the TRA challenging, among other things, the Commissioner’s refusal to accept the NOPA.

On 5 May 2016 the TRA issued its decision (_Case 4/2016_ \[2016\] NZTRA 0427, (2016) NZTC 3/026). In relation to s 89K, the TRA concluded that the Commissioner’s decision to refuse to accept the NOPA out of time was incorrect, and it was set aside accordingly.

On 28 June 2016 the Commissioner issued her NOR. The disputant and the Commissioner then issued statements of position and a challenge notice was given by the Commissioner on 31 May 2017.

On 19 July 2017 the disputant filed this claim in the TRA.

### Decision

_**Does s 89AC apply?**_

The TRA found that the meaning and purpose of s 89AC is clear and that is, to specify a response period for the filing of a NOR by the Commissioner where the provisions of s 89K are met by a disputant. The provision is purely of a procedural nature. It came into force on 24 February 2016, and was not restricted in its application to disputes commenced after that date.

The TRA was satisfied that ss 89AB(2) and 89AC apply to this dispute and found that the Commissioner’s NOR was issued within the requite response period set out in s 89AC(2) and is valid.

_**Situation in the event that s 89AC does not apply?**_

The TRA also considered whether there would have been deemed acceptance under the prior s 89AB. The TRA found that until exceptional circumstances are established, a late NOPA does not have any effect and in these circumstances, it follows that there is no obligation on the Commissioner to issue a NOR at that time.

Section 89K(1) of the TAA says that where exceptional circumstances are subsequently found, then the disputant’s NOPA is to be “treated for all purposes under this Part as if it had been given within the applicable response period”. The TRA noted that s 89K(1) does not refer to the response document and concluded that there was no basis on which to conclude that the 2-month response period to file the NOR commences from that date that a disputant issued its late NOPA. Her Honour Judge Sinclair noted that in most cases, this period would have expired before any decision would likely be made by a hearing authority in the event of a challenge to the Commissioner’s refusal to find exceptional circumstances.

Finally, the TRA stated that even if it could be argued that an earlier response period applied, it did not accept there had been deemed acceptance of the disputant’s NOPA by the Commissioner. Her Honour followed the reasoning of Heath J in _Jacobs-Maxwell v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2011) NZTC 20,094 that no question of deemed acceptance arises if the ordinary disputes resolution procedures set out in Part 4A are not applicable. As the disputant had failed to issue a valid NOPA within the requisite time period and had to establish exceptional circumstance under s 89K, the claim clearly fell outside those ordinary procedures.

When is a person an 'employee' for the purposes of the RSP scheme?
==================================================================

Eligibility for the RSP was based on whether you were carrying on a business or organisation that met the criteria to apply. Eligibility was not based on employee numbers.

However, the number of employees does matter when working out the RSP amount you could get.

When you work out how much RSP you might get, a person is your employee if both of the following are met at the time you applied.

*   The person is your employee and not, for example, an independent contractor.
*   They 'regularly work' for you. In other words they were actively involved in the business day-to-day.

The number of hours an employee regularly worked for you helped you work out whether to claim them as a:

*   full-time equivalent worker (20+ hours a week) or
*   part-time equivalent worker (up to 20 hours a week).

Below are some examples of how these RSP terms and conditions actually applied

Show all

Employees on leave

An applicant will still be able to claim for an employee even if that employee is on leave at the time the application is made (for example, on sick leave, annual leave, or parental leave). The applicant should, in such circumstances, claim for the employee on the basis of the hours per week that the employee regularly works for the applicant when they are not on leave. For example, if the employee regularly works 20+ hours per week (when they are not on leave) they can be claimed as a full-time equivalent worker even if they may be on leave at the time that the application is made.

Employees on ACC

An applicant will still be able to claim for an employee even if the employee is on ACC at the time that the application is made. The applicant should, in such circumstances, claim for the employee on the basis of the hours per week that the employee regularly works for the applicant when they are not on ACC. For example, if the employee regularly works 20+ hours per week (when they are not on ACC) they can be claimed as a full-time equivalent worker.

Self-Employed people

A self-employed applicant (that is, an applicant that works as a sole trader for themselves) is able to claim for themselves as employee. 

Shareholder-employees

An applicant that is a company will be able to claim those shareholder-employees that regularly work for the applicant (that is, those shareholder-employees that are actively involved in the day-to-day business) as being employees for RSP calculation purposes, whether or not the company has paid the shareholder-employee a salary in a particular year. For example, the applicant may be in a growth stage and they may not have yet paid the shareholder-employee a salary if they're retaining capital within the company).

Not-for-profits

An applicant that is a not-for-profit will often have volunteers, as opposed to employees. However, such an applicant is able to claim for the person making the application on its behalf as an employee, provided that the person regularly works for the applicant. That is, they are actively involved in the day-to-day business. 

Commonly owned groups

An applicant that is a member of a commonly owned group will be able to claim those persons that regularly work for them as being employees (for RSP calculation purposes). This is the case even if the person is legally employed by another member of the group.

Please see the guidance on our Eligibility page for the circumstances when a member of a commonly owned group can claim a person as an employee for the purposes of the RSP calculation (and also the circumstances when such an employee will be a full-time equivalent employee on the one hand or a part-time equivalent employee on the other hand).

Āhea koe tono ai mō te utu tiaki pēpi When you can apply for paid parental leave payments
=========================================================================================

Find out when you can apply (and the deadline for your application), when payments start, and how paid parental leave payments affect your Best Start payments.

When you can apply
------------------

You must apply for paid parental leave payments before you return to work. You can apply:

*   before your baby’s first birthday if you or your partner or spouse gave birth to the child
*   before you have had permanent primary responsibility for the child under 6 years for 12 months.

Parental leave payments start the earlier of when you go on parental leave and your date of confinement (the date childbirth starts).

If you are an employee and are entitled to parental leave, you can choose to start parental leave any date up to 6 weeks before the expected due date of the baby, or earlier if any of these situations apply:

*   you and your employer agree to an earlier date
*   you have health concerns and a certificate from any medical practitioner or midwife telling you to go on parental leave early
*   your employer directs you to go on parental leave early because you cannot perform your work safely or adequately, and there is no other suitable work available.

If you apply after your baby is born, or have become the primary carer and you’re eligible for paid parental leave, we’ll pay you a lump sum to cover the period from your start date until your regular payments get under way.

Payments can start after any other paid leave finishes
------------------------------------------------------

If you’re an employee, and you’re taking other paid leave before starting your paid parental leave, your start date can be the day after your paid leave finishes.

Best Start and paid parental leave
----------------------------------

If you receive paid parental leave payments, you cannot receive Best Start payments for the same period.

If you apply for paid parental leave for a period where you’ve been receiving Best Start payments, these Best Start payments will be treated as an overpayment.

Please apply on time
--------------------

You cannot apply for paid parental leave after:

*   your child turns 1 (person who gave birth)
*   you’ve been the child’s primary carer for 1 year (other primary carers)
*   you return to work.

So please make sure you apply in time.

Example: Ellen takes annual leave to get ready for baby

Ellen’s expecting her first baby on 7 August. Her job keeps her very busy and she’s decided to take annual leave from work from 24 July to 10 August to catch her breath and take care of last-minute arrangements for baby.

Even though Ellen’s expected due date is 7 August, her paid parental leave will start on 11 August, after her annual leave finishes.

Example: Jenna applies for paid parental leave after getting Best Start payments

Jenna stopped work after giving birth, to care for her child, who was born on 10 October. She did not think she met the work requirements for paid parental leave, so she registered for Working for Families and began receiving family tax credit and Best Start.

In June 2023, after talking with another birth parent, Jenna realised she did qualify for paid parental leave. She sent in her application and the money was paid into her bank account every fortnight.

That means she has received an overpayment of Best Start.

Āhea me uta i te tāke hokohoko ki ngā rawa iti te uara kua kawea mai When to charge GST on low value imported goods
===================================================================================================================

#### GST Dates

[All GST dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[GST (goods and services tax)])

You are only required to charge GST on a sale of low value imported goods if it is a taxable supply.  A supply is taxable if:

*   the goods and services are treated as supplied in New Zealand
*   you are registered or required to be registered for GST, that is your turnover was $60,000 in the last 12 months (or will be $60,000 or more in the next 12 months)
*   it is made in the course of your taxable activity, or it is treated as being part of your taxable activity because you are an online marketplace operator or a redeliverer
*   the supply of your goods and services is not an exempt supply.

**When a sale is connected with New Zealand**
---------------------------------------------

From 1 December 2019, imported goods supplied to a customer are treated as supplied in New Zealand if the:

*   goods individually have a customs value of NZ$1,000 or less
*   overseas business has chosen to charge GST on high value goods sold to a consumer
*   merchant, online marketplace operator or redeliverer assists in bringing the goods to New Zealand.

Sales to New Zealand GST-registered businesses for business use
---------------------------------------------------------------

GST does not generally apply to sales of low value imported goods made to New Zealand GST-registered businesses for business use.

An overseas GST-registered business can choose to charge GST on a sale to a New Zealand GST-registered business if:

*   the value of the goods is NZ$1,000 or less
*   in the 12 months after the sale, the business expects more than 50% of all its sales to New Zealand customers will be made to customers who are not registered for GST.

Overseas suppliers can presume that a New Zealand customer is not a GST-registered business unless they have provided their GST registration number or New Zealand Business Number, or otherwise notified the supplier of their status as a GST-registered business.

Charging and collecting GST
---------------------------

An overseas business required to register must charge and collect GST on the services and low value goods they sell to consumers in New Zealand.  They must pay the GST collected to us.

Overseas businesses also need to let consumers know GST has been applied. They can do this by providing a receipt showing:

*   the amount of GST charged
*   their GST registration number.

Tokens, stamps or vouchers
--------------------------

GST may be payable when a token, stamp or voucher is either:

*   issued
*   redeemed for goods and services.

The issuer or seller can treat the supply as occurring for GST purposes when:

*   it is redeemed for low value goods or remote services
*   the supplier of the goods and services is a different person.

Calculating GST on taxable goods
--------------------------------

The value of a supply of taxable goods is not the same as the estimated customs value that will usually include amounts for related services such as freight and insurance.

The amount of GST required to be returned is 15% of the value of the supply. For goods that are priced inclusive of GST, the amount of GST to be returned will be equal to the amount of consideration for the supply multiplied by 3 ÷ 23.

Wendy purchases a fascinator

Wendy purchases a fascinator from Wild Hats, an e-commerce business based in Australia. Wild Hats is registered for GST in New Zealand.

The price of the fascinator is NZ$23 including GST. Wendy also pays a shipping fee of NZ$11.50 (GST-inclusive). The total amount paid by Wendy including GST is NZ$34.50.

The GST returned on the supply by Wild Hats is NZ$4.50 (NZ$34.50 × 3/23 = NZ$4.50). This includes the NZ$1.50 of GST included in the shipping fee.

When you register for GST, you need to choose an accounting basis and a filing frequency. This page explains the options and who's eligible, and there is a tool at the bottom of the page, to help you decide the best accounting basis for you.

Choosing your GST accounting basis
----------------------------------

The accounting basis you choose determines how you account for GST collected from your sales and income, and GST you’ve paid on purchases and expenses.

You choose your accounting basis when you register for GST.

| Accounting basis | Who's eligible | What you need to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Payments | If your total sales are:<br><br>*   $2 million or less in the last 12 months<br>*   likely to be $2 million or less in any 12-month period beginning on the first day of a month. | In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you've been paid by customers<br>*   amounts you've paid to suppliers if you hold taxable supply information. |
| Invoice | Anyone | In your GST return for the period include:<br><br>*   amounts you’ve notified customers to pay by invoice, even if you have not been paid yet<br>*   the full sale price amount if customers have paid any amount before you’ve invoiced them<br>*   amounts you’ve paid to or been invoiced by suppliers if you hold taxable supply information, even if you have not paid the full amount yet. |
| Hybrid | Anyone. **Note:** This method is not commonly used by small businesses because of negative cashflow consequences. This is because you may return GST on invoiced sales before you have received payment, but you can only claim GST when you have paid for your purchases (not when invoiced). | Use the invoice basis for your sales.<br><br>Use the payments basis for your expenses. |

Choosing your GST filing frequency
----------------------------------

You need to file regular GST returns. How often you file depends on your sales.

You choose your filing frequency when you register for GST.

| Filing frequency | Who is eligible | Who it's suitable for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly | *   Anyone.<br>*   You must file monthly if your sales are over $24 million in any 12-month period.<br>*   For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. | Customers likely to get regular GST refunds. |
| Two-monthly | *   Anyone with sales under $24 million in any 12-month period.<br>*   For a GST group the $24 million applies to the group as a whole. | Customers who find regular filing helps them keep on top of paperwork. |
| Six-monthly | *   Anyone with sales under $500,000 in any 12-month period.<br>*   For a GST group the $500,000 applies to the group as a whole. | *   Customers with few sales and purchases.<br>*   You only need to file two returns a year but it can be a big job to account for six months' worth of trading in one go. |

Once you've chosen your filing frequency, make note of when your returns and payments are due.

What's best for you?

Our online tool can help you choose the most suitable accounting basis and filing frequency.

Ka taea e wai te tono mō te utu tiaki pēpi Who can apply for paid parental leave
================================================================================

You can apply for paid parental leave if you’re the child’s primary carer, and you may also be eligible if you miscarry your baby or your baby is stillborn.

You also need to meet the work requirements.

[Work requirements for paid parental leave](/paid-parental-leave/qualifying/work-requirements)

Meaning of ‘primary carer’
--------------------------

A primary carer can be any 1 of these 3 people:

1.  the person who gave birth
2.  spouse or partner of the person who gave birth
3.  someone else ─ who cares for a child under 6.

Let’s look at each of these in more detail.

### Person who gave birth

The term means someone who is pregnant or has given birth to a child, and also includes a surrogate and a person who miscarries their baby or has a stillborn baby.

### Spouse or partner of the person who gave birth

A spouse or partner does not normally qualify for paid parental leave. There are some exceptions, including:

*   where the spouse or partner has taken over permanent primary responsibility for the care, development, and upbringing of the child from the person who gave birth
*   where the person who gave birth has transferred their paid parental leave entitlement to their spouse or partner.

There may be other circumstances that could be considered. Please contact us in myIR if you’d like to discuss your circumstances.

[Transfers of paid parental leave](/paid-parental-leave/transfers)

### Someone else ─ who cares for a child under 6

Someone taking permanent primary responsibility for the care, development, and upbringing of a child who is under 6 may be entitled to paid parental leave. Examples of these people include:

*   an adoptive parent
*   a parent with a child birthed by a surrogate
*   a matua whāngai (whāngai carer)
*   a grandparent with permanent full-time care
*   a permanent guardian.

‘Permanent primary responsibility’ does not include part-time or temporary responsibility like foster care or after-school childcare arrangements.

Surrogates
----------

If you’re a surrogate, and meet all the requirements for paid parental leave, you’re entitled to paid parental leave to recover from your pregnancy.

If your baby dies
-----------------

We’re sorry for your loss. We hope you’re getting all the support you need at this difficult time.

You and your whānau may find the Whetūrangitia website helpful. It has information about services and financial support available to you.

[Whetūrangitia website](https://wheturangitia.services.govt.nz/)

If you miscarry your baby or your baby is stillborn, you’re still entitled to paid parental leave.

If your baby dies after they are born, you’re also entitled to paid parental leave. In this situation, please provide a letter from your doctor or midwife confirming your baby’s date of birth. We need this information to work out your entitlement.

Later claims for paid parental leave
------------------------------------

You are not entitled to paid parental leave if fewer than 6 months have passed since the last payment of paid parental leave you received for another child.

**Narrator**

Employers are businesses that engage someone to work in their business.

It’s up to the employer to understand who’s an employee, and who’s an independent contractor.

Anyone that works for you, where you have control over what, where, and how the work is performed, could be an employee.

If you’re unsure, we have a questionnaire on our website which will help you work this out.

It’s an IR336.

If you hire a self-employed contractor, you may still need to deduct tax from their payments.

There’s a list of contractors that must have their schedular tax deducted from their income.

It’s found on our website, and on our IR330C form.

Employer responsibilities

You’ll need to:

*   Make deductions from salaries, wages and schedular payments to contractors
*   Keep wage records and pay PAYE and ACC
*   Understand your obligations regarding KiwiSaver
*   File employment information for each pay day

#### Audio

**Narrator**

One of the key responsibilities for employers is to make deductions from wages, and from schedular payments made to contractors.

You must keep wage records and budget for PAYE, and ACC.

You’ll also need to ensure your employees complete their tax code form, and any KiwiSaver forms, if they’re eligible.

Employers must also file employment information returns on a pay day basis.

Deductions

There are a variety of deductions which Inland Revenue may require you to deduct from employees, or which employees may choose to have deducted.

*   PAYE/schedular tax
*   KiwiSaver
*   ESCT
*   Student loans
*   Child support
*   Payroll giving

**Narrator**

Here are the types of deductions you’ll need to deduct from wage payments.

We’ll cover most of these in more detail in the following slides.

There may also be times when we request you make additional deductions from an employee’s income.

For example, to cover their arrears.

If this is the case, we’ll send you a letter with the details.

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Employers must deduct tax from salaries, wages, and schedular payments to contractors.

Employees must complete a tax code declaration form, with their IRD number, and tax code, and give it to their employer.

Employers hold onto the IR330, and use the information provided to work out how much tax to deduct.

If you hire a contractor that receives schedular payments, you’ll deduct, schedular tax.

The list of businesses that receive schedular payments is on the IR330C form.

If the contractor’s activity isn’t on the list, then you don’t need to deduct any tax.

If the activity is on the list, the contractor must complete the IR330C form, and give it to you.

You keep this form with your records.

Schedular payments are taxed at a flat tax rate, and the IR330C, tells you which tax rate applies.

If a contractor holds a current certificate of exemption, you won’t need to deduct any tax.

They must show you the exemption, and you’ll need to take a copy.

**Narrator**

It’s important to know your KiwiSaver responsibilities as an employer.

When a new employee starts, you’ll need to check if they meet the automatic enrolment criteria.

Generally, if you’re a New Zealand resident and aged between 18 and 65, you must be enrolled into KiwiSaver.

The full criteria is on our website.

If an employee must be enrolled, you’ll need to give them the KS2 enrolment form and start KiwiSaver deductions from their first pay.

The employee can only opt-out of KiwiSaver between week 2, and week 8 of employment.

If they want to opt-out, they need to complete a KS10 forml and give it to you.

You hold on to all of these forms in your records.

KiwiSaver members choose to contribute between 3 percent, and 10 percent of their income to their KiwiSaver fund.

Employers must contribute 3 percent to the employees fund.

You can choose to contribute more if you want to.

Employers contributions have tax deducted.

The tax is called, ESCT, employer superannuation contribution tax.

Note, that you don’t make KiwiSaver contributions for payments to contractors.

* * *

#### Visual

Employer Superannuation Contribution Tax

A tax deducted from your cash contributions to employee KiwiSaver schemes, complying funds and other superannuation funds.

You’ll need to deduct ESCT at either:

*   The rate determined by adding the employees income to the employers KiwiSaver contributions

or

*   If your employee agrees, you can add your employer contributions to your employees salary or wages and deduct PAYE form the total

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Employers need to work out how much tax, or ESCT, to deduct form your employer KiwiSaver contributions.

The rate depends on the employee’s gross salary and wages for the year, plus the total employer contributions.

If the employee hasn’t been with you for a year, our website has details on how to work out the ESCT rate.

Search, ESCT, to find the information.

We also have a separate YouTube video, specifically on ESCT that you might want to watch.

The other option for deducting tax on employer contributions, is to add your contributions to the employee’s wage, and deduct PAYE.

This can only be done if the employee agrees.

ESCT rates

| ESCT rate threshold amount |     |
| --- | --- |
| $0 to $16,800 | 10.5% |
| $16,801 to $57,600 | 17.5% |
| $57,601 to $84,000 | 30% |
| $84,001+ | 33% |

#### Audio

**Narrator**

Here are the different ESCT rates and thresholds.

Work out the ESCT rate based on the total wages, plus employer contributions for the year.

For example, if an employee earns 40 thousand dollars per year, and the employer KiwiSaver contributions are 1 thousand 2 hundred, then the combined total is 41 thousand 2 hundred, and the ESCT rate will be 17.5 percent.

Once you’ve worked out the ESCT rate, you’ll enter this into the PAYE calculator.

The calculator will tell you how much ESCT to deduct from the pay.

The ESCT rate stays fixed for the year, regardless of any change in salary or wages.

Student loans

*   Employees with a student loan must add ‘SL’ to their tax code
*   Deduct repayments from the employees’ salary or wages
*   There are special situations where a different student loan deduction may apply

#### Audio

**Narrator**

If you have an employee with a student loan, deductions are made form their salary and wages to repay it.

The employee will add, SL, to their tax code.

When you use these details in the PAYE calculator, it’ll tell you much the student loan deductions are for that pay.

In some situations the usual deduction rate might not apply.

Your employee might’ve given you a certificate with a specific deduction rate, or even an exemption from deductions.

Follow the rate on the letter for the period of time specified.

At the end of the certificate period, you’ll go back to the usual deduction rate, unless the employee provides a new certificate.

You might also receive a notice direct from Inland Revenue for student loan deductions.

If you do, you must follow the requirements of the letter.

If the employee disagrees, they’ll need to contact Inland Revenue.

Who is liable for GST: the receiver or the partnership?
=======================================================

2010 case note – considers law regarding mistaken payments - partnership, receiver, personal property, GST, liability.

Case

Stiassny and ORS v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Personal Property Securities Act 1999

### Summary

The sale of a forest by a partnership (each party of which was in receivership) created a goods and services tax (GST) liability of $127 million. The receivers paid the GST to the Commissioner and sought a Court order to return the funds. The Commissioner was unsuccessful in having the claim struck out.

### Impact of decision

This decision has limited tax-technical implications, but is of interest for its analysis of section 95 of the Personal Property Securities Act 1999 (PPSA) and of the law regarding mistaken payments. The decision is being appealed by the Commissioner.

### Facts

The plaintiffs in this case are:

*   two companies, and the receivers of those companies, which were the partners in the Central North Island Forestry Partnership (CNIFP)
*   the secured creditors of the CNIFP.

The partner companies were each placed in receivership by a secured creditor. The CNIFP itself was not in receivership.

The CNIFP sold a forest for US$621 million, plus GST of approximately NZ$127 million. There were insufficient funds to repay secured lenders as well as the GST on the sale, which resulted in a dispute as to the priority of the GST amount. The receivers paid the GST to the Commissioner and commenced proceedings to claim the funds back. The plaintiffs sought:

*   an order that the receivers were not liable to pay the GST
*   the return of the funds as money paid under a mistake of law (a restitutionary claim).

The Commissioner applied to strike out the claim, on the grounds that the:

*   receivers were liable to pay the GST amount
*   Commissioner is nevertheless entitled to retain the funds under section 95 of the PPSA
*   Commissioner provided good consideration for the funds
*   companies and the receivers did not have standing to bring the proceedings.

### Decision

The receivers were not liable to pay the GST; the liability was that of the partnership \[32\]-\[48\].

*   The sale of the assets was not a taxable activity of the partners; it was part of the taxable activity of the partnership. The partners (in being members of the partnership) were not conducting any taxable activity:

> ... Section 58(1A) imposes upon a specified person liability only in respect of the taxable activities of the incapacitated person concerned \[ie the partner companies\], and not in respect of the taxable activities of some other person registered in respect of those activities \[ie the partnership\] \[41\].

*   His Honour held at \[42\] that while the partners were jointly and severally liable for the GST liability of the partnership under section 57(3), that liability:

> is not dependent upon or related to the carrying on by partners of their own taxable activity. The subsection simply imposes statutory liability for the GST responsibilities of another (registered) entity.

*   The receivers of companies that are partners in a partnership are not members of the partnership:

> Although the definition of "member" in section 2(1) is not a closed definition, the Court would not, in my view, be justified in extending it to a receiver, given that the legislature has seen fit to specify four categories of legal person who come within that definition \[44\].

Section 95 of the PPSA applied, but did not operate to prevent _in personam_ claims such as a claim for money had and received \[49\]-\[73\].

*   The payment was a debtor-initiated payment, notwithstanding it was paid under compulsion or pressure as a result of exposure to interest and penalties:

> ... There is nothing in the language or purpose of s 95 which requires that a gloss be placed on the meaning of the term "debtor-initiated payment". There can be no question here but that the payment was initiated by or on behalf of the debtor in the sense that a conscious decision was taken by the receivers to forward a cheque to the Commissioner for the amount of the GST liability. The fact that they did so because they believed that they were or might be personally liable for the amount of the GST concerned could not justify the conclusion that the payment was other than debtor-initiated. Although the payment was made for motives associated with the sanctions for late payment imposed by the relevant statutory regime, it could not be said that the payment thereby lost its debtor-initiated status \[72\].

*   Section 95 of the PPSA did not prevent the plaintiffs claiming restitution on the ground of mistaken payment. His Honour noted at \[60\] that nothing in the section or Act shows a legislative intention to exclude overarching legal principles, and went on to state at \[64\]:

> While I accept that section 95 protects a creditor from a proprietary claim to a negotiable instrument falling within the section, as against the holder of a relevant security interest, a claim _in personam_ does not conflict with the creditor's rights in a negotiable instrument.

At \[107\]-\[122\]:

*   While the liability was the CNIFPs, and the CNIFP made the payment, the CNIFP understood the receivers to be liable for the debt and made the payment to avoid that liability. The payment would not have been made but for that mistaken belief \[103\]-\[104\], \[117\], \[120\]-\[122\].
*   There may have been some doubt on behalf of the receivers as to the correct position (as opposed to a fully fledged mistaken belief). His Honour noted there is authority that says mere doubt does not amount to a mistake, but there is also authority holding that doubt is not necessarily sufficient to rule out an argument based on mistake. His Honour stated at \[119\]:

> I do think that the fact that the plaintiffs had doubts as to whether the receivers were personally liable for the GST payment is determinative of the question of whether they are acting under a mistake.

The Commissioner provided good consideration, but may not have acted in good faith. His Honour decided that, due to the novel nature of the fact scenario, and that this is a developing area of the law, that this question should only be addressed after hearing fuller evidence and submissions, and it was not appropriate to determine it at the strike-out stage \[123\]-\[140\].

*   His Honour found on the facts that the CNIFP made the payment to discharge its GST liability, and that the discharge of the liability constituted good consideration by the Commissioner \[125\].
*   His Honour noted that the receivers had little choice but to take the course that they did, in paying the disputed amount and then commencing proceedings. His Honour stated at \[137\]:

> ... Although the Commissioner did not acknowledge any mistake, he was on notice by the time of receipt that the plaintiffs challenged the validity of the payment. There is an argument to make that in those circumstances, the Commissioner did not receive the payment bona fide for the purposes of the provision.

*   His Honour went on to note at \[138\]:

> The law relating to recovery of payments made under a mistake (and particularly under a mistake of law) is still evolving. Goff and Jones observe that questions about the scope of the defence of good consideration have not been definitively answered. Those questions include the good faith requirement. I recognise that questions of law will ordinarily be determined on a strike-out application even where difficult and troublesome but in my opinion, this unusual combination of factual and legal issues is best resolved at trial and not on the present application.

The circumstances are not sufficiently clear to say that the plaintiffs do not have standing to bring the proceedings \[141\]-\[144\].

[Taxation (Urgent Measures) Act 2005](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-urgent-measures-act-2005 "Taxation (Urgent Measures) Act 2005")

Wine producer rebate
====================

2005 changes enable IR to assist in the extension of the Australian wine producer rebate to NZ wine producers whose wine is exported to Australia.

### Sections CV 3 and CV 4 of the Income Tax Act 2004 and sections 3, 4B and 85J of the Tax Administration Act 1994

Changes to the Income Tax Act 2004 and the Tax Administration Act 1994 will enable Inland Revenue to assist in the extension of the Australian wine producer rebate to New Zealand wine producers whose wine is exported to Australia.

### Background

Wine equalisation tax is an Australian tax that is charged on wholesale sales of wine in Australia. New Zealand wine that is exported to Australia is also subject to the wine equalisation tax. The tax is paid in Australia either by wine importers or any other wine wholesalers.

In 2004, Australia passed legislation giving a wine producer rebate to Australian wine producers to partially compensate for the wine equalisation tax. Qualifying Australian wine producers are eligible for a rebate of 29 percent of the wholesale value of wine produced, up to a maximum of $290,000 each year. Since New Zealand producers did not receive a similar rebate, it was considered that New Zealand wine would be commercially disadvantaged in the Australian wine market.

The Australian government therefore agreed to extend the wine producer rebate to New Zealand wine producers selling in the Australian market. It was also decided that New Zealand will assist Australia in the administration of the rebate to New Zealand producers.

To extend the rebate to New Zealand producers, legislative changes were required in both countries. The Australian legislation, extending the wine producer rebate to New Zealand producers, received Royal assent on 19 December 2005.

The corresponding New Zealand changes were added to the Taxation (Urgent Measures) Bill by means of a Supplementary Order Paper.

### Key features

New section CV 3 of the Income Tax Act 2004 ensures that the wine producer rebate derived by a New Zealand wine producer is included as income for the purposes of that Act.

New section CV 4 enables the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to prescribe regulations for the administration of the wine producer rebate. The regulations will relate to:

*   claiming the rebate;
*   approval or verification of a NZ wine producer’s entitlement to a rebate; and
*   any other matters necessary to give effect to a provision relating to a wine producer rebate in an agreement between the governments of New Zealand and Australia for the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion.

For the provisions of the Tax Administration Act to apply to the wine producer rebate, the definition of “tax” in section 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act has been amended to include the Australian wine producer rebate.

New section 4B of the Tax Administration Act governs the application of that Act and regulations to the rights and obligations of a person in relation to the wine producer rebate. The Act and regulations apply to the rights and obligations of a person as if:

*   claims for approval by a New Zealand wine producer to be a New Zealand participant were an application for registration for a tax imposed by an Inland Revenue Act;
*   claims for payment of a wine producer rebate were an application for a refund of tax imposed by an Inland Revenue Act;
*   a decision concerning a person’s entitlement to a wine producer rebate were a decision by the Australian Taxation Office concerning an entitlement of the person to a refund of Australian tax;
*   a payment to a person of a wine producer rebate was a refund by the Australian Taxation Office of Australian tax.

New section 85J of the Tax Administration Act overrides the general secrecy provisions to enable the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to transfer information to the Australian Taxation Office and the New Zealand Customs Service. The information transferred will be that which is relevant to the claim by a New Zealand wine producer for a wine producer rebate or for the purposes of the approval or verification of an entitlement to the wine producer rebate.

### Application date

These provisions apply from 21 December 2005, the date of assent of the Act.

Ka haere au ki te mahi, ki te ako rānei ki Aotearoa I am coming to work or study in New Zealand
===============================================================================================

If you’re earning money in New Zealand, you'll need to pay tax on that income. If you want to work in New Zealand, you'll need to:

*   get an [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
    
*   pay the right tax when working
*   file or approve your end-of-year tax return.

This page only covers tax on income you earn from working. Make sure you check out how New Zealand's tax system works as a whole. You'll also need to be sure your visa from Immigration New Zealand allows you to work.

[Work in New Zealand (Immigration New Zealand)](https://www.immigration.govt.nz/new-zealand-visas/visa-lists/all-work-visas)

How New Zealand's tax system works
----------------------------------

New Zealand's tax system may be different from what you're used to using. Aside from working and studying in New Zealand, make sure you know how other types of income are taxed.

[Understanding New Zealand's tax system](/situations/work-or-study-in-new-zealand/tax-system)

You need to get an IRD number
-----------------------------

An [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
 is a tax identification number you'll need if you're earning income from working in New Zealand. In fact, most sources of income mean you'll need to get an IRD number. When you have an IRD number, the person or business paying you can deduct the right amount of tax from your income.

You may want to wait until you get here to apply for an IRD number. Applying as a 'new arrival to New Zealand' before your visa travel date expires can be a faster option, but some people prefer to get an IRD number beforehand while they are 'living overseas'. If you do apply for an IRD number while overseas, keep in mind you'll need either a:

*   fully functioning New Zealand bank account
*   [customer due diligence - IR997](/api/glossary/item?id={AF686B0C-99FC-47C5-ACE7-7DFDBCC9548B})
     form.

If you apply as a 'new arrival to New Zealand' and have a student or work visa, you'll also need 1 of these requirements. If you have a resident visa for New Zealand or an Australian passport, you will not need either of these requirements when applying as a new arrival.

If you apply after your visa travel date expires, you'll need to apply as 'living in New Zealand and not a new arrival'. With this timeframe in mind, it's a good idea to apply as soon as you can once you're in New Zealand.

Paying the right tax when working
---------------------------------

The tax year is from 1 April to 31 March. While working in New Zealand, depending on how you're paid, you'll pay income tax differently during and at the end of the tax year. There are 2 main ways of earning income from work. You'll either earn:

*   salary or wages from an employer
*   income from self-employment.

If you earn 1 or both of these types of income, you'll pay income tax at the rates set for individuals. You'll also need to be aware of special situations with [IR56 taxpayers](/api/glossary/item?id={81D57DCC-B9C3-411A-A7BA-F74C1BA85EBE})
 and international students who are working.

Earning salary or wages from an employer

If you're earning salary or wages, your employer is responsible for deducting income tax from your pay and sending it to us during the tax year. You'll need to give your employer:

*   your IRD number
*   the right tax code. 

When you get paid, your employer must give you a pay slip showing how much you were paid and any deductions they made. Your employer will deduct 'PAYE' which stands for 'pay as you earn'. It includes the:

*   income tax you need to pay 
*   [Earners' levy](/api/glossary/item?id={D0B72E97-AB1D-4CE0-A5DA-DE14E7717B67})
     for New Zealand's Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).

In New Zealand, anyone who gets injured in an accident is covered by the ACC insurance programme, which is owned and operated by the New Zealand government. You can check the current rate for the Earners' levy on the ACC's website.

[Levy results (Accident Compensation Corporation)](https://www.acc.co.nz/about-us/our-levies/levy-results/)

By not paying too much or too little tax while working, you can avoid a large expense or refund at the end of the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
. If you work without an IRD number or a tax code, you'll be charged the highest rate of tax, called a 'no-notification' rate. Your tax code depends on your estimated income and you'll need to work it out.

Earning income from self-employment

Self-employed people carry out activities on their own, earning their own income. Self-employment can be known by many names, such as being a:

*   contractor
*   freelancer
*   sole trader
*   consultant
*   small business.

If you're earning income from self-employment, you do not need to set up a formal company. Instead, you'll need to:

*   use your individual IRD number to pay income tax
*   pay income tax on net profit by filing a tax return.

If you're earning income in a partnership, you're still considered self-employed. However, you'll need to file some more paperwork and consider other points about your situation.

[Income tax for partnerships](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-partnerships)

  

If you choose to form a company, then you'll pay income tax using a completely different process. You can work out which type of business is right for you at the business.govt.nz website.

[Income tax for companies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies)

[Business structure overview (business.govt.nz)](https://www.business.govt.nz/getting-started/choosing-the-right-business-structure/business-structure-overview/)

  

While getting started in New Zealand, you might come across information about New Zealand Business Numbers (NZBNs). These are not required for your work as a self-employed person, but you might decide it helps you in your business activities.

[About the NZBN (New Zealand Business Number)](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/whats-an-nzbn/about/)

  

#### Other responsibilities for self-employed people

If you employ staff to work for you, you'll need to register with us as an employer. You'll need to make sure you meet your tax responsibilities when hiring workers. This includes deducting PAYE from your employees' salaries or wages and sending it to us during the tax year.

[Employers](/roles/employers)

  

In any 12-month period, if you earn more than $60,000 in [turnover](/api/glossary/item?id={B7A7B2F3-9E68-4DDF-ACED-28BE96F1F811})
 from [taxable activities](/api/glossary/item?id={F966147A-3408-4CDD-A965-AF294365FA2D})
, you'll need to register for New Zealand's goods and services tax (GST). You'll need to charge your clients and customers GST, collect it and send it to us during the tax year.

[GST](/gst)

  

Being considered in business, you'll need to keep track of receipts, invoices and other types of documents. You must keep these records for 7 years and they must be in English or Māori. Having these documents organised can also help you efficiently and accurately meet your tax responsibilities during and at the end of the tax year.

[Record keeping](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping)

  

#### Paying tax during your first year in business

Generally, in your first year in business, you will not need to pay income tax until the end of the tax year. However, you can choose to make voluntary payments in order to help spread the cost. If you meet the criteria, you might be able to get an early payment discount in your first year in business.

There are some situations where the person or business contracting your services may set up schedular payments with you. These payments have a standard tax code and the contracting person or business will deduct income tax from your earnings at the rate set for the type of work you do. You may also have extra income tax to pay at the end of the year. To avoid this, you can choose a tax rate that fits your situation.

Unlike PAYE for people earning salary or wages, deductions from schedular payments do not include levies for New Zealand's Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). You'll need to pay these at the end of the tax year to ACC.

[Paying tax in your first year in business](/income-tax/provisional-tax/paying-tax-in-your-first-year-in-business)

[Schedular payments](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

  

#### Paying tax at the end of the tax year

Whether you receive schedular payments or not, you must file an end-of-year tax return. You'll need to tell us your income and may claim certain expenses for running your business. You'll pay income tax on your net income. When filing your tax return, you'll need to give us either a:

*   Financial statements summary - IR10 form
*   set of financial statements.

[Complete a Financial statements summary - IR10](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping/financial-reporting-for-companies/standards-for-minimum-financial-reporting/complete-a-financial-statements-summary-ir10)

  

This is also when you pay ACC levies to ACC. In addition to the [Earners' levy](/api/glossary/item?id={D0B72E97-AB1D-4CE0-A5DA-DE14E7717B67})
 that people getting salary or wages pay, you'll also pay the:

When you file your tax return, you'll need to include your business industry classification (BIC) code. We send this along with your income information to ACC to calculate your levies. You can check all the information you'll need at ACC's website. Once ACC gets your information from us, they'll send you an invoice for your levies.

[Calculating your levies (Accident Compensation Corporation)](https://www.acc.co.nz/for-business/received-an-invoice/calculate-your-levies/)

  

When you file your tax return, you'll also find out whether you'll need to pay provisional tax during your second year of business. If you do need to, you'll be paying your income tax during the tax year. You can make adjustments to your provisional tax payments if your income changes.

IR56 taxpayers - earning salary or wages and need to deduct their own income tax and ACC Earners' levy

There are some situations where, even though you're being paid a salary or wage, you'll need to pay your own tax on it during the tax year. Normally, an employer deducts income tax and the [ACC Earners' levy](/api/glossary/item?id={D0B72E97-AB1D-4CE0-A5DA-DE14E7717B67})
 from employees' salaries or wages. If you're an IR56 taxpayer, you'll need to register and do this yourself.

You're an IR56 taxpayer if you're:

*   embassy staff
*   a New Zealand-based representative of an overseas company
*   a United States Antarctic Program worker
*   a part-time private domestic worker, such as a home helper, caregiver, nanny or gardener.

You'll need to make sure you're not considered self-employed or an employee.

[IR56 taxpayers](/roles/ir56-taxpayers)

  

Depending on your role at an embassy, some of your income may be exempt. You'll need to check if you qualify as diplomatic personnel.

[Diplomatic personnel](/roles/non-residents/diplomatic-personnel)

International students who are working

If you're an international student, you'll need an IRD number to work in New Zealand. You'll also need to know whether your student visa allows you to work and, if so, for how many hours. You cannot be self-employed on a student visa.

See Immigration New Zealand's website for more details about working while studying in New Zealand. Depending on your situation, you may also be able to apply for a student loan.

This method uses a rate of an asset's adjusted tax value each year. The depreciation deduction gets lower over an asset’s life.

This method is sometimes called the written down value or tax book value.

Find your asset's rate
----------------------

Use our Depreciation rate finder and calculator to find the depreciation rate and calculate depreciation for a business asset.

Or use the IR265 guide to find the depreciation rate for your asset and method and continue with these steps.

Depreciation rate finder and calculator

Use this tool to find the depreciation rate and calculate depreciation for a business asset.

[Go to this tool](https://myir.ird.govt.nz/tools/?LINK=clcdcr "Go to the Depreciation rate finder and calculator")

[General depreciation rates IR265 Aug 2024 (PDF 541KB) Download guide](/-/media/project/ir/home/documents/forms-and-guides/ir200---ir299/ir265/ir265-august-2024.pdf?modified=20240918025046&modified=20240918025046)

Example: depreciation rate for an espresso machine

If you bought a commercial espresso machine for your café business, the IR265 guide’s contents page will direct you to ‘Hotels, motels, restaurants, cafes, taverns and takeaway bars’ on page 20.

Then on page 20 you’ll see ‘coffee makers’ with a diminishing value (DV) rate of 30%.

Work out depreciation for the first year
----------------------------------------

For the first year, depreciate using the rate you’ve identified and the asset’s cost value – how much it cost you to buy.

Cost value × diminishing value rate % = amount of depreciation to claim in your income tax return

The asset’s new adjusted tax value is its cost value minus how much depreciation you’ve claimed.

If you bought the asset partway through the year, or if you do not use it 100% for business, you also need to follow steps 3 and 4.

Example: buying an espresso machine for $10,000

If you paid $10,000 for a commercial espresso machine with a diminishing value rate of 30%, work out the first year’s depreciation like this.

Cost value $10,000 × DV rate 30% = $3,000 depreciation to claim in your tax return

The remaining $7,000 is the espresso machine’s adjusted tax value to use in next year’s return.

If you bought the machine partway through the year, or if you do not use it 100% for business, you also need to follow steps 3 and 4.

Work out how many months you've used the asset
----------------------------------------------

If you bought the asset partway through the financial year, or if you started using it for business partway through the year, then you need to work out depreciation for the number of months you used it for business. Count part-months as whole months.

Use the depreciation amount from step 2.

Depreciation × months used = 12

If you used the asset in business for the full 12 months of the financial year, you do not need to do this step.

Example: buying an espresso machine partway through the year

If your financial year is 1 April to 31 March, and you bought the espresso machine on 20 May, then you’ve used it in your business for 11 months (counting part-months as whole months).

Using the depreciation amount from step 2:

Depreciation $3,000 × 11 months ÷ 12 = $2,750

Work out business use percentage
--------------------------------

If you use the asset personally throughout the year as well as for business, you also need to:

*   work out how much the asset is used for business, as a percentage
*   multiply your final depreciation amount by that percentage.

Depreciation amount × business use percentage = depreciation to claim in your return.

If you use the asset 100% for business, you do not need to do this step.

Example: espresso machine with business and personal use

If you use your espresso machine for business 70% of the time and personally 30% of the time, and you’ve worked out depreciation at $2,750 in the previous step, do this calculation.

Depreciation amount $2,750 × business use percentage 70% = $1,925 depreciation to claim in your return.

Work out depreciation for following years
-----------------------------------------

For the second year and each year afterwards, depreciate using the same rate and the asset’s new adjusted tax value. You only depreciate assets while they are used in your business.

Adjusted tax value × diminishing value rate % = amount of depreciation to claim in your tax return

If you stopped using the asset partway through the year, or if you do not use it 100% for business, you’ll need to do the extra calculations from step 3 and 4.

Example: depreciating an espresso machine over several years

Using our example from step 2, your commercial espresso machine’s adjusted tax value is $7,000, with a diminishing value rate of 30%. You use it 100% for business for the full year, so do not need to work out business use percentage or months used.

Work out the depreciation like this:

**Year 2:** Adjusted tax value $7,000 × DV rate 30% = $2,100 to claim in your tax return.  
Your new adjusted tax value is $4,900. ($7,000 − $2,100)

**Year 3:** Adjusted tax value $4,900 × DV rate 30% = $1,470 to claim in your tax return.  
Your new adjusted tax value is $3,430. ($4,900 − 1,470)

**Year 4:** Adjusted tax value $3,430 × DV rate 30% = $1,029 to claim in your tax return.  
Your new adjusted tax value is $2,401. ($3,430 − $1,029)

What happens next
-----------------

Keep working out your depreciation like this until you’ve done one of the following.

*   You’ve claimed the asset’s full cost value – its original purchase price or valuation.
*   You no longer use the asset in your business.

For more information, see our Depreciation guide for businesses – IR260.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

Work out your provisional tax
-----------------------------

The method you use to calculate your provisional tax depends on what instalment you are working out and when you file your previous year’s return.

You need to determine what method to use before you can calculate your instalments. If you are unsure, find out

[Standard option](/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)

### Return filed after a weekend or public holiday

If the provisional tax date is on a weekend or public holiday and you file your previous year’s return on the next working day, it is treated as being filed on the provisional tax instalment date. 

### Balance date

If you have a standard balance date of 31 March your 3 instalments will be due on 28 August, 15 January and 7 May. 

If you have a balance date other than 31 March, use our tax due date calculator to work out when your instalments will be due.

Work out your instalments if you have filed your previous year’s return
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have filed your previous year’s return on or before your first provisional tax instalment date add the uplift amount to your residual income tax. This will result in your provisional tax being your previous year’s residual income tax plus 5%

Divide your residual income tax plus the additional 5% by 3.

If you're a 6-monthly GST filer, divide your [residual income tax](/api/glossary/item?id={5F62E02F-5C69-4E98-B925-D9197C71558A})
 by 2. You'll pay 2 equal instalments when your GST returns are due.

Work out your instalments if you file your previous year’s return after 1 or 2 instalments
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you file your previous year’s return after the first or second instalment, some of your instalments will be based on your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%.

### Previous return filed after 1 instalment

If your return is filed after the first and on or before the second instalment dates, use the following calculations.

*   For your first instalment take your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%. Divide this amount by 3.
*   For your second instalment take your previous year’s RIT plus 5% and then times it by 2 (the number of payments remaining). Divide this amount by 3 and then subtract the amount you have paid for your first payment.
*   For your final instalment take your previous year’s RIT plus 5% and subtract the amounts paid in the first and second instalments.

### Previous return filed after two instalments

If your return is filed after the first and second instalment dates, use the following calculations.

*   For your first and second instalments take your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%. Divide this amount by 3. That will give you the amount of each instalment.
*   For your final instalment take your previous year’s RIT plus 5% and subtract the amounts paid in the first and second instalments.

Work out your instalments if you file your previous year’s return after the final instalment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your return is filed after all instalments, use the following calculations.

*   For your first and second instalments take your RIT from 2 years ago plus 10%. Divide this amount by 3. That will give you the amount of each instalment.
*   For your final instalment take what you expect your previous year’s RIT to be plus 5%. Subtract the amounts paid in the first and second instalments.

If your previous year’s RIT is different from expected, you will have paid more or less than needed.

Make payment
------------

Pay your instalments in full by the due dates. If the payments are late, you may get penalties and interest. If the provisional tax date is on a weekend or public holiday, payments made on the next working day are treated as being made on the provisional tax date.

Before you start
----------------

If you want to know the depreciation rate for an asset, you’ll need to know the date you acquired the asset and then confirm that you don’t know the depreciation rate.

And, if you want to calculate the depreciation, you’ll also need to know the:

*   cost or adjusted tax value
*   business use percentage (if less than 100%)
*   depreciation method you want to use
*   disposal date, if applicable.  
      
    

Buildings

Buildings rates were changed from the 2011-12 through to the 2020-21 income years. Refer to the Depreciation - a guide for businesses IR260 for how these apply to you.

If the asset is a non-residential building with an estimated useful life of 50 years or more, you’ll need to use the opening tax book value as at the first day of your 2020-21 income year if either of the following apply:

*   owned the building during the 2010-11 income year
*   acquired the building after the 2010-11 income year and before the 2020-21 income year.

If the asset is a building which was acquired before the 2011-12 income year and has an estimated useful life of 50 years or more, we will not be able to provide a final calculation on disposal.

Work programme confirms economic and social focus
=================================================

**08 August 2019**

The Government’s updated [tax policy work programme]([file_link,id=731] "Tax Policy Work Programme")
 continues the focus on productivity, growth and wellbeing outlined in Budget 2019, Revenue Minister Stuart Nash announced today.

The tax policy work programme (TPWP) required an update following the release of the Tax Working Group (TWG) report in April. The TPWP was last produced in May 2018.

“We are committed to the fundamental principles of a broad-based, low-rate system,” Mr Nash says. “The TWG found that on the whole, New Zealand’s tax system is working well. But we need ongoing improvements to maintain its integrity, fairness and neutrality.”

“The refreshed TPWP reflects the need to encourage productive investment and ensure the tax system remains sound. It highlights our intention to deal with land speculation and land banking. It prioritises the need to address tax barriers to investment in infrastructure and to reduce compliance costs for business.

“Our goal is to build a productive, sustainable and inclusive economy. The Wellbeing Budget signalled our plans to balance fiscal sustainability with long-term infrastructure investments and improvements in living standards.

“Our tax policy has a big role to play to encourage productivity and growth. It has a direct impact on the lives of New Zealand families and businesses. It touches on priority areas like housing supply and affordability, nationally significant infrastructure, retirement savings, charities, and making life easier for small businesses,” says Mr Nash.

The tax policy work programme is grouped under a number of workstreams reflecting the government’s priorities. Key workstreams include:

• **Land**  
Policy work will continue the review of current land rules, particularly affecting investment property and speculation, land banking, and vacant land. It will ensure that the current tax settings are fair and encourage investment where it is most productive. Enforcement of the current tax rules is also a priority.

• **Business**  
The government is focussed on ways to enhance economic performance and minimise the impact of the tax system on businesses. This includes the tax treatment of spending on innovation. It covers feasibility and blackhole expenditure, or capital spending that is not otherwise deductible.  
Work will also focus on minimising compliance cost for businesses; and lifting the economic performance of all businesses, especially smaller firms and the self-employed. It also considers employment matters in the face of the changing nature of work.

• **International**  
This work stream considers options for the digital economy and reflects growing public and government concern at the tax treatment of multinationals who earn income here. The Government has not made any decisions on whether to adopt a digital services tax. Its preference remains a multilateral approach through the OECD.

• **Infrastructure**  
Infrastructure is a key area of interest for the coalition government. After nine years of neglect, the need to fix our public assets is a long-term challenge.  
This project will consider whether the tax system has a role driving infrastructure investment. We are determined to reverse the current infrastructure deficit. This work supports our drive for a more modern, sustainable and climate resilient economy. It also contributes to unlocking the potential of our regions.

• **Exemptions and charities**  
We are driving a focus on consistency and coherence of our tax frameworks. This includes entities such as charities and businesses run for charitable purposes, as well as institutions like local authorities and state owned enterprises. It is important that income tax exemptions and concessions are effectively targeted.  
The work programme also includes a charities workstream. This work links to the charities project underway at Department of Internal Affairs.

• **Social policy**  
This workstream supports the welfare overhaul including reform of Working for Families, the student loan scheme and KiwiSaver.

Mr Nash also confirmed an update to the Generic Tax Policy Process (GTPP) as recommended by the Tax Working Group.

“The GTPP allows people to participate at the front end of tax policy development. It helps ensure policy proposals are practical and workable while minimising compliance costs. The changes allow a greater level of engagement, in particular with Maori interests. This will be good for our tax system, our economy and our communities,” Mr Nash says.

The tax policy work programme and the updated framework for engagement are available at [taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/work-programme](http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/work-programme "Tax Policy Work Programme")

Both employees and self-employed people can qualify for paid parental leave.

We look at your work record over the 52 weeks immediately before either:

*   your expected due date (person who gave birth)
*   the date you became the primary carer.

You must have worked for an average of at least 10 hours a week for any 26 weeks over the 52-week period.

Check out the example in the blue box at the bottom of the page.

### Income from various sources

When you’re checking to see if you’ve worked 10 hours in a week, you can combine:

*   (if you are an employee) the hours from all of your jobs
*   (if you are self-employed) the hours from all of your business activities.

If you work as both an employee and self-employed person, you cannot combine the hours worked in each capacity to meet the work requirements. You must meet the hours worked requirements as either an employee or self-employed person.

This means, if over the relevant period, you only worked an average of 5 hours a week as an employee and 5 hours a week as a self-employed person, you will not qualify.

### ‘Sufficient connection’ to New Zealand

Your work must have a ‘sufficient connection’ to New Zealand to be eligible for paid parental leave.

For employees, this could mean you work for a New Zealand employer and your employment relationship is controlled by New Zealand employment law.

For self-employed people, this generally means you pay income tax in New Zealand.

Working out if you have a ‘sufficient connection’ to New Zealand can be tricky, so please check with us if you’re unsure.

### You can apply early

You can apply for paid parental leave even if you haven’t met the ‘work record’ requirements yet ─ if you’ll meet them by your due date or the date the child comes into your care.

Keeping in touch hours
----------------------

If you’re an employee, you can use ‘keeping in touch hours’ to check in with work from time to time and still keep your full paid parental leave entitlement.

[Keeping in touch hours](/paid-parental-leave/qualifying/keeping-in-touch-hours)

Example: Manaia’s work record

Manaia is a young mother who works part time as a real-estate agent while she cares for her 2 children.

She’s expecting her third child, and the expected due date is 16 August. In July, she checks to see if her work record will qualify her for paid parental leave.

Her hours worked over the 52 weeks ending on 15 August are:

| Week number | Total weeks | Hours worked per week |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-18 | 18  | 15  |
| 19-31 | 13  | 0   |
| 32-46 | 15  | 15  |
| 47-52 | 6   | 5   |
| \-  | 52  | \-  |

To qualify, Manaia should look at the 26 weeks where she worked the highest number of hours.

Her work record shows at least 26 weeks where she has worked 15 hours a week (between weeks 1-18 and 32-46). Therefore, she has worked an average of 15 hours in 26 weeks.

That means Manaia will be able to receive paid parental leave payments ─ provided she meets all the other relevant requirements.

[Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010 "Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010")

Working for Families Tax Credits: Definition of "family scheme income"
======================================================================

2010 amendment broadens the definition of 'family scheme income' used to determine entitlements to Working for Families Tax Credits.

_Sections MB 1, MB 7 to MB 13, YA 1, schedule 38 of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 31C and 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994_

The definition of "family scheme income" in the Income Tax Act 2007, which is used for determining entitlements to Working for Families (WFF) tax credits, has been broadened. The amendments are intended to improve the fairness and integrity of WFF by, for example, countering arrangements that have the effect of inflating entitlements beyond what people's true economic circumstances justify, and filling in gaps in the definition of "family scheme income".

This broader definition of "family scheme income" will also apply to people with dependent children who apply for the community services card. The Government has also announced that the broader definition will be used in the parental income test for student allowances.

### Background

In Budget 2010, the Government announced that the integrity of certain social assistance programmes, namely WFF, student allowances and the community services card, would be improved.

As a first step to addressing integrity concerns around these social assistance programmes, the Government excluded investment losses such as rental losses for the purpose of determining WFF tax credits. This was included in the Taxation (Budget Measures) Act 2010.

The current definition of "family scheme income" is based on "net income" for income tax purposes, with certain adjustments. The legislation broadens the definition of "family scheme income" in the Income Tax Act 2007 to more closely reflect the income available for the family's day-to-day living needs. This ensures the rules support the original intention of targeting assistance to people in genuine need.

Proposals to broaden the definition of family scheme income were set out in an officials' issue paper _Social assistance integrity: defining family income_ in August 2010.

The new legislation was added to the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Bill by Supplementary Order Paper No. 187.

### Key features

The definition of "family scheme income" in the Income Tax Act 2007 has been amended to include the following additional types of income:

*   trust income (including attributed income from trust-controlled companies) that is attributed to a person who is a settlor of the trust;
*   fringe benefits that are attributable fringe benefits if received by a company employee who, with their associates, controls the company;
*   passive income such as interest and dividends over $500 derived by dependent children;
*   income from a portfolio investment entity (PIE) that is not sufficiently locked in until retirement;
*   foreign-sourced income of non-resident spouses;
*   tax-exempt salary and wages;
*   main income equalisation scheme deposits;
*   50% of non-taxable private pensions and annuities; and
*   other payments (besides those already included in the definition of family scheme income) used to replace income or to meet a family's living expenses if the total exceeds $5,000 a year per family.

The broader definition of family scheme income applies when determining entitlements for WFF tax credits. This change automatically flows through to people with dependent children who apply for the community services card because the definition of family scheme income also applies for this purpose. The broader definition will also be used in the parental income test for student allowances.

### Application dates

The broader definition of "family scheme income" applies for WFF tax credits and community services cards for those with dependent children from 1 April 2011.

For the parental income test for student allowances, an application date will be set separately by Order in Council.

### Detailed analysis

"Net income" as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 is used as the basis for calculating "family scheme income". Family scheme income, which is used to determine entitlements for WFF tax credits, is defined to include a number of adjustments to a person's net income.

Details of the additional types of income that will be included in family scheme income are discussed below.

#### _Trust income (section MB 7)_

Trustee income distributed to beneficiaries of the trust tax-free is not included in the taxable income of beneficiaries. Consequently, under the previous rules, the amount of distributed trustee income was not included in family scheme income even though it could have been available to meet a family's living expenses. This had the effect of increasing their WFF tax credit entitlements.

The new rule includes the net income of a trust (less beneficiary income) in a person's family scheme income if they are a settlor of the trust. Beneficiary income received by the person is already included in their family scheme income. The new rule also includes the net income of trust-controlled companies.

##### _Scope of attribution rule_

The rule attributes the net income of a trust to a person who is a settlor of the trust.

A person is treated as a settlor if they meet the definition of "settlor" in sections HC 27 and HC 28. This means that the term "settlor" has a wide meaning and is defined broadly as a person who transfers value to a trust. For example, the extended definition of settlor in section HC 28 provides that:

*   when a company makes a settlement, any shareholder with an interest of 10% or more in that company is treated as a settlor in relation to that settlement as well as the company itself;
*   when a trustee of a trust (the first trust) settles another trust (the second trust), the settlor of the second trust is treated as including any person who is a settlor of the first trust; and
*   when a person has any rights or powers in relation to a trustee or settlor of a trust which enables the person to require the trustee to treat them (or a nominee) as a beneficiary of the trust, the person is treated as a settlor of that trust.

The definition of settlor, in conjunction with the nominee look-through rule in section YB 21, does not include professional advisors acting on behalf of clients and other persons such as friends and family members who simply allow their name to be listed as the settlor on a trust deed. The main focus of the definition is on persons who provide the trust property. It is therefore the client of the professional advisor, or the person the friend or family member is acting for, who would be treated as the settlor.

Section MB 7 also excludes persons who provide personal services for free in relation to a trust's administration or the maintenance of the trust's property from the definition of settlor. For example, if a person undertakes general repairs and maintenance work on the trust's assets for free, such as repainting a dwelling owned by the trust, these services will not be treated as a settlement for the purposes of these rules.

If there is more than one settlor for a trust, the trust income is attributed to the settlors of the trust proportionally based on the number of settlors. However, if a settlor arranges for friends or relatives to be settlors to artificially dilute the attribution rule, the original settlor is treated as the sole settlor of the trust. This is a result of the existing settlor definition (including the nominee look-through rule) and the anti-avoidance rule.

The focus of the attribution rule is on closely held situations where integrity concerns can arise. The following trusts have therefore been excluded from the trust income rule:

*   charitable trusts that are registered as a charitable entity under the Charities Act 2005;
*   trust settlements for the benefit only of local authorities;
*   funeral trusts under section CW 45;
*   trustees for registered superannuation schemes; and
*   trusts where neither the settlor nor any member of the settlor's family can be a beneficiary without a Court order.

##### _Calculation of amount attributed_

Under the rule, the amount of trust income included in family scheme income is calculated according to the following formula:

|     |
| --- |
| trustee + company − dividends |
| settlor number |

"Trustee" in the formula represents the net income of the trust less income distributed as beneficiary income. This amount cannot be less than zero. This income includes income of a trust earned directly by the trust carrying on a business or receiving investment income such as dividends or interest.

"Company" in the formula represents the net income of a trust-controlled company. A trust-controlled company is defined as a company in which the trustees and their associates hold 50% or more of the voting interests or market value interests (if there is a market value circumstance). The amount of income of the trust-controlled company that is attributed is calculated by multiplying the company's net income for the income year by the trust's voting interests (or market value interests) in the company.

The attribution of a company's net income is restricted to trust-controlled companies only. For example, if a trust is a shareholder in a widely held company, only the dividends from that company are included in trust income.

"Dividends" in the formula represents the total amount of dividends that are derived by the trust from a trust-controlled company. This amount cannot be greater than the net income of the company. Dividends are subtracted in the formula because they are already included as a part of the trust income.

**Example: Application of attribution rule to single company**

![Example: Application of attribution rule to single company](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/2/b/2b0a9b8046335cd7855ebf7747109566/leg-2010-wfftc-example1.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203148&hash=4C179AA9986EA3EEACBA8854835E3C71)

In this example, John is the sole settlor of Family Trust. Family Company is wholly owned by Family Trust. Family Company's net income is $200,000 and it pays an imputed dividend of $100,000 to Family Trust. Family Trust also earns income of $30,000 from investments. Family Trust distributes $10,000 as beneficiary income to John's family.

John's family scheme income for the income year is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trustee | $100,000 dividend + $30,000 debt investment income  <br>less $10,000 beneficiary income  <br>\= $120,000 |
| Company | $200,000 net income |
| Dividend | $100,000 |

|     |
| --- |
| trustee + company − dividends |
| settlor number |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \=  | $120,000 + $200,000 − $100,000 |
| 1   |

**Total** = $220,000

Therefore, $220,000 is included in John's family scheme income for the income year.

**Example: Application of attribution rule when dividend exceeds net income**

![Example: Application of attribution rule when dividend exceeds net income](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/5/a/5a6de68046335d718566bf7747109566/leg-2010-wfftc-example2.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203149&hash=D134A2776FE76369BB89EDCCCF8500D9)

In this example, Murray is a sole settlor of the Family Trust. Family Company is wholly owned by Family Trust.

Family Company has $70,000 net income and it pays an imputed dividend of $120,000 to Family Trust. Murray's family scheme income for the income year is calculated as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trustee | $120,000 dividend |
| Company | $70,000 net income |
| Dividend | $70,000 (capped) |

|     |
| --- |
| trustee + company − dividends |
| settlor number |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \=  | $120,000 + $70,000 − $70,000 |
| 1   |

**Total** = $120,000

Therefore, $120,000 is included in Murray's family scheme income for the income year.

If there is more than one trust-controlled company, the "net income" of each company is calculated separately and then added together. This means that if one of the trust-controlled companies has a "net loss", the amount cannot be offset against the net income of another company (section BC 4(3) provides that if a person has a net loss, their net income for the year is zero).

**Example: Application of attribution rule to multiple companies**

![Example: Application of attribution rule to multiple companies](/-/media/project/ir/tt/resources/4/9/4933e10046335e28856dbf7747109566/leg-2010-wfftc-example3.jpg?sc_lang=en&modified=20200318203148&hash=AE37EC761DE9620127C1A10CEE28BB3D)

In this example, Lisa is a sole settlor of the Family Trust. Company A and B are wholly owned by Family Trust.

Company A has $100,000 net income; it pays no dividend to Family Trust. Company B has a $50,000 net loss. Family Trust also earns income of $10,000 from investments. Lisa's family scheme income for the income year is calculated as shown below:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trustee | $10,000 debt investment income |
| Company | $100,000 (Company A's net income) + $0 (B's net loss) |
| Dividend | $0 (Company A) + $0 (Company B) |

|     |
| --- |
| trustee + company − dividends |
| settlor number |

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| \=  | $10,000 + $100,000 − $0 |
| 1   |

**Total** = $110,000

Therefore, $110,000 is included in Lisa's family scheme income for the income year.

#### _Fringe benefits (section MB 8)_

Under the previous rules, fringe benefits were not included in family scheme income because they are taxed to the employer rather than included in the employee's taxable income.

New section MB 8 includes fringe benefits in a person's family scheme income if it is received by a shareholder-employee of a company. A person is treated as a shareholder-employee of a company if they and their associates hold 50% or more of the voting interests or market value interests (if a market value circumstance exists) in the company. The inclusion of interests held by associates means this rule applies to an individual who settles a family trust which owns a company of which the individual is an employee. The reason for limiting this rule to shareholder-employees as defined is because they can influence the nature of fringe benefits they receive as part of their employment.

The rule is also limited to include only attributable fringe benefits in a person's family scheme income. Attributable fringe benefits are significant fringe benefits, many of which are easily substitutable for cash. Such benefits are attributable to individual employees for the purposes of the fringe benefit tax rules. Section RD 47 provides a list of attributable fringe benefits which are:

*   motor vehicles;
*   low-interest employee loans;
*   subsidised transport (when the employer is in the business of transporting the public) above a threshold of $1,000 per annum;
*   contributions to sickness, accident or death funds (and funeral trusts) above a threshold of $1,000 per annum;
*   payments to insurance schemes above a threshold of $1,000 per annum;
*   employer contributions to superannuation schemes as defined in the Income Tax Act 2007 above a threshold of $1,000 per annum (this excludes superannuation schemes registered under the Superannuation Schemes Act 1989 and the KiwiSaver Act 2006); and
*   undefined benefits above a threshold of $2,000 per employee per annum.

The rule also provides that the amount of the fringe benefit to be included in a person's family scheme income is equivalent to the gross cash value of the fringe benefit, comprising:

*   the taxable value of the fringe benefit that the company must attribute to the person under sections RD 47 to RD 49 for the income year; and
*   the company's fringe benefit liability in relation to the person's fringe benefit under section RD 50 (employer's liability for attributed benefits) for the income year.

**Example**

Chris is an employee of a company controlled by a trust which he settled. Chris is married and has three children under 13 years of age. His partner is not in paid employment. Chris receives a salary of $70,000 and is provided with a motor vehicle (with a cost price of $60,000 including GST) which is available at all times for private use.

Under the previous definition of family scheme income, Chris's situation would have been as follows:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cash salary | $70,000 |
| WFF income | $70,000 |
| WFF tax credits | $7,427 ($143 per week) |

Under the new rule, his situation becomes:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Cash salary | $70,000 |
| Attributed income from fringe benefit  <br>(motor vehicle) | $17,909 |
| WFF income | $87,909 |
| WFF tax credits | $3,846 ($74 per week) |

From 1 April 2011, Chris's entitlement to WFF tax credits decreases by $3,581 for the year.

#### _Passive income derived by dependent children (section MB 11)_

New section MB 11 includes passive income over $500 per child in a person's family scheme income. Parents are able to allocate income directly to their children through family trusts and companies or place their investments directly under their children's names. This income can then be used to meet the family's living expenses.

The rule includes in a person's family scheme income amounts derived by a dependent child which consists of:

*   resident passive income (such as interest, dividends, and taxable Māori authority distributions);
*   a royalty;
*   rent;
*   certain beneficiary income;
*   attributed income from a portfolio investment entity that is not a superannuation fund or retirement savings scheme; and
*   a distribution from a listed portfolio investment entity.

Beneficiary income of dependent children is counted even though the beneficiary income of a person who is under 16 years old is taxed as trustee income. However, beneficiary income that is an amount referred to in section HC 35(4)(b)(i), (ii) and (v) is not counted. These exceptions relate to trusts such as testamentary trusts, or trusts established by a Court order or for child disability.

A minimum threshold of $500 has been introduced to exclude modest amounts of passive income earned by children, and which is unlikely to be put towards the family's living expenses.

#### _Income from unlocked portfolio investment entities (section MB 1(5))_

New section MB 1(5) includes income from unlocked portfolio investment entities (PIEs) in a person's family scheme income. Unlocked PIEs include all PIEs other than superannuation schemes that are registered with the Government Actuary, such as KiwiSaver schemes or retirement savings schemes. These schemes are excluded on the basis that the income is sufficiently locked-in until a person's retirement.

The rationale for including unlocked PIE income is because this income can be accessed by investors at any time and is readily available to meet a family's living expenses. Examples of unlocked PIEs include cash PIEs, which are similar to on-call bank accounts, and listed PIEs.

Consequential to this change, sections 31C and 57B of the Tax Administration Act 1994 have been amended to bring forward the notification and return requirement dates for unlocked PIEs by one month from 30 June to 31 May.

#### _Non-residents' foreign-sourced income (section MB 12)_

New section MB 12 includes the foreign-sourced income of a person's non-resident spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner in the person's family scheme income.

Under the previous rules, only the New Zealand-sourced income of a non-resident was included in family scheme income. This is despite the offshore income being available and often used to support the children resident in New Zealand.

This rule means that a non-resident parent's income is included in family scheme income. It is intended to ensure equitable treatment with families where both spouses live in New Zealand where both New Zealand and overseas income is taken into account.

Section MB 1(2) already includes any maintenance payments made by a non-resident parent to the resident parent in family scheme income if the parents are separated.

#### _Exempt income - salary or wages (section MB 1(2)(b) and schedule 38)_

Section MB 1(2) has been amended to include an amount of salary or wages that is exempt from income tax under specific international agreements in a person's family scheme income. Previously, this income was not included in family scheme income as it was exempt from income tax, even though it is available to meet the family's living expenses. An example of these types of income is salaries received by employees of international organisations such as the United Nations or the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

New schedule 38 lists Acts that exempt salary or wages under specific international agreements. They are:

*   the Arbitration (International Investment Disputes) Act 1979;
*   the Consular Privileges and Immunities Act 1971;
*   the Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities Act 1968;
*   the International Finance Agreements Act 1961; and
*   the Pitcairn Trials Act 2002.

Salary or wages that are exempt from income tax under these Acts, or under a regulation or Order in Council made under these Acts, are included in a person's family scheme income.

#### _Main income equalisation scheme deposits (sections MB 1(5D) and MB 9)_

New section MB 9 includes the amount of deposits to main income equalisation accounts in a person's family scheme income.

The main income equalisation scheme is intended to allow persons carrying on an agricultural, fishing or forestry business to smooth their incomes when there are large fluctuations of income over several years. Currently, section DQ 1 allows a deduction for a deposit made to a main income equalisation account for income tax purposes. Under the previous rules, the reduction in a person's net income resulting from deposits in these schemes could also reduce their family scheme income.

The rule includes deposits to these schemes made on or after 1 April 2011 in a person's family scheme income if the deposit was for a business of:

*   the person;
*   a company that meets the requirements of section MB 4;
*   a trustee of a trust that meets the requirements of section MB 7; or
*   a company controlled by a trust referred to above.

Regardless of who makes the deposits to these schemes, the amount of deposit is included in a person's family scheme income.

To prevent double counting, new section MB 1(5D) excludes refunds (excluding interest payable under section EH 6) from main income equalisation accounts (under sections EH 8 to EH 26) from a person's family scheme income.

This amendment does not apply to deposits made to the adverse event income equalisation scheme and the thinning operations income equalisation scheme.

#### _Pensions and annuities (section MB 10)_

New section MB 10 includes 50% of distributed non-taxable private pensions and annuities in a person's family scheme income. This would cover a pension from a superannuation fund that is a defined benefit scheme such as the Government Superannuation Fund or an annuity from a New Zealand-resident life insurer. It would not cover a lump-sum payment from a defined contribution scheme, such as KiwiSaver. Only 50% of pensions and annuities is included to reflect that some portion of these payments represents the return of the original capital investment rather than income.

#### _Other payments (section MB 13)_

New section MB 13 includes certain other payments that a person may receive (other than those already included or specifically excluded) in a person's family scheme income.

Under the previous rules, section MB 1(6) stated that the Commissioner must have regard to income from all sources known to the Commissioner in calculating family scheme income. There was some uncertainty over what section MB 1(6) actually captured. New section MB 13 clarifies this.

"Other payments" include the value of payments paid or provided to the person from any source and used by the person to:

*   meet usual living expenses of the person or the person's family; or
*   replace lost or diminished income of the person or the person's family.

What constitutes "usual living expenses" will depend on the particular circumstances of the person or the person's family.

Examples of other payments include:

*   distributions of trust income from a trust where the person is not the settlor of the trust;
*   regular cash payments from family members to supplement income;
*   soft loans which are non-commercial loans with a discounted interest rate and/or lenient options for repayment; they are usually between related parties such as family members or family-controlled entities;
*   payments from an income-related insurance policy, other than life insurance, to cover loss of employment income;
*   payments received to meet living costs such as rent, servicing a mortgage, food, power and clothing or to pay hire purchase accounts, or insurance payments; or
*   payments of expenses by a third person, such as paying utility bills directly.

Any payments with specific purposes other than usual living expense purposes, or any capital payments are excluded. New section MB 13(2) specifically excludes the following types of payments and benefits:

*   a loan under ordinary commercial terms and conditions;
*   an amount that is proceeds of the disposal of property and not assessable income of the person disposing of the property;
*   a payment on behalf of the person by a local authority or public authority;
*   a forgiveness of debt by a public authority;
*   a charitable distribution from a charitable entity registered under the Charities Act 2005;
*   an educational scholarship;
*   a student loan under the Student Loan Scheme Act 1992;
*   a grant for the payment of expenses relating to medical treatment or a funeral;
*   a payment under an insurance contract, other than a payment for a loss of income;
*   compensation for a loss other than a loss of income;
*   lump sum compensation under the Accident Compensation Act 2001;
*   a monetary benefit under the Social Security Act 1964 that is exempt income;
*   a pension or allowance under the War Pensions Act 1954 that is exempt income;
*   a payment that is exempt income under section CW 33(1)(c), (e), or (f) (allowances and benefits);
*   an amount that is declared not to be income for the purposes of the Social Security Act 1964 by a regulation under section 132 of that Act;
*   an amount included in the family scheme income of the person under another section; and
*   an amount expressly excluded from the family scheme income of the person under another section.

Given there are separate rules including company income in closely held situations in family scheme income, company drawings are not counted under this category.

A threshold of $5,000 year has been introduced to exclude small payments received in a year. If the value of payments exceeds $5,000 for the income year, the whole amount is included in a person's family scheme income.

Working for Families tax credits provisions
===========================================

2007 legislative amendments following the re-naming of family assistance to Working for Families Tax Credits, and other remedial amendments.

**_Section GC 28, subpart KD and section MD 1 of the Income Tax Act 2004; sections GB 44, LA 7, LB 4 and subparts MA to MF and MZ of the Income Tax Act 2007; sections 80E, 80KD, 80KK, 80KN to 80KR, 80KU, 80KW, 84 and 85G of the Tax Administration Act 1994_**

The re-naming of family assistance to Working for Families Tax Credits and name changes for some of the component credits has required a large number of remedial amendments in the Revenue Acts, as well as consequential amendments in other legislation not administered by Inland Revenue.

Three other remedial amendments were necessary to:

*   introduce modifications to the formula for calculating the parental tax credit - to be used in specific circumstances;
*   clarify the meaning of "net family scheme income" in the Income Tax Act 2007, to ensure that the minimum family tax credit is calculated from a base of after-tax income in all cases; and
*   ensure that the end-of-year calculation formula when there have been 53 weekly or 27 fortnightly interim instalments applies, regardless of whether those interim instalments have been paid by Inland Revenue or by the Ministry of Social Development.

### Name change for Tax Credits for Families

#### Key features

The name changes to the tax credits for families are as set out in the following table:

| **Former names** | **Names applying from 1 April 2007** |
| --- | --- |
| Family Assistance | Working for Families Tax Credit |
| Family support | family tax credit |
|     |     |
| In-work payment | in-work tax credit |
| Parental tax credit | parental tax credit |
| Family tax credit | minimum family tax credit |

The grouping of the credits as "family support" and "family plus" has been removed.

The names have been replaced as shown in the table whenever they occur in subpart KD of the Income TaxAct 2004 and in subparts MA to MF and MZ of theIncome Tax Act 2007, and elsewhere as cross-references in:

*   the Income Tax Act 2004;
*   the Tax Administration Act 1994;
*   the Housing Restructuring and Tenancy Matters Act1992;
*   the Rates Rebate Act 1973;
*   the Social Security Act 1964;
*   the Health Entitlement Cards Regulations 1993;
*   the Social Security (Temporary Additional Support) Regulations 2005; and
*   the Student Allowances Regulations 1998.

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004, other than the amendments to subpart KD, are in Part 1 while the amendments to the Tax Administration Act 1994 are in Part 2. The amendments to other Acts, including the Income Tax Act 2007 and Regulations are in Part 3 and Schedule 2, and the amendments to subpart KD of the Income Tax Act 2004 are in Schedule 1.

**Application date**

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2004 apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2007.

The amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007 apply from 1 April 2008 when that Act comes into force.

### Parental tax credit

The parental tax credit is paid for a maximum of 56 days immediately following the birth of a child. Parents can choose to receive it as a lump sum. However, when a child is born in the last 56 days of the tax year and parents choose to receive a lump sum, the calculation formula, because it spans two tax years, formerly conceded entitlement at levels of income that should extinguish entitlement.

#### Key feature

New section MD 16 of the Income Tax Act 2007 introduces the formula to be used when parents choose a lump sum payment of the parental tax credit for a birth that has occurred within the last 56 days of the tax year.

#### Application date

The new section applies from the tax year beginning 1April 2008.

### Net family scheme income

The minimum family tax credit tops up after-tax income to an annually specified amount. Former provisions had the effect of assuming that tax had been paid for certain types of income when it had not and vice versa for certain other items of income.

The new provision for "net family scheme income" ensures that the minimum family tax credit is calculated from a base of after-tax income in all cases.

#### Key features

New section ME 3 in the Income Tax Act 2007 provides a definition of "net family scheme income" that applies for the purpose of subpart ME, which contains the rules for the minimum family tax credit.

#### Application date

The new section applies from the tax year beginning 1April 2008.

### Write-off of additional instalment in some years

Because a year cannot be divided evenly into weeks or fortnights, there are some years in which more than 26 fortnightly or 52 weekly instalments fall within the tax year.

The Income Tax Act already provides for the automatic write-off of a 27th fortnightly instalment paid by Inland Revenue or a 53rd weekly instalment paid by the Ministry of Social Development. The amendments provide for the automatic write-off of a 53rd interim weekly instalment paid by Inland Revenue or a 27th interim fortnightly instalment paid by the Ministry of Social Development in the years in which those events occur, to ensure no-one is disadvantaged.

#### Key features

The amendments to sections 80KW(2)(b) and 80KW(4)(a)(ii) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 will ensure that the end-of-year calculation formula when there have been 53 weekly or 27 fortnightly interim instalments applies regardless of whether those interim instalments have been paid by Inland Revenue or by the Ministry of Social Development.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from the tax year beginning 1 April 2008.

[Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-annual-rates-and-budget-measures-act-2011 "Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011")

Working for Families tax credits
================================

The Act introduces amendments affecting the calculation of Working for Families tax credits including abatement rates and thresholds. Applies 1 Apr 2012.

_**Sections MD 13 and MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007**_

The Taxation (Annual Rates and Budget Measures) Act 2011 introduced a number of amendments that affect the calculation of Working for Families (WFF) tax credits.

There are three parts to the amendments to the WFF tax credits:

*   The rate at which WFF tax credits are abated will increase by 1.25 percentage points every time the Family Tax Credit (FTC) amounts are increased for inflation, until the abatement rate reaches 25%. The first abatement rate increase will occur on 1 April 2012 when the first inflation increase under section MF 7(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007 applies.
*   The threshold at which WFF tax credits begin to abate will decrease from $36,827 to $36,350 on 1 April 2012. The threshold will continue to decrease by $450 each subsequent time the FTC amounts are increased for inflation, until the threshold reaches $35,000.
*   The FTC amounts for children aged 16 and over will no longer be increased for inflation until the FTC amounts for the eldest child under 16 or for subsequent children aged 13 to 15 equals the respective 16 and over amounts. At this point subsequent increases for inflation will apply.

### Background

Under the previous rules, WFF tax credits (excluding the Minimum Family Tax Credit) abated at the rate of 20 cents in the dollar from an abatement threshold of $36,827. When a person's annual income exceeds this threshold, the WFF tax credits are abated - FTC is abated first, followed by the In-Work Tax Credit and then the Parental Tax Credit.

The amounts of FTC prescribed in section MD 3(4) of the Income Tax Act 2007 are adjusted for inflation. The inflation adjustment ensures that the real value of assistance is maintained over time. The adjustment occurs once the cumulative increase in the Consumers Price Index (CPI) reaches 5% from the last adjustment. The last adjustment was on 1 October 2008.

The next inflation adjustment will occur on 1 April 2012 because 5% cumulative inflation was breached in December 2010. The size of the adjustment will not be known until the September 2011 CPI is published, which is used for calculating the amount by which the FTC is indexed. The amount will be the cumulative CPI from September 2008 to September 2011, and will exclude the 2.02% increase in FTC on 1 October 2010, which is consistent with sections MF 7(1), (2) and (2B) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

### Key features

The policy objective of the WFF amendments is to reduce the fiscal costs of the scheme while protecting amounts of tax credits for lower income earners, and minimising the effects on work incentives.

The end result is for WFF tax credits to abate at a rate of 25% from a threshold of $35,000, with one amount of FTC for the eldest child and two amounts of FTC for subsequent children, for 0-12 years and 13 and over.

This result is achieved by staggering the increase in the abatement rate, the decrease in the abatement threshold and the alignment of amounts of FTC over time so the impact on families is gradual, while still generating fiscal savings.

Section MD 13(3)(a) has been amended so that:

*   in the first inflation adjustment round on 1 April 2012, the abatement rate increases from 20% to 21.25% and the abatement threshold decreases from $36,827 to $36,350;
*   in the second inflation adjustment round, the abatement rate increases from 21.25% to 22.5% and the abatement threshold decreases from $36,350 to $35,900;
*   in the third inflation adjustment round, the abatement rate increases from 22.5% to 23.75% and the abatement threshold decreases from $35,900 to $35,450; and
*   in the fourth inflation adjustment round, the abatement rate increases from 23.75% to 25% and the abatement threshold decreases from $35,450 to $35,000.

These changes to the abatement rate and threshold mean that entitlements to WFF tax credits reduce faster and sooner as income increases. These changes will come into force when inflation adjustment rounds are required by section MF 7(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007.

Section MF 7(1)(a) has been amended so that the prescribed FTC amounts for children 16 years and over in sections MD 3(4)(a)(ii) and (b)(iii) are no longer adjusted for inflation until FTC amounts for the eldest child under 16 or for subsequent children aged 13 to 15, equals the respective 16-year and over amount. At this point the older and younger child amounts are aligned by Order in Council and subsequent increases for inflation apply. This change simplifies the FTC, leaving one rate (rather than two) for a first child and two rates (rather than three) for subsequent children.

### Application dates

The amendments come into force at the same time as the inflation adjustment rounds required by section MF 7(2) of the Income Tax Act 2007. The first inflation adjustment round will take effect on 1 April 2012.

Working for family tax credits
==============================

2008 legislation increases the Working for Families tax credit amounts and abatement thresholds to reflect rises in the Consumer Price Index.

**_Sections MD 3(4), MD 13(3), ME 3(3) MF 4B and 4C, MF 7(2)(a) and Schedule 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007._**

Working for Families tax credit amounts and abatement thresholds have been increased to reflect rises in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

### Background

The Taxation (Personal Tax Cuts, Annual Rates, and Remedial Matters) Act 2008 makes changes to the Working for Families tax credit package to take account of movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes increase the family tax credit entitlement amounts and raise the income threshold above which the family tax credit, in work tax credit and the parental tax credit begin to abate.

The law relating to Working for Families tax credits requires that the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts are adjusted for inflation, as measured by the CPI, from the beginning of the tax year following the CPI movement cumulatively reaching 5% after 1 April 2007. This will occur in the September 2008 quarter, and the change would usually apply from the following 1 April, being 1 April 2009. However, it has been brought forward so that the new income threshold and family tax credit entitlement amounts will apply from 1 :October 2008.

### Key features

*   Family tax credit entitlement amounts have been increased.
*   The abatement threshold above which the Working for Families tax credits (other than the minimum family tax credit) abate has been increased.
*   The provision that allows future indexation of the threshold and the tax credit entitlement has been amended so that the next adjustment will be when the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% after 1 October 2008.

### Application date

These changes will apply from 1 October 2008.

### Detailed analysis

#### _New family tax credit entitlement amounts (sections MD 3(4), MF 4B and 4C))_

A Working for Families tax credit entitlement is calculated on the basis of a full tax year (1April - 31 March). However, having the new entitlement amounts applying from 1October 2008 will result in two sets of entitlement amounts applying during the 2008-09 tax year. The amounts before and after 1 October are outlined (shaded) in the table below. New sections MF 4B and 4C provide that these entitlement amounts will be used to calculate a family's entitlement if it wants its family tax credit entitlement paid in instalments during the year (either weekly or fortnightly).

Also outlined in the table are composite entitlement amounts that will apply for the whole of the 2008-09 year and reflect the combination of the entitlement amounts before and after 1 October. These composite amounts will be used by Inland Revenue to calculate entitlements if a family waits until the end of the year to receive its family tax credit, or to square up a family's entitlement if it has received family tax credit instalments during the year. These changes have been made by amending section MD3(4).

**Family tax credit** **amounts** **for the 2008-09 year**

| Children | Current amount  <br>1 April 2008  <br>($) | New amount  <br>1 October 2008 ($) | Composite amount for the 2008-09 year ($) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First child if under 16  <br>First child if 16 or over  <br>Subsequent child if under 13  <br>Subsequent child if 13 to 15  <br>Subsequent child if 16 or over | 4,264  <br>4,940  <br>2,964  <br>3,380  <br>4,420 | 4,487  <br>5,198  <br>3,119  <br>3,557  <br>4,651 | 4,376  <br>5,069  <br>3,042  <br>3,469  <br>4,536 |

How much a family will gain from these changes depends on the number and age of children in the family and whether the family earns above the income abatement threshold.

The new entitlement amounts from 1 October 2008 also apply for the 2009-10 and subsequent years.

#### _Abatement threshold (section MD 13(3) and schedule 31)_

In addition, the income threshold above which the family tax credit, in work tax credit and parental tax credit abate has been raised from 1 October 2008 to take account of inflation. The previous abatement threshold was $35,000, and from 1 October 2008 it increases to $36,827. As with the changes to the family tax credit entitlement amounts, changing the abatement threshold part-way through the year (1 October) will result in a composite threshold applying for the 2008-09 year. The composite threshold for this year will be $35,914. These changes have been made by amending section MD 13(3).

For the 2009-10 and subsequent years, the threshold amount will be $36,827.

Schedule 31 of the Income Tax Act 2007 has also been amended to reflect the new abatement threshold of $36,827. This schedule is used to calculate weekly or fortnightly instalments of the Working for Families tax credits based on bands of estimated annual family income.

#### _Calculation of net family scheme income (section ME 3(3))_

The definition of "adjusted liability"; in the formula for calculating net family scheme income in section ME 3(3)(c) has been amended by repealing subparagraph (ii) as a consequence of the repeal of the low income rebate. Net family scheme income is a component of the formula for calculating the minimum family tax credit.

#### _Future indexation (section MF 7(2)(a))_

Section MF 7 of the Income Tax Act 2007 previously required the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts to be adjusted for inflation, by Order in Council, when the CPI movement cumulatively reached 5% after 1 April 2007. Because the CPI indexation has been brought forward, section MF 7 has been changed so that the abatement threshold and the family tax credit entitlement amounts are adjusted for inflation when the CPI movement cumulatively reaches 5% after 1October 2008.

新西兰税务体系的运作方式
------------

新西兰的税务体系可能与您习惯的体系有所不同。除了在新西兰工作和留学，请确保您知道其他类型的收入应如何纳税。

[了解新西兰的税务体系](/simplified-chinese/new-zealand-tax-system)

您需要取得IRD税号
----------

如果您在新西兰工作赚取收入，便需要税务识别号码——[IRD税号](/api/glossary/item?id={394B9B6C-A05C-41C2-BEFF-24AD703E1C4D})
。事实上，大部分的收入来源都要求您具有IRD税号。如果您有IRD税号，给您支付薪资的个人或公司即可从您的收入中扣除正确的税款。

您可以等到抵达新西兰后，再申请IRD税号。在签证旅行日期到期前申请“新西兰新入境旅客”是一个更为快捷的选择，但有些人倾向于从境外提前申请IRD税号。如果您要在海外申请IRD税号，请注意您需要具备以下两项中的任意一项：

*   可正常使用的新西兰银行账户
*   [客户尽职调查 - IR997](/api/glossary/item?id={C8EB7273-FB2B-490B-8E6A-A022B27ED505})
    表格。

如果您以“新西兰新入境旅客”的身份申请，并且持有学生签证或工作签证，您仍需满足以下要求中的一项。如果您持有新西兰居民签证或澳大利亚护照，在以新入境旅客的身份申请时，则无需满足这些要求。

如果您在签证旅行日期过期后才申请，则需要以“新西兰居住者，非新入境旅客”的身份申请。考虑到此时间限制，建议您一抵达新西兰就尽快申请。

赚取雇主支付的工资或薪水

如果您赚取薪水或工资，您的雇主有责任从您的工资中扣除所得税，并在纳税年度内转给IRD。您需要将以下信息提供给您的雇主：

*   您的IRD税号
*   正确的税务代码。

当您收取工资时，您的雇主必须给您一张工资单，显示您取得的工资以及雇主扣除的任何款项。您的雇主会扣除“PAYE”，即“所得预扣税”。它包含：

*   您需缴纳的所得税
*   意外伤害保险局 (ACC) [对工资所得者征收的保险费用](/api/glossary/item?id={B2294C57-D9F8-4CB3-A40A-8C9DB62A2540})
    。

在新西兰，任何在事故中受伤的人都由ACC保险方案承保，该保险方案由新西兰政府所有和运营。您可以在ACC网站上查询当前的工资所得者保险费率。

从自雇经营中赚取收入

自雇人士自行开展业务并赚取收入。自雇人士有多种称谓，例如：

*   承包人
*   自由职业者
*   个体商
*   顾问
*   小型企业。

如果您的收入来自自雇经营，您无需成立正式的公司。不过，您必须做到以下几点：

*   使用您个人的IRD税号支付所得税
*   提交纳税申报表以缴纳净利润的所得税。

如果您通过合伙经营赚取收入，您仍属于自雇人士。然而，您需要提交其它文件，并考虑与您的情况相关的其他事项。

[合伙经营所得税](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-partnerships)

  

如果您决定成立一家公司，则应通过完全不同的流程缴纳所得税。您可以在business.govt.nz网站上找出与您情况相符的企业类型。

[关于新西兰商业号码 (NZBN)](https://www.nzbn.govt.nz/whats-an-nzbn/about/)

  

#### 自雇人士的其他责任

如果您雇用员工，则须要向IRD登记雇主身份。雇佣员工期间，您务必要履行您的税务职责。这包括从员工的工资或薪水中扣除预扣所得税 (PAYE) 并在纳税年度内将其转给IRD。

[雇主](/roles/employers)

  

在任何为期12个月的时段内，如果您从[应纳税活动](/api/glossary/item?id={20527F17-D96C-4DA1-BD56-75DB0B2CF2D1})

，则须注册新西兰的商品及服务税 (GST)。您需向您的客户收取GST，并在纳税年度内将其转给IRD。

[商品及服务税 (GST)](/gst)

  

作为企业经营者，您必须记录收据、发票和其他类型的资料。您必须将这些记录保存7年，且记录的语言必须是英文或毛利语。保持资料井井有条还可以帮助您在纳税年度期间和年终时高效且准确地履行您的税务职责。

[保存记录](/managing-my-tax/record-keeping)

  

#### 在经营公司的第一年缴纳税款

一般来说，在经营公司的第一年，您无需缴纳所得税，直到纳税年度结束为止。不过，您可以选择自愿支付，以协助分摊成本。如果您符合要求标准，则有可能在营业企业的第一年获得提前纳税折扣。

在某些情况下，与您签订服务合同的个人或企业可能会与您约定按定期支付款项。这些款项带有标准税务代码，订约人或企业将按照您从事的工作类型对应的税率从您的收入中扣除所得税。您也可能需要在年终时缴纳额外的所得税。如需避免这种状况，您可以选取符合您情况的税率。

与工资或薪水所得者的所得预扣税 (PAYE) 不同，按进度支付款项的扣除税款不包括新西兰意外伤害保险局 (ACC) 的保险费用。您需要在纳税年度结束时向意外伤害保险局 (ACC) 支付这些费用。

[按进度支付款项](/income-tax/withholding-taxes/schedular-payments)

  

#### 在纳税年度结束时缴纳税款

无论您是否收到按定期支付的款项，您都必须提交年终纳税申报表。您需要向IRD报告您的收入，并可以申报经营业务的特定支出。您需要根据净收入缴纳所得税。提交纳税申报表时，您需要向我们提供以下资料中的任意一种：

*   财务报表摘要 - IR10表格
*   一组财务报表。

之外，您还需要支付：

*   工作保险税 (Work levy)
*   工作安全保险税 (Working Safer levy)。

[若您经营或拥有企业（意外伤害保险局），则需支付保险费用](https://www.acc.co.nz/for-business/understanding-levies-if-you-work-or-own-a-business/)

  

填写纳税申报表时，需要填入您的企业行业分类 (BIC) 代码。我们会将此连同您的收入信息一起发送到意外伤害保险局 (ACC) 以计算您的保险费用。您可以在ACC网站上查看您需要的所有信息。一旦ACC从我们这里取得您的信息，便会向您发送一张保险费用发票。

IR56纳税人 - 赚取工资或薪水，且需要扣除自己的所得税和ACC向工资所得者征收的保险费用

在某些情况下，即使您是领取工资或薪水，却仍需在纳税年度期间自行缴纳税款。通常情况下，雇主会从雇员的工资或薪水中扣除其所得税和[ACC向工资所得者征收的保险费用](/api/glossary/item?id={B2294C57-D9F8-4CB3-A40A-8C9DB62A2540})
。如果您是IR56纳税人，则需要登记并自行扣税。

如果您符合以下条件，您便是IR56纳税人：

*   使馆人员
*   海外公司新西兰办事处的代表
*   美国南极计划的工作人员
*   兼职私人家政佣工，如家政助手、护工、保姆或园丁。

您需要确认自己不会被视为自雇人士或雇员。

[Child Support Amendment Act 2006](/new-legislation/act-articles/child-support-amendment-act-2006 "Child Support Amendment Act 2006")

Write-off of penalty debt
=========================

2006 amendment means liable persons who begin making regular child support payments again may have late payment penalties written off.

Liable persons who reach an agreement with Inland Revenue to begin making regular payments again, which will include paying something towards the arrears that they owe, will be able to have some of the late payment penalties that they owe written off if they keep to the agreement for 26 weeks.

#### Background

This major change is a response to the escalation of penalties owed by liable parents. It is intended to serve as an incentive for those who have stopped paying to begin making their payments again.

As at June 30 2006, liable parent debt was $1,073 million. Of this, core debt was $433.4 million, with unpaid penalties amounting to another $640 million. Penalties compound and grow very quickly, so much of the increase in child support debt over recent years is the result of unpaid penalties rather than a dramatic increase in the numbers of parents not paying.

#### Key features

The previous provisions in the Act relating to penalties have been rewritten to provide a consistent form for the granting of relief from them, distinguishing between those provisions under which relief is discretionary and those under which relief is mandatory.

Sections 135B to 135F describe the discretionary power available to Inland Revenue to grant relief from penalties that already existed, while the new provisions for relief from penalties are contained in sections 135G, 135J, 135K and 135L.

When a liable person has no current or future liability for financial support, all initial 10% penalties have been paid, and all that remain are incremental penalties, section 135G gives the Commissioner of Inland Revenue the discretion to consider writing off those incremental penalties. Inland Revenue must have regard to whether recovery is an inefficient use of resources or whether it would place the liable person in serious hardship as defined in the section.

The provisions for mandatory relief in respect of the initial late payment penalty that were in section 135A are located in new sections 135H and 135I.

When there is continuing liability, or arrears still to pay, the write-off of accrued incremental penalties is mandatory if the terms of a new payment agreement have been complied with. Section 135J provides a formula for the calculation of the amount that is to be written off at 26-weekly review points for new agreements.

The formula is modified in section 135K in respect of arrangements that are already in place, while section 135L gives Inland Revenue the discretion to disregard failures to make a payment under an agreement in specified circumstances.

The mandatory relief from continuing incremental penalties previously in subsection 135(3) is in new sections 135M and 135N.

New section 135O provides for refunds to be made out of a Crown Bank Account and for the new provisions to apply to penalties that are imposed before or after the new legislation comes into force.

#### Application date

The amendments apply from 26 September 2006.

Year 3 of automatically issued income tax assessments
=====================================================

The process of automatically calculating individuals’ income tax assessments is designed to make tax simpler for New Zealanders.

We’re using the data we get throughout the year to help ensure people are paying and receiving the right amounts. Having up-to-date data means that any errors or changes in circumstances are identified and addressed during the year - for example, ensuring customers are on the right tax code.

If deductions are accurate throughout the year, customers should have smaller refunds or bills to pay (if any) at the end of the tax year.

Issuing income tax assessments automatically is still a relatively new process. As changes to employment and investment income reporting were introduced progressively, the year ending 31 March 2021 was the first full year we received more details, more often, about recipients of investment income.

Building on our experience to improve in 2021
---------------------------------------------

Planning for the 2021 automatic assessment season continued to build on lessons learnt from 2020 and 2019. We worked to get the assessments out faster than in previous years to give customers certainty faster - especially families.

To help ensure assessments were as accurate as possible, we contacted 450,000 customers and employers during the year to let them know that they were on unsuitable tax codes and needed to update their details.

We took steps to enhance the customer experience by improving the accuracy of data to reduce the possibility of errors or confusion. We used focused marketing campaigns to encourage customers to update their details, such as bank accounts.

Insights generated from our analytical tools enabled us to tailor interventions to identify and address specific issues that customers were struggling with.

We’re focused on further improvements. From 31 March 2021, income from portfolio investment entities - such as KiwiSaver schemes - is included in the end-of-year income tax assessment process and automated where possible. We continue to learn from each year and focus on how to make the next annual assessment run as smoothly as possible.

Trends in accuracy of assessments
---------------------------------

As at 30 June 2021, 2.9 million assessments had been issued to customers through the 2021 automatic income tax assessment process.

We have seen a year-on-year improvement in the accuracy of income tax assessments resulting in refunds.

The average tax to pay decreased from $458 in 2020 to $412 in 2021, although this is still provisional. An increase from 2019 to 2020 was, in part, due to a large number of people being on a higher or lower prescribed investor rate than they should have been.

Following changes to legislation, from 1 April 2020, we have provided portfolio investment entities with correct rates for people on an incorrect rate. From the year ending 31 March 2021, portfolio investment entity income is included in the end-of-year income tax assessment process and automated where possible.

It’s important to note that the 2021 tax-to-pay results will be inflated by a significant number of customers who received an extra pay, leading to extra tax - this happens once every 11 years or so. This extra tax gets written off for many customers.

Note, 2021 information is at 30 June 2021. Customers with agents have until 31 March 2022 to amend their 2021 assessments.

2019 information is as at 31 March 2020 and 2020 information is at 31 March 2021.

YouTube earnings could be considered taxable
============================================

**27 September 2017**

Making money from YouTube videos has been clarified as potentially taxable even if you are not running a business.

An Inland Revenue statement says the earnings may be taxable either as ordinary income or from a profit-making undertaking or scheme.

Director of Public Rulings Susan Price says it’s more common these days for people to make money from uploading videos on YouTube by charging sponsorship fees, selling advertising and taking commissions.

“People may not be aware that even though this money is earned online, it still falls within the tax system and should be declared as income.

“Money that is earned on a regular basis may be taxable income and when a YouTuber, creates a video with the intent of profiting from it, then tax should probably be paid on any profits that result.”

Inland Revenue’s statement contains guidelines and sets out three examples, which show the sort of income that’s taxable.

**Earning commissions**

Let’s say you have a regular 9-5 job but in the evenings you like playing video games. You also enjoy making videos of yourself playing these games, which are then uploaded online. These videos quickly gain a following and before long the game producer asks you to promote their other products. Every month you would be expected to produce three videos in order to be paid a monthly commission.

“You might not be doing this with the intention of making a profit,” says Ms Price, “but the commission is clearly regular income so it’s definitely taxable.”

**Aiming for profit**

Many YouTubers know what it takes to make a video go viral. Filming cute cats is one such ploy. Let’s say you decide to write a short film, build sets and props and make your cat the star. Your video becomes an overnight sensation attracting millions of hits. You create an advertising account to earn money from the video and quickly generate $10,000.

“This might seem like a one-off windfall,” says Ms Price. “However, in this case the income is subject to tax because by choosing to monetise the video with ads, you have shown intent to make a profit.”

**Not all videos are taxable**

Let’s say you are an amateur photographer and on your annual holidays you enjoy taking pictures of wildlife. When you get home you sometimes put your favourite pictures on a video timeline and upload them to your YouTube channel. In the video description you post a link to your website where the pictures can be purchased. The proceeds are used to cover the cost of your holiday and photography equipment.

“This is a case where the photographer doesn’t seem to be operating a business and receives sporadic income. The money made is used to recoup costs so there’s a lack of profit-making intention.”

**How to comply**

Even though earning money from YouTube seems like a new concept, it still falls under existing rules in the Income Tax Act.

”If you are generating income this way you have an obligation to declare it in your tax return,” Ms Price says.

“You should also be keeping a financial record of your endeavours and retaining them for at least seven years.”

Anyone in doubt as to whether the money earned from their YouTube exploits is considered assessable income should seek advice.

[Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-international-investment-and-remedial-matters-act-2012 "Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012")

Zero rate of AIL on retail bonds
================================

Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 provides a zero rate of AIL (approved issuer levy) on retail bonds.

_Sections 86I and 86IB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971_

The approved issuer levy (AIL) is imposed on interest payments made by New Zealanders to foreigners. The levy is 2% of the interest paid, and is paid to the Government by the borrower. AIL is an alternative to paying non-resident withholding tax (NRWT), which applies at a rate of 15%, or 10% with treaty countries, on the interest. The option to pay AIL is available only when certain requirements are met, such as the borrowing being from an unrelated party.

When AIL was introduced in 1991, the central aim was to substantially reduce the tax imposed on loans from unrelated parties on the basis that NRWT raised the cost of capital to the New Zealand borrower in these circumstances. The basic operation of the approved issuer levy is explained in _Tax Information Bulletin_ Vol 3, No 2, August 1991, pp 7-8.

Unlike the 1991 reform, the measure in the Taxation (International Investment and Remedial Matters) Act 2012 aims to remove a potential tax impediment to the development of New Zealand's traded bond market, rather than reducing the cost of unrelated debt across the board.

The Act amends the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 by providing a zero rate of AIL for bonds that are traded in New Zealand. Strict criteria are used to prevent ordinary loans, syndicated lending, private placements and other forms of closely held or non-traded debt from qualifying for the zero rate of AIL.

The 2% rate of AIL is retained and AIL will be considered to be paid when either the existing 2% rate is paid, or the new nil rate applies.

#### Application date

The changes apply to interest payments made on or after 7 May 2012. This means that the zero rate can be used in respect of future interest payments on bonds issued before enactment of the legislation.

#### Key features

To qualify for AIL generally, the debt security must first comply with the existing AIL registration requirements in section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1991 and section 86H of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971.

In cases where these requirements are met, the borrower can pay a 2% rate of AIL.

Section 86IB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 sets out the additional requirements that a registered security must meet to qualify for the zero rate of AIL. These are:

*   that the security is denominated in New Zealand dollars;
*   that the security was offered to the public for the purposes of the Securities Act  1978;
*   that the security was not issued as a private placement;
*   that the security is not an asset-backed security;
*   that the registry and paying agent activities for the security are conducted through one or more fixed establishments in New Zealand; and
*   that the security is listed on an exchange registered under the Securities Market Act 1988 (the NZDX) or alternatively, the security is traded in a market that brings together buyers and sellers of securities and satisfies a widely held test.

The main test is the NZDX test, with a widely held test as a back-up option for bonds that are traded in New Zealand but not listed on the NZDX.

The widely held test is outlined in new section 86IB(2). A bond must satisfy the widely held test at, or before, the time of the interest payment. This means that if the test has been satisfied on one previous occasion, it is not necessary to re-apply the test a second time.

There are two parts to the widely held test:

*   The securities must be held by at least 100 separate persons whom the issuer could not reasonably expect to be associated with the issuer or with one of the other bond-holders. Bond-holders that are associated with each other count as one person for the purposes of this test. Persons who would be associated with the issuer due to the existence of a trust which is established for the main purpose of protecting or enforcing beneficiaries' rights under the class of securities can still be counted, so long as they are not associated with the issuer in some other way.
*   No person or group of associated persons can hold more than 10% of the value of the securities at the time the test is applied.

Regardless of whether they pay AIL at 2% or 0%, the approved issuer will need to file an AIL return/payment slip.

#### Detailed analysis

In order to access the zero rate of AIL, the issuer of the security must first register to pay AIL. The issuer of the security must be an approved issuer under section 32M of the Tax Administration Act 1991 and must have registered the security under section 86H of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971. This allows them to pay AIL at a rate of 2%.

Section 86I of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 has been amended so that AIL is considered to be paid when either the existing 2% rate is paid, or the new nil rate applies. When AIL is considered to be paid, a nil rate of non-resident withholding tax will apply under section RF 12 of the Income Tax Act 2007 as long as the borrower and lender are not associated, and as long as the interest is not jointly derived with a New Zealand resident.

Section 86IB of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971 sets out the requirements that a registered security must meet to qualify for the zero rate of AIL.

#### _Issued in New Zealand_

The objective of the zero rate of AIL is to remove a potential obstacle to the further development of the New Zealand bond market (bonds issued in New Zealand and denominated in New Zealand dollars) rather than reducing taxes on foreign debt funding more generally.

Two requirements are used to limit the zero rate of AIL to bonds which are issued in New Zealand.

The first requirement is that the securities are denominated in New Zealand dollars (section 86IB(1)(a)).

A supporting requirement is that the activities of the registrar and paying agent for the security are conducted through one or more fixed establishments in New Zealand (section 86IB(1)(d)). This means that these activities occur in New Zealand. Bonds will be registered with a registrar whose role is to check that the bonds comply with relevant legal obligations and that the amount of bonds on issue matches the amount of bonds authorised by the company. A paying agent is an agent who accepts payments from the issuer of a security and then distributes the payments to the holders of the security.

#### _Issued publicly_

Two requirements are used to limit the zero rate to bonds that are issued publicly.

First, the securities must be an offer of securities to the public under the Securities Act 1978 (see section 86IB(1)(b)(i) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971). The Securities Act does not expressly define an offer of securities to the public, but section 3 of the Act provides guidance on how the phrase should be interpreted. Section 3 of the Act lists people who are not considered to be members of the public. These include associates, institutional investors, underwriters and investors who pay a minimum subscription price of at least $500,000 before allotment of the securities. The Securities Act requires the preparation of an investment statement, a registered trust deed and (generally) a registered prospectus before a debt security can be issued to the public.

Secondly, the securities cannot be issued as a private placement (section 86IB(1)(b)(ii)). A "private placement" is not a formally defined term in the Income Tax Act 2007 so this exclusion relies on the ordinary commercial meaning of a private placement. For example, securities that were exclusively issued to a group that were pre-selected by the issuer would probably be considered to be a private placement.

#### _Not an asset-backed security_

The securities cannot be asset-backed securities (section 86IB(1)(c)). Again, an "asset-backed security" is not formally defined so would be interpreted using the ordinary commercial meaning of this term. For example, securities whose interest payments were directly financed out of cashflows from a pool of financial assets such as mortgages or other loans could be considered to be asset-backed securities.

In cases where a company issues bonds and then on-lends all of the funds to a related party, the bonds will not usually be an asset-backed security. With an asset-backed security, the interest payment on the bond is dependent on the performance of the underlying assets. This is not the case when the funds are simply on-lent to a related party.

The purpose of this requirement is to deny the zero rate of AIL in cases when a group of loans have been bundled together and securitised into a bond. The concern is that such securities could be used to effectively shift the profit margin earned on closely held loans (such as mortgages) outside the New Zealand tax base.

#### _Traded in a market_

The securities must either be listed on an exchange registered under the Securities Market Act 1988 (see section 86IB(1)(e)(i) of the Stamp and Cheque Duties Act 1971), or alternatively, must be traded in a market that brings together buyers and sellers of securities and also satisfy a widely held test (section 86IB(1)(e)(ii)). This means that non-traded instruments such as bank term deposits will not qualify for the zero rate of AIL. Currently, the NZDX is the only debt exchange that is registered under the Securities Market Act.

Securities listed on the NZDX will not need to apply the widely held test and are expected to generally satisfy the other requirements listed above.

#### _Widely held test_

The widely held test is outlined in section 86IB(2). A bond needs to satisfy the widely held test at, or before, the time of the interest payment. This means that, if the test has been satisfied on one previous occasion, it is not necessary to re-apply the test a second time.

The securities must be held by at least 100 separate persons whom the issuer could not reasonably expect to be associated with the issuer or with one of the other bond-holders. Bond-holders that are associated with each other count as one person for the purposes of establishing if there are at least 100 separate bond-holders. Persons who would be associated with the issuer due to the existence of a trust which is established for the main purpose of protecting or enforcing beneficiaries' rights under the class of securities can count toward the 100 persons, so long as they are not associated with the issuer in some other way. See the next section, "AIL and associated persons remedial", for a discussion on why this exclusion for bond trusts is necessary.

Note that the securities need not all be issued on the same date so long as the debt securities are identical (that is, they are fungible). This means that issuers can build up to 100 investors over time, although they will only get the nil rate of AIL in respect of interest payments made on or after the first day that the securities satisfy the test.

**Example**

If half the bonds were issued in January 2012 and half in August 2012, and by the 14th of September 2012 the total number of bond-holders has reached 100 persons, then the test could be satisfied in respect of interest payments made on or after the 14th of September 2012.

If the number of persons who hold the bonds subsequently drops below 100, the test will still be satisfied so long as this threshold was not met simply because of an arrangement (that the issuer could reasonably be expected to be aware of) that was intended to temporarily increase the number of persons holding the bonds.

The second part of the widely held test is that no person or group of associated persons holds more than 10% of the value of the securities at the time the test is applied. If a person subsequently comes to hold more than 10% of the bonds, the test will continue to be satisfied. Note that both parts of the widely held test (requiring 100 persons and that no person holds more than 10% of bonds) must be satisfied on the same date.

#### _Filing requirements_

Regardless of whether they pay AIL at 2% or 0%, approved issuers will need to continue to file an AIL return/payment slip by the 20th day of the month following the month in which the interest payment was made (sections 86I and 86K). This slip will now require the approved issuer to record the total amount of interest payments which have been zero-rated. A person will not generally be able to use the zero rate of AIL in respect of any interest payments for which they fail to provide this information by the 20th day of the following month. However, there is scope for the Commissioner to provide a later deadline in a notice given to the approved issuer (section 86I(b)(ii)). Alternatively an approved issuer that is late at supplying this information would still be able to get a 2% rate of AIL (section 86I(a)(ii)) if they pay AIL at a later date, along with any interest and penalties.

[Changes to the GST rules](/new-legislation/act-articles/taxation-gst-and-remedial-matters-act-2010/changes-to-the-gst-rules "Changes to the GST rules")

Zero-rating land transactions
=============================

2010 changes to the GST rules cover zero-rating of land transactions and apply to goods supplied on or after 1 April 2011. Includes a new definition of 'land'.

### Background

In November 2009, the Government released the discussion document, _GST: Accounting for land and other high-value assets_, which proposed a number of changes to the GST Act to deal with certain GST base risks and improve the operation of the GST system more generally. The main risk to the tax base identified was "phoenix" fraud schemes, typically between associated entities, that involve Inland Revenue refunding GST to one party with no corresponding payment being made by the vendor because the vendor deliberately winds up their business before making payment.

The discussion document recommended a domestic reverse charge as a possible solution to the problem. However, most submitters expressed a preference for zero-rating as it would give rise to fewer compliance costs. This option has been adopted in the new legislation since, under this mechanism, the accounting obligations of the parties would in most situations remain virtually unchanged from the previous legislation.

### Key features

GST-registered vendors will be required to charge GST at the rate of 0% on any supply to a registered person involving land, or in which land is a component, if at the time of settlement:

*   the recipient intends to use the goods for making taxable supplies; and
*   the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as the principal place of residence of the recipient or a relative of the recipient.

Other features of the new rules include:

*   a definition of "land" which largely follows the definition used for income tax purposes but which excludes most commercial leases;
*   an obligation for the purchaser to advise of their registration status and intentions in respect of the land; and
*   special rules to deal with situations when a supply is either incorrectly zero-rated or incorrectly standard-rated.

### Application date

The new rules will apply to goods supplied on or after 1 April 2011.

For transactions entered into before 1 April 2011 but for which the time of supply is on or after that date, the supplier has the option of treating the transaction as being governed by either the current GST rules or the new rules (section 11(8C)).

### Detailed analysis

#### _Determining zero-rating_

New section 11(1)(mb) provides that a GST-registered person must zero-rate a supply if the supply wholly or partly consists of land, and:

*   is made to another registered person; and
*   the recipient acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and
*   the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c) (that is, their relative).

To be a zero-rated supply, the above conditions for zero-rating must be satisfied at the time of settlement of the transaction (new section 11(8B)). If any of these conditions are not satisfied at the time of settlement, the supply should be taxed at 15%.

If land is supplied as part of a larger supply, the whole supply is zero-rated. For example, if land is supplied as part of a business being sold as a going concern, under the new rules the supply of the going concern is zero-rated in its entirety. To ensure that the zero-rating rules apply to services supplied as part of a transaction that includes land, new section 5(24) treats these services as a supply of goods.

The requirement that the recipient must intend to use the goods for making taxable supplies may be satisfied even if the recipient does not intend to use the goods wholly for making taxable supplies. Thus, the supply may be zero-rated in its entirety even if the recipient intends to use the goods partly for making non-taxable supplies. It should be noted, however, that in these circumstances the purchaser will be liable to account for the output tax on the non-taxable use of the goods under new section 20(3J). (See the section on the new apportionment rules for more details.)

The zero-rating rules do not apply to supplies of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient of the supply or a relative of the recipient (section 11(1)(mb)(ii)). If a "principal place of residence" is included in a larger supply of real property, amended section 5(15) requires the supplier to treat the supply of the residence as separate from the supply of any other real property included in the supply. These provisions clarify that a supply of the principal place of residence is not subject to the zero-rating rules. This should prevent registered persons, such as sole traders, from using their GST-registered status to zero-rate the purchase of their family home.

#### _Meaning of "land"_

A supply will only be zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb) if it is a supply of land. A new definition of "land" in section 2(1) of the GST Act includes an estate or interest in land, a right that gives rise to an interest in land, and an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land.

"Land" includes the ground within the territory of New Zealand, whether below or above the water, and things of a permanent nature situated on the ground, such as buildings or any other structures that become a fixture and thus part of the land. "Land" does not simply mean the physical ground, but the nature of the right involved in the ownership of land.

In common law, all land is held by the Crown and rights in respect of land held by subjects are derived directly or indirectly from the Crown. The bundle of rights held by subjects in respect of land is described as "an estate in land". The largest estate possible is an estate in fee simple but any number of smaller estates may exist at the same time as an estate in fee simple, and each of those estates may be sold or otherwise dealt with.

Estates may be freehold or less than freehold, for example, leasehold. For the purposes of the new rules, leases are excluded from the definition provided that they are leases of dwellings or they are commercial leases for which:

*   the supply is made periodically; and
*   25% or less of the total consideration specified in the agreement, in addition to any regular payments, is paid or payable under the agreement in advance of or contemporaneously with the supply being made.

The exclusion will ensure that commercial leases that do not require high one-off payments and which are unlikely to be used for phoenix fraud purposes are not caught by the new rules. The definition also expressly excludes mortgages.

Although a person who has an estate will often have a right of immediate possession of the land, it is not a necessary component of having an estate in land. For example, an estate may exist if it gives a person a right of possession at some future time or is contingent on an event that may or may not take place.

An "interest" in land includes both legal and equitable estates. By including equitable estates in land, the definition includes interests in land that are recognised and enforceable under the rules of equity, for example, equitable easements or restrictions on the use of land.

One of the rights that may be granted by a person with a legal interest in land is a "profit à prendre", that is, a right to enter another person's land and take some profit from the soil. Common examples of profit à prendre include the right to mine for minerals or the right to harvest timber.

"Land" also includes a right or an option to acquire land or an estate or interest in land.

Finally, the new definition includes a share in the share capital of a flat-owning or office-owning company, as defined in section 121A of the Land Transfer Act 1952. This aims to prevent such structures being used for fraudulent purposes.

#### _Disclosure requirements_

A supply that wholly or partly consists of land is a zero-rated supply if, at the date of settlement, the recipient is a registered person, acquires the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies, and the supply is not a supply of land intended to be used as a principal place of residence of the recipient or their relative.

New section 78F seeks to help the supplier identify this information so they can apply the correct GST treatment. Thus, if a supply wholly or partly consists of land, section 78F(2) requires the purchaser to provide, at or before settlement, a written statement to the supplier whether at the date of settlement:

*   they are, or expect to be, a registered person; and
*   they are acquiring the goods with the intention of using them for making taxable supplies; and
*   they do not intend to use the land as a principal place of residence for them or a person associated with them under section 2A(1)(c) (their relative).

This information must be provided to the supplier in writing. It is expected that the requirements of this section will be incorporated into standard sale and purchase agreements. In that case, the written statement could simply be by way of ticking (or not) the relevant criteria.

Since the tests in section 11(1)(mb) must be satisfied on settlement for the zero-rating rules to apply, the information provided by the purchaser may be provided on a prospective basis, that is, on the basis of the best prediction of the recipient's circumstances at the time of settlement. For example, if a purchaser is not registered for GST but intends to register before settlement, they may indicate on their statement that they expect to be registered for GST. Furthermore, if the purchaser who contracts with the supplier does not intend to receive the land themselves but nominates or intends to nominate a third party to receive the supply, the purchaser may make representations on behalf of the nominated person (section 78F(5)).

If a supply of land is made by a lender to whom section 5(2) applies, the purchaser must provide the information required by section 78F to the lender rather than the borrower, for example, the mortgagee under a mortgagee sale.

#### _Supplier's obligations_

Having received a written statement from a purchaser, the supplier may rely on the statement to either standard-rate or zero-rate the supply (section 78F(3)). If the statement indicates that the conditions in section 11(1)(mb) are or will be met, the supplier may zero-rate the supply. If the statement indicates otherwise the supplier may standard-rate the supply.

In some circumstances, the vendor may believe that the information provided by the purchaser is not accurate. In these situations, the legislation provides flexibility for the vendor to adopt the GST treatment that they consider to be correct. For example, if, in contrast to the purchaser's claims the vendor is aware that the purchaser will use the property in question as their principal place of residence, they may but are not obliged to choose to standard-rate the supply. In a commercial transaction it is reasonable to assume that the vendor is unlikely to unilaterally adopt a GST treatment different from the one indicated by the purchaser's representation without first consulting the purchaser.

Once a written statement is provided, the supplier is not required to make any further enquiries regarding the purchaser's circumstances.

If the purchaser either refuses or for any other reason has not provided a written statement regarding their GST registration status and intentions in respect of land, the supplier should standard-rate the transaction.

#### _Record-keeping requirements_

If a supply is zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb), new section 75(3B) requires the supplier to maintain sufficient records to enable the following particulars in relation to the supply to be ascertained:

*   the name and address of the recipient; and
*   the registration number of the recipient; and
*   a description of the land; and
*   the consideration for the supply.

#### _Consequences of incorrect GST treatment_

In some situations, the GST treatment of the transaction elected by the supplier may be found to be incorrect. The consequences of this will depend on whether the mistake is discovered before or after settlement.

#### _Correction of GST treatment before settlement_

For a supply to be zero-rated, the conditions for zero-rating in section 11(1)(mb) must be satisfied at the time of settlement. Since the time of supply may occur before a transaction is settled, the supplier will need to determine whether the supply should be standard-rated or zero-rated at that earlier time. As discussed earlier, this determination will usually be made on the basis of the written statement provided by the purchaser.

Before settlement the parties may become aware that the GST treatment applied to the transaction thus far is not correct.

For example, on signing the sale and purchase agreement the purchaser may have informed the supplier that they will be registered at the time of settlement. The supplier zero rates the transaction as a result. Before settlement, the purchaser may decide to nominate a third person to settle the transaction. The nominated person indicates that they will not be registered at the time of settlement.

Conversely, the parties may become aware of circumstances that indicate that a transaction should be zero-rated rather than standard-rated.

In both cases, since the crystallisation of the correct GST treatment in respect of the supply occurs at the time of settlement, the new zero-rating rules do not impose any obligations on the parties to change the initial GST treatment of the supply before settlement. Nevertheless, the parties may voluntarily agree to correct the GST treatment to avoid the consequence of being incorrect, as outlined below.

If GST has already been accounted for to Inland Revenue by the supplier, the correction may be done under section 25 of the GST Act, which allows the supplier to issue a credit note to adjust the tax payable by the supplier. Thus, if a supply was standard-rated when it should have been zero-rated, the supplier will be able to deduct the GST already paid to Inland Revenue and the purchaser will be required to account for the amount of any deduction incorrectly claimed in respect of the supply. Alternatively, if a supply was zero-rated when it should have been standard-rated, the supplier would be required to account for the GST. Generally the purchaser will not be able to claim a deduction in respect of the supply since if they are registered for GST and intend to use the goods in making taxable supplies (requirements for obtaining a deduction), standard-rating is unlikely to be the correct treatment.

Section 25 has been amended by the Taxation (GST and Remedial Matters) Act 2010 to explicitly allow suppliers to issue debit and credit notes in the context of the zero-rating rules.

**Example 1**

Max, a registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Geoff for $500,000 plus GST, if any. Geoff informs Max that he does not expect to be registered for GST at the time of settlement and does not have any intention to use the land for taxable purposes.

Before settlement, Max issues a tax invoice on the basis that the GST of $75,000 is chargeable in respect of the supply. The tax invoice triggers the time of supply and Max accounts for the amount of GST to Inland Revenue.

Following the time of supply but before settlement, Geoff tells Max that he has decided to nominate Paul to settle the transaction. Paul informs Max that he will be registered for GST at the time of settlement, will use the land for making taxable supplies and will not use it as his or his relative's principal place of residence.

The parties want to ensure that the correct GST is achieved before settlement. Therefore, Max issues a credit note under section 25 and deducts the amount of GST already paid to Inland Revenue ($75,000).

**Example 2**

Robert, a GST-registered property developer, agrees to sell land to Graeme, who is not registered for GST, for $1 million plus GST, if any. In the sale and purchase agreement Graeme specified that on settlement he will be registered for GST, will acquire the property with the intention of using it for making taxable supplies and will not use it as his or his relative's principal place of residence. As a result, the parties treat the supply as zero-rated under section 11(1)(mb).

Before the date of settlement, Robert issues a tax invoice, thereby triggering the time of supply. Since Robert treats the transaction as zero-rated, he does not account for any GST to Inland Revenue.

Following the time of supply but before settlement, Graeme informs Robert that his circumstances have changed and that he will not be registered for GST at the date of settlement. As a result, the correct GST treatment of the transaction would be to standard-rate the supply.

The parties want to ensure that the correct amount of GST is accounted for before settlement. Robert issues a debit note under section 25 and accounts it to Inland Revenue for the GST amount of $150,000. Since Graeme is not registered for GST, he is not able to claim any input tax deduction.

#### _Correction of GST treatment after settlement_

In some situations the correct GST treatment may be unknown until after the transaction has been settled. The consequences of incorrectly standard-rating or incorrectly zero-rating the supply are set out below.

##### _Supply incorrectly standard-rated_

When a supply that should have been zero-rated is incorrectly standard-rated and the GST has been accounted for to Inland Revenue, the supplier will be required to use the credit note mechanism in section 25 to deduct the GST paid in respect of the supply. The purchaser would then be required to account for output tax in relation to any amount of input tax that they have incorrectly claimed in respect of the supply.

**Example 3**

Sarah, a registered vendor, agrees to sell land to Brent for $200,000 plus GST, if any. Brent informs Sarah that he does not expect to be registered for GST at the time of settlement and does not have any intention to use the land for taxable purposes.

Before settlement, Sarah issues a tax invoice on the basis that GST of $30,000 is chargeable in respect of the supply. The tax invoice triggers the time of supply and Sarah accounts for the amount of GST to Inland Revenue.

Before settlement, owing to changes in Brent's circumstances, he registers for GST. He also intends to use the land for making taxable supplies and does not intend to use it as his principal place of residence.

The parties settle the transaction. Since at the time of settlement all conditions in section 11(1)(mb) for zero-rating were satisfied, the supply should have been zero-rated rather than standard-rated.

Following settlement, Sarah issues a credit note under section 25 and deducts the amount of GST already paid to Inland Revenue ($30,000). Since Brent has not claimed an input tax deduction, he is not required to account for output tax in relation to the credit note adjustment.

##### _Supply incorrectly zero-rated_

When at any time after a transaction is settled it is found that the supply should have been standard-rated rather than zero-rated, new section 5(23) will treat the purchaser, at the date of settlement, as making a supply of the goods in question at the standard rate. The value of the supply under section 5(23) will be equal to the amount of the consideration for the original supply. Since the supply is treated as being made at the date of settlement of the underlying supply, the purchaser may be subject to use-of-money interest with any applicable penalties calculated from that date.

If the purchaser who is required to account for tax under section 5(23) is not registered for GST, they will be treated as registered from the date of the supply under section 5(23) and must apply to be GST-registered (new section 51B(4)). If the purchaser fails to apply for registration, the Commissioner of Inland Revenue will be able to force their registration.

New section 20(4B) denies a deduction to the person who is treated under section 5(23) as a supplier of goods. However, the person may be able to claim a deduction for the supply at a later date if they register for GST and use the relevant goods for making taxable supplies.

Once GST is accounted for, the purchaser may request that the Commissioner cancel their registration (new section 51B(5)). Under section 5(3) a person cancelling their registration must ordinarily account for the output tax on any goods and services forming part of the assets of a taxable activity carried on by the person. This rule could result in unfair and unintended consequences if it applied to deregistration of a person who was required to register under section 51B(4). Therefore, new section 51B(6) renders section 5(3) inapplicable if:

*   the person seeks cancellation of their registration by the end of the taxable period in which they have accounted for the output tax under section 5(23); or
*   the Commissioner agrees that section 5(3) should not apply.

**Example 4**

Isla agrees to acquire land for $1 million plus GST, if any. In a written statement provided to the supplier, Isla indicates that she is registered for GST, intends to use the land for making taxable supplies and will not use it as her or her relatives' principal place of residence. On the basis of these representations, the supplier zero-rates the transaction.

The transaction is settled on 1 July 2011. At the time of the settlement Isla is not registered for GST.

Following settlement, Isla is treated as making a supply of the land on 1 July 2011 and has to account for the GST at the standard rate. Since Isla is not registered for GST, she must apply to be registered.

Once registered, Isla must account for the GST under section 5(23) on the value equal to the consideration for the original supply:

*   $1m × 15% = $150,000

Isla will not be able to claim an input tax deduction on the payment made under section 5(23) as this is denied under section 20(4B).

In the same taxable period in which she accounts for the output tax under section 5(23), Isla asks the Commissioner to cancel her registration. The Commissioner confirms the deregistration. By application of section 51B(6)(a), Isla is relieved from the requirement to pay any additional tax under section 5(3) on deregistration.

##### _Transactions involving associated persons_

An amendment has been made to section 3A (meaning of "input tax") to limit input tax deductions for second-hand goods in relation to land acquired as part of an arrangement involving more than two associated parties and more than one supply (new subsection (3B)). If the section applies, the amount of input tax for the supply is limited to the amount accounted for as output tax for all supplies that are part of the arrangement. This section is necessary to ensure that the zero-rating rules are not circumvented by arrangements involving second-hand goods deductions.
