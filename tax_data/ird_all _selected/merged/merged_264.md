NZ Tax working group submission. 9 October 2018 Submitted by: Mark Hutchinson. Relevant experience: - Managing partner of Divergent & Co, an executive leadership consultancy (see www.divergentandco.com) - Qualified to MSc level and as Clinical Psychologist. - 18 years consulting to business at senior levels in the UK (e.g Sainsburys, Vodafone, RBS, Barclays) and NZ (e.g. Fonterra, Fletcher, TrustPower, ASB, AMP, Chorus, Panuku). - Organisational Development Manager Barclays UK Retail bank 2007- 2009 during GFC. - Worked with several thousand senior leaders across a range of industries. - Early career in the public sector (Child Mental health) Key issues tax reform needs to address: 1) SAVINGS RATE (& Major banks owned off-shore) This leads to a small pool of capital for investment in NZ, weakness in the investment market, and the lion share of the benefits of any productivity flowing off-shore. Related to this, incentives to invest heavily in residential property instead of the productive sector need to be unwound. 2) INEQUALITY (especially the rise of the super-rich e.g. richest 1% own c28% of GDP). Extreme gaps from top to bottom do matter. Action needs to be taken to address this (e.g. death tax, capital gains, addressing off-shore tax havens). 3) PENSIONS. Related to 1) above. There is an urgent need to build a self-funding system. As the proportion of the retired population ages it is critical for the economy that older people have the money to support themselves and to participate in society (thus continuing to contribute to GDP through spending their pensions savings rather than becoming a fiscal burden) 4) INVESTMENT IN PRODUCTIVITY & SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENT. Also related to 1). Need for long-term funding models for necessary infrastructure and investment to boost productivity and drive the switch to sustainable economic development (health, education, R&D, de-carbonising, diversification away from commodities) Principles that should underpin the tax system: 1) Simpler works best (eg one rate of sales tax, simple uniform tax bands) 2) Progressive to increase redistribution (low & middle income earners should benefit) 3) Fair. All income should be equivalent (whether capital, wage/salary, dividends, trust). This would require a tilt from taxing income towards taxing assets. 4) Incentivise retirement saving (and growth of the local banking and finance industry) 5) Critical assets need to remain in NZ ownership. The NZ economy will struggle if we continue to outsource investment as any productivity gains will flow off-shore (as with the Australian owned banks). This should include Ports, critical infrastructure, limits to residential housing ownership, rebalancing the financial services sector, agricultural land and other key assets. Suggested interventions: GST – suggest remains the same (with measures to compensate for its regressive nature such as a zero tax band) INCOME TAX. Should be more progressive and distribute more towards the bottom to ensure that lower and middle-income earners benefit from the overall shift. Aim for overall reduction in income tax as asset / capital gains taxes come on stream. - TOP BAND. Aim to keep at 33%. \[Though raising the top rate to offset gains from introduction of a zero tax band should be left on the table\] - ZERO BAND. Aim to create as high a band as possible over time to take large numbers out of the tax system and effectively accelerate the move for the working poor towards an after-tax living wage. CAPITAL GAINS / ASSET TAXES. Treat capital gains the same as income (same bands). - Exceptions for capital gains in small businesses and e.g. farms where included as part of individual’s pension savings limit (see below) - Consider additional asset taxes especially for the super wealthy - Consider windfall taxes where corporates make unreasonable returns (e.g. Australian banks). - Consider Death Duties on large estates (e.g. over? $5m) (Allow generous inheritance amounts for e.g. children – perhaps same as the pension cap amount, and heavy duties over this. Would need to investigate e.g. off-shore avoidance schemes / possibly set up a unit in IRD to tackle this group. The levels should be set to only effect the top 1-5% in terms of asset wealth. PENSION SAVINGS & RETIREMENT - Set a nominal tax-free lifetime investment amount (as per UK). This means once invested in an approved pension vehicle income on savings would not be taxed until retirement. The cap should be set at enough to fund a comfortable retirement (e.g UK system allows c 1m GBP) \[so income taxed, pension savings exempt, pension annuities taxed above the tax free band\] - This tax-free pension saving status should only apply to NZ owned investment funds with certain investment rules (e.g. 30% must be invested in NZ). This would specifically not be available to the big Australian owned banks and investment companies. These investment funds could choose to invest in critical assets (e.g. ports, infrastructure) - The default fund should be administered by the Cullen fund. - For those whose savings vehicle is a business or farm – they would place that asset in a pension wrapper and get the same level of tax-free status. (this would have to be the capital gain of the asset not an offset against business income). SUSTAINABLE GROWTH / IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY - A range of taxes / incentives should be implemented to accelerate decarbonization of the economy (e.g. increased import tax on fuel-inefficient cars used to subsidise electric vehicles) - Mineral taxes should be introduced to fund a sovereign wealth fund similar to Norway (this could involve expanding the Cullen fund) - Environmental taxes should be introduced in a user / polluter pays fashion. (e.g. farm and industrial effluent) - Carbon tax should be considered or giving the Carbon credit trading system more teeth. Go with the simplest option to implement and run. - Industrial water levies commensurate with cleaning the waterways / net benefit gained by the water user should be charged (e.g. water bottling levy, commercial irrigation levies). It may be necessary to give those farmers who have invested heavily in waterway protection some form of offset so as not to disincentivise those who are doing the right thing.

There are currently five licensed members of TCA:  Public Trust;  Trustees Executors Limited;  The New Zealand Guardian Trust Company Limited;  Covenant Trustee Services Limited; and  Anchorage Trustee Services Limited. TCA Members currently act as statutory supervisors for in excess of $380 billion of New Zealand savings and investment related products held in Corporate Trust structures. TCA maintains relationships with government ministries, regulatory bodies, and financial sector groups. TCA sets standards for its Members by way of practice guidelines – standards for integrity, competency, financial capacity, internal controls, powers and duties and the management of conflicts of interest. TCA Members welcome the Tax Working Group’s (the Group) Interim Report but notes the requirement for a final report in February 2019. This clearly leaves little time for the Group to fully consider and receive meaningful feed back on what could become a major \[1\] PO Box 10133, Wellington 6143 • change in tax policy impacting significantly on all New Zealanders. Indeed, it is noted in the Interim Report that “the Group’s views are by no means final”. The Interim Report identifies a large number of issues which are not resolved and makes few recommendations meaning the opportunity to analyse and comment is severely limited. On this basis, aside from our brief comments on capital gains tax proposals, our submission has largely focused on the need for any proposal to carefully consider the impact any changes may have on the desirability of investment by New Zealanders into retail managed investment schemes. Our Members’ focus is on seeing New Zealanders increase their net savings and diversify their savings both prior to retirement and in retirement not only for their own personal benefit but for the long-term benefit of the economy as a whole. In our view, any major changes to the country’s tax policy must be considered with this focus in mind. In this regard our Members’ are conscious that the non-expert investor (or saver) is put off by complexity and is reluctant to invest (save) when they do not fully understand what the implications are. We consider the current portfolio investment entity income tax regime from clarity and simplicity perspective is a vast improvement on previous managed investment scheme income tax regimes and should be retained. If we assume that retail managed investment schemes (including KiwiSaver) are in ‘competition’ with other forms of retail investment or wealth creation, and in particular, real property investment (including residential property), then from a retail investor’s perspective, managed investment schemes are at a disadvantage as the retail investor typically has a better understanding of real property investments (including the tax implications) than managed fund investments. In addition they are often able to very easily borrow or ‘leverage up’ against real property (which creates economic and social issues as net saving rates do not necessarily increase) whereas it is not typical for a retail investor to be able to borrow or ‘leverage up’ against their investment in a managed investment scheme. On this basis we consider there is merit in ensuring that widely held and diversified managed investment schemes (including KiwiSaver Schemes) are not only transparent and easily understood from a taxation perspective but also encourage or incentivise saving or investing into these schemes. This will help ensure the retail investor is diversifying their wealth (i.e. managing their risk and exposure) and actually increasing their net savings. We also note that these schemes invest predominantly in businesses and capital markets (i.e. the productive sectors of the New Zealand economy) which provide wider social and economic benefits to New Zealand alongside providing direct benefits to the actual investor. \[1\] PO Box 10133, Wellington 6143 • We also recommend that any changes proposed to the portfolio investment income tax regime give consideration to the costs associated with what is proposed, as increased registry and other administrative costs will inevitably largely be carried by retail investors with the likely result of a reduced appetite to save. We note there is a recommendation to “reduce the lower PIE income tax rates for KiwiSaver Schemes only by five percentage points each”. We submit that this change is not restricted to KiwiSaver Schemes only and is instead applied to all widely held and diversified managed investment schemes. We are concerned that this will likely lead to distortions for investors (in particular) retirees, and encourage investment in KiwiSaver products only. In the interests of balance and fairness, we suggest that this recommendation be reviewed. A Capital Gains Tax: Is it counter intuitive? We consider there is a strong argument that an introduction of a broad based capital gains tax on most investments (assets) without including the family home (which represents a large percentage of New Zealand’s housing stock) is counter-intuitive and could in fact reduce New Zealander’s net savings, increase personal borrowings and continue to incentivise investment away from the productive areas of the economy. We are concerned that excluding the family home will encourage increased investment in and borrowing against the family home. While (based on the interim report and the exclusion of the family home) we are not supportive of a broad based capital gains tax, particularly in relation to widely held retail managed investment schemes, we also consider that an accruals based capital gains tax would be extremely problematic to operate particularly where the underlying investments are not liquid and/or do not produce regular cash flows from which to satisfy any tax obligations. For example, for a managed investment scheme that invests in commercial property (over 95%) and a small amount of working capital (including cash), if capital gains taxes need to be paid on an accrual basis these schemes will either need to hold significantly more cash or borrow against scheme property (if they can). This will reduce the returns on these schemes making them less attractive to investors. These schemes are an investment in the real economy being offices, factories and warehouses. Our Members have appreciated the opportunity to review the Interim Report but as noted, we are concerned at the minimal resolution of the issues raised and therefore little opportunity to provide any meaningful feedback. \[1\] PO Box 10133, Wellington 6143 • We would be happy to further discuss any matters raised in this letter.

Current system Automotive excise duty is paid by LPG Producers/Importers on all LPG produced or imported into NZ. The rate is 10.4 cents per litre + gst. The excise is intended as a tax on the ultimate use of LPG as an automotive fuel source. However, LPG used for non-automotive purposes is not intended to attract this tax, so the Government (through NZTA) rebates that portion of the tax applying to non-auto sales of LPG. In the early 1990s, automotive LPG sales were approx 80% of total LPG sales in New Zealand. The tax rebate was therefore small and the process of ‘large upfront payment followed by small rebate’ was sensible and efficient. The situation has since changed dramatically. In the 2017 calendar year, automotive LPG sales comprised just 2.7% of the total (4,900 tonnes out of total NZ LPG sales of 180,303 tonnes). The running 12-month total at September 2018 is down further to 2,978 tonnes. Unfortunately, this trend is likely to continue as the conversion and refuelling infrastructure is continuing to decline because of the advent of hybrid vehicles for taxis and the increasing cost and complexity of the post conversion of modern vehicles. In effect, Government – and industry – are now involved in a complicated, costly process that nets only about $600,000. The Government collects approximately $36 million + gst in tax revenue pa from LPG sales, only to have to rebate around $35.4 million + gst of it back to industry/consumers. The issue for industry is that there are approximately 250 LPG retailers which can claim the rebate plus a further 100 + large bulk users and the major LPG wholesalers. Claims are made two monthly, which means significant time and resource is involved in compliance. Claims are accepted up to two years in arrears. The issue for Government is similar in terms of ‘compliance’ and resourcing. The National Motor Registration Centre in Palmerston North handles the rebates, but two other Government agencies are also involved - New Zealand Customs collects the excise and the Ministry of Transport is responsible for the Regulations. The fact that automotive sales now comprise such a small and decreasing percentage of total LPG sales raises questions about the cost-effectiveness of continuing the current collection/rebate system. Other Options. We submit that there are two other options which could be considered to reduce cost and compliance for all parties. 1. Remove excise duty on LPG. Considering the complexity and cost of the current system, both for the Government agencies and industry, the $0.6 million collected could be considered insufficient to warrant maintaining it. This move would certainly benefit industry considerably for a number of reasons, including improved cashflow and reduced compliance cost. This move could be justified on another level as well. LPG has traditionally been granted lower taxes than petrol because of its environmental advantages, both in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and local air quality. 2. Collection from automotive retailers. A second option is to collect the excise in arrears from LPG automotive outlets. MRC would still have to handle the income from 200 + retailers and would continue to have to ensure compliance and verification. However, this approach would simplify the existing system and save both industry and Government time and money. In addition, Government tax take would be unaltered. Change is essential Irrespective of which proposed option is preferred, the status quo should not be maintained because of the significant costs of compliance it imposes on both Government and industry, for very little net collection of the tax. We would welcome the chance to brief the Committee in more detail on the issue and the proposals for addressing it. Peter Gilbert Executive Director LPG Association of NZ

The Association represents all producers I have been asked by some of our craft producers to open up a dialogue on the duty rates for cider, and how these might be amended. We have since contacted the Treasury and have been advised to make a submission to the Tax Working Group. I note that Chapter 10 (Corrective Taxes) covers some of the anomalies seen in alcohol taxation. The chapter however does not include the cider and fruit wine situation – which is also very complex. The rates of excise duty are made up as follows. Up to 6% ABV the excise is based on actual alcohol in the cider. Above 6% ABV the excise dramatically increases to a flat rate of $2.3545 per litre. The issue we have with cider is that apple juice will naturally ferment to an ABV of between 5.5% and 7.5%. Therefore craft producers striving to produce a high quality cider face a conundrum. At 5.9% ABV they pay an excise duty of $1.74 per litre. But at 6.1% ABV they pay an excise duty of $2.35 per litre. An increase of 61 cents per litre. Most craft producers are therefore choosing to add water to their product, to ensure a finished ABV below 6.0% ABV. Whilst this is permissible, it is far from ideal for these producers aiming for the best possible end product. The Association is seeking for an amendment in Excise item number 99.30.32K to replicate 99.30.26E (in other words excise duty to be charged at $29.432 per litre of alcohol through the range 2.5% to 9% vol.). This change would greatly aid in maximising the quality of craft cider in New Zealand. In terms of government revenue, I see no implication across the cider/fruit wine industry. Of note:  The majority of craft producers are currently avoiding the higher duty rate via dilution. The change would actually see an increase in duty revenue from these producers, as craft producers will choose to leave their product undiluted to maximise quality. In my example above the 6.1% cider would pay just 6 cents more than the 5.9% cider. Not 61 cents extra.  The commercial producers currently avoid the 6% to 8% range of ABVs. A “no man’s land” as the excise duty is constant. There are a number of Scrumpy style ciders that sit between 8% and 8.3% ABV. These currently attract a duty rate of $2.3545 per litre. Under the proposed change they would attract duty at the rates of $2.3546 and $2.4429. So again, revenue to the government is likely to increase slightly through this change.  It is worth noting that producers are either targeting below 6% ABV or above 8% ABV specifically because of how the existing duty rates are defined. With a change to 99.30.32K we may well see producers of high ABV ciders reduce their alcohol levels – which can only be good for supporting sensible/moderate drinking amongst consumers.  It is interesting that beer has no upper limit. Above 2.5% ABV it attracts excise at exactly the same rate as <6% cider ($29.432 per litre of alcohol). This supports the concept that cider and fruit/cider blends should match beer excise methodology - through to 9%, at which point they should rightly attract a wine rate, as existing (99.30.47H). In conclusion, I kindly ask that the Tax Working Group also considers cider producers in its recommendations. New Zealand’s cider producers would commend a simplification that taxed on a per litre of alcohol basis, through to 9% ABV. David Sax Chairman Fruit Wine & Cider Makers Association

ICNZ represents general insurers that insure about 95 percent of the New Zealand general insurance market, including over half a trillion dollars’ worth of New Zealand property and liabilities. We are writing to you in regard to two specific issues: A. the distortions and unfairness created by the continuing imposition of the Fire and Emergency New Zealand (FENZ) levy on insurance, and why FENZ should be funded through general taxation; and B. the tax treatment of earthquake strengthening of buildings. Funding FENZ through general taxation The earliest fire brigades were formed in the 18 th century by insurance companies in order to reduce their companies’ losses from fire. Brigades were owned by each fire insurer who responded only to their customer’s fires. This practise was confined to large urban areas where it was practical to respond. Over time, however, the insurance industry role was phased out as local government (initially) and then central government (in 1976) took over responsibility for the provision and funding of urban fire services. A levy on fire insurance in its current form to fund the then Fire Service, now FENZ, was introduced as a “temporary fix” in 1993. A number of factors have contributed to the breakdown of the historical link between fire insurance and fire services, including the change in scope of fire services to include a full range of non-fire Page 2 of 3 emergency services and the increased focus of fire-fighters on preservation of life rather than preservation of property. We have identified twelve reports produced since 1993 and almost all recommend moving away from the current insurance-based levy to at least partial use of alternative bases, including greater use of general tax revenue funding. There is no public policy rationale for continuing to involve the insurance industry in collecting money through levies on policy-holders to fund fire and emergency services. The insurance industry does not benefit directly from the provision of fire services to its clients, although it is acknowledged those services reduce costs that clients would face without the intervention of FENZ. That cost reduction is reflected in reduced insurance premiums. On equity grounds, a leading consideration of the Tax Working Group, we submit that the funding of FENZ is fundamentally unfair. It imposes the cost of funding FENZ on those who insure themselves when FENZ provides a public good by responding to all those who call for assistance. The insurance- based regime imposes unjustified collection, administration and compliance costs on insurers and on FENZ, which must administer and audit the levy collection scheme. Levying insurance makes insurance more expensive due to the imposition of the levy itself and the costs of collection. The impacts of this are regressive for households as the levy rate for residential property is capped. Reducing the affordability of insurance potentially contributes to under- insurance, exposing households, their communities and ultimately the government to greater costs in the event of major disasters. Inland Revenue on the other hand already provides a very efficient revenue gathering service. Utilising this to fund FENZ would drastically reduce the direct and deadweight costs associated with the current approach of funding it by a levy collected on a complex product like insurance. Using established public finance principles to evaluate the current insurance-based levy, analysis undertaken by NZIER 1 (enclosed with this submission) identified that the current insurance-based levy is the worst option for funding FENZ, and the first best option would be having it funded entirely from general taxation. This was the preferred option because the general tax system with its broad base and low rates provides the fairest and most efficient means to raise the revenue required and would recognise the wider public benefits associated with much of FENZ’s activities. These reasons have led most relevant jurisdictions internationally to fund their fire and emergencies services through direct taxation and/or some form of property levy. We draw this issue to the attention of the Working Group and recommend that in the interests of improving efficiency and fairness it considers the benefits that would result from funding FENZ through general taxation rather than through the current levy on insurance. Earthquake strengthening We note the Tax Working Group has identified the issue of the tax treatment of the seismic strengthening of buildings and that no deductions are allowed for this. 2 We agree the current approach results in a counterintuitive outcome: deductions may be claimed if a building collapses in an earthquake, but no deductions may be claimed on expenditure that will prevent the building from collapsing. 1 Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand Alternatives to the present insurance levy, NZIER report to the Insurance Council of New Zealand, April 2013. 2 Refer to Box 14.1 on page 108 of the Interim Report. Page 3 of 3 Given the seismic risks prevailing in much of New Zealand it is important for buildings to be strengthened to reduce the potential loss of life from a major earthquake. Such strengthening can also contribute to improving the resilience of such buildings to earthquakes and therefore the communities they sit within. More resilient buildings will also generally be easier to insure. The tax system should not disincentivise building owners from conducting earthquake strengthening and so we support the Working Group giving further consideration to how to ensure tax policy is supporting the Government’s disaster risk management agenda, rather than working against it.

We have used established public finance principles to evaluate the current insurance- based Fire Services Levy and contrast this with the alternative approaches of funding through several forms of property-based levy (collected along with Territorial Authority property rates) and a fixed levy as part of vehicle licence fees (or a variable levy through fuel taxes and Road User Charges) for light motor vehicles. We also compare the alternative of funding through general taxation. In the second part of the review we compare the winners and losers and develop charts to illustrate the incidence of benefits and costs that result from moving from an insurance-based to various alternatives in the property-based levy. What we found The historical link between fire insurance and fire services has long since broken down – the fire service levy based on fire insurance is a relic of a bygone age The earliest fire brigades in New Zealand were formed by insurance companies in order to reduce their exposure to risk. Over time, however, the insurance industry role was phased out as local government (initially) and then central government (in 1976) took over responsibility for the provision and funding of urban fire services. The Fire Services Levy in its current form was introduced as a “temporary fix” in 1993. A number of factors have contributed to the breakdown of the historical link between fire insurance and fire services, including the change in scope of fire services to include a full range of non-fire emergency services and the increased focus of fire- fighters on preservation of life rather than preservation of property. Starting from scratch, an insurance-based Fire Service Levy is the worst option for funding fire services – the best approach is general taxation Using established public finance principles to evaluate the current insurance-based Fire Services Levy (FSL), our analysis has identified that the first best option is having the New Zealand Fire Service (NZFS) funded entirely from general taxation. The timing may not be right for this option given the government’s commitment to fiscal deficit reduction. However, this is the most efficient and least distortionary option. The next best option is to apply a mixed model that includes some general taxation combined with levies on rateable values of property If that option is not considered acceptable, then as a second best we recommend a mixed funding model. This would involve a move from a fire insurance base to a property base (at least for commercial buildings and household dwellings, and ideally for domestic contents) with levies collected through local authority rates, and to an NZIER report - Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand ii equivalent base for light motor vehicles with levies collected through vehicle registration, including:  flat fees on domestic property collected through rates (with a possible extension to cover household domestic contents by proxy)  variable levies on the full rateable value of commercial property collected through rates  a flat levy on light motor vehicles collected as part of motor vehicle registration  an increasing share of public funding provided over time to cover non- fire and non-vehicle related emergency services and the Crown share of costs for the protection of state property. These changes could be phased in over time. In addition to these changes the report explores a range of next best options. Review after review has concluded that the existing fire service levy is deeply flawed and unsustainable The current arrangements for funding the fire services were introduced as a ‘temporary fix’ in 1993. We have identified twelve reports produced since 1993 and almost all recommend moving away from the current levy to at least partial use of alternative bases, including greater use of general tax revenue funding. Based on advice from officials and private sector advisors, both of the previous administrations have agreed to move away from a fire insurance based levy. What has been lacking has been the political will to introduce the amending legislation. What services are being funded? There are two distinct but overlapping fire management systems in New Zealand which are funded quite differently. The national ‘urban’ service is provided by the NZFS and largely funded by the FSL. The ‘rural’ system is a collection of services under the control of Rural Fire Authorities (RFAs) that use a mixed funding model including local authority rates and contributions from the levy. The RFAs provide a working example of a mixed funding model in operation. Amending legislation is required to address the need to better integrate the two fire services and their systems, and to move them onto a common funding basis. That will include changing the role of local authorities from part funder to revenue collector. Comparison with the Australian situation Fire services in Australia, which are funded at the State level, have moved away from insurance-based funding. Funding was changed from insurance-based to property- based levies in Queensland (1985), SA (1999) and WA (2003), while Tasmania has a hybrid of property and insurance levies. Victoria will transition from an insurance- based levy to a property-based levy collected through rates on 1 July, 2013. Only New South Wales still has a system that relies heavily on insurance-based levies (73.7%) for funding its fire services, along with local authority (11.7%) and state government revenue (14.6%). Much of this is summarised in a report by Deloitte that recommends a shift to a property-based levy system (Report for the Insurance Council of Australia, Property-based funding options for the NSW Fire Services Levy, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, June 2011). NZIER report - Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand iii What is to be done? There are at least two possible approaches to reform of fire service funding. Changes could be introduced as one comprehensive package, once the fiscal position allows, or could be phased in over time. The advantage of one comprehensive reform is that the fiscal position is projected to improve rapidly so delay until after 2015/16 would permit the move to general tax funding (the first best option). The risk with this option is that the history of stalled reforms in the last two decades does not give any confidence that a comprehensive package would proceed. In the meantime the levy base will continue to be eroded and evaded. The second-best option would be to phase in changes, creating a mixed system, as outlined below. Take the first step into the modern age – focus on light motor vehicles Phase 1 – Replacement of the levy on light motor vehicle insurance with a flat per vehicle charge collected as part of the motor vehicle registration (to come into effect as soon as a practical legislative vehicle becomes available). A second phase should focus on residential dwellings (and contents) Phase 2 – Replacement of the levy on domestic insurance with a flat fee on dwellings. The role of local authorities would change from part funder to levy collector. Domestic household contents could be eliminated as a separate category for the levy, with the present contribution being collected as part of the flat fee on dwellings. Amending legislation will need to address these changes and the integration of the two fire systems, and move them onto a common funding system. A redraft of the Fire Service Act would provide a suitable legislative vehicle for all of these changes, and there may also need to be amendments to Acts governing rating powers of local authorities. A third phase should focus on commercial property Phase 3 – The existing levy should be replaced by a variable levy on the full rateable value of commercial property. Our initial analysis has identified a number of issues that need to be resolved including better identification of the Fire Service’s costs associated with providing protection for commercial buildings and assets and the scope for risk rating based on risk amelioration measures (sprinklers etc.) that are employed by the owners. This area requires further analysis to design the reform. A fourth phase should focus on greater government funding Phase 4 – Greater public funding should be provided over time to cover non-fire, non-vehicle emergency services and the Crown share of costs for protection of state property phased in as the fiscal balance returns to surplus after 2015/16. How would this impact upon property owners? The result would be fairer as all property owners would contribute to funding the fire services, not just those who currently have insurance policies on their property. The broadening of the revenue base would reduce the average cost per property owner. For residential real property we have used a model to compare the status-quo fire insurance based levy with alternative forms of levy on the underlying property base (for household dwellings and contents) using collection through rates, and a shift for light motor vehicles from a levy on fire insurance to one based on registration. NZIER report - Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand iv Our analysis shows that the property base is a viable alternative to an insurance value base for residential property. Starting from a replication of the current capped value fire insurance levy against a property value database, we have determined the relative impact of benefits and costs across alternative funding mechanisms. These include two alternative value caps, an uncapped levy and a fixed-rate levy. Up to a million property owners would pay less as the burden is spread The results show that moving to an uncapped levy or a fixed-rate levy would each generate net savings in cost for around 1 million of the current 1.6 million residential property owners, relative to the cost of the current form of capped levy. However, the adverse impact from a variable levy is loaded on higher value properties, while the adverse impact of a fixed rate levy falls on lower value properties. In either case, and with other property-based funding options, owners of properties that are not currently insured would face the full cost of the new property-based levy. The application of a fixed annual levy of $70.70 per property would yield the same revenue as a capped levy on the value of improvements with a maximum rate of $76.00 (the current FSL maximum) applied over the residential property value base. The current fire-insurance levy on household domestic contents could be replaced by a capped variable levy on the property value, as a proxy for the value of the contents. A fixed annual levy of $12.78 per property could alternatively be applied to yield the same amount of revenue as is presently derived from the fire insurance-based levy. A combined fixed levy on residential properties of $83.48 per year would yield as much revenue as a levy on current capped values ($ 100 K for property and $ 20 K for contents) that has a maximum cost of $91.60 per year. Increasing the combined fixed levy to $ 90 per year would generate additional revenue of $17 million while still producing small savings for the majority of currently insured households. The fixed levy is favoured as a higher value capped levy would lead to some currently insured property owners paying more under a property levy system, although with a value cap of $ 300 K the additional cost would be capped at less than $ 43 per year. The existing rates relief provisions could be amended to cover the additional cost for those who would be unable to pay them, and the cost could be recovered through a small increase in the rates-based levy. A change from an insurance-based levy to a property-based charge using the existing collection agencies would also reduce the costs of administration and compliance verification. Vehicle based funding would be spread over an additional 100,000 owners, reducing costs for the 2.3 million current contributors For light motor vehicles (under 3.5 tonnes), a move from the current levy based on fire insurance contracts to a flat fee per vehicle collected as part of registration fees would result in a cost reduction for owners of the estimated 2.3 million vehicles with fire insurance. Owners of approximately 100,000 additional vehicles would begin to contribute to funding the emergency response capability of the fire service. Commercial property changes require more information for analysis We were not able to perform similar analysis for commercial property, as that would have required detailed information on current insurance arrangements which are much more varied in their construction than what we have assumed for comparison with the property-value based model we have used for residential property.

What we have done The Insurance Council of New Zealand (ICNZ) commissioned NZIER to identify alternatives to the current levy on insurance to fund the fire services in New Zealand and to evaluate the impact of moving to alternative funding bases. We have drawn on NZIER’s 2007 report to the ICNZ which established the public policy rationale for the role of government in the provision of fire services. We have taken that analysis and the existing role and function of the NZ Fire Service and Rural Fire Authorities as a given and focused on the funding of those functions. In brief, we have used established public finance principles to evaluate the current insurance-based Fire Services Levy and contrast this with a property-based levy and general tax funding. Our conclusions as to which options are preferred are compared with the findings from a suite of earlier reviews. We have also used a quantitative model to determine the levies required to match current revenue under different options, and to estimate the number of winners and losers from moving from an insurance-based to a property-based levy. We have:  reviewed and taken note of prior work and reports relevant to the funding of the New Zealand Fire Service (NZFS), and in particular, the use of the Fire Service Levy collected by insurers, and the policy objectives that this approach is intended to address  developed a range of feasible alternatives to the use of the current insurance-based levy as a means of part-funding the NZFS, including those that you have identified in your letter  developed a set of well-recognised principles for the good design of tax and revenue measures, including economic and administrative dimensions, and applied these to score and rank the current and alternative funding measures  developed narrative arguments based upon the preceding analysis and ranking exercises to support the preference for the adoption of funding measures other than an insurance-based levy. We have also:  for residential real property (and household domestic contents) and light motor vehicles, used available data to perform quantitative analysis and comparison of the current fire insurance levy system against a range of alternatives, each designed to produce the same revenue yield  developed tables of winners and losers for the residential property (including contents) and light motor vehicles groups that show the incidence of benefits and costs, for changes from the present arrangements to alternative funding arrangements  illustrated the gains and costs from implementing a number of the proposed options for a range of typical households and landlords. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 2 2. The context for fire services 2.1. Fire services in New Zealand There are two distinct but overlapping fire management systems in New Zealand which are funded quite differently. The national ‘urban’ service is provided by the NZFS while the ‘rural’ system is a collection of services under the control of Rural Fire Authorities (RFAs) 1 . The urban and rural fire systems are governed by two different pieces of legislation:  The Fire Services Act (1975) (FSA) covers urban fire services  Forest and Rural Fires Act 1977 (FRFA) covers rural fire services. There is considerable overlap between the two systems. For example, the urban fire service provides a first response to approximately 80 percent of rural fires because of its ability to respond promptly to emergency calls. 2 These cross overs result in complex financial transactions as the NZFS is required to recover response costs in rural areas from other payers. Urban fire services are almost exclusively levy funded. The Fire Services Levy (FSL) is collected on the value of property (buildings, their contents, other commercial assets and motor vehicles) insured for fire risk. In 2011/12, the levy funding was $325.9m and total spending by the New Zealand Fire Services Commission was $317.5m. By contrast, total annual spending by all rural fire authorities combined has ranged historically between $20 and 25m 3 . RFAs operate on a mixed funding model. Funding is collected from a variety of sources: local authority rates, contributions from the Department of Conservation and the NZ Defence Force, fees paid by private forestry companies and grants from the Rural Fire Fund that is financed from the Fire Services Levy. Fire-fighters, whether paid or volunteers, are responsible for the delivery of fire suppression services and other emergency interventions, including extrications of people from motor vehicle accidents and hazardous substance incidents. The NZFS, including these volunteers, represents one component of a national approach to risk management in the context of fire hazard, including:  Prevention i.e. reducing the incidence of fires, through public education, inspection and testing of fire safety equipment, and related activities  Mitigation – e.g. through use of sprinklers, and application of building standards that reduce the severity of fires and their consequences  Suppression – fire-fighter action to contain and extinguish fires that do occur. 1 There were 76 RFAs at 30 June 2012 and the NZFSC’s goal is reduce the number to 60 by 2013. In addition, there are a number of specialised private brigades covering major commercial installations such as airports, the Marsden Point Oil Refinery, and the Tiwai Point Aluminium Smelter. 2 While urban districts cover only 2% of the land area, they cover 98% of New Zealand’s population and 80% of the population is within 7 minutes travel of a fire station. 3 These figures do not include the unpaid inputs of 8,000 volunteer fire-fighters in urban districts and another 3000 in rural districts. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 3 As well as emergency responses, professional and volunteer fire-fighters provide fire safety public education and other advisory or monitoring services intended to reduce the incidence and consequences of fire. The NZFS is headed by the New Zealand Fire Service Commission (NZFSC), a Crown Entity agent under the Crown Entities Act. Under the FSA, the Commission is directly responsible for urban fire services, working through a regional command structure. It also oversees the National Rural Fire Authority, the body responsible for co- ordinating RFAs under the FRFA. The legislative basis for the Fire Service Levy is contained in Part 4 of the FSA along with all of the rules, procedures and processes that are needed to ensure that it is collected on the required basis from policies that include fire insurance and paid in a timely manner to the Fire Service Commission. There are provisions for the auditing of insurance agencies responsible for collecting the Levy and for penalties for under declaration and late payment. In these respects the FSA reads very like a tax act. 2.2. Linkage between insurance and fire services Fire services in England and subsequently in New Zealand were created by the insurance industry. The earliest fire brigades in New Zealand were formed by insurance companies in order to reduce their exposure to risk of loss by fire. Over time, however, the insurance industry role was phased out of fire service provision, as local government (initially) and then central government (in 1976) took over greater responsibility for the provision and funding of urban fire services. The FSL in its current form was introduced as a “temporary fix” in 1993. Some details of this action are provided in the recent Report of the Fire Review Panel (2012) at p67: “The present arrangements for funding fire services were introduced in some haste following the 1993 decision by Government to discontinue earthquake cover for non- residential properties..... The provisions inserted into the Fire Service Act in 1993 ...... were intended to be revisited when the final report of the Fire Service Levy Working Party was completed. ...The recommendations of the Working Party were never implemented due, in part, to more pressing concerns about NZFS performance and in part to the emergence of new levy minimisation mechanisms..... In the relatively short time since 1994 when the present funding arrangements came into force there have been no fewer than 16 reports addressed at improving the Commission’s funding arrangements. Those reports were generally critical of the present funding arrangements.... ...Much of the criticism contained in the 16 reports flowed from the failure to revisit what was acknowledged at the time as a temporary fix.” We provide a summary analysis of the contents of many previous reports about the Fire Service Levy in New Zealand (Table 2 within section 3.3 below). We also note that most of the Australian States have changed from insurance-based levies to property-based levies for funding their fire services. Tasmania has a hybrid system, Victoria is about to make the change on 1 July 2013, and New South Wales has yet to make such a move. These developments are summarised in a report by Deloitte to the Insurance Council of Australia (Property based funding options for the NSW Fire Service Levy), which modelled options using insurance data from the ICA. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 4 2.3. Erosion of the link between taking fire cover insurance and the provision of fire services While there are historical links between taking fire cover insurance and the provision of fire services, over time these links have broken down. A number of factors have contributed to the decoupling of fire insurance from fire services. These include the increasing diversity of roles performed by modern fire services, and the shift in emphasis from fighting fires to the preservation of life as a primary responsibility. 2.3.1. Broadening of the scope of fire services The Fire Service has a number of capabilities that enable it to act as a first responder organisation with broad responsibilities:  a distributed national network of around 440 fire stations with vehicles and personnel available for immediate dispatch  a robust integrated national communications system  a 24-7-365 response capacity available in all major urban areas and in a number of minor centres  the inclusion of cutting tools, resuscitators, and other rescue equipment in the standard set of gear carried by fire appliances  a staff of experienced and multi-skilled first-response personnel  access to a reserve cadre of skilled volunteers. Over the last decade there has been a 20% drop in the number of fires per head of population (NZFSC Annual Report 2011/12, Figure 6 p21) while the number of non- fire incidents per head has grown by 25% (ibid Figure 9 p25). Taking into account population growth of 12% for the decade (Statistics NZ), the number of fire incidents attended (other than false alarms) has trended down over time. Instead the urban fire service has increasingly become involved in a range of roles other than fire-fighting incidents. The Fire Service has statutory responsibilities under the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996 and the Civil Defence Emergency Management Act 2002. Additionally, it has become increasingly involved in using its capabilities to respond to non-fire incidents. As a result, non-fire incidents have grown from 5,969 or 15% of total incidents in 1976 to 16,096 or 25% in 2003 (DIA 2003 p13) and around 20,000 or 30% in 2011/2012 (NZFSC Annual Report 2012). Examples of these non-fire services include:  Floods and storms: The Fire Service is often called to attend weather emergencies. Fire-fighters help pump out flooded buildings, secure roofing and other building material battered by storms, and cover areas of buildings damaged by storms  Evacuations: When a hazardous substance is spilled, released, or found to be present during an emergency, fire-fighters are often the ones who ensure that people evacuate the scene. This is in addition to their role in cleaning up spills and decontaminating areas where spills have occurred NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 5  Accidents and medical emergencies: Fire-fighters play a major role at the scene of motor vehicle accidents, attending around 12,000 motor vehicle accidents a year. In some areas fire-fighters receive training to back up the ambulance service by providing a first response for medical emergencies, such as cardiac arrest  Rescues: Fire-fighters also help people who are trapped, such as in lifts or after accidents on building sites, and some personnel are specially trained as members of urban search and rescue teams for use at the scene of building collapses following an earthquake or other disaster. 2.3.2. Focus of fire services One of the features of modern fire services is the emphasis on saving life and limb. Undertaking this function has the elements of a public good in the technical sense that exclusion from the service is not only difficult, but also undesirable. The original fire brigades (developed by the insurance companies in England) would attend a fire but only would fight that fire if the plaque on the front of the house confirmed that the house was covered. Their concern was to protect property rather than people. In a modern fire service with a mixture of volunteers and professional fire fighters the primary focus is on the rescue of people rather than the preservation of property. Excluding people from being able to access fire services because they (or the building owner) had failed to pay the fire services levy would put fire-fighters in an intolerable position. As exclusion is not possible, there is a strong public policy rationale for recovering the costs of such a good (whether or not it is considered purely a public good) from the community as a whole, either through general taxation, or (where the benefits are localised) from local government revenue. The insurance companies are not the ultimate beneficiaries, as they pass on costs savings from having fire protection provided by other parties to their clients, in the form of lower premiums. Those premiums reflect many factors in addition to fire risk. 2.3.3. The Australian experience Fire services in Australia are funded at the State level. In the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, all funding is from consolidated revenue. Funding has been changed from insurance-based to property-based levies in Queensland (1985), South Australia (1999) and Western Australia (2003), while Tasmania has a hybrid of property and insurance levies. The State of Victoria will transition from an insurance-based levy to a property-based levy collected through rates on 1 July, 2013. The new system will comprise a fixed rate levy plus a variable levy applied to the capital improved value of properties. There will be differences in the rates applied to residential and to commercial properties, and between urban and rural rating authorities. The new levies will be collected by the City and Shire rating authorities, along with other property-based rates and charges. Only New South Wales still has a system that still relies heavily on insurance-based levies (73.7%) for funding their fire services, along with local authority (11.7%) and state government revenue (14.6%). Those arrangements are summarised in a report by prepared Deloitte Australia’s economics and infrastructure advisory service) that recommended a shift to a property-based levy system (Insurance Council of Australia, Property based funding options for the Fire Services Levy, June 2011). NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 6 2.3.4. Summary By the early 21st century the FSL remains the only vestigial remnant of the otherwise vanished historical relationship between fire services and fire insurance. There is no public policy rationale for continuing to involve the insurance industry in collecting money through levies on policy-holders to fund fire services. The insurance industry does not benefit directly from the provision of fire services to its clients, although those services reduce costs that clients would face without the intervention of the fire services. That cost reduction is reflected in reduced insurance premiums. Further, the application of the FSL has the ability to distort the market for asset risk insurance, with owners of major assets able to arrange their affairs in complex ways that minimise their liability to pay the Levy, while still protecting their risks. In this respect, the simplistic assumption that the insurance process is able to determine a fair and equitable basis for pricing the fire risk associated with commercial property, and to apply a commensurate fire service levy, is largely nullified. Changing the basis of the FSL from “indemnity value” to some other measure of value would not solve this problem, given the complexity of commercial insurance arrangements. The insurance-based regime imposes unjustified collection, administration and compliance costs on members of the New Zealand Insurance Council, other insurers, and on the staff of the Fire Service Commission who must administer and audit the levy collection scheme. 2.3.5. Analysing the funding alternatives The next section analyses the funding of fire services in New Zealand using established economic principles. We take the functions of the Fire Services Commission and the organisation of the NZFS and RFAs as a given and focus on the key issue “how should the fire services be funded if we were starting from scratch without a fire services levy on insurance?” Various options are considered and evaluated according to established economic principles. The section after that provides quantitative comparisons between the status quo and some alternative options for funding the residential property and private vehicle related components of the Fire Service Levy. This answers the questions of who stands to benefit from changes to the system, and can there be more winners than losers from making changes? NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 7 3. Policy analysis 3.1. Policy framework This section analyses alternative ways of funding of fire services in New Zealand using established economic principles. We take the functions of the Fire Services Commission and the organisation of the NZFS and RFAs as a given and focus on the key issue “how should the fire services be funded if we were starting from scratch without a fire services levy on insurance?” The Public Finance literature on taxation revenue provides some useful principles that have been applied in assessing the relative merits of the design and means of implementation of several alternative funding mechanisms. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants suggest 10 “Guiding Principles of Good Tax Policy”. In Figure 1, we have grouped these principles under two subheadings: tax design and tax administration. Similar statements of principles can be found in New Zealand Treasury and Office of the Auditor General publications 4 . Figure 1 Tax design and administration principles Source: American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 4 Treasury (2002) Guidelines for Setting Charges in the Public Sector, and Controller and Auditor General (2008) Charging fees for public sector goods and services – a good practice guide. Tax design principles are: Equity and Fairness. Similarly situated taxpayers should be taxed similarly Economic Growth and Efficiency. The tax system should not impede or reduce the productive capacity of the economy Transparency and Visibility. Taxpayers should know that a tax exists and how and when it is imposed upon them and others Minimum Tax Gap. A tax should be structured to minimize noncompliance Simplicity. The tax law should be simple so that taxpayers understand the rules and can comply with them correctly and in a cost-efficient manner Neutrality. The effect of the tax law on a taxpayer’s decisions as to how to carry out a particular transaction or whether to engage in a transaction should be kept to a minimum Appropriate Government Revenues. The tax system should enable the government to determine how much tax revenue will likely be collected and when. Tax administration principles are: Certainty. The tax rules should clearly specify when the tax is to be paid, how it is to be paid, and how the amount to be paid is to be determined Convenience of Payment. A tax should be due at a time or in a manner that is most likely to be convenient for the taxpayer Economy in Collection. The costs to collect a tax should be kept to a minimum for both the government and taxpayers. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 8 We have expanded that list, particularly in the fairness category. The framework for our analysis is shown in Table 1, which provides an elaboration of the principles shown in Figure 1, grouped under the four key dimensions of equity, efficiency, legitimacy and cost effectiveness. We have used this framework to analyse and compare the different funding options, and identify the preferred options. Table 1 Revenue design and administration principles Category Principle Explanation Equity / fairness Horizontal equity Entities with similar risks are treated the same Comparability Entities have a common basis for fair assessment Vertical equity Entities with different risks treated differently Ability to pay Entities can be assessed according to some proxy for wealth Efficiency Minimal distortion Imposition does not lead to undesirable changes in behaviour Breadth of base Revenue base includes all entities with common risk Legitimacy Transparency and visibility Liable parties are aware of charges and means of collection Certainty and clarity of rules Basis of assessment is widely known and understood Convenience of payment Liable entities can make payment with minimal effort Cost effectiveness Simplicity of application Calculation of payment for liable entities is easy Certainty of revenue yield Revenue can be calculated readily using known stable base Minimal scope for avoidance Avoidance is difficult and enforcement of payment is easy Ease and cost of collection Revenue can be collected with minimal administrative effort Source: NZIER, based upon public finance literature 3.2. Applying the policy analysis framework Based on the prior reviews we considered a range of policy alternative policy settings which we combined into coherent alternative packages or options. We compared the status quo funding arrangements for fixed property, light motor vehicles and commercial assets with four alternative funding options:  Option 1 – General tax revenue  Option 2 – Fixed levy on property and registrations - a flat dollar amount of levy on dwellings (and their contents) and a variable levy on the rateable value of commercial buildings collected through the rating system, together with a flat levy on light motor vehicles collected through the registration system  Option 3 – Variable levies on dwelling and vehicle use - variable levies collected on dwellings up to a revised cap (up to $300,000), or on full NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 9 value, collected through the rating system, on light and heavy motor vehicles through the fuel tax and the Road User Charge systems, and on the full value of commercial property through the rating system  Option 4 - A mixed model – with some general tax revenue funding combined with flat levies on dwellings (and their contents) and light motor vehicles and a variable levy on commercial property and vehicles. Options 1 and 4 were each assessed as a whole. Options 2 and 3 and the status quo each have several components. We scored the components for each option and for the status quo on a numerical scale ranging from 1 (low) to 10 (high) and then averaged the components for each option to get a single number. For each option, we computed the average scores across all 13 criteria listed in Table 1 on a simple un-weighted basis, and then ranked the options according to their average scores. We also computed the average scores for each of the four summary categories of the individual criteria, on a simple un-weighted basis, and ranked the options according to their average scores in each category. The results are shown in the following figure. Figure 2 Comparison of status quo and four policy options Source: NZIER Appendix A.1 includes details on the scoring methods and on the development of the set of rankings that resulted. In the following section we summarise the analysis by comparing the options in terms of the criteria used within the four main categories and then provide a summary comparison of the status quo and all of the options.

Comparing the options across categories The criteria we used fall into four categories: fairness, efficiency, legitimacy and cost effectiveness. In the following we omit detailed consideration of Option 4 as it is a hybrid that combines the elements and characteristics of Options 1 and 2. Option 4 is at least as good as the poorer of Option 1 and Option 2 on each measure, and ranks between those options overall and in each of the categories except the last. Fairness In terms of fairness Option 1 (general tax revenue funding) came out the highest, because the broad base of taxation enables horizontal equity (treating similar cases the same) and vertical equity (treating differently cases differently). The status quo (levies tied to fire insurance) came out lowest. This ranking is consistent with the consensus from earlier reviews that the insurance-based levy treats the insured unfairly relative to the uninsured or the lightly insured (e.g. third party cover for light vehicles does not incur FSL). Option 2 ranks behind general tax funding because a flat levy does not take into account ability to pay but is well ahead of the status quo. Option 3 is fairer than Option 2 because a levy applied on a capped or uncapped property value recognises that those with more expensive properties should be able to afford to pay more than those with cheaper properties, but is no better than Option 1 as it does not recognise that some people are asset rich but income poor. Efficiency On economic efficiency grounds Option 1 (general tax revenue funding) is superior to all other options because the breadth of the tax base and the collection mechanism lead to minimal distortions. Option 2 also ranks highly as fixed-rate levies lead to minimal avoidance, with Option 3 less attractive as variable levies encourage some avoidance behaviour, while the status quo is again the least preferred option. A particular concern with the status quo is that it encourages the avoidance of liability for the levy by owners of commercial property, who are able to exploit the availability of insurance arrangements that minimize the levy payment while achieving adequate insurance coverage, in some cases reducing their liability by tens of thousands of dollars. Further, for light motor vehicles, the ready availability of policies that exclude fire cover makes it possible to avoid the relatively modest levy. Motor vehicle accidents impose a significant demand upon the fire services. Uninsured households benefit from the protection of the fire services at the expense of insured households. These avoidable costs cause economic distortions. Legitimacy On legitimacy all options have some drawbacks. The status quo is inadequate in terms of certainty and clarity of rules. For example, during 2011/12 the Insurance Brokers Association commenced proceedings to get a declaratory judgement on the calculation of the levy. Option 1 is marked down in this category as general taxation is less transparent than an explicit FSL, although the Statement of Intent and Annual Report of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission will continue to provide information on how the funding is used. Option 2 (Levy on vehicle registrations and on property collected through rates) raises a concern that the territorial NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 11 accountability of Local Authorities may be distorted. The recent Fire Review Panel rejected the proposal to move to property-based funding because it would require Local Authorities to act as revenue collectors on behalf of central government (Report of the Fire Review Panel, Department of Internal Affairs, December 2012). We suggest that these concerns are overstated. Firstly the GST and income tax system already requires central and non-central government organisations to collect and remit taxes on behalf of the State. Secondly a number of Territorial Local Authorities are already collecting Regional Government levies on behalf of another layer of government. We also note that local government is a part funder of many Rural Fire Authorities. Moving to one unified funding system with a specific fire service levy on property will improve the transparency for local authorities in their use of rates to fund fire services. Option 1 is favoured overall, ranking marginally ahead of Option 2 where the fixed levy on property and vehicles is judged to be more visible, with its rules and simplicity contributing to its superior rating. Option 3 scores lower on all criteria, as the variable levy and collection of light vehicle contributions through fuel taxes and the RUC are less transparent and more complex than the flat rate levies of Option 2. The status quo is a little more transparent than option 1 but scores much lower on simplicity and certainty of the rules, leading to it being the least preferred case in this category. Cost effectiveness On Cost effectiveness Option 1 (general tax revenue funding) is superior to all other options, as no other revenue collection agencies are required, followed closely by Option 2 (fixed levies on vehicle registrations and on property collected through rates) which should be simple to administer. Option 3 with variable rate levies and a need to tweak both fuel levies and RUCs is less attractive as it is more complex administratively. The status quo with the need for a complex system of levy calculation, collection and remittance by members of the insurance industry, combined with the need for a separate audit function within the Fire Service Commission, is the least preferred option. The Commission advise that these administrative and audit costs amount to around $500,000 per year. In addition, there are substantial compliance and collection costs imposed on the insurance industry. None of these costs would be incurred if the current levy were replaced with general taxation. Some costs would be removed by adopting a property-based and vehicle-based levy system, while retaining an insurance base for commercial assets. The status quo also lacks revenue certainty relative to all other options as it is more prone to avoidance and to base erosion. Announced changes in the basis for insurance contracts are also likely to impact on the insurance values of residential property, leading to greater volatility in the insurance value base and consequently greater revenue uncertainty over the next year or two. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 12 3.2.2. Evaluating the options Looking across the status quo and the four broad options for change, we note the following. The status quo – the current levy system - scores the worst of any option. There are a number of critical drawbacks that have been identified above - it is relatively unfair, it encourages distortionary behaviour, and it is not cost effective to administer. In economists’ jargon it is a ‘dominated’ option as we were unable to identify any advantages for the status quo relative to any of the other options. Starting from scratch, an insurance-based Fire Service Levy is the worst funding option. General tax revenue (option 1) scores highly on every dimension other than a marginal loss of transparency. This option dominates all others:  The key advantage of this option is its ability to leverage an existing well- run broad-based low-rate tax system.  A potential disadvantage is the inability to build in incentives to take preventive measures (such as sprinkler systems) that reduce the cost and risk of fires  A short-term disadvantage is that that tax system is currently unable to generate enough revenue to meet existing expenditure demands, meaning that its full implementation would need to be delayed. The latter point is an argument for introducing another reform option and then phasing in greater general tax revenue funding as the overall fiscal position improves. A flat-rate levy on property and registrations (option 2) is the second best option. The key advantages are:  the relative lack of distortions due to the difficulty of evasion compared to the status quo and other inferior options  the cost effectiveness of administration by collecting the fee through agencies that already collect revenue from property and vehicle owners. The key disadvantages are:  some reduction in transparency and blurring of accountability in the Local Authority rates assessment  a minor lack of certainty of the ability to pay (relative to the option of general tax revenue) as reflected in the existing need for rates relief provisions. A variable levy on property and vehicle use (option 3) is another dominated option (although it is a significant improvement on the status quo). It has the advantage of being somewhat fairer than option 2, but is marginally more complex to administer, and less certain in its revenue yield. Overall, it ranks behind option 2 across the set of all evaluation criteria. The mixed funding model (option 4) is essentially an amalgam of the first best and second best options, 1 and 2. It rates between those options in its ranking. Given the fiscal constraints that may limit the ability of the Government to accept option 1, this may be the pragmatic policy approach. It could be achieved by initiating the steps towards implementation of option 2, while continuing to seek recognition of the arguments for funding the public good activities of the NZFS and RFAs through taxes. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 13 There are a number of examples of mixed funding models that operate successfully in New Zealand. Funding of rural fire services provides one example, while another example is ACC levies which operate along with general tax funding to provide separate funding cover for the different accident risk groups. The main advantage of this option over option 2 (flat levies on property and registrations) is its adaptability:  retention of the ability to build in incentives to use preventive measures (such as sprinkler systems) that reduce the cost and risk of fires  the ability to seek increased general tax funding over time as the link between property and fire services progressively reduces. Its key disadvantage is the current potential difficulty of securing any general tax revenue funding to cover non-fire, non-vehicle emergency services and the Crown share of costs for protection of state property. These may need to be deferred. Comparing these options with the recommendations of the Fire Review Panel Although they recommended the retention of insurance-based levies for real property and commercial assets, the Fire Review Panel recommended a number of refinements including:  Moving away from vehicle insurance to an unspecified funding mechanism for the transport sector (Recommendation 52)  Shifting the levy base for non-residential property from property that is insured to a levy on premiums and using all contracts of material damage not just fire insurance as the base (Recommendation 53)  Adjusting the caps on the present levy for residential and personal insurance to reflect inflation since they were last set in 1993 (Recommendation 53). The Panel’s recommendations are a variant that mixes elements of Option 2 and Option 3 discussed in this report. In essence adopting the Fire Review Panel’s recommendation would represent a marginal improvement on the status quo and on Option 3, but offers less improvement than Option 2 (flat rate) or Option 4 (a mixed funding model). The Panel’s recommendation represent a small improvement on the status quo by moving away from motor vehicle insurance and moving to a broader property insurance base (which may be less subject to avoidance). However the panel’s recommendations are inferior to a move to general tax revenue (first best), a mixed funding model (second best) or a system with fixed rate levies and levies on property, all of which sever the link with insurance altogether. More analysis of the Panel’s recommendations, including quantitative aspects, is included in section 4.2.4 below. Summary In summary, funding fire services from general tax revenue is the preferred option because the general tax system with its broad base and low rates provides the fairest and most efficient means to raise revenue. If general tax revenue is not an immediate starter then there are second and third best options that achieve many of NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 14 the benefits of general taxation without the many draw-backs of the current levy system. The introduction of a flat levy into the vehicle registration system provides an excellent example of a measure that would be easy to execute and would reduce current significant market distortions and administrative costs to virtually zero. The move to use the rating system as a base for collection of levies in respect of residential property is slightly more complex. The most effective approach would be to introduce a flat levy per dwelling unit, to replace the current levies on policies that include fire insurance cover for residential property and for household contents. In addition to the options discussed above, we have explored other possible approaches that replicate elements of the current levies with value-related charges on residential property, with or without a cap on the assessable value (that value cap could be set at a higher level than the current insured value cap). However, it may be difficult to justify including anything other than a flat charge for the fire risk related to household contents through property-based charges. Implicitly, the fire risk associated with domestic household contents could be subsumed into the fire risk of the dwelling. Moving from an insurance-based model would allow for just one flat charge to be applied. That is much simpler, and also fairer. 3.3. Comparison with previous reviews The current arrangements for funding the fire services were introduced as a ‘temporary fix’ in 1993. We have identified twelve reports written since 1993 that review aspects of these funding arrangements, and eight others that touch upon the funding issue in the context of discussing reforms of the fire services. Of the twelve, we have reviewed nine in detail, and almost all recommended moving away from the current levy on insurance. One review that recommended retention of insurance-based levy was the recent Report of the Fire Review Panel (2012). However, its terms of reference required a focus “primarily on a levy on insurance contracts” and specifically precluded consideration of general tax funding. The Review Panel recommended a move away from the levy on automotive insurance towards another ‘mechanism’ to be identified by the transport sector. The Review Panel recommended retention of an insurance-based levy for residential property and for non-residential property (with the latter based on insurance premiums rather than the sum insured). The retention of an insurance base was argued on the grounds that the move to a rates base would attenuate the accountability of Local Authorities. This somewhat tenuous argument has been addressed above in section 3.2.1. The Panel also identified that Crown property, church properties and some other classes of property are exempt from rates. The contribution to protection of these properties could be funded from general taxation. With the notable exception of this one review that was constrained by its narrow terms of reference, every other review we have been able to locate has recommended a move away from a fire levy based on insurance. These reviews include official discussion documents of the Department of Internal Affairs and Select Committee reports, as well as advice from leading economic and other consultancies. Table 2 below contains a summary of the conclusions from the reviews we have been able to locate and analyse. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 15 All the reports summarised in the table support the move from the current levy based on insurance (when their terms of reference allowed it). With the exception of the NZ Business Roundtable which favours user charges, the unconstrained papers reached a conclusion that favoured either a property rates and car registration based system or a mixed system that includes greater tax funding as well. Both previous government administrations have agreed to move away from a fire insurance based levy. What has been lacking has been the political will to introduce the amending legislation. In short the lack of progress on reform to funding fire services is not a problem of lack of analytical clarity and partisan policy disagreement; this is a problem of political will.

Policy recommendations Our analysis identified that the first best option is to have the NZFS funded entirely from general taxation. The timing may not be right for this option given the government’s commitment to fiscal deficit reduction. If this option is not considered acceptable to other parties, then as a second best we recommend a mixed funding model that includes:  direct government funding,  levies on the full value of commercial property,  flat or variable fees on domestic property collected through rates  flat fees on light motor vehicles collected as part of motor vehicle registration  variable fees on heavy motor vehicles collected through the Road User Charge. Direct public funding should be provided to cover non-fire non-vehicle emergency services and the Crown share of costs for protection of state property. This line of reasoning is consistent with the thrust of the consensus view from the unconstrained previous reports. Changes could be introduced as one comprehensive package, once the fiscal position allows, or could be phased in over time. The suggested phasing would be: Phase 1 - Replacement of the levy on car insurance policies that have fire cover with a flat per vehicle charge collected as part of the motor vehicle registration fee (to be given effect as soon as a practical legislative vehicle becomes available). Phase 2 - Replacement of the levy on domestic dwelling insurance and contents insurance with a flat fee collected by Local Authorities as part of property rates (a redraft of the Fire Service Act would provide a suitable legislative vehicle including the required amendment to the Rating Act). Phase 3 – The existing levy should be replaced by variable levies on the full rateable value of commercial property. There are a number of issues that need to be resolved including better identification of the Fire Service’s costs associated with providing protection for commercial buildings and assets and the scope for risk rating based on risk amelioration measures (sprinklers etc.) that are employed by the building owners. This area requires further analysis to identify and compare a range of options for reform. Phase 4 - Greater public funding through general taxation to be provided over time to cover the increasing proportion of non-fire, non-vehicle emergency services and the Crown share of costs for protection of state property (phased in from 2015/16 when the Crown is projecting a return to fiscal surplus). Note that general tax revenue should be used to cover the Crown’s share of protection costs for state property that is not subject to rating by Territorial Local Authorities, which would no longer be subject to insurance levies as part of the phase 2 reforms. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 17 4. Quantitative analysis Our analysis shows that the property base is a viable alternative to an insurance value base for residential property. Starting from a replication of the current capped value fire insurance levy against a property value database, we have determined the relative impact of benefits and costs across alternative funding mechanisms. This section provides information on how the various alternative options for funding the Fire Service would impact upon the ultimate payers of the present levy. In brief, the results show that moving to an uncapped levy or a fixed-rate levy would each generate net savings in cost for around 1 million of the current 1.6 million residential property owners, relative to the cost of the current form of capped levy. Vehicle registration based funding would be spread over an additional 100,000 owners, reducing costs for the 2.3 million current contributors. Our analysis follows the scheme of Figure 4 below. Figure 4 The quantitative analysis approach Source: NZIER As previously indicated our quantitative analysis focuses on the rates-based options for replacing the present levy on the insurance of residential property and domestic household contents. We also look at a registration-levy option for light motor vehicles. The analysis does not cover other options, and it does not extend to the levy Categories of insured assets subject to the Fire Service Levy: Residential real property (excluding land) – subject to a value cap Domestic household contents – subject to a value cap Light motor vehicles, under 3.5 tonnes – fixed rate levy Commercial real property (excluding land) Commercial and other motor vehicles, over 3.5 tonnes Other commercial or personal property. Types of analysis (for residential property, contents and light motor vehicles): Estimation of non-insurance (or an assumption based approach) Comparison of charges applied to alternative bases to yield similar revenue Comparison of charges with alternative value caps Comparison of charges with value caps removed Comparison of charges with an alternative fixed levy Feasibility of collection by a party other than an insurer. Outputs: Tables of winners and losers for residential real property options Tables of winners and losers for household contents options Illustrations of changes in costs for a range of typical households Diagrams showing the economic incidence of costs for rental residential property – comparison with the status quo. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 18 on insurance of commercial assets, where the insurance arrangements are more complex, and the necessary data would need to be gathered from industry sources. Initially we develop a model for the replacement of the insurance-based FSL on residential property with a property-based rates levy applied to the closest match for the current levy base, the value of property improvements, capped at $ 100,000. We explore the effects of varying the cap, removing the cap, and applying a fixed levy. We then extend this model to include the value of household contents by proxy. For light motor vehicles, we apply a model using records of the number of cars, motorcycles and mopeds registered as the base for a registration-based levy in lieu of the current fire-insurance based levy for motor vehicles with GVM under 3 tonnes. We develop tables showing the number of winners and losers from moving from a rates-based levy that matches the current configuration of the insurance-based levy for residential real property and domestic household contents to a number of alternative forms of rates-based levies. We also estimate the number of winners and losers in shifting from vehicle insurance-based levy to a registration-based levy. Finally, we look at the potential gains and losses for some typical households and rental property owners from the proposed changes from insurance-based levies to selected combinations of the rates-based and vehicle registration-based levies. 4.1. Review of residential property data In this section we:  Develop and calibrate a model for estimating revenue for a property- based levy similar to the current insurance-based levy system  Use that model to compare a range of alternative options for levy collection to the base case, keeping the revenue yield constant  Show where the gains and losses occur, within ranges of property values, for moving from the current to alternative options  Show the numbers of winners and losers among residential property owners, for moving from the current to the alternative options. We have obtained data on residential property values throughout New Zealand from PropertyIQ. This is in the form of summary data for the land value, the value of improvements and the total capital value, for all residential properties in bands of $100K of the value of improvements, from $ 1 up to $ 1 million, plus data for properties with zero value of improvements and for values of over $ 1 million. This data is compiled for all rateable residential properties, some of which have multiple dwelling units, and includes both residential and lifestyle block properties, but excludes farm properties. In total, it covers 1.65 million rateable residential properties, of which 1.56 million include improvements. 4.1.1. Estimation of revenue from applying a property-based levy at the current FSL rate We analysed the property improvement values (IV) to determine the total and average IV in each non-zero value band. We then estimated the revenue yield that would be obtained by applying the current FSL rate of $ 0.76 per $ 100 of value (with a cap of $ 100 K) to the property IVs. The results are shown in the following table: NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 19 Table 3 Value of rateable improvements by value band and FSL yield Current FSL equivalent applied at $0.076 per $100 of IV with $100K IV cap applied (max levy $76.00) Value Band (Improvements) Number of Properties Total Dollar Value of Improvements Revenue Yield if the current FSL insurance-based rate is applied No Improvements 85,432 Nil Nil 0 - 100k 292,865 18,391,405,710 13,977,468 100 - 200k 678,693 97,878,946,590 51,580,668 200 - 300k 336,769 81,343,469,250 25,594,444 300 - 400k 142,741 48,474,108,950 10,848,316 400 - 500k 56,771 24,932,151,600 4,314,596 500 - 600k 23,833 12,859,708,250 1,811,308 600 - 700k 11,959 7,665,667,450 908,884 700 - 800k 6,614 4,899,516,000 502,664 800 - 900k 3,929 3,302,808,000 298,604 900 - 1m 2,496 2,346,320,000 189,696 1m + 7,711 12,525,768,000 586,036 All properties 1,649,813 314,619,869,800 110,612,684 Improved only 1,564,381 314,619,869,800 110,612,684 Source: PropertyIQ, NZIER calculations of revenue yield 4.1.2. Sources of difference from current revenue Somewhat surprisingly, the estimated revenue yield from applying a levy at the current rate of the FSL, with the same value cap of $ 100K, would yield just $ 110.6 million, short of the $ 118.5 million reported by the FSC as proceeds of the levy on insured residential property for 2011/12. There are several possible explanations for this difference. Firstly, a proportion of the properties included in the above data includes multiple dwellings, for which we have applied the levy on their capped combined value, whereas the FSL would be applied to each of these dwellings individually, with each unit most likely to be above the levy cap in value. These are properties that have multiple dwelling units held on a common title, rather than separate titles, and include blocks of flats and apartments that have a common owner, as well as home and income properties. The total number of rateable residential properties with improvements, at 1.564 million, is 10.4% less than 1.745 million, the estimated number of dwellings in New Zealand as at the end of June 2012 (Statistics New Zealand, Population Statistics, Private Dwelling Estimates by Tenure, January 2013). Secondly, some property owners currently insure their properties for more than the rateable value, using either private valuations or values based upon estimates of rebuilding costs for insurance purposes. Offsetting that factor, there is a need to recognise that about 5% of properties are likely to be uninsured currently, and are therefore not contributing to the FSL at present. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 20 Thirdly, the Fire Service Commission note that revenue for 2011/12 was $ 17 million higher than expected, owing to increased uptake of insurance, the use of increased insurance values and advances in the timing of payments by some insurers (DIA, Annual Report of the Fire Service Commission, 2011/2012, page 4). There is no breakdown provided to identify the relative contribution of these factors, or to relate the increase to any specific category of insurance. 4.1.3. Our analysis is indicative rather than exact, given the data limitations As we are unable to measure the effect of these factors, we have used the available property data without adjustment, determined the effective yield of the current levy as in Table 3 above, and calibrated our modelling to yield a similar amount of revenue for each option. The overall revenue can be scaled up or down without altering the comparability of the options. With more comprehensive data on the multiple dwelling properties, and access to information about the number and value of insured residential properties, we would be able to do more extensive modelling. 4.2. Our quantitative modelling approach We note that the base for a property-based levy could be land value, value of improvements or the improved capital value. Territorial Authorities in New Zealand determine their rates on different bases, with the improved capital value being the most common. On the grounds that fire protection and fire risk is generally associated with structures (at least in urban areas), we have used the value of improvements (IV) in our modelling. That corresponds most closely to the base for the current fire insurance based levy, which is applied to the value of insured assets. In our analysis and modelling, when comparing with an insurance-based levy, we attempted to allow for an expected 5% non-insurance, biasing this towards lower- value properties. However, that simply reduced the revenue yield to around $ 105 million. This suggests that that many of the insured properties are currently insured for significantly more than their rating improvement value, around 12.5% on average We do not have sufficient information to be able to apply specific adjustments for these effects or to take account of the effect of multiple-dwelling properties that are listed and valued as one improvement. Instead, we accept the property data as given as being representative of the preferred revenue base, and calculate the resultant levies on property values that would be required to match the targeted revenue. We consider the comparison of the levies for different options (current capped value, increased value caps, and flat rate levies on improvements and also on contents) to be more important than the absolute level of levy calculations. With more detailed information on the value of individual dwellings in grouped assessments, we would be able to improve the analysis of all options in comparison with the present levy. Target revenue levels for our comparative analysis For our comparative analysis, we have worked to a common revenue target of $ 110.6 million for the levy on residential real property, and $ 20 million for the levy on domestic household contents. As explained above, these targets differ from the $ 118.5 million raised by the FSL on policies of insurance on residential property in NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 21 2011/12, and of $ 19.9 million raised by the FSL on policies of insurance on domestic household contents (DIA, Report of the Fire Review Panel, December 2012, page 72). For light motor vehicles, we have used the $ 13.8 million reported in the same report for the levy collected in 2011/12 as our revenue target. We have used figures from NZTA for the numbers of light motor vehicles (cars, motorcycles and mopeds, excluding rental cars and taxis) registered in New Zealand as at 30 June 2012 as our alternative base (New Zealand Transport Agency, NZ Motor Vehicle Registration Statistics 2012, page 54). That total is less than the total for non-exempt vehicle fleet numbers for those categories of vehicles also listed by NZTA (ibid, p62). Our choice is influenced by the use of vehicle registration as the base for the alternative charge. 4.2.1. Comparison of status quo and property value based options for residential real property In this section we analyse the economic impact for owners of residential real property in moving from the current insurance-based Fire Service Levy to alternative funding schemes. The first step involves a shift from the fire insurance levy to an alternative that matches the characteristics of that levy as closely as possible. We then explore variations in the funding parameters, including increasing the cap on the value of residential property for which the charge is pro-rated, a no-cap option, and a fixed charge option. Moving from an insured value based to a property value based levy As identified in section 4.1, applying the equivalent of the current FSL on insured values to real property values would yield less revenue, amounting to $ 110.6 million as against the $ 118.5 million reported for the FSL for 2011/12. To produce the full $ 118.5 million revenue would require a fee of $ 0.814 per $ 100 of property value up to a cap of $ 100,000, with a fixed charge above that level, analogous to the current FSL mechanism. The maximum charge would be $ 81.40, against $ 76.00 at present. Clearly the impact for the owner of a property valued above $ 100,000 that is currently insured would be an increase in charges of $ 5.40, while the owner of an equivalent property that is not currently insured would be required to pay $ 81.40. This is a “worst case” result. If the multiple dwelling properties on common rating titles can be identified and separately charged, the maximum charge will reduce, and it is likely that those currently insured will pay a little less than they do at present. That would require an increase of at least 8% in the number of assessable properties. For the analysis that follows, we assume a common revenue target of $ 110.6 million. Effect of variation in the value cap One recommendation from the Fire Review Panel was that it would be desirable to estimate the effect of increasing the cap on the value of domestic property used for the calculation of the Fire Service Levy. While that recommendation was tied to an insurance-based levy, it can be applied equally well to any property value based levy. The present ceiling was set in 1993, when provisions were inserted into the Fire Service Act, replicating the previous basis for assessing and collecting the earthquake premium and fire levies as a single charge. At that time, about 75% of residential properties were valued at less than the $ 100,000 ceiling to which both the earthquake and fire levies applied. On today’s values, the ceiling would need to be NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 22 raised to between $ 200,000 and $ 300,000 to include a comparable percentage of dwellings. Increasing the value cap would reduce the levy rate per $ 100 of property value, leading to a reduction in the levy payable by owners of lower-value properties. At one extreme, an uncapped value for the levy would lead to the lowest cost for owners of cheaper properties, but would lead to owners of more expensive properties paying a lot more. The opposite effect would result from a flat and fixed levy, where owners of cheaper properties would pay more than at present, while owners of most properties would pay less. In our analysis, we have modelled the effect of increasing the value cap from the fire insurance levy property value equivalent of $ 100,000 to $ 200, 000 and $ 300,000. We have also modelled the effect of changing to an uncapped levy, and to a fixed rate levy. All of these are related to the residential property value of improvements. Modelling results - average levies by property value band The following table summarises the average levy payable within each value band, obtained from our modelling of the alternative forms of property-based levy.

The actual means have been used in our calculations of the required levies. In each case, the total revenue raised by the levy is close to $ 110.6 million. We have not included mixed strategies, such as a proportion of revenue being collected as a fixed-rate levy and a proportion as a capped or uncapped variable rate levy. Such an option would reduce result in levies intermediate between those for the components from which it is constructed. We note that a composite levy approach involving both fixed and variable components has been adopted by the NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 23 Australian State of Victoria for its property rates based fire service levy to be introduced from 1 July 2013. Gains and losses from changes in the levy structure In assessing policy options, it is more informative to consider the change in the levy payable, relative to the current levy, rather than the absolute level of levy. The following table show the average gain or loss for the average value property within each value band for the different options, relative to the current $ 100,000 value cap. Table 5 Average property levy changes relative to the status quo Negative values indicate a levy reduction and positive values an increase in the levy Value Band $000 Current Value Cap $ 100 K Higher Value Cap $ 200 K Higher Value Cap $ 300 K No Cap on Value Fixed Rate Levy 0 - 100 $ 0.00 -$ 18.15 -$ 22.42 -$ 25.62 $ 22.97 100 - 200 $ 0.00 -$ 8.07 -$ 17.88 -$ 25.24 -$ 5.30 200 - 300 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 21.34 $ 9.02 -$ 5.30 300 - 400 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 43.54 -$ 5.30 400 – 500 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 78.59 -$ 5.30 500 - 600 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 113.93 -$ 5.30 600 – 700 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 149.63 -$ 5.30 700 – 800 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 184.75 -$ 5.30 800 – 900 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 219.90 -$ 5.30 900 – 1,000 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 254.89 -$ 5.30 Over 1,000 $ 0.00 $ 18.20 $ 44.90 $ 495.79 -$ 5.30 Source: PropertyIQ data, NZIER analysis Again, note that if mixed strategies are included, the gains and losses may be differently distributed. For instance, a 50% fixed rate and 50% variable rate levy would result in a small average gain ($ 1.33) for the lowest value band property owners, and halve the potential added cost for owners of high value properties. Numbers of winners and losers from changes in the levy structure In order to gain public acceptance, a policy change should desirably create more “winners” who benefit from the change than “losers” who are adversely impacted. Desirably, there should be significantly more winners than losers if the new policy is adopted. At the same time, the costs for the worst losers need to be affordable. The analysis to produce tables of winners and losers is a little more complex than might be expected, as there are some losers in value bands that have an average gain, and some winners in bands that have an average loss, for some of the options. Where there are both winners and losers in some property value bands, we have calculated the net number of winners or losers. The following table shows the net numbers of winners and losers among property owners by value band and overall. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 24 Table 6 Numbers of winners and losers among property owners from moving to other options relative to the status quo Positive numbers are net winners; negative numbers (shown in red) are net losers within each band Value Band $000 Current Value Cap $ 100 K Higher Value Cap $ 200 K Higher Value Cap $ 300 K No Cap on Value Fixed Rate Levy 0 - 100 0 292,865 292,865 292,865 -252,018 100 - 200 0 154,183 523,756 678,693 678,693 200 - 300 0 -336,769 -336,769 229,615 336,769 300 - 400 0 -142,741 -142,741 -142,741 142,741 400 – 500 0 -56,771 -56,771 -56,771 56,771 500 - 600 0 -23,833 -23,833 -23,833 23,833 600 – 700 0 -11,959 -11,959 -11,959 11,959 700 – 800 0 -6,614 -6,614 -6,614 6,614 800 – 900 0 -3,929 -3,929 -3,929 3,929 900 – 1,000 0 -2,496 -2,496 -2,496 2,496 Over 1,000 0 -7,711 -7,711 -7,711 7,711 Overall net total 0 -145,775 223,798 945,119 1,019,498 Source: PropertyIQ data, NZIER analysis Based upon the above analysis, an increase in the value cap to at least $ 240K would be needed to guarantee a net positive number of winners, while a greater number of winners would be created through an uncapped levy, although for some owners the costs would be quite high (see table 5). The greatest net number of winners would result from applying a fixed-rate levy, although the adverse impact under that option falls entirely on owners of lower-value properties (valued at up to $ 93,000). Again, note that adopting a mixed strategy would change the distribution of winners and losers. It may or may not be possible to devise a mixed strategy that increases the number of net winners relative to the pure options. A half fixed-rate and half uncapped levy strategy would produce fewer net winners than either option alone. There may be concerns about the ability of some property owners to pay these charges. We note that the Victorian Government plans to allow holders of concession cards a deduction of $ 50 from the cost of the new property-based fire levies, for their primary residence. A similar approach could be applied in New Zealand. Alternatively, the thresholds for the existing rates rebate scheme could be adjusted to protect low income households by compensating them for any increase in their fire service levies. If their properties are currently insured, the costs should be minimal, unless and uncapped levy were to be introduced, when some impecunious owners of expensive properties would struggle to pay the increased amount. That is one reason to be cautious about adopting any uncapped-value rates-based levy. The cost of any concession on the property-based fire service levy could be recovered by a small increase in the levy rate applied. As identified in the following section, there is sufficient margin between the required minimum value of a fixed NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 25 levy and that of the current levy to allow for the levy to be set at an intermediate rate that would both generate additional revenue and cover the cost of concessions. We note that the Victorian Government reforms will apply the levy to the capital value of residential property, including both land value and value of improvements. Following such an approach would expand the levy base and reduce the levy rate, but to the extent that higher-value houses and apartments tend to be built on more expensive land, the incidence of the levy will not shift. One exception will be for undeveloped land, and for properties where development is progressing in stages, where a capital value based levy would cost more than an improvement value based levy. 4.2.2. Comparison of status quo and feasible options for household domestic contents For household contents, we use the residential property values as a proxy base, and model the application of the existing value cap on contents as a parallel to that. We also model a fixed charge for domestic contents. Our modelling of the value of household contents assumes that the value of contents varies with the value of the property, at least over the lower value range. Given the current $ 20,000 cap on the value for applying the fire service levy to insured contents, and the $ 100,000 value cap for applying the levy to insured residential properties, we have assumed a proportional relationship between the value of contents and the value of the property up to those cap limits. Thus, we assume that a property valued at $60,000 will have contents valued at $ 12,000, and one valued at $120,000 will have contents valued at above $ 20,000. We use this relationship to compare the status quo (a levy of $ 0.076 per $ 100 of value up to a cap of $ 20,000, resulting in a maximum levy of $ 15.20) with the application of a flat rate levy that would raise the same $ 20 million from 1.56 million residential properties with improvements. That results in a fixed levy of $ 12.78 per property. We do not have confidence that the proportionality between the value of residential property and value of contents would be valid of an extended range, particularly as there are multiple dwelling properties included in the higher value ranges. Therefore, we have not analysed the alternative of applying a higher value cap to contents. Given that the object of this analysis is to determine a feasible basis for replacing the fire insurance levy with a residential property based levy, and that the rating value base does not include information about the value of contents, we are modelling the simplest approach, which is the application of a fixed levy, to be collected along with (essentially as part of) the levy on residential property. In the specific case where a fixed levy is adopted for residential property, the levy could simply be increased to cover the contribution in respect of household contents. The following table shows the distribution by value band of the fixed levy for contents, and how it would compare to the fixed levy on property: NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 26 Table 7 Average levies for property and for contents, current capped value levies compared with fixed rate levies Value Band $000 Combined Assets Current Value Cap Property $ 100 K Current Value Cap Contents $ 20 K Fixed Rate Levy Property Fixed Rate Levy Contents Levy (per $100) $ 0.076 $ 0.076 Fixed $ 70.70 Fixed $ 12.78 0 - 120 $ 47.73 $ 9.50 $ 70.70 $ 12.78 Over 120 $ 76.00 $ 15.20 $ 70.70 $ 12.78 Source: PropertyIQ statistics, NZIER analysis For the majority of properties, a combined fixed rate levy would amount to $ 83.48, compared to the combined capped rate levy of $ 91.20 that is equivalent to the present fire insurance based levies. The saving of $ 7.72 is small, in both absolute and relative terms. For properties valued below $ 100,000, the results are less favourable. Initially, the net benefit of moving to fixed levies reduces as the property and contents value decrease. For properties valued at under $ 91,500 (with contents valued at less than $ 18,300), there would be a net cost if a fixed levy were adopted. At the mean value, that would be $ 36.25. However, a significant proportion of such properties are unlikely to be making any contribution through an insurance-based levy at present. For properties that are currently not insured, the imposition of a combined fixed-rate levy would cost the owners $ 83.48 per year. That is not an unreasonable amount to pay for fire service protection, including having prompt assistance on call for fire and non-fire emergencies. At the moment, only those insured pay the $ 91.20 per year. There is potentially a case to be made for increasing the rate of a fixed-rate residential property levy to a rounded level of $ 90 per year, or for extending it to include vacant residential land, where that land is currently subject to rating. The former would increase the fixed levy revenue by 7.8%, and the latter would bring an additional 85,000 properties into the levy base, increasing the yield of the fixed levy by 5.4%. Together, those changes would raise an additional $ 17.7 million in revenue. 4.2.3. Comparison of status quo and options for light motor vehicle contributions to funding NZFS For light motor vehicles, we have used the $ 13.8 million reported by the NZFSC for the levy collected in 2011/12 as our revenue target (DIA, Annual Report of the New Zealand Fire Service Commission, 2011/12). We have used figures from NZTA for the numbers of light motor vehicles (cars, motorcycles and mopeds, excluding rental cars and taxis) registered in New Zealand as at 30 June 2012 as our alternative base (New Zealand Transport Agency, NZ Motor Vehicle Registration Statistics 2012, page 54). We have modelled a fixed charge as part of the registration fee, but have not modelled a variable charge based upon levies on vehicle fuel or Road User Charges. The following table compares the current Fire Service Levy on insured light vehicles to the option of funding through a levy on annual vehicle registration: NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 27 Table 8 Comparing levy bases for Light Motor Vehicles Current Levy applied on Insured Vehicles Proposed Levy applied on Registered Vehicles Base number of vehicles (under 3.5 tonnes) 2,296,737 (calculated from levy data) 2,395,562 (cars, motorcycles, mopeds only) Levy Rate, per vehicle $ 6.08 $ 5.76 Revenue Yield, million $ 13.8 $ 13.8 Source: NZFSC, NZTA data, NZIER calculations Even without including light trucks and other types of vehicle that may be subject to this levy, in addition to those listed, the number of registered vehicles is greater than the apparent number of insured vehicles. That is not surprising, as the current levy is applied only to vehicles which have fire cover included in their insurance. While owners of 2.3 million vehicles will experience a reduction in their costs, owners of an estimated 100,000 vehicles that are not subject to the current levy will pay the new fee. With a change to the registration base, the annual per vehicle levy will be reduced from the current $ 6.08 to a maximum of $ 5.76, or less if more vehicles (light trucks and vans that are privately used) are eligible for inclusion in this category. 4.2.4. Examples of the impact of changes to the levy base on households and on rental properties Using some of the options identified above, we look at the expected annual financial impact of moving from the present fire-insurance based levy to property-based levies for a range of households, and also for owners and occupiers of domestic rental property. The chosen options are the application of a property-based levy capped at $ 100 K, the application of a levy capped at $ 300 K, and the application of a fixed levy. For contents, we use the current $ 20 K insured-value cap as a basis for comparison with a fixed levy included as part of the property-based levy. For motor vehicles, a fixed registration-based levy is applied. The tables that follow show the impact of these changes on four different households, three owning their properties and one renting, with differing values of properties and contents, and differing numbers of vehicles. It is assumed that the properties are all insured (the rental property being insured by the landlord, with costs recovered in the rent), but the insurance status of the contents and vehicles varies from case to case. Two further tables cover different situations for landlords. One has two rental flats as part of a single rateable property, while the other owns three rental apartments on separate titles. The landlords are assumed to be seeking to recover costs in the rent.

The larger costs are associated with higher value properties with the $ 300 K capped value option. Only the owners of the $ 150 K apartment are better off under that option. However, the increased property-related costs under this option do not exceed $ 43 per year or 83 cents per week per dwelling. The results with the $ 100 K value cap and with the fixed rate levy move in the same direction in all cases. The fixed rate levy produces smaller costs and larger savings than the $ 100 K value cap option. That is why this is the preferred option. The motor vehicle differences are small, but impose costs for owners of vehicles that are not currently insured, and provide modest savings for owners of insured vehicles. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 31 4.3. Comment on recommendations of the Fire Review Panel on changes to the Levy Although they recommended the retention of insurance-based levies for real property and commercial assets, the Fire Review Panel made a number of recommendations for changing aspects of the Fire Service Levy: Recommendation 52 That appropriate agencies of central government, including those with policy responsibilities for the transport sector, be charged with the design of a mechanism to attract a contribution from the transport sector toward the costs of maintaining and operating New Zealand’s fire services for their fire and rescue roles. Recommendation 53 That the Fire Service levy provisions and other funding arrangements be amended to:  shift the levy base for non-residential property from a levy on the amount for which property is insured to a levy on premiums;  extend the levy base for non-residential property from contracts of fire insurance to all contracts of material damage;  retain the present levy arrangements for residential and personal property but with the caps adjusted from their 1994 levels to the equivalent levels in the property market today;  attract an appropriate contribution from the transport sector; and  continue to have the discretion to charge for services delivered, with the exception of attendances at fires and other emergencies for which fire services are pre-funded under the new funding arrangements. Assessing the feasibility of implementing the FRP recommendations The evidence in this report leads to the following responses: Recommendation 52 We note that the FSL contribution from insurance on light motor vehicles was $ 13.8 million and from commercial motor vehicles $ 13.0 million in 2011/12. These sums could more easily be raised by fixed charges on annual registration for light motor vehicles, and a component of Road User Charges for heavy motor vehicles. The provision of any further contribution would need to be justified by modelling of the benefits of fire and rescue services attributable to the road transport sector. We note that the costs of responding to and dealing with emergencies involving dangerous goods and other hazardous substances are recoverable from the parties concerned. With 2.4 million light motor vehicles registered in 2011/12, a fee of $5.76 per vehicle would suffice. This compares with the current $6.08 per vehicle levy on light vehicles insured for fire. With Road User Charges currently raising $1,045 million in 2011/12, the collection of an additional $13.0 million would require an element representing an addition of just 1.2%. That should not lead to any adverse reaction from the road transport industry. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 32 Recommendation 53 Note the following:  A move to a levy based on insurance premiums rather than property values for commercial insurance would tend to lock-in the present system for funding the FSL through insurances, and make it more difficult to shift to another base. Further, insurance premiums can be discounted when the insured accepts a share of the insurance risk, which may or may not reflect the fire risk.  Actions to ameliorate fire risk may or may not be reflected in material damage insurance premiums. Different businesses will have different mixes of perils that need to be covered by insurance, and fire may be major or minor in the mix.  We have modelled the effect of varying the caps on residential property, but in the context of a property-based levy rather than an insurance- based levy. The results can be translated to an insurance base, but any change would make it more difficult to move away from an insurance- based levy in future.  The options involving a change in the levy cap (option 3) are inferior to other options, including that of applying a fixed levy (option 2), the mixed funding model (option 4), and funding through general taxation (option 1).  As identified, there is potential to increase the transport contribution through a dedicated fee element within Road User Charges, which currently raise more than $ 1 billion in revenue per year. However, that would require justification.  Again as identified, there are specific categories of incident where the Fire Service can charge for provision of its services. The cost of the increasing proportion of non-fire non-vehicle call-outs should be funded through general taxation, as part of a mixed funding model, with such costs identified. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 33 5. Summary of results Our analysis identified that the first best option is to have the NZFS funded entirely from general taxation. The timing may not be right for this option to be adopted immediately given the government’s commitment to fiscal deficit reduction. If this option is not considered acceptable by other parties, then as a second best we recommend a mixed funding model that includes:  direct government funding  flat or variable levies on the full value of commercial property  flat or variable fees on domestic property collected through rates  flat fees on light motor vehicles collected as part of motor vehicle registration  variable fees on heavy motor vehicles collected through the Road User Charge. Direct public funding should be provided to cover non-fire non-vehicle emergency services and the Crown share of costs for protection of state property. This line of reasoning is consistent with the thrust of the consensus view from previous reports. Changes could be introduced as one comprehensive package, once the fiscal position allows, or could be phased in over time, as outlined in section 3.4 above. Our quantitative analysis of options suggests that flat fees are feasible and preferable to variable fees on residential real property:  Adopting either a flat fee or an uncapped variable fee would lead to around 1 million property owners paying less than under the current system (for those who are currently insured), while raising the same amount of revenue, or even up to 10% more revenue  A flat fee would lead to owners of cheaper properties paying more than at present, while an uncapped variable fee would lead to owners of more expensive properties paying a lot more than at present  If variable property-based fees are introduced, a value cap should be at $ 300,000, to adjust for changes in relative property values since the current $ 100,000 cap was set, and to achieve a favourable ratio of winners to losers, without over-burdening higher value properties.  The rates rebate system could be extended to protect those on low incomes from the impact of the change, with costs covered by the fee. The present levy on insurance of household domestic assets should be subsumed into the flat or variable property-based levy:  The total impost with both of these collected as a flat fee would be less than the current levy paid by owners who insure their property for $ 100,000 or more and contents for $ 20,000 or more  A combined flat fee of $ 90 per year per dwelling would raise more revenue than the current levies on insurance of residential property and domestic contents. For light motor vehicles, a flat charge included as part of the annual registration fee should be adopted to replace the current levy on vehicle fire insurance policies:  A flat fee of $ 5.76 per vehicle would raise as much revenue as the current flat levy of $ 6.08 on fire insurance contracts for light motor vehicles. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 34 Overall the results show that moving from the current system of insurance-based funding to a property-based fixed-rate levy would generate net savings in cost for around 1 million of the current 1.6 million residential property owners, relative to the cost of the current levy, while imposing only modest cost increases for other owners. Vehicle registration based funding would be spread over an additional 100,000 owners, compared to the present insurance-based system, reducing costs for the 2.3 million current contributors, with only nominal costs imposed on non-contributors. NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 35 6. Recommendations The recommendations that flow from our analysis are as follows: 1. that the fire services should be funded entirely from general taxation, as a long term objective if not immediately feasible. 2. that as a minimum, the non-fire non-vehicle emergency services provided by the fire services should be funded from general taxation 3. that the present levies on fire insurance contracts for residential properties and household domestic contents should be replaced by a flat fee on each dwelling unit, to be collected by territorial authorities through the rating system 4. that if flat levies are not acceptable, then a single variable levy on the value of residential property with a value cap of $ 300,000 be applied in lieu of current fire insurance levies on both residential property and household contents, and collected by territorial authorities through the rating system 5. that the present levy on contracts that include fire insurance for light motor vehicles be replaced by a flat fee to be collected by NZTA as part of the motor vehicle registration fee 6. that a strong selling point is that broadening of the revenue base through the above recommendations would reduce the average costs for around 1 million property owners and 2.3 million vehicle owners while those owners currently evading the FSL would face modest cost increases of less than three dollars per week (for one high-value property and three vehicles under the capped levy option, less with the flat levy option) 7. that the present levy on contracts that include fire insurance for heavy motor vehicles be replaced by a component of Road User Charges, with that change generating a minor (less than 1.3%) increase in the level of those charges 8. that the share of fire service funding attributable to commercial real and other property should be based on a set of standardised risk-adjusted property values, rather than avoidable valuation bases such as the present insurance value base 9. that further work is needed to determine a fair and appropriate basis for determining the fire service contributions relating to commercial property, both fixed and movable, and whether there is a better agent for collecting the contributions than the insurers of those assets.

NZIER report -Better ways of funding fire services in New Zealand 37 Appendix A – Data analysis methods, tables and charts A.1 Evaluation and ranking of the selected options for replacement of the Fire Service Levy on residential real property, household domestic contents and motor vehicles The chart on the following two pages shows the results of the evaluation and ranking exercise comparing the status quo and the four options for replacement of the Fire Service Levy on insurance of residential real property, household domestic contents and light motor vehicles. These are more fully explained in section 3.2 of the report. Options 2 and 3 each have sub-option components that are evaluated separately and these options are then assigned an overall score against each measure (criterion, category or overview) based on the average of the scores of those components. The status quo and options The alternatives that have been compared are: The Status Quo Indemnity value based levy on fire insurance policies Option 1 General taxation as the only source of funding Option 2 Fixed levies on dwellings, contents, and light motor vehicles Option 3 Variable levies on dwellings, contents, light motor vehicles Option 4 A mix of general taxation and flat levies (options 1 and 2) Scoring method The scoring is based upon our assessment of the relative merit of each alternative on each of the 13 criteria. In general, we awarded 10 points if we could not identify any significant limitation for a component or option, and reduced the score according to our assessment of departures from that ideal. Minor impairments led to a score in the range 7 – 9, more significant challenges to scores in the range 5 – 8, and severe challenges to scores in the range 1 – 4. The narrative in section 3.2.1 incorporates the thinking behind this scoring method in its discussion of the comparative results. We include a table summarising the factors applied in the scoring after the next chart. Graphical presentation (next two pages) The following chart compares the status quo with other options and sub-options. We use a colour scale ranging from red for the worst alternative to green for the best alternative to provide for a visual comparison of the sub-options and options for each category – fairness, efficiency, legitimacy and cost-effectiveness - and also for the comparison of the average scores for each sub-option and option on all 13 criteria. The summary chart included as Figure 2 in section 3.2 above uses the same average scores and rankings as are included in this chart.

Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document February 2019 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 25 October 2018 To Members of the Tax Working Group   We understand that you are looking for ideas that can be used to deliver benefit to business taxpayers when you recommend to Government a package(s) for tax reform.   The Tax Pooling Intermediary Association (TPIA) will shortly submit to Inland Revenue the attached document, suggesting ways that pooling can be used more innovatively. Among other things, this will address taxpayers’ cashflow requirements, and we expect will assist Inland Revenue to manage its debt book more effectively, and prevent small and medium sized taxpayers getting into sizeable tax debt positions.  The purpose of sharing this with the Tax Working Group is to illustrate how Inland Revenue could create a better business environment for taxpayers through a more relaxed application of an existing regime. This will be of particular benefit to small and medium taxpayers.    We have seen how Inland Revenue’s launch of the AIM regime, which was meant to be a benefit to taxpayers, has not resonated with tax agents or SMEs as it is seen as being overly complex. AIM is a regime built around intermediaries (the approved software providers).  IR is now looking at ways that it can relax the constraints it has built around AIM.  In the same way, we think that relaxing the very tight constraints they have built around the pooling regime will enable more taxpayers to access the regime, with a benefit to all.  Our recommendation is that, in assessing ways to improve the tax compliance framework for business, the Tax Working Group suggests that IR actively look for ways in which it can remove unnecessary constraints around intermediary-based regimes, and give the private sector the opportunity to deliver compliance services more effectively.  Best regards,  Josh Taylor, Chair The Tax Pooling Intermediary Association represents   PwC Tax Pooling Solutions, Tax Traders and Tax Management New Zealand. PO Box 74479, Greenlane, Auckland 1546 \[1\] \[1\] 1 Improving taxpayer engagement for   Inland Revenue through tax pooling PROPOSAL FOR INLAND REVENUE • OCT 2018 Building on a strong foundation Tax pooling is a progressive framework established by Inland Revenue (IR) in 2001, to help taxpayers meet their provisional tax obligations. 1 There has been a strong uptake from the business sector in subsequent years, and significant benefits delivered to IR and the economy. Tax pooling is now an established and respected part of the New Zealand tax system. The Tax Pooling Intermediary Association (TPIA) – representing PwC Tax Pooling Solutions, Tax Traders and Tax Management New Zealand– is committed to working collaboratively with IR to build on this solid foundation, maximising benefits for IR and taxpayers. We believe there is a considerable opportunity for IR to advance its Business Transformation objectives through a stronger partnership with tax pooling intermediaries, to strengthen taxpayer engagement and compliance. TPIA supports Inland Revenue’s goal to progress toward a more flexible, customer- centric approach. There are core aspects of the tax pooling model that directly promote this: ‣We act as intermediaries (similar to payroll intermediaries), providing a useful buffer between taxpayers and IR. ‣IR receives the right amount of tax at the right time, however the delay in determining which taxpayers this tax is ultimately allocated to provides a high-value benefit to taxpayers – in terms of timing, reduced cost and reduced uncertainty. ‣The system is generally very efficient and well-resourced, thus providing timely outcomes for taxpayers. See Appendices: ‘How Tax Pooling Works’ and ‘The History of Tax Pooling’ 1 2 Strengthening taxpayer engagement   for Inland Revenue Tax pool intermediaries facilitate the collection of tax for IR, ensuring tax is paid in full and on time. In the process, taxpayer experience is positively enhanced with direct benefits for Inland Revenue. Tax pooling increases public goodwill toward IR Tax pooling makes compliance easier for some taxpayers. In addition, taxpayers perceive they are getting a slight discount when paying through a tax pool. AS A RESULT: Taxpayers feel better about paying their tax because they perceive IR as more customer-centric and easy to deal with, including faster response times. This increases taxpayer engagement and willingness to comply in the future. Taxpayers feel understood and supported by IR Tax pool intermediaries provide a ‘soft face’ in the collections process. The significance of this is hard to overstate. Whilst the vast majority of taxpayers want to comply and pay their fair share, unfortunately positive cashflow doesn’t always align with IR’s timeframes. When this occurs, taxpayers don’t want to feel unduly penalised, and compulsion can lead to resentment. As a counter, the provision of payment timing accommodation through tax pool intermediaries offers an excellent solution. For these taxpayers it is a valued option that still provides IR full payment on time. AS A RESULT: Taxpayers feel genuinely supported by IR and are more likely to be in a position to contribute productively to the economy in the years ahead. This also does not put the business/taxpayer under unnecessary financial stress as they can then pay their provisional tax when their cashflow allows. 3 Ancillary benefits of tax pooling for IR As intermediaries, we deliver these benefits to IR at no charge – actively supporting IR’s objectives to reduce costs and increase collection efficiencies, including: 1. Saving IR staff time, resource and manpower ‣ Less IR staff time spent on complex cases and answering taxpayer questions ‣ Valuable taxpayer feedback is gathered for IR and new IR policy implemented ‣ Improved management of payments is achieved within agreed timeframes, without the need for IR to chase or follow up taxpayers. This also removes the need for taxpayers to contact IR seeking payment arrangements. 2. Increasing revenue generation ‣ Flexible options for taxpayers increases IR revenue receipts by providing further compliance avenues ‣ In dollar terms, the vast majority of provisional and terminal taxpayers choose to pay IR via tax pool intermediaries. (More than $10 billion is currently held in tax pools.) ‣ Less than 1% of taxpayers who tax pool default on payments. 3. Helping to fuel the economy ‣ Money saved through tax pooling is reinvested by the taxpayer into their businesses to increase profit, invested in housing and commodities. This promotes economic growth and increases the government’s future Income Tax and GST revenue. Supporting IR business transformation Building on this strong foundation we can optimise benefits for IR, supporting your goal to become more taxpayer-centric, flexible and current in your approach. We understand this goal is ongoing and comes with inevitable challenges for large organisations like IR, due to the sheer scale of your customer connections. We encourage IR to consider the substantial value of creating a platform on which tax pooling intermediaries can continually innovate, to help achieve your objectives.  4 Ways to derive further utility for IR At the point taxpayers engage with a tax pool intermediary, they want to comply – albeit, some may have been in a state of non-compliance. If tax pooling can be a vehicle to get tax payers back to a compliant state, this offers a fundamental benefit for IR and the Government. We regularly see taxpayers wanting to comply that don’t fit current strict tax pooling criteria. Listed below (together with further detail in Appendix C) are meritorious cases for your consideration that would be of significant benefit to helping small and medium sized businesses. We have highlighted the issues and benefits briefly here but would welcome the opportunity to discuss these with you more fully following our upcoming meeting. We would also be interested in any other IR objectives to consider whether tax pooling can be used to provide a solution to meeting those objectives: ‣Tagging tax pool users in IR system so agents and IR can see they have a tax pool relationship. The benefit here is that it should stop the automatic transfer of refunds to offset income tax and stop provisional payment follow up letters and debt follow up letters that don’t acknowledge arrangements already made through tax pooling. Avoiding these situations will save considerable rework for all parties and reduce taxpayer uncertainty. We understand that this function or feature is already planned to be implemented in IR’s April 2019 income tax release to the START system. ‣Acknowledgements on payment reminders and debt letters that they can be disregarded if arrangements have been made through a tax pool. This again would reduce uncertainty and compliance costs because many taxpayers currently spend time and cost confirming the validity of their tax pool payments when they receive reminders that don’t acknowledge tax pooling. ‣Softening the hard deadlines for tax pool use   (Filing requirements and time requirements). Historically the concern has been that allowing tax pooling for a wider range of cases would open the floodgates to non-compliance. IR has in recent years significantly reduced the incidence of late payment penalties without seeing a jump in non-compliance. The further savings to taxpayers from allowing tax pooling to further assist only provides at most an incidental inducement to further non-compliance when viewed against the removal of late payment penalties that has already taken place. 5 ‣Authentication to act of behalf of taxpayers. At present tax pools have no standing to receive taxpayer specific information. While we understand the reasons for IR being sensitive with data we believe there is scope for a limited level of disclosure to enable timely resolution of tax pooling transactions and that would be consistent with data security given the implied consent of taxpayers to assist in finalising their tax positions. We understand that this function or feature should be available in IR’s April 2019 release 3 to the START system by enabling more than one intermediary to interact with IR in relation to a taxpayer. ‣IR being more proactive in acknowledging and recommending tax pooling as a compliance tool.   Given that IR established tax pooling to promote compliance and given its acceptance by taxpayers, we believe it can only aid future compliance for IR to be more proactive in acknowledging and recommending tax pooling as a payment option. It results in the full amount of tax being paid and paid on time with minimal engagement required from IR. 6 Appendix A: How tax pooling works Tax pooling is the framework Inland Revenue established in 2001 to help taxpayers meet their provisional tax obligations. The tax pooling system is based on taxpayers who pay provisional tax into a ‘pool’ at Inland Revenue. Once taxpayers know exactly what they need to pay in provisional tax, they transfer this out of the pool to their Inland Revenue account and sell any surplus to someone else (typically for a fee greater than the Inland Revenue credit interest rate they would otherwise receive). At all times the tax has been with Inland Revenue on the due dates, but tax pooling allows for a delay in the final attribution of those payments to specific tax payers. A taxpayer faced with an underpayment can then acquire those surpluses for a fee less than the Inland Revenue debit interest rate. When these surpluses are transferred from the pool to the taxpayer’s Inland Revenue account it is like a transfer from a related party, so Inland Revenue considers it a payment made on time and therefore there is nothing further to pay. Any interest or late payment penalty charges on the taxpayer’s account are usually eliminated at the same time. Surpluses can be acquired from the pool whether you put tax into the pool or not. Surpluses can only be sold if they’ve been deposited into the pool initially. Acquisition of additional tax can be done in advance (finance) or after the provisional date (buy), and surplus tax can either be sold over time (sell) or refunded within a matter of days. 7 Appendix B: The history of tax pooling The challenge When Inland Revenue introduced the provisional tax regime, there were no penalties or interest costs if you paid late. So that’s what most people did. This prompted Inland Revenue in 1987 to impose an interest rate regime that would encourage compliance. People were charged high interest rates (currently 8.22%) when they underpaid or late paid, but only received low interest rates (currently 1.02%) when they overpaid. The big criticism of this framework through the 1990s was that it made no distinction between the relative business risks of whether a taxpayer would actually pay, and the taxpayer’s compliance history. New system (2003) The challenge was that Inland Revenue was not well placed to manage different interest rates for different taxpayers. They recognised that it was the private sector that was better able to provide and maintain this degree of flexibility, and so in response to this Inland Revenue introduced tax pooling, a public/private solution to a shared problem. Inland Revenue wanted to retain the incentive structure of its interest regime but provide accommodation to compliant taxpayers. Meanwhile taxpayers wanted a less costly and more flexible means of complying with their obligations, and tax pooling intermediaries could provide that. Tax pooling Inland Revenue put the framework in place and there are now three large scale intermediaries operating across the country to facilitate settlements between taxpayers. Indeed, the majority of provisional tax obligations with IR are now settled through tax pools. Taxpayers end up better off because they can obtain more interest on overpaid tax and have outstanding tax obligations satisfied at a lower cost than they otherwise could. Meanwhile Inland Revenue is happy because outstanding tax debts are satisfied. Rather than refund old payments and receive new ones, they simply allow an existing payment to be applied elsewhere. 8 Appendix C: Further detail on meritorious cases With the exception of Point 6 below, the meritorious cases in this table primarily concern SME taxpayers. These cases highlight areas where tax pooling could (but is not currently) providing an efficient and easily accessible route back to becoming tax compliant. If some of these changes were restricted to SME taxpayers (which could be done by making them available to taxpayers under a turnover threshold) this would mitigate the risk to the tax base as any individual incidence of non-payment would be relatively small. As a further measure, IR could retain the ability to compel settlement through a tax pool within a certain time frame upon becoming aware of the debt, eg within 120 days of filing, for example. The turnover threshold and time frames and could be set by Order in Council so that it provides flexibility to IR to adjust them as it sees fit.  This would also assist in ensuring that any changes remain firmly focused on increasing compliance. Suggested Change Expected Outcomes 1 Allow tax pooling to be used for voluntary disclosures even if an original return has not been filed / original assessment issued, with appropriate safeguards. These may include: a.Requiring any voluntary disclosure to be a "pre or post- audit notification voluntary disclosure" to be able to use tax pooling (i.e. cannot use if an assessment from an audit and no voluntary disclosure). b.Guidelines on how long is acceptable before a voluntary disclosure should be made after becoming aware of the issue. c.Requiring the taxpayer and/or their accountant/tax agent to sign a statutory declaration stating the date on which the error/unpaid tax became known to the taxpayer/tax agent (possibly requiring evidence to be provided – e.g. correspondence); possibly include as part of the voluntary disclosure requirements. d.Impose shortfall penalties where there has been an unacceptable delay (based on the guidelines) in making a voluntary disclosure after becoming aware of the issue. ‣ Encourage compliance and voluntary disclosures of tax not paid where no original return/assessment has been filed/issued, mainly where taxpayer did not realise they had a tax obligation ‣ Increased tax revenue collection, particularly tax liabilities not known by IR ‣ Appropriate publicity push could result in significant tax revenue early on ‣ Tax deposits already in tax pools will permanently transfer to IR 9 2 Alter the restrictions and timing deadlines on when tax pooling can be used, with appropriate safeguards. ‣ Allow instalment payment arrangements beyond current time restrictions so taxpayers remain ‘good taxpayers’ but have cash-flow issues. ‣ Increased tax revenue collection. ‣ Keep taxpayers in habit of meeting their tax obligations that is aligned with their business needs. ‣ Improved public image of IR of working with taxpayers to help them meet their tax obligations. 3 Allow taxpayers with tax debt to enter into payment plans using tax pooling intermediaries. ‣ Assist taxpayers with increasing and sometimes overwhelming tax debt to become good taxpayers and establish pattern of compliance. ‣ Use private sector resources to collect more recent tax debt, so IR can use its collection powers and resources to focus on older more difficult debt. 4 Amend the AIM method to give taxpayers the option to: a.Use the existing AIM method process – this works for businesses that have steady regular income that matches cash-flow eg property rental businesses. b.Allow taxpayers to elect to use tax pooling when using AIM with amended rules. Taxpayers: a.Will continue to file regular taxable income statements. b.Will not pay tax direct to IR and are not eligible for any refunds from IR during the tax year. c.Must have made a tax finance arrangement (which would show up in IR records). ‣ Better perception of IR by taxpayer customers that IR understands business and their issues ‣ Increased compliance by taxpayers in paying their provisional tax – because they feel better paying tax when they are able, and not causing stress when they can’t afford to pay ‣ Better real time information of regularly submitted taxable income statements ‣ Less likely to result in small businesses (or other cash-flow constrained businesses) from falling over by trying to meet tax liabilities at times when they have no cash – particularly seasonal businesses. 10 5 Lessen the strictness of the 60 day and 75 day deadlines and facilitate the ability to finance reassessment tax Currently, taxpayers are required to transfer purchased tax from their tax pooling account to the taxpayer's IRD account within 75 days after terminal tax date. This default date should remain as there has to be a line in the sand where the Government knows what its income from tax for the year is. A similar issue arises for reassessments where taxpayers have to transfer their tax to the IRD within 60 days after the issue of a reassessment. Some taxpayers cannot find sources of cash to pay the full reassessment amount within 60 days and do not want to be classified as a 'bad taxpayer'. Consideration should be given to: a. Providing IR the discretion (mainly for the terminal tax date plus 75 days deadline) to approve an extension to these deadlines in certain circumstances (based on criteria/ guidelines) to ensure that some taxpayers that cannot meet that deadline continue to remain "good taxpayers" and they feel they are not getting over-burdened by interest and penalties. b. Allowing tax payable from a reassessment to be paid through a pool under an instalment arrangement extending beyond the 60 day limit currently imposed. This would achieve a similar outcome to a payment arrangement with IR, but managed by the tax pooling industry as an extension of IR and reducing the need for IR to dedicate resource to this. c. IR discretion should only be provided upon some kind of application/approval; and/or agreeing to a regular payment plan using the tax pool similar to an instalment plan. d. These arrangements will be clearly visible when the tax pooling intermediaries provide their data feed to IR showing the maturity dates for each financed tax portion and know what to expect on settlement date. IR, if they so choose, can follow up immediately if a settlement payment is not received. e. This could also be used by IR as a debt collection "over- load" option. In other words, where IR is engaging with a taxpayer for collection of tax debt, IR could have the option referring the taxpayer to a tax pool to 'sort out an instalment plan' so IR can move on to the next taxpayer and efficiently use its limited resources. IR collections has previously worked with a tax pool to achieve this on a limited basis, but within the current time limits. ‣Taxpayers with a willingness to pay are able to clear debt faster. 11 f. To alleviate IR’s concerns about financing tax resulting delayed payment and reducing the ability for IR to actively recover the tax some time later due to the delay, a possible solution is: • If the Tax Pool could be required to make that finance arrangement a secured debt /arrangement before IR agrees to it with possible subrogation rights (ie security interest able to be transferred to IR) if the taxpayer fails to make an instalment payment. • This will mean that IR would become a secured creditor and rank in priority above general creditors. 6 Apply the transfer rules in s173M to tax pooling a.Rather than restrict the transfer rules of 'own funds' to between companies in a group, it should be consistent and apply the rules in s173M of the Tax Administration Act. ‣This will allow groups of taxpayers (typically privately owned businesses that have individual, trust and/or 50% company shareholders) to transfer provisional tax between them on the correct dates within the tax pool before transferring the tax amounts to IR and then requesting IR to transfer tax payments between taxpayers, which are sometimes rejected. ‣It may also help alleviate some of the confusion around the impact on a company’s ICA when ‘own funds’ become ‘purchased tax’. 12 Contact: Josh Taylor, Chair  Ph 021 623 465 / josh.taylor@taxtraders.co.nz / PO Box 74479, Greenlane, Auckland 1546 13
Tax Working Group Public Submissions Information Release Release Document February 2019 taxworkingroup.govt.nz/key-documents Key to sections of the Official Information Act 1982 under which information has been withheld. Certain information in this document has been withheld under one or more of the following sections of the Official Information Act, as applicable: \[1\] 9(2)(a) - to protect the privacy of natural persons, including deceased people; \[2\] 9(2)(k) - to prevent the disclosure of official information for improper gain or improper advantage. Where information has been withheld, a numbered reference to the applicable section of the Official Information Act has been made, as listed above. For example, a \[1\] appearing where information has been withheld in a release document refers to section 9(2)(a). In preparing this Information Release, the Treasury has considered the public interest considerations in section 9(1) of the Official Information Act. 1 From:Claremont Estate Sent: Friday, 26 October 2018 5:34 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Increasing Taxes Has the Tax Working Group contemplated lowering and not raising taxes? It would appear right to suggest that we may be approaching a tipping-point, where raising taxes has become or could become counter productive. Evidence suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the tax rate and the amount of revenue collected. The higher the tax rate the lower the Government's revenue. In making the case for lower taxes, we need only look to the Russian Federation, following the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991. In order to invigorate a sclerotic economy, the introduction of a flat tax resulted in a 25% rise in revenue from personal income tax, followed by a similar increase in the second year and 15% in year three. The Laffer curve predicts such an outcome, attributing the primary reason for increased revenues to higher levels of economic growth, stemming from the introduction of the flat tax. If the NZ Government were to adopt this model it would also benefit the exchequer by increasing declared income and reducing bureaucracy by simplifying the way tax is calculated and collected. Richard Goord \[1\] 2 \[1\] 1 From:Claremont Estate Sent: Friday, 26 October 2018 5:23 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: NZ tax review Dear Sirs, I wish to make a submission to the Tax Working Group in relation to the recommendation that NZ should introduce a Capital Gains Tax. I am opposed to the concept of a CGT on the following grounds: 1) If the purpose of the Tax Working Group is to ensure fairness within the tax system then any tax that effectively taxes inflation is manifestly unfair. Unless there is indexation of the GCT threshold, (assuming that there is a CGT threshold) then it is not a tax on "real capital gains" but rather is a tax upon the inflated value of assets caused by underlying inflation. Accordingly, if introduced, a CGT must only tax real gains after an allowance for inflation. 2) CGT is a tax that effectively punishes those who chose to save and invest. Capital Assets have usually been acquired out of tax paid income. A CGT is therefore a disincentive for savers. Many New Zealander have historically invested in second homes, rental properties farms, business or other assets as a form of savings and a hedge against inflation. It has been one of the few ways that hard working Kiwis have been able to enhance their wealth and living standards. 3) To be fair any CGT computation needs to take into account the cost of capital improvements that have contributed to the enhanced value. Over time Capital assets acquired, as outlined above, are often improved. The enhanced assets are not infrequently sold at or around retirement age. Those willing and able to look after themselves financially in this manner alleviate a burden from the state. In the UK there is a low rate of CGT for retirees who have owned a business for more than 10-years. It would be expedient to contemplate similar concessions in NZ. 4) There is already, in effect, a CGT on homes by virtue of the Brightline test. The introduction of CGT on second homes is unlikely to make houses more affordable. This has certainly not been the case in the UK were there is a CGT on second homes. 5) For the above reasons it is evident that a CGT will be contentious and it will inevitably be complex. Therefore it will complicated and probably expensive to collect and administer. Only the accounting profession is likely to benefit from the introduction of a CGT. This is con trary to the ethos of the current NZ Tax system which is designed to be simple and straightforward. CGT will be deeply unpopular. I believe that there are other more effective ways to raise Government revenue. If Labour wants to be re-elected then I think the Government would be wise to look at other alternatives. I hope that the group will consider these concerns. Richard Goord \[1\] 2 \[1\]

We applaud the fantastic amount of work that has gone into the Interim report and believe that the Interim Report (IR) provides invaluable material and ideas on taxation and its relationship with societal goals. We have two main concerns and related sets of comments/recommendations. Inequalities: we are unclear on the extent to which adoption of likely recommendations will succeed in ensuring that New Zealand becomes an optimally equal society, or substantially more equal than at present. “Correctional” taxes: we are disappointed with the depth, framing, and wording of this chapter. Our focus is the need for a tax system that is fair; efficient; transparent; enables inequalities to be reduced to the greatest extent possible; produces enough revenue (in conjunction with an effective transfer system) to ensure world-class provision of public services (i.e. health, education, housing transport, etc); uses health-promoting taxes effectively to maximise health and wellbeing; ensures the health of the environment for the present and the future; and interfaces with the international tax system in a way that reduces tax evasion, tax avoidance, and global inequalities. Major Points 1. The IR does not consider taxation in conjunction with welfare/benefit/transfer issues. We recognise that this lack of an integrated approach derives from the terms of reference. Unfortunately this limitation is a major impediment to sensible and meaningful recommendations, a difficulty which is implied at several points in the IR, for example: a. The IR recommends ‘additional Government support for childcare costs, but ... this support is best provided outside the tax system’ (13.7). b. On p 94, para 10-11, it is stated that that reductions to lower tax rates would assist low and middle income earners through the tax system; whereas incomes for very low income households would be best achieved through welfare transfers. The choice between these options is left in a no-person’s land between the tax working group and the expert advisory group on welfare, and hence no clarity of direction. The outcome is that income inequality issues are not adequately addressed. 2. Given the importance of this review, and our strong belief that the tax and welfare system should act coherently to reduce disparities and maximise well-being, we strongly urge that the final report acknowledges the constraints of the current TOR and includes a section outlining ideas and options for future consideration. Reference to such ideas and options would go beyond the terms of reference, even while acknowledging that they are not able to 2 be reflected in recommendations in the Final report. These ideas, options and materials could form the basis for future consideration by government (and groups with an interest in these issues). Recommendations 1. General We propose that: 1. Four principles are added to the conventional principles of tax design (efficiency, equity, predictability, certainty etc): (this would involve amending p 13 of the final report): a. Consistency with the Treaty of Waitangi and recognition that taxation should contribute to giving effect to the Treaty; b. Reducing inequalities: An explicit purpose of the tax system should include taxation as a means of reducing inequalities and minimising poverty. The purpose of tax in reducing inequalities would be consistent with Te Ao Maori perspectives, a perspective which otherwise in the TWG IR is not given much weight. (This purpose may be seen by some as inherent in the notion of equity/fairness, but we believe this broad principle is insufficiently explicit about the aim of reducing disparities and poverty). c. Transparency, and the need for comprehensive disclosure and public access. This principle is consistent with the growing international consensus about the importance of transparency and the increasing implementation of transparency-promoting measures within tax system reforms. d. Adequacy in terms of achieving government social, health and environmental goals. 2. We recommend that the text (if not recommendations) recognise that the aims of reducing inequalities, provision of good quality public services, and reduced poverty, require: a. increased tax revenue; that is, a great proportion of GDP than 30 percent; rather than maintaining this proportion at the current level b. a more progressive system of income tax than appears to be recommended in the Interim Report; and c. a greater proportion of the tax revenue from wealth/assets (rather than income or consumption). 2. Corrective taxes The chapter on ‘corrective taxes’ covers taxes such as those relating to tobacco. These aim to prevent disease and improve public health. This chapter is seriously flawed and contrasts with the more in-depth and conceptually-based chapter on “environmental and ecological taxes”. The concept of ‘corrective’ taxes has highly negative connotations (associated with ‘correctional facilities’ and generally an old-fashioned somewhat negative ‘schoolmasterly’ approach). This framing of ‘corrective taxes’ is particularly regrettable as these taxes, unlike most others (e.g. income tax and GST), have the potential to directly enhance individual and population wellbeing, e.g. through reducing smoking prevalence or improving diets, as well as raising tax revenue to support the provision of expenditure to promote social goods. 3 We therefore strongly believe that a more positive term should be used for such taxes e.g. ‘health-promoting taxes’ or ‘health and well-being taxes’; and that the chapter should acknowledge that such taxes are an important component of comprehensive strategies for societal wellbeing. We also disagree with the characterisation of the appropriate rate for these taxes in the report as being tied to their associated negative externalities. Firstly, it is very difficult to determine the exact extent of such externalities. They are often underestimated unless large indirect impacts such as productivity loss and valuation of loss of life and health are included as well as direct health care costs. Secondly, the main aim of these taxes is to reduce adverse health-related behaviours and hence improve health, so the assessment of appropriate level of these taxes should relate to their impact on these indicators. The following paragraphs have comments on specific health taxes: a. Tobacco: Tobacco taxation is the most well proven intervention to reduce smoking prevalence by discouraging young people from starting to smoke and encouraging smokers to quit. Tobacco taxes are strongly supported by organisations such as the World Bank, WHO and International Agency for Research on Cancer. Taxation on tobacco has quite simply saved tens of millions of lives around the world. This chapter unfortunately frames health taxes in a highly negative way, as seen in its focus on regressivity, reducing efficacy, and possible associated crime – without providing any evidence for any of these assertions. Tobacco taxes can be regressive in economic terms but are usually highly progressive in health terms (i.e. they reduce smoking most in poorer populations). The impacts on disparities therefore need to be assessed using a range of metrics and perspectives. In addition, any regressive economic impacts could be mitigated in several ways, e.g. through: (i) hypothecation of revenue to interventions encouraging and supporting the most disadvantaged smokers to quit; (ii) making available credible alternatives to smoking such as nicotine-containing e-cigarettes which are not subject to the same excise increases; (iii) addressing economic impacts on disadvantaged smokers through increases in benefits or targeted reductions in tax that preferentially impact disadvantaged groups. The statement that the effectiveness of tobacco excise tax increases appears to be increasing is not supported by evidence e.g. there are continuing declines seen in smoking prevalence in the annual NZ Health Survey and of adolescent smoking prevalence in the ASH Year 10 survey. The relation between tobacco tax levels and retail crime has not been rigorously evaluated as to (i) whether such crimes are increasing, and if they are, (ii) whether tobacco tax increases are an important cause. We endorse the IR’s conclusion that a range of other tobacco control measures are required, but it is critical that these accompany and complement tobacco tax increases, not replace them. We endorse the ASPIRE submission on the original TWG documents with its proposals for a framework of continuing tobacco excise tax increases, mitigation measures such as hypothecation of revenue to support poorer smokers to quit, supporting fiscal measures such as the removal of duty free tobacco product allowances and implementing a minimum 4 tobacco product price (to avoid tobacco industry tactics to reduce the impact of tobacco tax increases), and through rigorous monitoring and evaluation of impacts. b. Alcohol: We consider that the IR is negligent in not recognising the vast amount of work that has been done on the importance of price as one strategy for reducing alcohol harm, in conjunction with other strategies. The submissions on alcohol from health groups have a consistent approach in recommending a 50% excise raise to ensure at least a 10% increase in price. This is not an area where ‘further work is required’: the work has been done and its messages are coherent, strong, and fully evidence based. c. Sugar sweetened beverages: There is good theoretical and emerging empirical evidence that SSB taxes reduce consumption of sugary beverages and this tax has the potential for important health gains in New Zealand. The evidence base for SSB taxes has rapidly expanded in the last two years and it has been introduced in over thirty countries around the world, including at least eight Pacific countries. An SSB tax in New Zealand is needed as part of a broad range of obesity prevention measures to address New Zealand’s very high OECD obesity rankings. We suggest the tax working group support future SSB tax. d. Gambling: We are disappointed that this chapter includes no reference to the role of taxation in relation to gambling. Gambling produces a wide range of harms at the population and individual levels, and taxation is one appropriate strategy in conjunction with others in addressing such harms. 1. International income tax. We recommend, in relation to chapter 11 on ‘international income tax’ that the final report recommends that further work be done on issues that go beyond the terms of reference and the material in this chapter. In particular further work should analyse the implications of the interface between New Zealand’s domestic taxation system with international cross-border flows with respect to the extent to which New Zealand’s system continues to facilitate tax evasion/avoidance; and the need for further transparency in particular the need for public country by country reporting. The present lack of transparency has implications both for maintaining inequalities and poverty. 2. Transparency: We recommend that the sentence on p 9, second column, be amended to finish after the phrase ‘about the tax system’ (4 th line in the second paragraph) It makes little sense to affirm the need for greater public access to data about information that is already publically available. 3. Environmental taxes: we support the proposal of a framework for helping decide whether and when environmental taxes are appropriate. We do not however agree that all of the proposed criteria in Box 9.1 be regarded as essential prerequisites. Instead the criteria should be applied in nuanced way, recognising that there are degrees of (for example) responsiveness and risk tolerance, to be balanced against a range of other criteria such as the significance of the issue and the degree of efficacy of the proposed tax. We also consider that an important criterion has been missed and should be included: the degree to which a possible tax would assist in ensuring that New Zealand is able to fulfil its international commitments (including both legal and policy 5 commitments). On the specific topic of carbon taxes, we recommend that the final report be fairly neutral on the choice of instrument, i.e. trading scheme or direct tax, (given other work in progress on this issue); but that there be a strong emphasis on the need for the price of carbon to be increased. 6 3. Recommendations on modelling required to assess the impact of proposed changes We recommend that the final report include modelling and analysis of the impact of the TWG recommendations, if accepted and implemented. Such modelling should include impacts on income and wealth distribution, and poverty reduction; but also the impacts on the environment, population health and well-being and other social goods. We understand that the government has indicated its commitment to a package that would reduce inequalities in this country. We need to see how implementation of the current recommendations as broadly framed would affect, one way or another, the extent of inequalities in New Zealand. If implementation does little to improve the status quo it is not clear what purpose is being served. We believe that New Zealand should aim at being one of the top five most equal societies in the world, nothing less. Hence, at the very least, information in the TWG final report should include projections demonstrating whether adoption of its recommendations would in fact reduce inequalities, and to what extent. We recommend, as noted above, that a legitimate use of the final report would be inclusion of ideas and options that go beyond the terms of reference even if they cannot be included in TWG recommendations. These ideas, options and materials would form the basis for future consideration by government (and groups with an interest in these issues). The report could include a section or appendix ‘ideas for future consideration’; or ‘ideas for the long-term’. We further recommend, as an example of the above approach, that whether as an appendix or working paper, the report include modelling of the impact of other possible packages of measures on inequalities with the ultimate question being: what package of measures would be necessary to ensure that NZ is the most equal of OECD societies (or the least unequal). What would it take for New Zealand to be as equal as the five OECD countries which are the least unequal? Setting out the implications of a range of such measures would enable informed discussion in the future. We recommend that the Final report includes, again perhaps as an appendix, a much comprehensive analysis of the potential of wealth taxes (conceptualised broadly as including capital) for reducing inequalities. The paragraphs on p 43 are skimpy to say the least, and are broadly devoted to listing disadvantages such as difficulty of application and likelihood of evasion/avoidance. The possible advantages of wealth taxes in reducing inequalities are not mentioned. 4. Recommendations on other work required We recommend that the TWG include, as a recommendation for further work, the need for research on the interface between the tax and welfare/transfer system. By February the Welfare Group should also have reported. The Government should be urged to ensure that further work is carried out that would integrate ideas and options from both the existing group in a way that allows real choices to be made on policies that would reduce inequalities and poverty. This further work should outline the interface issues between the taxation and welfare/transfer systems, with examples of how they impact on each other. This section could include details on the interface is managed in other countries – for example the effects on poorer people of continued (relatively) high income taxes can be offset by greater and more universal provision of public services (health, education, child care, housing), with consequent implications for inequality reduction.

More information about NZCCS and contact person for these comments is contained in Appendix One. The Interim Report and associated background papers and resources represent a large and impressive amount of work attempting to address the wide range of tax issues covered by the TWG. The publication of this information and analysis will assist the wider public and technical experts to better understand and assess the choices and options available. NZCCSS provided comments to the TWG in our submission on 30 th April 2018. Our response to the Interim Report is based on those comments and other issues raised in research and discussion over the past six months. A fairer tax system is urgently needed The Interim Report identifies problems with the fairness and balance of the system and the need to reduce inequality and improve progressivity of the system. The actual proposals included in the Interim Report do not however seem to go far enough to actually significantly reduce inequality or increase progressivity. More analysis will be needed in the final report to show the expected impact of proposals made. NZCCSS agrees with the TWG finding that the “tax system relies on a relatively narrow range of taxes and is not particularly progressive” (p.5). The TWG has identified inconsistent tax on capital income and treatment of natural capital as key issues. NZCCSS recommends adding the lack of taxation of financial transactions and overall wealth as further reasons for the narrowness of the tax base and its lack of progressiveness. Government expenditure level that fosters wellbeing The wellbeing approach to analysis is not particularly developed in this Interim Report. NZCCSS recommends that the final report pay more detailed attention to assessing the tax system and impacts of proposed changes through specific wellbeing frameworks. The Interim Report does not contain any analysis of how its interim findings would translate into meeting the Government’s objective of maintaining expenditure at around an “historical level of 30% of GDP” (Appendix B, p.140). NZCCSS recommends that an analysis will be included in the final 347b Paul Barber.DOCX - 2 - report of expected increases and reductions in tax revenue through the changes proposed in the final report, preferably linked to the assessment of wellbeing impacts. Tax has a vital role to reduce inequality The interim report very clearly recognises and acknowledges the inequalities and imbalances of the current tax system. It names wealth inequality as one of the key issues raised by submitters (p. 7). The role of tax in reducing income inequality by redistributing income is discussed (p.13) and the fact that the inequality-reducing role of the tax system has diminished considerably in recent decades (p.18) with NZ now ranked in the lowest group of OECD countries for redistribution efficiency of the system. The Interim Report does not sufficiently respond to these concerns or set out a clear analysis of how the proposed set of recommendations will be effective to reduce inequality. Specific proposals relating to reducing tax rates and changing thresholds for low income earners (13.3 p.132) could have some effect to reduce income inequality. The proposals to extend taxation of capital income should have some impact to reduce wealth inequalities, depending on which options are chosen and the detail of their design. Beyond these proposals, the other specific recommendations included in the interim report cannot be seen as making a direct impact on income or wealth inequality through the tax system. NZCCSS recommends that the TWG include a comprehensive analysis of the redistributive effects of proposed changes in its final report as well as a target to reduce inequality and increase the redistributive effectiveness of the tax system. Tax on wealth is needed NZCCSS welcomes the proposals to extend the taxation of capital income. The options put forward represent progress towards fairer treatment of wealth in the tax system. From the analysis presented, using a deemed rate of return on equity (Risk-Free Return Method) would appear to be the better option to fairly tax wealth and generate a meaningful revenue stream as well as encouraging more productive use of capital. It is disappointing that the TWG has already discounted further work on a net wealth tax (p.32). A net wealth tax is discussed in the literature considered by the TWG (e.g. OECD 2018) as a complimentary tax to other forms of wealth taxation and would provide another way to extend the tax base to underpin future tax revenue flows. NZCCSS recommends that the final report propose that further study and design work be undertaken to assess options for the future for such a tax. It is also disappointing that the TWG has not included proposals for further work on a financial transactions tax (FTT) in this country. The Interim Report notes that such taxes raise reasonable amounts of revenue in other countries and that the overall impact of an FTT would be progressive because groups that regularly trade financial assets will pay a high share of the tax. 347b Paul Barber.DOCX - 3 - NZCCSS recommends that the final report include proposals for further work to investigate the feasibility of an FTT for NZ. Higher Tax rate on the highest income earners Tax increases are specifically excluded from the TWG terms of reference. The lack of progressivity in the New Zealand tax system is a repeated finding of the Interim Report across most parts of the tax system. The proposals to change lower income tax rates and thresholds are a clear endorsement of the need to address the progressiveness of the tax scale and this cannot be achieved without looking at higher income tax rates as well. NZCCSS recommends that the TWG include in the final report an analysis of the redistributive effect of taxes on higher income earners (e.g. higher tax rate on incomes over $150,000) as an appendix on issues for further consideration, even if it cannot be included in the formal recommendations of the TWG. Better interaction between the tax and benefit systems It is extremely disappointing that the TWG Interim Report does not go further to address the issues raised by the interaction between the tax and welfare systems. This is despite the fact that a number of key areas are identified as needing attention: abatement rates and thresholds for Working For Families and accommodation support, and support for childcare costs. The effect of secondary tax comes up consistently in any discussion on tax with people working on low-incomes, especially those with variable working hours and irregular employment, yet this is not mentioned at all in the Interim Report. The Interim Report notes that low and middle income earners would be helped by changes to lower tax rates, but income increases for the very low income households would be best achieved through welfare transfers (p.94). The Interim does not frame this as a recommendation under 13.1 (p.132). The risk in not making clear recommendations relating to the welfare system is that this very important area in tax and welfare policy is left in limbo, outside of the TWG and not properly part of the Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG) work. The risk is that neither the TWG nor the WEAG will adequately focus on this area. NZCCSS recommends that the final report include a clear set of recommendations on areas in the tax/welfare interface that need to be addressed by the Welfare Expert Advisory Group and ensure that the WEAG receives adequate analytical support to conduct a proper analysis of these issues. Child-focused tax policy The Interim Report includes no specific analysis of the impact of proposed changes on child wellbeing. There is no attempt to address the specific issue of how to the tax system changes proposed will work to improve child wellbeing. The Interim Report includes no recommendations on taxes to promote health goals that affect children (e.g. taxing sugary drinks), saying only that “more clarity” is needed around the government’s goals in this area. 347b Paul Barber.DOCX - 4 - The Interim Report does not support making childcare costs deductible, recommending instead that support be provided outside the tax system (13.7 p.135). NZCCSS recommends that the final report contain a full analysis of the impact on child wellbeing of the tax changes that are recommended. Gender impacts of tax The TWG background paper on Taxation and Gender gives an analysis of gender issues and these are addressed to some extent in the Interim Report. The Interim Report briefly addresses gender issues (p.20) and identifies disproportionate impacts on women of tax policies around childcare (p.99) and retirement savings (p.51). The recommendation for incentives for retirement saving for low income people is identified as likely to benefit women proportionately more. Such analysis needs to be further developed in the final report. NZCCSS recommends that the final report include stronger analysis of how the changes proposed by the TWG will improve gender equity and outcomes for women generally. Reduce GST The TWG has clearly stated in Interim Report that they do not think that targeted reductions in GST on specific items such as healthy food, nor a general reduction in the GST rate are effective tax measures that will deliver benefit to low-income households. The key arguments identified in the Interim Report are “windfall gains” for wealth-holders from a one-off decrease in GST, and secondly, the redistributive effect of an overall GST decrease is less than could be achieved for the same cost through targeted cash transfers to those households through the welfare transfer system. Reducing GST is not recommended on the basis that a stronger redistributive effect could be achieved through direct transfers through the welfare system. The Interim Report does not however make the recommendation to do this, because it is outside of the TWG terms of reference. This is a lost opportunity considering a similar recommendation is proposed in the discussion on support for childcare costs (see above and recommendation 13.7, p135). NZCCSS recommends that the TWG propose increased income transfers through the welfare system instead of a decrease in GST. A secondary recommendation should be, that if no changes are made to the income transfer system, then a decrease in GST is the preferred tax option to reduce inequality. The Interim Report does not propose to pursue further work on charging GST on financial services, despite recognising an “in principle” case. There are undoubtedly complexities and risks associated with applying GST in this area, but complexities apply in other areas of tax also. It is vital that more work be done to explore this area to help increase the tax base across a growing area of financial and economic activity. NZCCSS recommends the final report include proposals to do further work on the feasibility of charging GST on financial services. 347b Paul Barber.DOCX - 5 - APPENDIX ONE About NZCCSS NZCCSS works for a just and compassionate society in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Its perspective may therefore vary from that of smaller scale farmers operating in a single sector and/or region. 3 2 This submission 2.1 Pāmu’s submission provides an opportunity for the company to articulate its position and vision i.e. the outcomes it seeks for its business and more broadly for New Zealand farming. 2.2 Pāmu’s submission takes a commercial view and looks to the mid-term future (10-20 years, rather than 5-10 years). 2.3 Pāmu believes that there is customer demand for an environmentally friendly source of supply and this submission sets out practical measures to address that desire. 2.4 One of the points of reference that Pāmu has used when formulating this submission is the “Living Standards Framework” published by Treasury which seeks to promote intergenerational well-being through ensuring through the growth, distribution and sustainability of “The Four Capitals” – Natural Capital, Human Capital, Social Capital and Financial/Physical Capital. 2.5 Pāmu recognises the importance of the following tax reform principles: a) The tax system must raise sufficient revenue to fund the operations of government; b) Taxes should be raised in a way that is least detrimental to inclusive and sustainable growth; c) Changes to the tax framework must have broad community support and buy-in; d) The tax system needs to be robust, but able to adapt to social, economic, and technological trends and developments; and e) The tax system and its reforms should be consistent, coherent, administratively efficient and transparent to ensure that the amount of tax due can be predicted and calculated with certainty by tax payers. 2.6 In the next section of this submission Pāmu sets out its high-level recommendations in an Executive Summary. 2.7 In the final sections of this submission we focus specifically on issues related to Environmental Taxation where we feel we have particular expertise and insight due to our unique position in the New Zealand agricultural sector. 2.8 Pāmu would welcome to opportunity to engage with the Tax Working Group on any of the matters addressed in this document. 4 3 Executive summary 3.1 Pāmu practices sustainable management, which requires a balance to be found between managing use and development of natural and physical resources, while also ensuring those resources are protected. 3.2 Pāmu believes that the achievement of good business outcomes and good environmental outcomes can be facilitated by tax reform in the medium term, thereby ensuring that “The Four Capitals” are increased over time. 3.3 Pāmu believes that Environmental taxes need to be designed so as to strongly influence behaviour at the individual farm level, rather than imposed on the industry at a unitary rate regardless of past or present behaviour. In principle therefore Pāmu supports the introduction of well-designed and targeted environmental levies to address issues such as nitrate run-off and water quality. 3.4 Pāmu recognises the desirability of being able to monitor nitrate leaching and its effect on waterways using an independent and auditable tool such as “OVERSEER 1 ”. We welcome the announcement of extra government funding for “OVERSEER” in the 2018 Budget. We believe that such a tool is extremely useful when assessing and monitoring environmental risks at a farm level or in areas where there is a high risk of adverse environmental impacts. We would however caution against the use of such a system as a regulatory tool due to the significant effort, expense and expertise required to implement and operate it across the New Zealand agricultural sector. 3.5 Pāmu believes that placing a levy at source on fertiliser products containing nitrogen represents the best available mechanism to target excessive use of nitrogen in agriculture. While there is not a direct correlation between the use of these products and nitrogen leaching, we would contend that usage is a suitable proxy which correlates well with intensive farming on high risk soils. We feel this is certainly a more workable proxy than say “cow numbers per hectare”. In addition, since there are alternatives to using nitrogen we believe that a levy will tend to drive behaviour towards using mitigations that are already available. When considering how best to address the nitrogen issue it is important to note that the key things that influence nitrogen leaching in OVERSEER are rainfall, the presence of irrigation and “leaky soils”. These factors compound regional differences. In contrast, a levy has the attractions of being relatively quick to implement, easy to administer, predictable, and able to provide appropriate incentives to users to limit and optimise the use of nitrogen fertiliser products on farm. These modified behaviours are in turn likely to have a beneficial impact in reducing leaching. 1 Overseer is a New Zealand tool used by a range of primary industries and regional councils that helps measure nutrient use and greenhouse gas emissions 5 3.6 Pāmu believes that creating an enhanced ETS will assist in ensuring “best use” of land including the planting of trees (“ETS”). 3.7 In our view, inclusion of agriculture into the current ETS is not the best way to incentivise the full range of behaviours needed to reduce emissions. Simply put, the ETS is a “blunt instrument”. We believe the ETS should be one of a suite of consistent and coherent regulatory tools to drive desirable behaviours and outcomes. 3.8 For example, Methane is relatively short-lived in the atmosphere compared to say carbon or nitrogen. The scheme does not currently distinguish between types of greenhouse gases. Making such distinctions could be useful by enabling emissions charges to be specified and varied in relation to the severity of the harm being caused in each case (see point 4 (d) below). 3.9 To maintain and enhance New Zealand’s natural capitals Pāmu recommends that the Tax Working Group consider the issue of water usage. It is generally accepted that in some geographical regions the drawing of water for irrigation purposes has reduced river flows, and thereby contributed to a degradation of water quality. There may be opportunities to address this water quality issue and promote a more efficient allocation of water via an agreed national allocation methodology. 3.10 Pāmu believes that in pursuit of environmental benefits the Tax Working Group should consider the merits of offering tax credits or incentives for setting up and maintaining wetlands and eco systems that benefit the environment. Such incentives could help to address issues such as loss of indigenous biodiversity and indigenous species as well as water quality. 3.11 Pāmu is not opposed in principle to a well-designed Capital Gains Tax (“CGT”). Such a tax would need to take account of various practical considerations including (inter alia) the cost of compliance, ensuring that cash tax is only payable when gains are crystallised, ensuring a fair and equitable basis for the valuation of farm land, taking due account of inflation, consideration of “rollover relief” for capital recycling and specifying appropriate rules for the application of CGT payable to farmhouses (which are often family homes). 3.12 Pāmu opposes the idea of a land tax. Pāmu believes that a land tax would not incentivise any beneficial behaviour and would simply increase the tax burden on Pāmu. Land taxes are sometimes cited as a vehicle that will assist in freeing up land for housing development. Pāmu believes that sufficient commercial incentives to undertake such developments already exist. 6 4 Environmental levies – General principles 4.1 Above in section 2.5 we have set out some general principles that we believe should apply when implementing levies. In this section we propose further principles that we feel should be considered when considering the promulgation of environmental levies. a) An environmental levy framework should influence the behaviour of farmers and create incentives for those at production level to invest in mitigation i.e. in simple terms the tax must be “worth avoiding”; b) Environmental levies should be targeted to the pollutant or polluting behaviour, with few exceptions; c) The scope of an environmental levy should match the scope of the environmental damage; d) The rate of an environmental levy should be commensurate with the environmental damage; e) The levy must be credible and its rate predictable in order to motivate environmental improvements; f) It may be possible to introduce environmental levies that can be applied differently around New Zealand based on geographical areas. Furthermore, exemptions to a nitrogen levy could be applied in the case of locally grown and purchased fruit and vegetables or essential foods (for local consumption) if clear criteria can be established. g) Levies may have unforeseen impacts and these should be carefully researched prior to implementation. For example, feed pads help control effluent discharge to waterways but have a higher carbon profile. 4.2 In broad terms Pāmu believes that revenue from environmental levies should go towards corrective measures such as cleaning-up waterways, subsidising nitrogen fertiliser alternatives, funding riparian planting schemes, fencing waterways projects or increasing the sustainable farming fund. 7 5 Environmental levies – “A price on nitrogen” 5.1 Pāmu believes that consideration should be given to applying a levy on fertiliser products containing nitrogen. This could be levied at source and collected by manufacturers/importers of fertiliser products containing nitrogen. 5.2 Pāmu believes that applying such a levy prior to sale represents the simplest method of ensuring that all of the nitrogen being applied to agricultural land is subject to the levy. 5.3 The imposition of a levy will in theory merely increase input costs for users of the product. These users will however be naturally incentivised to (a) minimise use, (b) substitute other fertiliser compounds that are less environmentally harmful and (c) ensure optimum product placement in the most cost effective locations both from an efficiency perspective and, if appropriate, in order to minimise spill-over and consequent exposure to any applicable water quality regulations in nearby waterways. Depending on location and climate there may be other strategies which a farmer may employ in order to mitigate use of nitrogen. For example, ryegrass is suitable in some areas as a pasture grass and one of its benefits is that it aids in helping to break up hard soils, thereby allowing roots to absorb nitrogen. Herbs (e.g. plantain, chicory) and legumes are also examples of alternative feed sources that can provide grazing and winter feed without the need to apply such large quantities of nitrogen fertiliser. Education and training for farmers wishing to make changes to their farming systems could be funded from any levy so that farmers have access to advice on issues that may arise as changes are made e.g. the perceived negatives (for example bloat) from legumes are fully able to be mitigated. Pāmu is currently able to show an increase of 70% in terms of feed production despite a complete withdrawal of nitrogen fertiliser on some of our farms. 5.4 The quantum of any levy should be set so as to provide sufficient incentive to mitigate its impact through actions such as those listed above. The aim should be to achieve rapid change. Nevertheless we would encourage the Tax Working Group to also give consideration to mitigating the effects of such a levy, at least initially, through say increased tax depreciation rates on farm assets such as dairy sheds, land development costs etc. 5.5 Pāmu would advocate for the levy to be revenue neutral to central government with proceeds being applied to various activities such as farmer education (mentioned above), improvements to monitoring systems, administration of the tax and research into alternative fertiliser products, all of which have the aim of mitigating the effects of nitrogen products. 5.6 If the levy is intended to only target the area of most concern with regard to nitrogen leaching i.e. Dairy Farming (as opposed to dry stock farming or cropping), the design of the tax may be such as to ensure that it does not unfairly affect all consumers of the product. 8 6 Environmental levies – “Water allocation” 6.1 Pāmu believes that the introduction of a price on water usage has the potential to incentivise behaviours to ensure this valuable natural resource is consumed in such a way as to promote economic efficiency and environmental improvement over time. 6.2 Pāmu does not underestimate the political sensitivity in respect of ownership of water rights. 6.3 This suggestion is based on the premise that all stakeholders regard water as one of the country’s “Natural Capitals” within the Treasury’s “Living Standards Framework” and would therefore wish to see action taken to ensure a continuous and sustained improvement to water quality as time passes. 6.4 The regulation of water usage in Australia has been in place since the turn of the century. We recommend that the Tax Working Group undertake a full review of the Australian approach to water management over the last 25 years. Whilst there are undoubtedly aspects that could be improved upon, we feel that the overall approach has achieved the objective of placing a value on water for both environmental purposes and best use.

Subsequently, information on this subject was included in the Auditor General’s Health Report to Parliament. Regretfully, no action was taken by Parliament to either the submission or the Auditor General’s report \[1\] Over the last 20 years, on the basis of an average annual Vote Health of 12.5 billion dollars, 250 billion dollars has been spent on public health. Of this amount it is estimated that 1.5% has been spent on overseas visitors, or 3.75 billion dollars. Of this amount only 25% has been recovered meaning an estimated 2.8 billion dollars being paid for by NZ taxpayers. It is estimated that this cost was 180 million dollars in the financial year ended 30 June 2018 The estimate of 1.5% of Vote Health being spent on overseas visitors is confirmed by department of statistics information of tourist overnight accommodation which shows that at any point of time during the year this is the percentage of overseas visitors in the total population. The estimate of 25% recovery is based on information provided to the ministry of health by public health providers in relation to the amount of overseas patient debt written off The problem with this subject is that it is not possible currently to accurately calculate the cost as it is not being systematically measured. Now that there is an opportunity to match the travel insurance details of overseas visitors with any subsequent health treatment received while in NZ, there is no reason why this cannot be done. The cost can then be recovered by way of a claim on insurance. The insurance sector is currently receiving a significant subsidy from the NZ taxpayer via Vote Health for claims not made Thank you for your consideration of this submission. I would be happy to take any questions from your officials, if needed. I have made this submission after a search of the Tax Working Group submissions to-date, where it would seem that no reference is made to this subject. It is an opportunity to do so now on behalf of the NZ taxpayer and public health providers Best wishes with your work and I trust it leads to positive changes being made following the consideration of Parliament Rosser Thornley

The New Zealand Law Society’s (Law Society) Tax Law Committee is grateful to members Joanne Hodge, Craig Elliffe and Robin Oliver of the Tax Working Group (the Group) for the opportunity to participate in a conference call on 24 October 2018 to discuss aspects of the Group's interim report (the Interim Report). 2. This letter summarises the observations made by individual members of the Tax Law Committee, and other tax lawyers participating in the conference call, in their capacity as senior tax law practitioners, in response to the Interim Report. It should not be taken as expressing the Law Society's concluded view on any matter. This letter is intended to record key issues discussed during that conference call. 3. The references to the chapter numbers, the main headings or paragraph numbers below correspond to those in the Interim Report. Legislative process, and the GTPP 4. As an initial comment, the Law Society has frequently expressed concerns with the pace of legislative reform, the resultant potential for unintended errors and unintended consequences, the lack of consultation and an inability for key stakeholders to have the opportunity to consider and reflect on proposed law changes, and to make appropriate submissions. If, as seems likely, amendment to the Income Tax Act 2007 to introduce a capital gains tax is to be legislated prior to the next election there will be very little time to observe the Generic Tax Policy Process. There is a material risk that the process will not produce high quality legislation, creating arbitrary and unfair outcomes for taxpayers, and that extensive remedial legislation may be required. Capital income – Real property and family home exception 5. The proposed exemption for the family home from the taxation of capital gains is an acknowledgement of the societal importance of the family home. For this reason, due to current 2 house prices in large urban centres, the $5m cap could be considered low. In addition, any cap which is introduced should be indexed to market. 6. Practitioners have suggested that the family home exemption should be replaced by an exemption for "personal land assets". It could be considered unfair for two taxpayers, each with personal land assets worth $5m, to be taxed differently. That will be the case where one taxpayer's entire land assets are represented by the family home and another taxpayer has a lower-value family home and holiday home. Aggregation of personal land portfolio interests would resolve this inequity (along with a cap on the value of the portfolio, particularly the value of the holiday home). 7. A bach is similar to a family home, in that no deduction is available for expenditure on it. This is significantly different to the position in relation to land acquired for investment, which will typically be let out for rental income, and expenditure will consequently be deductible. To that extent, investment property is like any other business. In effect, the rental property is supported by the tax system, and the bach and family home are not. Accordingly, the bach and family home should be treated in a similar way. 8. Therefore, to remove the arbitrary bias against people with baches who have their main home in lower-value areas (and to reduce the bias towards the "mansion effect"), consideration should be given to excluding from a CGT home expenditure which is not deductible by a taxpayer owner. 9. In the absence of a corrective measure for the above phenomenon, a taxpayer who owns a home in a lower-value area and also owns a bach in a lower-value area, will be treated more harshly than a person who owns one home only, in a higher-value area. Capital income – deemed realisation events for trusts 10. One suggested realisation event, applicable to capital assets held in a trust, is the death of a settlor. However, the trust might (and commonly does) have a number of settlors, or the settlor might have predeceased introduction of the new rules. 11. To this end, a fixed period of ownership for trust-held assets would offer greater certainty and practicality than a link to the settlor's death. 12. This suggestion seeks to align the time at which a trust-held asset is taxed with the time the same assets, when held by a natural person, would be taxed. In the latter case, the person's death is a natural realisation event. Underpinning that is the idea that the "lock in effect" of an asset should not exceed the owner's lifetime. Capital income – double taxation 13. The Interim Report recognises the potential for double taxation where shares in a company are taxed at the shareholder level. A component of the share price is reflective of accrued gains in the value of assets held by the company. When those assets are later sold, the sale triggers a tax 3 liability at the company level. Economically, the same income is taxed twice. The Interim Report recognises that the imputation system should avoid that result, but will fail to do so. 14. One way of resolving that would be to operate the imputation system in reverse. A tax liability at the shareholder level could be imposed which would, to the extent it fairly relates to accrued gains in the company's assets, be creditable against those assets. 15. A simpler solution would be to replicate the partnership model, limited to capital assets. Thus, a sale of shares in a company might be treated as a sale of the underlying company held capital assets. 16. Although the Interim Report does not suggest amendments to the imputation regime, we note for completeness that the most effective solution to this issue would almost certainly require reworking or replacing the imputation regime. Capital income – compliance costs for the "valuation day" approach 17. Part VIII of Appendix B (Design features for extending the taxation of capital gains) of the Interim Report considers the transitional rules that would apply should a capital gains tax be introduced. 18. The Interim Report favours a “valuation day” approach, in that increases and decreases in value of affected assets from the implementation date will be taxed on a realised basis. Paragraph 117 of Appendix B considers a number of rules of thumb that may apply to reduce compliance costs in valuing assets subject to the new capital gains tax as at the “valuation day”. 19. An additional approach that could be considered is to allow taxpayers, at the taxpayer’s election, to allocate realised gains on assets acquired before the “valuation day” based on an index approach. Under this approach, Inland Revenue could publish ‘tables’ that allocate gains from certain asset types (such as residential property, commercial property and shares) given the movement in price indices for assets of that type from the income year in which those assets were acquired to the income year in which those assets were disposed of. 20. This is likely to provide a more accurate allocation of the realised gain than simply pro-rating the actual gain or loss on a temporal basis. These ‘tables’ could be modelled along the lines of the “inflation calculator” available on the Reserve Bank’s website which enables users to apply the CPI, Food, Clothing, Housing, Wages and Transport indices to make price comparisons. 21. In addition, the Group could consider allowing taxpayers the option of: a) having their affected assets valued as at the effective date and only the gain brought within the tax net; or b) being taxed on the entirety of the sale proceeds, at a reduced rate. 22. If this is not appropriate for all assets, consideration might be given to making the above concessionary option available to businesses, or small businesses, or only in relation to selected 4 assets. This option would reduce compliance costs in instances where a business is small or difficult to value. Structure and operation of the proposed taxpayer advocate service 23. Paragraphs 25 to 27 of chapter 17 of the Interim Report recommends that Government establishes a taxpayer advocate service to assist with the resolution of tax disputes. 24. Members of the Tax Law Committee endorse this recommendation. There is a perception among practitioners that the current disputes resolution process in Part 4A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 is not effective for disputes involving individuals, family trusts and small businesses, mainly due to the substantial costs involved and the understandable resulting reticence of taxpayers to take on a government department. 25. Paragraph 26 notes that “The service would need to be functionally independent from Inland Revenue in order to serve as a credible advocate for the taxpayer in dispute”. The view of members of the Tax Law Committee is that the taxpayer advocate service would need to be both legally and functionally separate from Inland Revenue in order for taxpayers to have confidence that that the service is truly independent of Inland Revenue. Taxpayers will not have confidence in the service if it is formally part of Inland Revenue (and has access to back-office support from Inland Revenue), even if the agency reports directly to the Minister of Revenue, rather than the Commissioner. 26. The taxpayer advocate service should be completely separate from Inland Revenue and report to the Minister of Justice, as this is an access to justice issue. Existing disputes regime 27. As noted above, the disputes regime is considered laborious and unworkable for many taxpayers. The time and cost entailed in this process is beyond the means of many smaller taxpayers. 28. The Group could consider improvements to the existing disputes regime. One suggestion is that the conference phase could be more akin to a mediation. The conference phase currently relies on Inland Revenue and the taxpayer reaching a voluntary agreement which, anecdotally, appears to occur in only a very small number of cases. 29. The utility of the conference phase could be improved by empowering the conference facilitator to resolve the dispute. The facilitator's decision, like that of a mediator, would be binding on both parties but with either party having a right of appeal to the Taxation Review Authority or to the High Court where the amount in dispute exceeded a monetary threshold (such as $200,000) or for nominated test cases. The facilitator would need to have appropriate legal and taxation law training, and should not be employed by Inland Revenue. 30. The proposed taxpayer advocacy service should be introduced in complement with the existing (or improved) disputes regime, thereby allowing taxpayers to be ably represented in the conference adjudication. 5 Company debt and the corporate veil 31. The Interim Report, in chapter 15, paragraphs 70 – 82, suggests the implementation of additional measures to impose company PAYE and GST debts on directors personally. There are already serious sanctions in place for directors who are responsible for failure to pay PAYE. 32. An employer who fails to pay the PAYE to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue by the due date is deemed to have misapplied it. 1 Knowing misapplication of PAYE by the due date is a criminal offence with a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. 2 33. In addition, directors are already responsible for unpaid income tax and GST in circumstances where there has been an arrangement whose purpose and effect is that a company tax liability will not be met. 3 34. If a further extension of those provisions is considered justified, then consideration should be given to removing the criminal liability on a director who is subject to a Director Penalty Notice. 35. In addition, more consideration should be given to the interface between debt collection and prosecution for outstanding PAYE. In practice, Inland Revenue frequently enters into instalment arrangements for outstanding PAYE, and only prosecutes once matters have become unmanageable. This leads to criminalisation of otherwise law-abiding taxpayers who were led to believe that the issue was a debt collection exercise. Aligning criminal penalties for GST and PAYE 36. The criminalisation of non-payment of PAYE arises from PAYE being deemed to be held on trust. Consequently, failure to pay it by the due date is a criminal breach of trust, not simply a debt collection issue. 37. By contrast, GST payments are not held in trust for the Crown. This was a deliberate policy decision at the time of implementation of the GST regime. The consequences for taxpayers, tax administration and the effect on the Crown’s obligations and immunities for GST refunds owed should be considered if GST debts owed by taxpayers are to be given equivalent status to PAYE debts. Charities 38. Some legal practitioners have expressed concerns about the Interim Report’s general approach to charities. It is their view that the Group must carefully consider the relationship between charities, the tax system and the benefit to New Zealand society as a whole before making any recommendations that would limit or remove tax concessions currently provided to charities. 1 Section 4A(2)(c) Tax Administration Act 1994 2 Section 143A Tax Administration Act 1994 3 Section HD15 of the Income Tax Act 2007 and section 61 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 6 39. The Group comments at paragraph 16.4 of the Summary in Chapter 16 of the Interim Report that "the underlying issue is the extent to which charitable entities are accumulating surpluses rather than distributing or applying those surpluses for the benefit of their charitable activities". 40. Some legal practitioners are concerned at the implication of this comment, namely that charities should be limited or prevented from accumulating surpluses. The benefits that charities are currently able to provide to the community could be significantly hampered if charitable entities were compelled to disgorge surpluses. Many long-established charitable entities which function throughout New Zealand, including particularly in the education sector, are able to make a significant impact in the communities in which they are based only by virtue of the fact that they have accumulated considerable capital. 41. Many legal practitioners are of the view that the existing limits on the application of funds other than for charitable purposes are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of tax-exempt income. This concept is not well-understood by members of the public, which may be behind the number of negative submissions the Group has received in relation to charities. The Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 42. Once the legislative work programme necessitated by the Group's recommendations and the Business Transformation project are complete, many practitioners consider that it would be timely to embark upon a comprehensive review and rewrite of the GST Act. As the Group will be aware, the current legislation is 33 years old and includes extensive amendments. With the recent introduction of the remote services rules, importing of low value goods, and zero-rating of land transactions, as well as several unresolved issues, many practitioners consider that such a rewrite is overdue, especially considering the number of rewrites of the Income Tax Act that have occurred during the same period. Conclusion 43. We would be happy to discuss any of these matters further if that would assist.

We are raising these issues with a particular focus on when the ultimate owner is a high net worth individual rather than a corporation. The current rules work better from the perspective of a corporation than for an individual with a CFC holding, even if that NZ individual owns the CFC through a NZ corporation. Submission: NZ should not implement a capital gains tax on CFCs or shares in CFCs 2 In our view, if NZ were to tax capital gains as income under proposed amendments to the Income Tax Act 2007, NZ tax resident shareholders should not be taxed on: 2.1 capital gains derived by the shareholder on the disposal of shares in that CFC; and 2.2 capital gains of the CFC – i.e. the capital gain should not be attributed to the shareholder as attributed foreign income. TWG interim report: CFC related capital gains 3 We understand from the TWG’s interim report that the TWG is considering: 3.1 to generally tax NZ resident shareholders on their capital gains arising on the disposal of shares, including the disposal of shares in a CFC; 1 and 3.2 taxing capital gains derived by a CFC as attributed foreign income to the extent the gain is derived from non-active assets or a non-active business (i.e. the question of whether capital gains derived by a CFC should be attributed income is to be determined by the nature of the income produced by the asset being disposed of, or by the nature of the CFC’s business). 1 We understand that the current proposal is that if a NZ resident company sells the shares in a CFC the gain on sale should not be subject to tax to the extent that the CFC is deriving active income. However, the gain is still effectively taxed when the New Zealand resident company makes a distribution to its shareholders or if its shareholders dispose of their shares. \[1\] 100219915/6703323.8 2 4 We consider that this approach should not be adopted for the reasons given below. We note that the CFC position is different to the position of a portfolio investor in a FIF. The taxation regime for FIFs is more favourable for most situations for a taxpayer that is an individual compared to the CFC rules. In fact, the FIF fair dividend rate rules seem to factor in that there is already a tax burden on the business overseas (see our comments on this at Appendix 1). Most CFCs are already subject to a comprehensive capital gains tax in their own jurisdictions 5 Most jurisdictions already have a comprehensive capital gains tax. This means that capital gains derived by a CFC are already likely to be subject to tax in the foreign jurisdiction in which the CFC is resident or the jurisdiction where the relevant asset is held. As such, NZ should not seek to tax foreign capital gains of a CFC by including the gain within attributed income of the CFC. The key focus in this area is the potential economic double taxation that may arise as a result of NZ seeking to tax capital gains that are already subject to tax. 6 Double taxation presents a high risk to NZ’s reputation as being a favourable country for business innovation, investment and growth. This risk is increased by the fact that high net worth individuals and their investments are mobile. Getting these rules wrong will be a barrier to high net worth individuals moving to or residing in NZ. The CFC rules are already overly complicated with a number of fixes required (see Appendix 2 for examples). 7 High net worth individuals from overseas will frequently have extensive CFC investments. These have been structured with the rules of the home jurisdiction in mind. Once they arrive in NZ, the overseas rules may make it very difficult to restructure to mesh well with the NZ rules. As a result, the new immigrant could easily find themselves facing double tax if they stay past their transitional period. This is alleviated by having no capital gains tax applying to their CFC investments. It is compounded with a CFC capital gains tax. Proposed rules lead to double taxation 8 Capital gains derived by a shareholder on the disposal of shares in a CFC that is “land rich” (i.e. the CFC holds a sufficient level of land in its home jurisdiction) are likely to be taxable in the CFC’s jurisdiction. As such, double taxation may arise (in the absence of NZ foreign tax credits) with associated complexity and integrity issues also arising. 9 Fundamentally foreign shares represent assets that reside in other jurisdictions and an underlying capital gains tax represents a tax on those balance sheets. A capital gains tax on assets sales (giving rise to attributed income) and again on the disposal of shares by a shareholder is likely to give rise to double taxation issues. This issue, coupled with the foreign jurisdiction also seeking to tax the same income shows how further work is required in respect of the application of a tax on capital gains to CFCs. 10 For example, the current proposals are likely to lead to distorted economic behaviour, such as selling off assets in order to reduce the value of a CFC’s shares and the amount of double taxation. In this case, the NZ shareholder should receive a 100219915/6703323.8 3 foreign tax credit for taxes paid in the foreign jurisdiction to credit against tax payable on attributable income. Assuming no difference in tax rates, NZ does not raise any tax revenue but has forced an uneconomic decision to be made. Proposed rules will need to align with overseas jurisdictions 11 If NZ did seek to tax a CFC’s foreign capital gain, NZ’s foreign tax credit rules will need to be extended to ensure there is no double taxation where such a gain is already subject to foreign tax. There is likely to be further complexities when the recognition and timing of income derivation between New Zealand and offshore jurisdictions are different. For example, where the offshore jurisdiction allows for roll-over relief in circumstances that NZ does not. As noted in Appendix 1, there may be valuation challenges related to the effective date of any capital gains tax. Level of complexity is too high 12 The taxation of CFCs is a complex area and TWG’s deadline of drafting legislation within 12 months does not provide enough time to adequately consider the existing and proposed rules in order to produce workable legislation. For example, the active/passive income distinction is flawed and without addressing these flaws, the proposed test for determining when a capital gain of a CFC should be included as attributable income should not proceed. 13 Applying the proposed rules is likely to lead to more complications and compliance issues due to the requirement to evaluate the nature of the asset and/or the nature of the CFC’s business. The CFC rules are already overly complicated in a number of areas and adding extra levels of complexity should be avoided where possible. 14 We have included in Appendix 3 to this submission examples that show that the passive/active distinction is flawed. Chapman Tripp’s suggested approach 15 Our main submission (as outlined at paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2) is that there should be no tax on CFC capital gains or capital gains on shares in CFCs. 16 If officials are worried about avoidance concerns, due to people investing in non- resident companies investing back into NZ, a NZ reinvestment limit could be introduced, whereby capital gains of a CFC are taxed if over a certain threshold of the CFC’s assets are in NZ. Alternative approach 17 Alternatively, if the TWG does not accept our submissions at paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2, then we submit that the TWG should consider implementing a jurisdictional black list (containing countries that do not have a comprehensive capital gains tax), such that where a CFC is listed in a black list country: 17.1 any capital gains of that CFC should be subject to NZ tax (i.e. the capital gain should be included as attributed foreign income under NZ’s CFC rules); and 17.2 any capital gain derived by a NZ tax resident shareholder on the disposal of that CFC’s shares should be subject to NZ tax, albeit there has to be a mechanism to credit tax already paid on the attributed amount. 100219915/6703323.8 4 CFC capital gains should not be included in attributable income 18 If none of our submissions are accepted by the TWG, at a bare minimum, we suggest that capital gains of a CFC should not be included as attributable foreign income. Chapman Tripp’s comments on problems with how the financial arrangement rules interact with the CFC rules 19 The spreading methods for foreign denominated financial arrangements are extremely burdensome and costly to apply. 20 For example, the calculations that are required under Determination G9C: Financial arrangements that are denominated in a currency other than New Zealand dollars: an expected value approach (G9C) are extensive and complex. From a compliance cost perspective, a NZ resident has a strong disincentive to enter into any foreign denominated financial arrangement. 21 However, under section EX 21(7), CFCs with significant financial arrangements are forced into dealing with the spreading methods for foreign denominated financial arrangements (such as G9C). Not only is this costly, the result may be that the CFC is treated as failing the active business test. 22 There should be a functional currency test that should allow a CFC to do all of its calculations in its functional currency in order to prevent the recognition of foreign currency gains and losses that do not actually materialise. 23 We would be pleased to discuss these issues in more detail at the appropriate time. Yours faithfully Graeme Olding P A R T N E R \[1\] \[1\] 100219915/6703323.8 5 APPENDIX 1: COMMENTS ON A CAPITAL GAINS TAX 1 We understand that the interim report was intended to provide a high level summary rather than a detailed discussion on how a capital gains tax may apply to CFCs, but caution ought to be taken not to oversimplify the issue of applying a capital gains tax to a tiered ownership structure (Tiered Structure). A common example of a Tiered Structure is where an individual owns shares in a corporation that owns shares in another corporation, which owns an operating business. 2 The interim report seems to overlook the fact that the value of the shares at the top of the chain will often be lower reflecting the fact there is underlying tax further down the chain. Therefore, the individual owning the shares in the top company already bears some of the cost of any underlying capital gains tax that may apply to the operating company at the bottom of the chain, even if there is no direct tax paid by the individual on the sale of the shares in the top company. 3 The interim report appears to view matters strictly from the perspective of what tax a particular taxpayer has paid, as opposed to how much tax an event, such as the sale of property at the bottom of the ownership chain, has generated. The extent to which the underlying tax is reflected in the valuation will vary considerably in different fact situations. 4 Taxing the ownership of equity in a Tiered Structure can lead to complexities and if the right mechanisms are not in place there will be problems, with potentially nonsensical and punitive results. These complexities will invariably lead to issues developing between taxpayers and the Inland Revenue Department, as taxpayers seek to avoid economic double taxation. This outcome should be avoided, and the design of any capital gains tax needs to take a responsible approach to protecting New Zealand’s reputation for its ease of doing business, which includes not having overly burdensome and complex tax rules. 5 Within a domestic setting, it may be that the imputation system will go a long way to resolving most if not all of the problems of Tiered Structures, assuming tax is only charged at the bottom level where the underlying asset is owned. 6 However, the issues are more difficult and nuanced with a Tiered Structure in relation to CFCs. As you will be aware, a New Zealand corporate holding an interest in a CFC will, generally, receives tax free dividends from its CFC, and pays no capital gains tax on its shares in the CFC. In effect, a corporate shareholder in a CFC is relived from any tax cash liability – reflecting in part the underlying tax liability that arises in the foreign jurisdiction where the CFC operates. 7 The same is not true for an individual who owns CFCs. The Tiered Structure means two levels of tax are involved, being tax in the foreign jurisdiction and the proposed capital gains tax on any disposal by the New Zealand shareholder of the shares in the CFC. 8 Furthermore, there are real difficulties in ensuring that capital gains or losses that arise offshore and within a Tiered Structure prior to the enactment of a capital gains tax are not incorrectly ignored on the subsequent sale or liquidation of the Tiered Structure after enactment. 100219915/6703323.8 6 9 Under our current rules for determining the ability of a company to return tax-free proceeds to shareholders on liquidation, the totality of historical gains and losses are considered. This will give rise to inappropriate outcomes in situations where a capital gains tax is intended to be imposed only on gains accruing after enactment. 10 In short, for any amount that a taxpayer is entitled to recover tax free prior to the valuation date, there must be a way for them to collect the same amount free from tax after the enactment of a capital gains tax. For instance, if prior to the valuation date, a shareholder was distributed capital gain proceeds derived by a CFC in some taxable manner, such as a dividend with no imputation credits (and paid NZ tax on the dividend), then in principle any loss on the capital proceeds of their investment in the CFC should be able to be offset against the tax on the dividend. This is an example of how a capital gains tax in the context of CFCs can create unintended tax liabilities for taxpayers. 11 Finally, where capital gains tax could be attributable from a CFC, there will need to be a valuation undertaken of the CFC’s assets as at the effective date. This is impractical in the best of circumstances but may be impossible as well. For example, the CFC interest could well be acquired considerably after the date a capital gains tax becomes effective, but the CFC could have owned the assets from before the valuation date, but had no reason to do a valuation on the effective date. 100219915/6703323.8 7 APPENDIX 2 CURRENT EXAMPLES OF COMPLEXITIES/FLAWS IN THE CFC RULES 1 If a CFC does not have audited statements it frequently has to apply NZ rules to its overseas accounts for NZ purposes. This can be very complicated and expensive. And it seems to serve little purpose, since there is already a big disincentive, in the form of double taxation, to have any attributable income in a CFC in a jurisdiction subject to a full income tax regime. 2 Any attempt to work through the debt allocation rules in relation to complicated CFC holdings can be very difficult and subjective, with potentially significant negative consequences if the 5% test is failed. 3 An interest in a CFC in one country, which has an interest in a FIF or a CFC (in either another country or in the same country but that can't be part of the group) can create double tax in some circumstances, such as deductible dividends paid up through a chain of ownership. 4 Trying to apply debt forgiveness rules to an insolvent CFC and attribute the debt forgiveness rules up to its NZ owner is punitive. The owner of the CFC likely has no economic gain. The attribution of debt forgiveness is an oversight but it does show how complicated rules can easily have major flaws (there are others) that take years, in the best case, to identify and resolve. 5 In summary, the CFC rules are so complicated for individuals with extensive holdings that it is not only very difficult and expensive to comply with the rules, it is also hard to get the professional help needed as there are a limited number of qualified people. 100219915/6703323.8 8 APPENDIX 3 EXAMPLE REASONS WHY PASSIVE/ACTIVE TEST IS NOT A GOOD BASIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER A CAPITAL GAIN AT A CFC SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED 1 In this appendix we have included examples that show how the CFC rules (in particular the active/passive distinction) sometimes do not work as intended and should not be used as a reliable distinction for when a capital gain derived by a CFC should be included as attributable foreign income. Example 1 – financial arrangements over $1m 2 Where the total value of financial arrangements to which a CFC is a party is more than $1,000,000 at any time during the relevant accounting period, generally it will be required to calculate the part of the attributable CFC amount and net attributable CFC income or loss arising from financial arrangements in NZ currency. 2 3 A CFC that only holds financial arrangements denominated in its own functional currency will not have foreign exchange gains or losses. However, for the purposes of the CFC rules, foreign exchange income (i.e. passive income) may arise as a result of converting an amount of interest or principal into NZ dollars. As a result of applying NZ's CFC rules, the CFC may be classified as passive (i.e. failing the active business test). 4 The CFC rules should allow for calculations to be done in the CFC’s functional currency regardless of whether it has audited statements to prevent unprincipled outcomes. Example 2 – start-up companies 5 Start-up companies may be deemed to be passive/active based on their current income streams but the income of the company (including minimal interest income and perhaps foreign exchange gain, but no revenue as it is developing its products and there is a long development period) may not truly represent the nature of the CFC’s business, but is rather a result of a certain phase of the CFC’s business cycle. If the CFC’s only income is from a financial arrangement, then the CFC can’t qualify as active. 2 Section EX 21(7).

The Report takes a comprehensive look at the system of taxation from the perspective of central government and its revenue needs, although there are a number of topics where the interface with local government is mentioned and it is these that our comments are generally concerned with. Section 9: Environmental and ecological outcomes Water pollution LGNZ agrees with the statement that tax instruments are not well suited to addressing all water pollution issues – there are also important roles for regulation, education and support. We also agree with the following: Locally variable pricing tools are supported. If the aim is to improve water quality, imposing allocation limits, backed by the ability to trade, is likely to have as good if not a better outcome. Sensitivity of water pollutant tax rates to local catchment conditions are also supported. Unless government provides a nationally consistent framework and toolkit for local application. Solid waste Given local government’s responsibilities in relation to the management of the waste stream, levies should be set at a level that meets the direct and indirect cost of managing the waste stream, but not to the degree that extensive non-compliance results. As the Report notes any significant increase in the waste levy creates a behavioural risk that individuals may resort to illegal dumping to avoid paying the increased charges. The suggestion is made in paragraph 88 that the current approach to hypothecation should be revisited, not only to ensure funds are allocated in the best way to promote a more “circular economy”, but also because additional funding may be required to address externalities, particularly if levy increases may be required to encourage non-compliance. LGNZ supports this view. Road transport Issues of equity related to road pricing are briefly discussed in paragraph 92. This is particularly prescient in New Zealand ’s hig h growt h coun cils with poor er famil ies mo re likely to be livin g further from city centres and thus likely to be most affected by any road user charges, as well as having less access to frequent public transport services. Conversely, wealthier citizens are likely to live more centrally and more likely to benefit from investment in public transport. Timing may be an important consideration when road user charges are being considered. Revenue recycling Paragraph 112 discusses the merits or otherwise of recycling income fro m environmental taxes, presumably through some form of hypothecation. While LGNZ believes hypothecated taxes play an important role in our system of public finance, (for example the Land Transport Fund), we suspect that too many hypothecated taxes could make the system complex and inflexible. Should the government explore this idea then an equalisation fund is needed to ensure low population/income councils are not further disadvantaged. Tobacco The discussion on tobacco excise contains an excellent discussion on the regressive nature of further excise increases and other potential negative externalities, such as increases in crime. Amongst the social costs created by tobacco use are costs incurred by councils when removing litter and performing regulatory roles, such as enforcing compliance in relation to smoke free areas. These activities are funded through property taxes but t here is a good case that some contribution should be made from the excise. Section 12: GST LGNZ supports the Tax Workin g Group ’s conclusions that GST exceptions are a poorly-targeted mechanism to achieve distributional goals. We agree that GST exceptions are also “complex and generate large compliance and administration costs. Other measures, such as welfare transfers, are likely to have greater benefits for t he same fiscal cost”. Section 14: Taxation of business Seismic strengthening Local government has a direct interest in the way in which the tax system can help or hinder the actions of building owners towards investment in seismic strengthening. It is a concern that current tax settings, as noted in the report, allow for t ax deductions to be claimed should a building collapse in an earthquake, but not for expenditure that will prevent the building from collapsing. Owners of older buildings throughout New Zealand are facing significant costs in order to meet earthquake standards, and it is important that the taxation system helps rather than hinders appropriate investment. Conclusion Our initial correspondence to the Tax Working Group (24 April 2018) highlighted the importance of taking an holistic and integrated look at tax in New Zealand and focused in particular on the inter- relationship between local and national taxes. While the Productivity Commission is looking specifically at the revenue needs of local government, high level thinking is also needed about the way in which the tax system provides for both national and local public goods. Councils are frequently confronted with demands for expenditure on matters that involve the achievement of national goals, objectives and policies for which existing revenue and taxing sources are poorly suited. Two recent matters involve the provision of local amenities for visitors and meeting drinking water standards in small and isolated communities. In both cases the demand for investment is driven nationally rather than locally and existing revenue options, namely rates and charges, are poorly suited. Both cases highlight a problem created by the allocation of tax bases between local and central government and the need for councils to have a more diverse tax base. LGNZ is more than willing to discuss these issues with the Tax Working Group. Yours sincerely Dave Cull President Local Government New Zealand

This is Auckland Council’s submission on the Tax Working Group’s interim report (the interim report) that was released on 20 September 2018. 2. Auckland Council welcomes the opportunity to submit on the Tax Working Group’s interim report. 3. Auckland Council makes this submission as the unitary authority for a region that is New Zealand’s largest commercial centre, is home to around a third of the country’s population and contributes almost 40 per cent to the nation's gross domestic product. 4. The council is committed to help tackle Auckland’s key challenges of high population growth, shared prosperity, and environmental degradation. Our comments in this submission reflect that. 5. Auckland Council recognises the importance of a well-functioning tax system and the role it can play in incentivising certain behaviours and disincentivising undesirable behaviours. 6. Given the submission deadline of 1 November 2018 and the broad spectrum of topics in the interim report, this submission focuses on the topics of most relevance to Auckland Council, primarily:  environmental and ecological outcomes  housing affordability. 7. The council notes the interim report contains a mixture of recommendations and further proposals/commentary. This submission addresses both aspects where relevant. In some instances, the council did not consider there was sufficient information in the interim report to provide a definitive response. 8. A key message of this submission is that the Tax Working Group should satisfy itself that its recommendations are supported by robust evidence, drawing on lessons and experience from other jurisdictions – what has been effective, and what lessons have been learned – whilst being cognisant of any perverse impacts and/or costs. 9. The interim report indicates that the Tax Working Group is considering whether to recommend the introduction of new taxes. Auckland Council submits that where councils are required to help implement and/or administer these taxes, they should be adequately compensated. 10. This submission has been approved by a delegation of Auckland Council’s Finance and Performance Committee and includes the views of the Auckland Independent Māori Statutory Board. 11. Given the broad nature of the interim report, the discussion/recommendations contained within it, and the wide cross-section of views that councillors represent from 2 across Auckland, not all points raised in this submission were unanimously supported by all councillors. 12. The address for service is Auckland Council, Private Bag 92300, Victoria Street West, Auckland 1142. 13. Please direct any enquiries to Matthew Walker, Chief Financial Officer, at Discussion Environmental and ecological outcomes Tax Working Group’s statements/comments in its interim report There is significant scope for the tax instruments to play a greater role in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes in New Zealand. Environmental tax instruments can be a powerful tool for ensuring people and companies better understand and account for the impact of their actions on the ecosystems on which they depend. Taxes are not well suited to all environmental problems and regulation will still be a better approach for dealing with some issues. The Group has prepared a draft framework that identifies a range of criteria and design principles for environmental taxes to be effective. Environmental taxation and regulation should be considered together for positive outcomes. 14. Auckland Council supports in-principle these conclusions, noting any environmental taxation tools would need to be part of a broader response which could include (but not limited to) regulations and non-regulatory incentives. 15. The council suggests that a success measure for environmental taxation tools could include the degree by which revenues from that tax reduce over the long-term, as behaviours change (as per the intent of any such tax) and environmental externalities decrease. Tax Working Group’s statements/comments in its interim report In the short term, there may be benefits in expanding the coverage of the waste disposal levy, and for reassessing waste and landfill disposal externalities to see if higher rates are warranted. There could also be benefits from strengthening the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and advancing congestion charging. Tax Working Group’s assessment in its interim report A reformed ETS should be the centrepiece of New Zealand’s emission reduction efforts but should provide greater guidance on price, and become revenue raising by auctioning of New Zealand emission units. The Tax Working Group has further recommended the ETS be subject to periodic review to ensure it is fit for purpose. \[1\] 3 Waste disposal levy 16. Auckland Council supports the recommendation regarding the waste disposal levy. The council is a member of the New Zealand Waste Levy Action Group which commissioned the Eunomia report referenced in the interim report. 17. The council recently adopted its 2018 Waste Management and Minimisation Plan (WMMP). It includes a priority action to advocate for an increased levy and a review of the waste levy structure. 18. It is considered a priority because the council has little influence over commercial waste which makes up around 80% of all waste sent to landfill in Auckland. A higher waste levy may incentivise diversion of waste from landfill to productive use, and investment in resource recovery technologies. 19. The WMMP cautions that a careful approach is required to ensure any levy changes are signalled well in advance, introduced gradually and do not undermine the financial viability of bona-fide recycling activities (for example, car dismantlers who produce waste as a result of their activities). 20. Funding from the levy will need to be made available to local authorities to support education and enforcement activities to address any short-term impacts, national recycling initiatives, along with nationally implemented product stewardship schemes to provide long term solutions for problem items such as tyres. Emissions Trading Scheme 21. The above recommendation and discussion by the Tax Working Group generally aligns with the council’s submission of September 2018 on Improvements to New Zealand’s Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS). 22. While the Tax Working Group notes that the ETS could be a significant source of revenue it does not discuss how any revenue should be spent. The council’s submission on Improvements to New Zealand’s Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) recommends ETS revenues be targeted to:  support local government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while ensuring communities are prepared for climate change impacts  support environmental biodiversity in face of climate change  support technological innovation to increase climate adaptation and mitigation. Congestion charging 23. As a member of the Congestion Question project, Auckland Council supports the investigation of a congestion charging scheme for Auckland to improve the performance of the transport network and more accurately reflect the cost of certain trips. 24. The council notes this is a complex area, and that before the introduction of any scheme, the economic, social and environmental effects will need to be understood 4 and appropriately addressed. For instance, the introduction of congestion charging on top of a regional fuel tax would be particularly burdensome for low-income Aucklanders. Tax Working Group’s statements/comments in its interim report Over the medium term, there could be benefits from greater use of tax instruments to address challenges in both water pollution and water abstraction. Addressing Māori rights and interests in fresh water should be central to any changes. In the longer term, new tools could allow for an expanded role for environmental taxes to address other challenges such as biodiversity loss and impacts on ecosystem services. 25. Auckland Council submits that improving water quality requires a comprehensive multi- pronged approach in which environmental taxes could feature. 26. Any environmental taxes developed to improve water quality need to be integrated with, and be complementary to, the National Policy Statement on Freshwater Management and other aspects of Central Government’s Essential Freshwater Programme. The council notes the Three Waters Review is underway. 27. We understand the three main objectives from the Essential Freshwater programme are:  stopping further degradation and loss  reversing past damage  addressing water allocation issues. 28. The council notes that while there is greater understanding and modelling capability for nitrogen and phosphorus pollution dynamics, a large array of pollutants affect fresh water from a range of sectors. 29. Further, the council would consider supporting greater use of tax instruments to address water pollution and water abstraction, though matters relating to Māori rights and interests in freshwater would first need to be resolved (assuming revenue from any such tax(es) would be allocated to the government and/or councils, or for mana whenua led rehabilitation or planting programmes for rivers and streams, or biosecurity/pest eradication activities). 30. The council submits that where councils are required to help implement and/or administer taxes, they should be adequately compensated. 31. It should be noted that as part of Auckland Council’s 2018 10-year-Budget, Aucklanders prioritised spending to protect our natural environment and improve water quality across the region. The council has ring-fenced $452 million raised through a water quality targeted rate for projects that will ensure cleaner beaches, streams and harbours. The $311 million natural environment targeted rate will help protect our natural environment and tackle the pests, weeds and diseases that are threatening our native species. 5 Tax Working Group discussion – tax concessions The Tax Working Group acknowledges the practical difficulties involved in applying fringe benefit tax to employee car parks. In recognition of this constraint, the group suggests Central Government examine the possibility of allowing employers to subsidise public transport use by employees without incurring fringe benefit tax. At the moment, the provision of free car parking to employees is not subject to fringe benefit tax, yet any contribution made to an employee’s public transport costs is taxed. This has the perverse impact of discouraging the use of public transport. 32. Auckland Council supports the suggested introduction of an exemption from fringe benefit tax for public transport. 33. As set out in in the New Zealand Transport Agency research report 474 Company cars and fringe benefit tax – understanding the impacts on strategic transport targets, “employees who receive significant parking subsidies (through \[fringe benefit tax\] exemptions) are more likely to drive than use alternative modes of transport”. 34. This outcome runs contrary to the strategic urban and transport policy objectives of both the council and the government. Allowing employers to subsidise employee public transport use in a similar fashion to employee car parking would help mitigate or remove this distortion. 35. Auckland Council also notes the rise of different forms of personal mobility which can be used as means of transport to and from employment (for example, bike share). The council suggests that the Tax Working Group explore the extent to which employers make contributions to their employees’ transport costs via other transport modes and consider whether this should also be excluded from fringe benefit tax. Housing affordability Tax Working Group’s statements/comments in its interim report The Tax Working Group’s work on housing affordability is closely linked with its work on the taxation of capital income. The group will have particular regard to housing market impacts as it finalises its recommendations regarding capital income. 36. Auckland Council notes that the Tax Working Group is aware that any recommendation(s) it ultimately makes in respect of extending the taxation of capital income could have significant impacts for assets held by Māori in collective ownership. 37. Exempting Māori land (freehold collective and commercial redress land) from capital income tax would likely support Māori entities to achieve economic and social development outcomes without further taxing their land, bearing in mind that Māori owned land is generally held inter-generationally and much less likely to be sold for capital gain compared to other land. And in the event such land was subsequently sold, it would then become liable for a capital income tax, just as non-Māori land. 6 38. The council notes the Tax Working Group intends to use the period between the interim and final reports to better understand this asset base and explore potential implications with Māori stakeholders. Auckland Council supports these discussions taking place. Tax Working Group discussion The Tax Working Group identifies three options that could release some additional supply: 1. Restoration of depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings. (New Zealand abolished depreciation deductions for buildings in 2010, with effect from 2012). The group is considering whether there is a case to reinstate depreciation deductions for certain types of buildings and will provide recommendations on this in its final report. 2. Introduction of a tax on vacant residential land or on empty homes in residential areas. 3. Removal of the ‘ten year rule 1 ’ (rule would need to be reconsidered if capital income taxation is extended further). 39. Auckland Council submits that there is no single solution to resolving the housing crisis and improving housing outcomes (whether people rent or own the home they live in). The use of multiple levers is required. 40. The council is supportive, in principle, of initiatives that will:  make more serviced/developable land available for housing and commercial activities (particularly in brownfield areas) in accordance with the Auckland Development Strategy and Future Urban Land Supply Strategy  help resolve the current housing crisis and result in better housing outcomes. 41. As stated earlier, the Tax Working Group should satisfy itself that its recommendations are supported by robust evidence, drawing on lessons and experience from other jurisdictions whilst being cognisant of any perverse impacts and/or costs. Tax on vacant residential land and empty homes in residential areas 42. Auckland Council notes any such tax would be in addition to rates already levied on the land/property. 43. Any such tax may be financially burdensome to property owners unable to make their land available for housing purposes. Equally there may be other reasons/issues why the land is not suitable for development (for example, contamination, topography, leftover land from development, or not meeting the minimum section size threshold) or has not yet been developed (for example, lack of capital or unavailability of bulk infrastructure). 1 Land affected by changes in zoning, consents or other specified changes may be taxed on sale, if the sale is within 10 years of acquisition. If at least 20% of the gain on disposal can be attributed to the change, the whole gain is taxable; however, the taxable amount is effectively reduced by a deduction equal to 10% of the gain multiplied by each year the taxpayer has owned the land. 7 44. The administration of a tax on empty homes is likely to be contingent on access to utility company and other evidence about utilisation. 45. In the absence of detailed analysis in the interim report, the council submits that in considering its final recommendations, the Tax Working Group should consider matters such as (but not limited to):  thresholds (for example, size of land parcels to target, whether land parcels meet feasible development tests and whether they are infrastructure ready)  how empty homes and vacant land are defined (for example, a time bound measure)  how the system would be implemented, and by whom  whether there is discretion to account for individual circumstances  whether taxation of empty homes could be combined with other incentives. 46. If the council is required to assist in the implementation of any such tax, the council would need to at least be compensated. Removal of the ‘ten year rule’ 47. Auckland Council understands that in the current situation, land affected by zoning changes, consents, or other specified changes may be taxed on sale, if the sale is within ten years of acquisition. 48. In the interim report, the Tax Working Group states that the ten year rule “creates an incentive for landholders on city fringes to withhold land from development until ten years have passed from a change in land use regulation.” 49. On the face of it, the council observes that the ‘ten year rule’ would have the opposite effect of the intent of a vacant land tax. While a vacant land tax would incentivise a landowner to release land for development (by taxing them for holding land), the ten year rule would appear to tax them for doing exactly that where land has been, say, rezoned from rural to mixed housing urban zone (that is, taxing the landowner for releasing land for development). 50. The council is unaware of the extent in practice to which landholders are incentivised to withhold land from development by the ten year rule. It is suggested that this be further explored, taking into consideration how removal of this rule might incentivise development at the urban fringes versus in brownfields, noting the infrastructure costs for brownfield areas are substantially less than for greenfield areas. 51. We envisage that the Tax Working Group’s final recommendation(s) in this regard will be supported by robust evidence. 8 Restoration of depreciation on multi-unit residential buildings 52. Auckland Council notes that Central Government abolished depreciation deductions for buildings in 2010, with effect from 2012. 53. The council notes that the Tax Working Group is considering recommending the restoration of depreciation deductibility for multi-unit residential buildings. 54. The council supports the restoration of depreciation deductibility for multi-unit residential buildings. We are encouraged by the Tax Working Group’s assessment that the restoration would support greater intensification in urban areas. 55. The restoration of depreciation deductibility for multi-unit residential buildings could be of benefit to Māori community housing providers and some forms of papakāinga. 56. The council notes that the group is considering whether to recommend restoration of depreciation deductibility for commercial and industrial buildings as well. The council supports this in principle (subject to further Tax Working Group analysis and exploration of any unintended consequences). The Tax Working Group would also need to be confident that any realised gain in excess of the depreciated value would be taxed as appropriate. Auckland has a large commercial and industrial base. The interim report states that commercial and industrial buildings depreciate faster than other types of residential buildings. Restoration of depreciation deductibility may therefore help with asset renewal decisions. Other matters Tax Working Group recommendation - Retain the 17.5% rate for Māori authorities. - Extend the 17.5% rate to the subsidiaries of Māori authorities. - Consider technical refinements to the Māori authority rules, as suggested by submitters, in the Tax Policy Work Programme. 2 57. In the process of preparing its submission, the council advised mana whenua of the Tax Working Group’s interim report and highlighted key topics that may be of particular interest to them. 58. The council notes that the 17.5% tax rate for Māori authorities is lower than the standard company tax rate of 28% in recognition of the marginal tax rate likely to be applying to the ultimate economic owners of Māori authorities. The interim report concludes that the 17.5% rate remains appropriate and recommends that more entities 2 Submitters have also suggested a number of technical refinements to the Māori authority rules. The main suggestion is to apply a default 17.5% resident withholding tax rate for distributions from Māori Authorities. The default resident withholding tax rate is currently 33%, so Māori authority members on the 17.5% rate will be subject to additional taxation of 15.5% if they do not provide their IRD numbers and file a tax return. Since few members do so, this income is effectively overtaxed. The Group recommends the Government investigate this and other suggestions through the Tax Policy Work Programme. 9 should qualify for this tax rate, in particular, subsidiaries of Māori Authorities. This would reduce compliance costs and simplify business structures for such entities. Tax Working Group discussion The interim report’s executive summary notes that the Tax Working Group is currently working with stakeholders to develop a framework to support the future evolution of the tax system that reflects principles from Te Ao Māori, alongside the four capitals of the Living Standards Framework and the principles of tax policy design. This includes exploring concepts of waiora (wellbeing), manaakitanga (care and respect), kaitiakitanga (stewardship), whanaungatanga (relationships and connectedness), and ōhanga (prosperity). 59. The council looks forward to seeing the outcome of this work and its application to the detailed design changes to the tax system. Conclusion 60. Auckland Council thanks the Tax Working Group for affording us the opportunity to submit on this important topic. 61. Our submission highlights a number of matters that the Tax Working Group should take into consideration before making its recommendations. 62. The council would welcome the opportunity to discuss the matters raised in this submission. 63. Auckland Council wishes the Tax Working Group well in its endeavours and we look forward to the group releasing its final report.

MEMORANDUM Date: 1 November 2018 To: Tax Working Group From: Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Subject: Submission on Tax Working Group Interim Report – Tax Administration and the Integrity of the Tax System \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with feedback on your interim report. Following our workshop on 11 October 2018 we summarise our key recommendations below. Tax Administration Transparency of IR – information and data  Devise a framework for publishing data and information. Accountability of IR – Taxpayer Advocate Service and tax disputes  We fully support the establishment of a Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) as an independent “voice for the taxpayer” within the tax system. With appropriate safeguards this could operate as an autonomous unit within IR.  It is reasonable that the initial focus of the TAS be to provide taxpayers, especially SME and individual taxpayers, with help and resources to deal with tax issues. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ.  The role of the TAS should promote the fairness of the tax system in terms of operation and also perception by taxpayers.  The immediate focus of the TAS should be to: o address taxpayer complaints and challenges faced through their interaction with the tax system; o act as a ‘circuit breaker’ during a tax investigation to avoid entrenchment; o ensure taxpayer issues are escalated within IR and dealt with appropriately; and o be an independent moderator/facilitator with early involvement in the formal disputes process (waiting until the conference stage is too late as an intervention in terms of taxpayer time and cost already expended); o a narrower rather than broader focus at the outset is appropriate until the service is fully operational and understood by taxpayer’s.  Further work and thinking is required to fully scope the role and powers of the TAS and how it would be structured – including more consultation with key stakeholders (CA ANZ, NZLS, CTG, IR (PAS and Customer and Compliance), Treasury).  Irrespective of whether or not a TAS is established it is imperative that taxpayer issues are able to be escalated within IR to avoid entrenchment of positions and taxpayer burn off. Transparency of IR/Integrity of the Tax System – development of tax policy  Action is required to address identified shortcomings in the execution of the GTPP.  Suggested areas of review include: o engagement needs to be early and meaningful – preferably at “problem definition” stage; o timeframes; o volume of work; o consideration of complexity of issues; o management and ownership of each project; o quality of draft legislation at Bill stage (drafting process should not be rushed and careful checking required before including in a Bill). © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ.  A process should be established within Parliamentary convention to allow the detail of the draft legislation to be discussed/debated.  Consistent with the “right from the start” approach, IR Policy should be responsible for the outcomes that result from the administration of the legislation (i.e. their responsibility does not stop at determining the policy). Accountability of IR/Integrity of the Tax System – legislative frameworks  Need to appropriately resource and prioritise continual work on remedials, e.g. establish a remedials committee (model on former Rewrite Advisory Panel).  Post-implementation reviews should be prioritised/carried out as a matter of course under GTPP. Integrity of the Tax System Hidden economy  The strategy adopted must be coherent and consistent, including the contemporaneous roll out of targeted and wider public awareness campaigns.  There is a behavioural aspect to addressing the hidden economy, e.g. there is strong anecdotal evidence that IR has a low profile outside of the main metropolitan centres, leading to the perception that compliance is low in the regions; this influences taxpayer behaviour.  Increasing/expanding the withholding tax rules does not address the issues at the consumer-to- business level – need another plan for this aspect.  More work is needed on whether it is appropriate to introduce a rule that would remove tax deductibility if a payer has not complied with withholding or reporting rules; and if such a rule were to be introduced, what the rule would look like (e.g. appropriate criteria and exceptions). Directors’ liability  More work is required regarding the Director Penalty Notice regime to clearly define the problem and the approach to be adopted. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ.  Concern regarding the practical risks of introducing the Director Penalty Notice regime, e.g. unnecessarily put off professional advisors taking up directorships, loss of valuable skills in business, unintended consequences. Debt collection  Further consideration is required regarding: o secrecy implications; o consistency of tax and non-tax debt collection rules/processes in IR and other Government departments; o relief and repayment rules (i.e. instalment arrangements); o role of tax pooling; o interest and penalties rules; o who would have powers to write-off?  Need to ensure outsourcing IR debt collection does not create negativities and anxieties – critical that the information acted on is correct. Overdrawn shareholder current accounts  IR already has extensive dividend rules which could be better utilised.  If additional powers of enforcement/recovery are given to the Commissioner there is a need to ensure that there is balance between these powers and the principles of fairness and equity.

MEMORANDUM Date: 1 November 2018 To: Tax Working Group From: Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Subject: Submission on Tax Working Group Interim Report – Business Tax \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with feedback on your Interim Report. Following our workshop on 23 October 2018 we summarise our key recommendations below. Key principles  Simplicity – increases productivity; increases voluntary compliance.  Thresholds and exemptions where appropriate – legislation should be written for the vast majority of taxpayers who comply, not the very small minority who do not.  Maintaining the integrity of the tax system – complexity means the rules may not be followed.  Optionality – including a simple option allows a business to spend less time on compliance; most smaller businesses do not have the time or resources to carry out several complex calculations. Acknowledge (but do not agree with) officials’ position that optionality encourages businesses to “game the system” and increases compliance cost. Overall comments  We agree with the decision in the Interim Report to not consider a bifurcated tax rate.  A lost opportunity for large scale reform – for example presumptive taxes based on turnover or gross income, with rates set by IR, would remove all complexity around deductions and amounts returned would be “close enough”. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Limiting the application of current rules  Suggest limiting a series of regimes or sets of rules for businesses below a consistent turnover threshold e.g. $5m.  This could be done through a combination of some or all of the below. Comments on specific rules  Low value asset write-off o Increase in threshold would be a significant simplification for all businesses, but could be limited to smaller businesses if subject to fiscal constraints. o We suggest a prospective rule that applies only to new assets. o Fiscal costs seems high – what assumptions were used for the modelling? o Should be retained as a measure for when the Government has sufficient fiscal headroom.  Capital/revenue boundary o The capital/revenue boundary could be eliminated for expenses up to a certain level e.g. $20,000. o This would be an expansion of the current rules for legal fees, which allow expenses up to $10,000. o Even the thresholds suggested involve very modest amounts of tax and could be increased.  Entertainment regime o We agree with suggestions to exclude all but the most significant costs. o We agree with suggestions that automation could also be helpful, but the technology would need to be accessible to all businesses and not just large businesses.  Building depreciation o We agree that some commercial buildings do depreciate in value. o A specific amendment could be made for seismic strengthening costs to allow deduction or depreciation of those costs. This issue also manifests itself in the discussion regarding the taxation of income from capital. Depending on which, if any, recommendations are adopted, it is likely that a tax on income from capital could resolve the issue and would defer the cost to government until realisation. This would put new builds on the same footing as existing buildings. o We recognise that the fiscal cost is significant and that a degree of compromise may be required.  FBT and motor vehicles o Allowing an up-front payment (or reduction in GST claimed) in return for no FBT payable and no GST adjustments would be a significant simplification. This measure could include an environmental element e.g. concession applies to electric vehicles. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. o Current definition of “work related vehicle” incentivises use of double cab utes – rules should be relaxed to allow more exemptions for environmentally friendly vehicles o Expansion of the “work related vehicle” exemption would also mitigate the current issues with the disproportionate FBT cost in respect of very limited availability for private use on a particular day.  Financial arrangement rules – definition of “cash basis person” o We understand that an extension to the definition is on IR work programme. o Would create alignment with investment income information.  Hybrid rules o Should not apply to small business and ideally should apply only to large multinational groups and structured arrangements. o Rules currently apply to simple business transactions including transfer of trading stock and utilisation of losses. The hybrid rules should not apply to these transactions.  Depreciation rates o Should be reduced in number for small businesses. o We suggest small businesses be allowed to use a simplified set of default rates for the life of the asset e.g. a rate for motor vehicles, plant and machinery, office equipment, computers, buildings  Threshold for GST adjustments o Increase the threshold for not requiring a change of use adjustment, which is compliance intensive for low revenue and poor compliance. o This concern was raised at the time of the regime’s introduction.  “Same business test” for losses o Would remove the need for complex ownership / continuity calculations. o Would assist start-up businesses and those in growth phase. o Could be extended to allow loss carry back (which would also benefit start-ups). o If there is to be a “same business” test it must be crafted to work for the vast majority who are simply trying to comply – we recommend a “materially the same” test – that is applied in a practical way.  AIM o We have held a workshop with officials to discuss how AIM could be made more accessible and more user friendly. o Following the workshop, officials are carrying out work to revise or eliminate certain determinations to reduce complexity and to consider incentives for entry.  Feasibility o Implementing appropriate rules to ensure feasibility study costs are immediately deductible, or at least amortisable. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

MEMORANDUM Date: 1 November 2018 To: Tax Working Group From: Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand Subject: Submission on Tax Working Group Interim Report – Capital and wealth. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback on your Interim Report. Following our workshop on 16 October 2018 we summarise our key recommendations below: Problem definition:  Establish a list of criteria to measure and assess fairness when considering what to tax;  Avoid complexity when designing the rules;  Greater analysis is needed to ensure New Zealand’s productive economy is not detrimentally impacted. What should be included?  Land, residential investment, commercial and farms;  Shares – in principle. However, this is a complex area because of the obvious double and triple tax issues and requires more analysis than has occurred to date;  Business assets. What should be excluded?  Main home;  Personal assets. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Other matters:  Consider further the exclusion of holiday homes that are held solely for personal use, particularly in the context of intergeneration/wider family ownership;  Consider what the impact might be on the New Zealand capital markets. Would introducing a tax on capital simply cause the flight of capital offshore? Shares  The treatment of shares requires further analysis and debate;  Preference to align the tax treatment of domestic listed shares and offshore shares to ensure New Zealand capital markets are not impacted by tax arbitrage;  Consider taxing a portfolio investment in foreign shares on a realisation basis. Business assets  Allow the purchaser to deduct or amortise the cost of goodwill. Main home  More than one home, allow the person to choose;  Main home used for income earning activity, include a de minimis e.g. X days;  Exempting the family home has distributional and equity impacts given that the value of the exemption differs depending on the location of the home;  Relatedly, a financial exemption raises issues of equity and can behave like an estate duty or inheritance tax. In the same way that the TWG needs to look at whether death is a taxable event it should likewise be examined in the family home context. Transitional rules  It is essential we have good quality legislation. The timeframe is tremendously ambitious. Given the design complexity and the need to provide certainty for various parties to update their systems, the initial application date should be deferred;  Adopt a phased approach to develop and pass legislation. Would allow for further investigation of the merits and desirability of each asset type to ensure all outcomes are understood: o Stage 1 - income producing land; o Stage 2 – shares and business assets; © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. o Stage 3 – managed funds and retirement savings;  Provide optionality for valuing existing assets;  Reconsider the merits of applying prospectively to new assets (ie the Australian approach). We are not certain that the cost and robustness of the “valuation at a time” approach has been adequately assessed;  We do not favour a process where taxpayers file an annual statement of cost. However, there needs to be a clear and approved process for record keeping. Calculation method  Impose tax on a realisation basis;  “Realisation” should be defined on a consistent basis;  Additional consideration should be given to recognising value shifting within the overall design. Detailed anti value shifting rules for some situations may be required or robust avoidance rules. Rollover relief  Rollover relief should be focused on situations where the asset is not converted to cash or a cash equivalent and where the proceeds are not reinvested within a prescribed commercial timeframe. The Christchurch earthquake experience will be useful in determining the appropriate rollover timeframe;  Provide rollover relief: o when there has been no change in ownership in substance including wider family transfers; o on death (if death is considered a realisation event) on transfers for natural love and affection, including testamentary transfers or transfers to a trust where it is because of natural love and affection the transferor has for the beneficiaries; o on an involuntary disposition where the proceeds are reinvested; o intra group transactions; o on dispositions of business assets where the proceeds are reinvested (including farms, business premises and assets).  Other possible options for rollover include: o making rollover mandatory not optional and including losses. This would reduce pressure on quarantining losses; o spreading the tax on the gain rather than complete deferral; o allowing rollover only to the extent that the profit exceeds the losses for the year. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ). Formed in Australia. Members of CA ANZ are not liable for the debts and liabilities of CA ANZ. Losses  We support the TWG’s approach of allowing the offset of losses except for fungible assets. We recognise this policy comes under pressure depending on rollover relief. Non-residents  Adopt a principled approach consistent with the Income Tax Act and tax non-residents on their New Zealand sourced income, subject to the Double Tax Agreements;  New Zealand should alter its tax treaty negotiations stance to achieve parity between residents and non-residents on New Zealand sourced income;  Consideration needs to be given to offshore holding structures that non-residents use to hold New Zealand assets to ensure all income from capital is subject to tax. Retirement Savings  Taxation of retirement savings should follow a consistent approach as there are various ways in which people save for their retirement;  The application date should be deferred to allow the funds industry time to update their systems to implement the legislative changes. © Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand ABN 50 084 642 571 (CA ANZ).

In response to the interim report, Philip Morris (New Zealand) Limited (PMNZ) engaged TDB Advisory to prepare a submission on matters raised by the Tax Working Group. PMNZ has provided the Tax Working Group a separate submission on the topic. There are now a range of reduced-risk alternatives to smoking including heat-not-burn (HnB) or heated tobacco products, that heat a portion of tobacco to a temperature that releases vapour and flavour, without reaching the temperature threshold for combustion. The current tax policy does not take into consideration differences in risk profiles between smoking tobacco and smoke-free alternatives. This submission proposes to: • create a separate excise tax for heated tobacco; and • introduce a lower excise tax rate on these products that reflects their reduced risk. This approach is consistent with the policy principles underpinning the application of tobacco excise in New Zealand and could help address the concerns raised by the Tax Working Group. I would be happy to answer any questions the Tax Working Group may have about this submission.

Executive summary 1.1 Introduction In March 2011, the Government adopted the Smokefree 2025 goal for New Zealand. Smokefree 2025 aims to reduce tobacco availability and smoking prevalence to less than 5 percent to effectively make New Zealand a smoke-free nation by 2025. Part of the policy approach to achieve this goal has been substantial annual tobacco excise tax increases. Although smoking rates have declined since 2011, it appears unlikely that the Smokefree 2025 goal will be achieved under the current policy approach. As the Tax Working Group highlighted in its recent interim report, smoking levels have not dropped commensurate with the tax increases. 1 Despite tobacco tax becoming a significant burden on those who smoke, with unwanted social impacts, many Māori, Pasifika and young adults are not quitting. At the current rates of decline, it is estimated that smoking will persist in the general population until after 2050, however it will persist among Māori until after 2080 and among Pasifika until after 2120. In response to the Tax Working Group’s interim report, Philip Morris (New Zealand) Limited engaged TDB Advisory to prepare an analysis of the current tobacco tax policy. This report invites the Tax Working Group to examine the policy principles underpinning the application of tobacco excise and proposes an update to tobacco policy in response to technological developments and evolving government policy on harm reduction. 1.2 Current tax treatment of tobacco and other alternatives Similarly with other countries, tobacco tax policy in New Zealand is designed to prevent smoking initiation and encourage smoking cessation. Where New Zealand stands out from other like- minded countries is the rapid escalation of all tobacco excise rates since 2010 to unprecedented levels internationally. Currently in New Zealand, the excise duty on cigarettes not exceeding 0.8 kg of tobacco content per 1,000 cigarettes, is $826.58 per 1,000 cigarettes. For cigarettes containing more than 0.8 kg of tobacco content per 1,000 cigarettes and smoking tobacco, the applied excise duty is $1,177.87 per kg of tobacco content. For other tobacco products (e.g., cigars) the applied excise duty is $1,033.20 per kg of tobacco content. As recognised by the Tax Working Group, increasingly high tobacco tax has led to three seemingly unintended consequences for consideration: • the regressive nature of the tax increases, disproportionately burdening low income smokers; 1 Tax Working Group, New Zealand. (2018). Future of Tax Interim Report. (page 77) available from https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-interim-report-html. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 5 • the apparent reduction in effectiveness of large excise increases on reducing smoking; and • the recent rise in criminal activity involving cigarettes. The interim report recommended the Government consider other measures to encourage smoking cessation ahead of further large increases in tobacco excise. 1.3 Harm reduction Harm reduction refers to policies and regulations that focus on reducing health risks. This usually involves providing safer forms of hazardous products, or encouraging less risky behaviours, rather than simply focusing on eradication of products or behaviours. Professor Gerry Stimson of Imperial College, London defines tobacco harm reduction as follows: “the tobacco harm reduction proposition is straightforward: smokers risk disease and premature death; most smokers say they want to stop smoking and many have tried; many find it hard to stop and many are unable or unwilling to give up nicotine. The provision of safer ways of delivering nicotine enables people to continue using nicotine but to avoid the health risks of smoking.” 2 There are now a range of reduced-risk alternatives to smoking tobacco. These fit broadly into three main categories of products: • e-cigarettes and e-liquids (vapes), that produce a nicotine-infused flavoured vapour using a battery powered heating system; • heat-not-burn (HnB) or heated tobacco products, that heat a portion of tobacco 3 to a temperature that releases vapour and flavour, without reaching the temperature threshold for combustion; and • oral smokeless tobacco and nicotine products, including products such as snus, a type of moist powdered tobacco, typically held in the mouth between the lips and gums, generally in a tea bag type pouch. The current tax policy does not take into consideration differences in risk profiles between smoking tobacco and these alternatives. Under the existing New Zealand fiscal framework: • e-cigarettes and e-liquids are not subject to excise tax; • HnB consumables are taxed based on the weight of tobacco, at $1,033 per kg of tobacco content, the same level as cigars; and • the sale of snus is currently banned. 4 2 Stimson, G.V. (2016) A tale of two epidemics: drugs harm reduction and tobacco harm reduction in the United Kingdom. Drugs and Alcohol Today, 16 (3), p. 203-11. 3 Products vary among manufacturers, but in general the process involves turning tobacco leaves into a paper-like substance by pulping, compressing and drying. The resulting product cannot be reconstituted for smoking tobacco. 4 Ministry of Health New Zealand. (2017).

TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 6 1.4 Reflecting harm reduction in policy The UK can be seen as a leading exponent of tobacco harm reduction. The UK Parliament Science and Technology Select Committee recently conducted an enquiry into e-cigarettes and novel tobacco products, in the process taking evidence from a wide range of stakeholders, public health experts. This report concluded: “There is clear evidence that e-cigarettes are substantially less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Public Health England estimate e-cigarettes as 95% less harmful, although the evidence available does not currently allow a precise figure to be determined.” \[Paragraph 27\] “More recently introduced ‘heat-not-burn’ products—producing nicotine from tobacco but without the combustion—have been estimated to be around 90% less harmful than conventional cigarettes,. “ \[Paragraph 28\] 5 In New Zealand, there has also been an acknowledgement of the need for a harm reduction policy framework. In May 2018, the Government stated that: “it is considering how best to apply risk proportionate regulation across all tobacco products including smoked tobacco, smokeless tobacco and vaping products.” 6 This was followed more recently by a statement at the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) 8th Conference of the Parties (CoP8), October 2018, that the New Zealand Government is: “looking at introducing risk proportionate regulations for vaping products to provide smokers with a significantly less harmful alternative.” 7 1.5 Incorporating harm reduction in tobacco taxation This submission puts forward a proposal to create a separate excise category for HnB tobacco with a unique excise rate. There are currently separate excise categories for cigarettes, cigars and loose tobacco, reflecting the characteristics and intended use of these products. It makes sense to create a new separate category for HnB tobacco for two reasons. Firstly, it is a product with fundamentally different characteristics from smoking tobacco products, because it is non- combustible and does not produce smoke. Secondly, it is relatively less harmful and a lower level of taxation would change smoker behaviour, encouraging switching from more harmful products. 5 UK Parliament Science and Technology Committee, “E-Cigarettes”, 2017, https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmsctech/505/505.pdf. 6 Ministry of Health New Zealand.

TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 7 There appear to be three broad options for determining an excise rate to apply to HnB consumables: 1. the same rate as currently applies to cigars and other tobacco products, $1,033.20 per kg of tobacco; 2. excise free, as currently applies to e-liquids; or 3. a rate that is in between Option 1 and Option 2, reflecting the likely reduction in risk from these products. Based on various reports about their estimated reduction in risk, this level could be reduced by 90 percent of the current level, to a level of $103.32 per kg of tobacco content. This approach is consistent with the policy principles underpinning the application of tobacco excise in New Zealand and could help address the concerns raised by the Tax Working Group. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 8 2. Introduction In its September 2018 interim report, 8 the Tax Working Group highlighted concerns about tobacco excise taxation. The interim report listed three seemingly unintended consequences for consideration: • the heavy burden of tobacco excise on low-income earners in poorer areas of the country, which display substantially higher smoking prevalence than the general population; • the reduction in smoking prevalence appears to have slowed, particularly given the size of the tax increases; and • high tobacco excise appears to be a factor contributing to criminal activity involving cigarettes. 9 The interim report recommended the Government consider other measures to encourage smoking cessation ahead of further large increases in tobacco excise. In response to the interim report, Philip Morris (New Zealand) Limited engaged TDB Advisory to prepare this submission on the matters raised. This report invites the Tax Working Group to examine the policy principles underpinning the application of tobacco excise and proposes an update to tobacco policy in response to technological developments and evolving government policy on harm reduction. 2.1 Reduced-risk alternatives to smoking and harm reduction There are now a range of reduced-risk alternatives to smoking. These fit broadly into three main categories of products described in Section 1: (1) e-cigarettes; (2) heat-not-burn (HnB) or heated tobacco products; and (3) oral smokeless products, such as snus. Harm reduction as a policy has gained increasing acceptance both in New Zealand and other countries. In New Zealand, the Government announced in May 2018 that it was considering how to apply risk proportionate regulation across smoked tobacco, smokeless tobacco and vaping. 10 Public Health England (PHE), an agency of the UK government’s Department of Health, has been particularly pragmatic in advocating for "harm-reduction" policies that will reduce the adverse health consequences of cigarettes. Essentially, PHE says that when stacked against one of the most 8 Tax Working Group, New Zealand. (2018). Future of Tax Interim Report. Available from https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz/resources/future-tax-interim-report-html. 9 The comment is given against a background of a spate of violent robberies of convenience store for cigarettes. Tobacco tax also provides the economic driver for the illicit trade in tobacco. According to the Framework Convention Alliance (2008), approximately 11 percent of the world cigarette market in 2006 was illicit. 10 Ministry of Health New Zealand. (2017).

TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 9 harmful substances known to human health (cigarettes), e-cigarettes (and other alternatives) fare better and ought to be used to help smokers quit. 11 With respect to taxation, the UK Science and Technology Committee has stated that: “The level of taxation on smoking-related products should directly correspond to the health risks that they present, to encourage less harmful consumption. Applying that logic, e-cigarettes should remain the least-taxed and conventional cigarettes the most, with heat-not-burn products falling between the two” \[Paragraph 82 \] 12 In March 2018, the UK Treasury released its report on a consultation on the application of excise duty to heated tobacco products. 13 In the UK, HnB consumables are currently taxed at the level of other smoking tobacco. However, the UK Government has announced that it will create a separate category for heated tobacco products by legislation later this year, which will be taxed on a per kg basis of their tobacco content. The UK Budget presented on 29 October 2018 announced that HnB consumables will attract the same tax rate per kg tobacco weight as ‘hand-rolling tobacco’. Although hand-rolling tobacco is a combustible product, in the UK it has long had a considerable tax advantage compared to the tax level on cigarettes. This implies that the effective tax rate on HnB will be significantly lower than that on cigarettes. As in New Zealand, e-cigarettes are not subject to excise duty in the UK. The criteria for inclusion in the new HnB category in the UK are: • is not cigarettes, cigars, hand-rolling tobacco, other smoking tobacco, or chewing tobacco; • consists of or includes tobacco; and • has been manufactured as an insert for exclusive use in a device designed to produce an aerosol for inhalation without combustion of the tobacco. Internationally, the approach of creating dedicated tax categories for HnB products has been adopted in 21 out of the 36 countries HnB products are sold so far. 14 In all but one of these cases the excise tax on HnB products is lower than cigarettes. 11 Public Health England has concluded that e-cigarettes are around 95 percent less harmful than tobacco (Public Health England.

TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 11 3. Background 3.1 Introduction This section provides an overview of the history and context of tobacco taxation and tobacco control in New Zealand and how that response has changed in response to changing understanding of the personal and societal effects of tobacco consumption and smoking. 3.2 A history of excise tax Excises are an example of indirect taxes. Indirect taxes are collected from the supplier of goods and services rather than directly on income or profits. The supplier is an intermediary who recovers the indirect tax from the consumer as part of the price charged for goods and services. The consumer ultimately pays the tax by paying more for the goods and services than the tax-free selling price. 15 Excises have existed for centuries. The infamous French salt gabelle was a temporary tax under Louis IX from 1259. The tax became permanent in 1341, until it was repealed in 1789 by the Revolutionaries. It was later reinstated by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804 and remained in force until 1947. Excise was first levied in Britain in 1643 on beer. Excise on tobacco was first introduced in 1660, not quite a century after the leaves and the practice of smoking was brought to England in 1565. Stamp duty was originally an excise on paper and vellum introduced in 1694 (two years before the infamous Window Tax). Stamp duty survived as a tax collected by stamping legal documents giving evidence to (particularly) real property transfers, mortgages and leases. Customs duties on imports were an early revenue source for the colonial administration in New Zealand. The first excise in New Zealand was imposed on distilled spirits in 1866, followed by domestically grown tobacco in 1879 and on domestically brewed beer the following year. Excises are usually applied as one of the two types explained below, or a combination of both: • ad valorem, a fixed percentage charged on the selling price of a good or service or value of a financial or real property transaction; and • specific, a fixed currency amount charged on a physical unit ($ per unit) related to the good or service. The physical unit may be mass, volume, quantity or weight. 15 The incidence of an indirect tax is determined by the elasticity of consumption in response to a price rise. If consumption is unresponsive (inelastic) the burden will fall mainly on the consumer (forward-shifted). However, if consumption is responsive to the price rise (elastic) the burden will fall mainly on the supplier (backward-shifted). TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 12 Excises in New Zealand are a duty 16 on the domestic manufacture of excised goods. Imported counterparts are subject to customs duty at a rate equivalent to the excise rate that would apply, had the products been produced domestically. The Customs and Excise Act 2018, provides the legal authority. New Zealand applies a system of fully specific excise, which is recognised by international financial organisations (i.e., IMF and the World Bank) as best practice. 17 Regular indexation of specific excise rates to inflation, with a 10 percent escalation in certain periods has removed the main draw-back of specific rates, that they erode with inflation. 3.3 A history of tobacco control in New Zealand Before WWI smoking rates in New Zealand were very low. At the outbreak of war, pipe smoking was the most common form of tobacco smoking in the armies of Europe. British and Empire soldiers received packets of loose tobacco (2 oz per week, roughly 50 g or 100 cigarettes) and matches with their rations. Soldiers supplemented their ration with privately purchased cigarettes because the ration was insufficient to support a smoking habit and the quartermaster’s tobacco was described as “awful”. At Christmas 1914 the Princess Mary Gift Fund Box was widely issued to British and Empire troops, with tobacco and cigarettes being the main contents. The war ushered in a revolution in tobacco culture. It was also the period where cigarette advertising began. After the war tobacco consumption grew steadily to a peak of 2.27 kg per capita in 1929 before falling to 1.86 kg per capita in 1933. Coinciding with the Great Depression, consumption of cigarettes fell 46 percent while consumption of loose tobacco fell 5 percent. Tobacco consumption in New Zealand was at its highest in 1963 at 3.35 kg per capita. That same year, cigarette advertising on television and radio stopped. In 1973, tobacco consumption was at 2.88 kg per capita and the tobacco industry voluntarily agreed not to advertise on billboards and in cinemas. The first health warnings were displayed on cigarette packets in 1974. Until 1970, revenue generation was the dominant rationale behind tobacco taxation in New Zealand. This was the year that the idea that tobacco was harmful, and consumption ought to be discouraged was also first given mention. The Minister of Finance stated: “Of all the products at present subject to indirect tax, it is clear that cigarettes and tobacco can be subject to additional taxation without harming in any way the general welfare of the community. In fact it is increasingly obvious that discouraging consumption of these commodities is likely to make a positive contribution to our general health.” 18 16 Duty is the term for a fee charged by the government on the manufacture and import or export of goods and on certain financial or real property transactions. The term indirect tax includes duties of various kinds as well as sales tax and value added tax. 17 See IMF. (2016). How to Design and Enforce Tobacco Excises? and World Bank. (2017).

Published by A.R. Shearer, Government Printer. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 13 In 1984, New Zealand’s first tobacco control programme began. Smoke-free policies were implemented including health education; support to quit; product health warnings; smoke-free environments; regulation of the tar in cigarettes; and a ban on tobacco event sponsorship. In 1986, tax changes, including the introduction of GST, caused tobacco products to rise in price by 53 percent. Two years later, the sale of cigarettes to anyone under 16 years of age was banned. This was later lifted to 18 years in 1998. From 1989 tobacco excise increases were was linked with the consumer price index (CPI). The Smoke-free Environments Act was passed in August 1990 which: • required all workplaces to have a policy on smoking, and also placed restrictions on smoking in many indoor workplaces. From 2004 smoking was banned in licensed premises and all other workplaces; • banned smoking on public transport and some other public places including cafes, restaurants and casinos. This was later extended to schools and early childhood centres in 2004; • regulated the marketing, advertising, and promotion of tobacco products and the sponsorship of products, services and events by tobacco companies; • provided for the control and disclosure of the contents of tobacco products; and • established the Health Sponsorship Council (HSC) to replace tobacco sponsorship. In 2003, the WHO FCTC was signed by New Zealand. The WHO FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. 19 In April 2010, the excise duty on loose tobacco was increased by 29 percent and excise on cigarettes by 10 percent. From the following year, the excise duty on tobacco products was increased by 10 percent on top of CPI each January. In the same year the National Māori Tobacco Control Strategy 2003–2007 and Action Plans were developed. Graphic pictorial health warnings appeared on all tobacco packages so that 30 percent of the front and 90 percent of the back was covered by health warnings. In April 2011, following a Māori Affairs Select Committee Inquiry, 20 the Government adopted Smokefree 2025 goal. The following year, the Government agreed in principle to introduce plain packaging and for annual tobacco excise increases of 10 percent (plus inflation) to extend for the next four years. This was part of a wider government programme to prevent young people from taking up smoking and to encourage existing smokers to quit. 19 World Health Organiasation. (last reprint 2005).

There has also been an acknowledgement of the need for a harm reduction policy framework. In May 2018 the Government committed to adopt risk proportionate regulation across all tobacco and vaping products and restated this in October 2018 at the WHO FCTC 8 th Conference of the Parties in Geneva. 3.4 New Zealand’s current tobacco taxation and consumption As Figure 1 below illustrates, the current excise duty on cigarettes not exceeding 0.8 kg of tobacco content per 1,000 cigarettes, is $826.58 per 1,000 cigarettes. For cigarettes containing more than 0.8 kg of tobacco content per 1,000 cigarettes and smoking tobacco, the applied excise duty is $1,177.87 per kg of tobacco content. For other tobacco products (e.g., cigars,) the applied excise duty is $1,033.20 per kg of tobacco content. Figure 1: Excise and excise equivalents duties table Source: https://www.customs.govt.nz/about-us/news/important-notices/new-rates-for-tobacco-and-tobacco-products/ HnB consumables are taxed based on the weight of tobacco, at $1,033 per kg of tobacco content, the same level as cigars. Excise duty on cigarettes and all tobacco categories is due to increase by 10 percent (plus inflation) on January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020 and annually by inflation thereafter. 21 Wellington District Court.

TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 15 E-cigarettes (e-liquids) are not subject to excise tax. The current tax policy does not take into consideration any differences in risk between different products and is used as means to prevent smoking initiation (by young people) and smoking cessation (by nudging smokers to quit smoking). Excises in New Zealand are a duty 22 on the domestic manufacture of excised goods. Imported counterparts are subject to customs duty at a rate equivalent to the excise rate that would apply, had the products been produced domestically. The following chart shows the evolution of the current excise on cigarettes. Since April 2010 the excise duty rate on cigarettes has increased by 163 percent. Figure 2: Recent Increases in Excise Duty on Cigarettes Note: On 29 April 2010, excise duty on cigarettes rose 10 percent, while excise on loose tobacco rose 25.4 percent. Source Stats NZ. The excise duty on loose tobacco has increased even faster than on cigarettes. In April 2010, excise duty on loose tobacco was increased by an additional 14 percent on top of the 10 percent increase that was applied to cigarettes. Since 2010, excise tax on loose tobacco has increased by 200 percent. The purpose of the additional increase was to equalise the tax on cigarettes and loose tobacco on a weight for weight basis of the tobacco contents of “roll-your-own” and manufactured cigarettes. Figure 3 shows New Zealand to have the highest level of tobacco excise in absolute terms and in relation to GDP per capita in the OECD. 22 Duty is the term for a fee charged by the government on the manufacture and import or export of goods and on certain financial or real property transactions. The term indirect tax includes duties of various kinds as well as sales tax and value added tax. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 16 Figure 3: Comparative Tobacco Tax in relation to GDP per capita Source: World Health Organisation and OECD data. It can be noted that Figure 3 is based on WHO 2016 rates and that excise tax levels in New Zealand have since increased by over 20 percent in real terms. 3.4.1 Government revenue Government revenue from customs and excise duty on tobacco products is on track towards $1,807 million in the year ended 30 June 2018. 23 This is 88 percent more than was collected in the year ended 30 June 2008. In the same period the excise duty rate increased by 167 percent implying a tax elasticity of 0.52. 3.4.2 Smoking rates Smokefree reports 24 New Zealand’s smoking rates 25 in 2016/17 were as follows: • 16 percent of adults (aged over 15 years) are regular smokers (down from 20 percent in 2006/07). Smoking rates among males are 17 percent compared with 14 percent of females; • among the younger age groups: 23 Source: Treasury Tax Outturn 30 June 2018. 24 Smokefree. (2018). Fact and Figures. 25 Indicator: Current smokers (have smoked more than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime and currently smokes at least once a month). TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 17 o youth aged 15–17 years: 4 percent smoke regularly down from 16 percent in 2006/07; and o young adults aged 18-24 years: 20 percent smoke regularly down from 28 percent in 2006/07); • 35 percent of Māori adults are regular smokers compared to 42 percent in 2006/07; and • 25 percent of Pacific adults are regular smokers compared to 27 percent in 2006/07. Comparing the 2017 (Smokefree) data with the 2013 (Census) data, it would appear that smoking rates (at a population level) are no longer declining as rapidly as they were, despite the increasing excise. Moreover, among certain population groups like Māori and Pacific adults and young adults aged 18-24 years, smoking remains persistent. 3.5 Conclusions This section has reviewed the history and context of tobacco taxation and tobacco control in response to changing understanding of the personal and societal effects of tobacco consumption. The idea that harm and discouraging consumption was an acceptable basis for tax emerged in 1970. Before that time revenue generation potential was the dominant motivation for tobacco taxation in New Zealand. New Zealand’s tobacco control policies began in earnest in 1984. Two years after the retail price of tobacco products rose by 53 percent in response to taxation including GST. From 1989, tobacco excise was linked with the consumer price index. From 2010 excise duty on loose tobacco equalised with the tax on cigarettes a weight for weight basis of the tobacco content of “roll-your-own” and manufactured cigarettes. Also from that year began a 10 percent annual increase in excise rates above inflation that has persisted for the following seven years. Excise duty on cigarettes is now 93 percent higher than it was in 2009. New Zealand has the highest excise levels on cigarettes amongst the OECD countries. Moreover, when adjusted for income levels, the tax level on cigarettes in New Zealand is higher than all other OECD countries. There has been an acknowledgement of the need for a harm reduction policy framework. In May 2018 the Government committed to adopt risk proportionate regulation across all tobacco and vaping products and restated this in October 2018 at the WHO FCTC CoP8 in Geneva. Yet despite the heavier taxation of tobacco products in New Zealand in recent years, tighter regulation of tobacco products, and the assistance available to help people quit smoking, adult smoking rates appear to be declining slowly at best. In particular, smoking rates remain persistently high amongst Māori and Pacific adults and young adults aged 18-24 years. It therefore seems appropriate to consider what additional measures might be considered to encourage smoking cessation or for those who cannot quit to switch to less harmful smoke-free alternatives. In the next section we examine the available evidence on who pays the tax on tobacco products. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 18 4. Who pays tobacco excise? An excise tax is a tax on consumption and is ultimately paid by the final consumer of the taxed product. Like any consumer tax, the imposition of excise on tobacco affects the distribution of spending power amongst households and individuals. This section examines the available evidence on who in society pays tobacco excise. 4.1 Tax incidence The distribution of the tax burden is usually referred to as the “incidence”. Estimates of tax incidence can be used to inform judgements about whether or not a tax is fair. Such judgements are usually anchored in two perspectives: • horizontal equity, which implies the same treatment is given to people in the same situation without prejudice or preference; and • vertical equity, which implies that people with higher ability to pay (should) pay more tax. Vertical equity is often reinforced through progressive taxes (average tax rate rises with ability to pay). A tax is seen to be regressive when people with a higher ability to pay incur a lower average tax rate than less well-off people. The difficulties associated with accurate determination of the economic incidence 26 of excise duties means that most studies of tax incidence merely assume the tax burden is passed on to the consumer in full through higher prices. The relatively inelastic demand for tobacco suggests that in general this assumption is reasonably realistic. However, as noted by the IMF in it publication: ‘How to Design and Enforce Tobacco Excises?’: “As the demand curve is typically unknown over the entire range of possible tax rates and ensuing prices, governments can best pursue revenue-raising objectives through a process of sustained incremental increases in excises. Thus, governments can learn about the demand and its characteristics by gradually (but not necessarily slowly) increasing excises (in real terms) and measuring the impact on price, quantity, and tax revenue.” 27 26 Firms are legally responsible for collecting excise duties and bear the legal incidence. The economic incidence is an assessment of the distribution of a tax burden between the owners and employees of the firm and consumers. The consumer burden of a tax reflects the amount by which the market price rises while the producer burden is the decline in revenue received after paying the tax. 27 IMF. (2016).

As illustrated in Figure 4 below, the New Zealand Health Survey reveals that approximately 27 percent of quintile 5 are regular smokers and 19 percent of quintile 4 smoke.

Estimated average tax rates on median income understate current average tax rates by ~15 percent because of subsequent excise rise Source: NZ Health Survey 2016/17, Household Economic Survey 2016, Stats NZ., TDB analysis 57 percent of smokers are in the two lowest income groups, Quintiles 4 and 5. We estimate this group (the two top quintile or lower income groups) contributes 51 percent of annual consumer expenditure on tobacco products. In contrast smoking prevalence among the two highest income groups, Quintiles 1 and 2, are 8 percent and 11 percent respectively. These upper income groups account for 29 percent of annual consumer expenditure on tobacco products. A significant proportion of the income of those in the two lowest income groups (Quintiles 4 and 5) is spent on tobacco tax. Figure 5 below illustrates the effective tobacco tax as a percent of median quintile income. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 20 Figure 5: Estimated effective tobacco tax as a percent of median quintile income Notes: See notes to Figure 4 Source: NZ Health Survey, Stats NZ, TDB analysis. Figure 5 shows our estimate of the effective tobacco tax rate as a percentage of median quintile income. As may be seen: • Quintile 5 smokers, i.e., those with the lowest income, pay an estimated 13 percent, more of their income in tax than non-smokers whose circumstances are otherwise similar; • Quintile 3 smokers pay an estimated 3 percent more of their income in tax than non- smokers; and • Quintile 1 smokers, i.e., those with the lowest income, pay an estimated 1.4 percent more of their income in tax than non-smokers. The clear conclusion is that tobacco tax is regressive. An additional consideration is the position of heavy smokers as one-third of heavy smokers are in quintile 5 (see Figure 6 below). Both horizontal equity consideration (equal treatment of equals) and the vertical equity (average tax rates do not decline with higher income) aspect of the tax systems are adversely affected by the taxation of tobacco. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 21 Figure 6: Comparison of effective tax rates on heavy smokers by quintile Notes: See notes to Figure 4 Source: NZ Health Survey, Stats NZ, TDB analysis. In concrete terms the heaviest smokers (males aged 45 to 55 years) who consume 15 cigarettes a day have $100 less available each week to spend on rent, power, food and their children’s needs. This could be seen as disproportionately burdensome on the lowest income members of our society, as the Taxation Working Group has pointed out. Instead we consider to be better ways of reducing the harm from smoking within these groups. 4.1.2 Ethnic groups For some extended period of time, tobacco tax has been the main policy tool in the Government’s arsenal against smoking. Limiting where people can smoke, Quitline, media campaigns, advice from health professionals, bans on advertising, and nicotine replacement therapy are other tools employed. Māori and Pasifika have been slower to quit smoking than other ethnic groups. As a result, Māori and Pasifika are paying a disproportionate share of the tobacco tax because they continue to be over-represented among the population that smokes. Figure 7 on the following page provides illustration of the high share of tobacco tax paid by these groups. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 22 Figure 7: Per capita tobacco tax by ethnic group Notes: See notes to Figure 4 Source: NZ Health Survey, Stats NZ, TDB analysis. On a whole, smoking prevalence has been gradually decreasing. Over the period 2006/07 to 2016/17 there was a 4 percentage point drop in the percentage of the adult population over 15 years of age who smoke to 16 percent. As Figure 8 shows below, there was a greater drop in smoking prevalence among Māori (6.7 percentage points by Māori males and 7 percentage points by Māori females), however smoking among Māori remains much higher than for the general population. In 2016/17 35 percent of Māori were smokers compared with 16 percent of the general population. Māori smokers pay 2.25 times as much tobacco tax as the general population. Figure 8: Trends in smoking prevalence by Māori Source: NZ Health Survey, TDB analysis TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 23 Smoking by Pasifika is also higher than for the general population at 25 percent compared with 15.7 percent. Pasifika smokers pay, on average, 56 percent more tobacco tax than smokers in the general population. While not as dramatic a difference as for Māori, 28 there are contrasting trends discernible in Figure 9 below: • there has been almost no change in smoking prevalence amongst Pasifika women in the decade to 2016/17. If anything, smoking among this group was on a rising trend before dropping by 2 percentage points in 2016/17 to the same level as 2006/07; • while the 10-year trend shows Pasifika males quitting at close to the same rate as the background population, the recent evidence is that smoking prevalence may have reached a plateau among this group. Figure 9: Trends in smoking prevalence for Pasifika Source: NZ Health Survey, TDB analysis To illustrate the differences in smoking trends among ethnic groups, Figure 10 takes a simple linear projection of recent the trajectories for smoking trends among Māori and Pasifika to indicate the trend declines in the coming decades, assuming similar response by smokers to continued tax increases On the basis of these projections: • Māori and Pasifika smoking may converge before 2060 (in four decades) at the smoking prevalence observed in the general population today; and • while smoking may cease among the general population after 2050, on the basis of current trends, smoking will persist among Māori until after 2080 (six decades) and among Pasifika until 2120 (another century). 28 Pasifika smokers, on average tend to consume 70 percent fewer cigarettes than Māori smokers. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 24 Figure 10: Linear trend in smoking prevalence Source: NZ Health Survey, TDB analysis 4.1.3 Conclusions Tobacco excise has played a part in reducing the proportion of adults (aged over 15 years) who smoke from 20 percent to 16 per cent over the last 10 years. The reduction in smoking has slowed and it has come at a high financial cost to the 602,000 smokers who have not quit. This financial cost of the excise tax at $3,000 per annum paid by the average smoker 29 seems to be given little attention in public debate about smoking cessation and tax policy. The higher tax spent on tobacco (as a percentage of income) paid by those on low incomes may be seen as disproportionately burdensome when it is recognised that Māori, Pasifika, the least well-off and youth aged 18 to 24 years pay extra tax as a result of tobacco tax than smokers generally and non-smokers, due to the higher smoking rates amongst these groups. In the next section we present a proposal for a conversation about the role that risk proportionate policies might play in accelerating the cessation of smokers and in reducing some of the inequities arising from current tobacco taxation policies. 29 Assumes 10 cigarettes per day, at a tax rate of $16.53 per pack of 20 cigarettes. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 25 5. Proposal for conversation on reduced-risk products This section presents a proposal for the role that smoke-free reduced-risk products could play in the achievement of a Smokefree 2025. We consider it possible to switch regular smokers, who would otherwise not quit smoking, to using reduced risk alternatives. 5.1 Harm reduction Harm reduction policies are commonplace across a wide range of activities that are regulated. Improving the survivability of motor vehicle accidents through safer vehicle design and compulsory seatbelts is an example. Building standards are geared towards the survivability of occupants during an earthquake. Food safety standards are intended to reduce harm from contamination. Electrical regulation allows the safe use of electricity. Workplace safety regulations promote freedom from harm in otherwise hazardous workplaces. Traffic regulations are intended to reduce harm to road users. Within the health domain there are wide-ranging harm reduction policies and programmes including for drug addiction and safe sex. Risk-based harm reduction approaches are also common within the agriculture sector, including risk-management programmes set up under the Animal Products Act 1999, with the aim of “identify\[ing\] and manag\[ing\] known biological, chemical and physical hazards. 30 A range of policies and programmes are also in place to manage the environmental, health and safety risks associated with pesticides and other chemicals. Harm reduction in connection with smoking cessation has lagged behind other areas, largely because of a lack of reduced-risk alternatives that smokers would switch to. The development of mass-market reduced-risk smoke-free products has seen differences in views among the public health community. The UK seems to be the leading exponent of harm reduction. This side of the debate points to evidence that reduced-risk products are significantly less harmful than smoking cigarettes for: • those who cannot or do not want to give up nicotine; and • those who want to cut back their smoking or quit altogether. From this follows the conclusion that smokers converting to reduced-risk alternatives to smoking have the potential to reduce the overall harm to society. On the other hand, some people working in the tobacco-control field regard reduced-risk alternatives to smoking as a ploy by tobacco companies to “normalise” tobacco use in countries where adult smoking rates have been in decline. A particular concern voiced is the possibility of such products becoming a pathway to nicotine addiction and regular smoking. 30 Ministry of Primary Industries. (2017). An overview of the Animal Products Act 1999. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 26 There are academic critiques on the normalise smoking argument. For example, an academic study published on e-cigarette use in British Medical Journal (BMJ), found that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are renormalising tobacco smoking. \[...\] The evidence shows that in the UK, US and other countries where e-cigarette use among young people have risen, levels of tobacco use have fallen." 31 Public Health England (PHE) and Royal College of Physicians also shared similar views against ‘normalize smoking’ idea. PHE mentioned that “\[...\] there is no evidence to date that EC are renormalising smoking, instead it's possible that their presence has contributed to further declines in smoking or denormalisation of smoking." Therefore, Royal College of Physicians also agreed that “there is no evidence that either NRT or e-cigarette use has resulted in the renormalisation of smoking." 32 5.1.1 How could heated tobacco be taxed? We have noted earlier that e-cigarettes and e-liquids containing nicotine are not subject to excise in New Zealand and HnB consumables attract excise because of their tobacco content, at the same rate as cigars. This is despite the fact that HnB does not combust the tobacco and the user inhales an aerosol that is not smoke. As noted below, 21 countries have introduced a new category for HnB products, with an excise tax lower than that of cigarettes. Table 1: Taxation of HnB Products in Selected Countries 31 Bauld, L., McNeill, A., Hajek, P, et al (2017). E-cigarette use in public places: striking the right balance. Tobacco Control 2017;26:e5-e6. https://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/26/e1/e5.info. 32 Public Health England. (2015). Public Health England: E-cigarettes: an evidence update.

Source: Eric Fruits, Vapor products, harm reduction, and taxation. Principles, evidence, and a research agenda. International Centre for Law & Economics, October 2018. Israel, is the only country that has introduced a new category for heated tobacco products and applies the same excise rates as applicable to cigarettes. Tobacco for heating comes in a variety of formats. Depending on the brand and manufacturer, the tobacco may be contained in capsules, pod or units, in the form of granulated or reconstituted leaf with and without humectants to facilitate the creation of vapor when heated. Some devices heat the tobacco directly while others first heat a liquid to generate an aerosol which passes through the tobacco. The common characteristic is that there is no combustion of the tobacco and the products are not smoked. There is likely to be continued innovation in the heated tobacco category as the market develops. Figure 11: Excise and Excise-equivalent Duties on Tobacco Products Note: Extract from the Excise and Excise-equivalent Duties Table (Imported Goods) from 1 October 2018 Source: NZ Customs Given the wide variety of formats, it would be difficult to define a unit for the taxable base for all formats for the heated tobacco products. A more realistic approach, followed by the vast majority of countries where the product is launched, is to apply excise to the net weight of tobacco contained in any product offering. A kg of tobacco content irrespective of the format is a practical TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 28 tax base and consistent with current practice for other tobacco products. A fully specific excise is recognised by the IMF, World Bank and other global institutions as the best approach. There appear to be three broad options for determining an excise rate to apply to HnB consumables: 1. the same rate as applies to other tobacco products, $1,033.20 per kg of tobacco; 2. excise free, as currently applies to e-liquids; or 3. a rate that is in between Option 1 and Option 2, reflecting the likely reduction in risk from these products. Based on various reports about their estimated reduction in risk, this level could be reduced by 90 percent of the current level, to a level of $103.32 per kg of tobacco content. Adoption of either of the second or third option requires an excise category to separate HnB or heated tobacco products from other smoking tobacco categories. Even if option 1 is pursued, it is recommended to separately classify HnB products for monitoring and statistical analysis purposes. Dedicated excise categories for HnB products have been adopted in 21 of the 36 countries where HnB products are sold so far. TDB Advisory Ltd tdb.co.nz Incorporating Harm Reduction in Tobacco Taxation 29 6. Conclusions Increasing tobacco taxation has contributed to reducing smoking rates, but there is evidence that the effectiveness of increasing taxes in reducing smoking has slowed. In addition, there is evidence of unintended consequences from New Zealand’s very high rate of taxation in cigarettes, including reducing the disposable income of the lowest two income quintiles and increased criminal activity involving cigarettes. Overseas experience indicates that it is possible for smokers who cannot quit smoking to switch to using less harmful smoke-free products. Reducing the tax of HnB could encourage switching that could benefit public health and alleviate the tax burden on the poor, Māori, Pasifika and young adults who within the current framework continue to smoke.

Organised by Income Equality Aotearoa New Zealand Inc More equal societies work better for everyone Response to the Interim report of the Tax Working Group by Income Equality Aotearoa NZ Inc For information about Closing the Gap go to www.closingthegap.org.nz 1. We acknowledge the work that has gone into, and the thoroughness of the interim report. 2. We are pleased at the recognition of the importance of reducing income/wealth inequality in New Zealand because of the damage this does to our society but we believe that apart from possibly reducing tax on the low-paid, the interim report actually contains nothing else that would reduce inequality. We believe that the final report should set out clearly how a reduction in inequality would occur through the recommendations. 3. In the interests of a tax system that is comprehensive, both horizontally and vertically fair and just, and is capable of being easily modified in the light of changing work structures and availablility, we feel that the work of the TWG has been seriously constrained by the terms of reference. We would hope that comments about that will form part of the final report. The final report should encourage the Government to look at further changes such as capital gains tax on the family home—with rules and exceptions, a much more steeply progressive tax system which includes taxes on capital, a financial transaction tax, and a tax system that is closely integrated with the welfare system. 4. We believe that in the interests of fairness etc there is a clear need for tax system that basically taxes ALL income regardless of source and this again is constrained by the terms of reference. We would encourage the TWG to include this principle in the final report as an encouragement to Government to look at further changes such as inheritance taxes, much higher taxes on high incomes eg over $150000 per year, land taxes---the absence of these is a huge impediment to the supply of housing, taxes on land banking would make a difference to local authorities abilities to open up land for housing. 5. The current rate of GST is regressive in the sense that because of the percentage of income the poor spend on things compared with the wealthy. A reduction in the rate of GST would help matters considerably. We still believe that it is a better system with GST on everything but it should include financial transactions. 6. Overall tax take. We believe that the Minister’s insistence that the total tax take must be less than 30% of GDP is unreasonable. It is clear that the Government does not have enough income to properly fund the work that it needs to do. When our tax take is compared to the tax take of the Scandinavian countries with much lower inequality than us it is clear the path we must take. A clearly higher tax take. 7. It is pleasing that the TWG is taking a positive approach to ensuring that foreign-owned companies working in NZ are paying the appropriate levels of tax. An approach of taxing overall turnover would be a good start. 8. We are delighted to see that environmental taxes are being considered. 9. Lastly we would reiterate the importance of the TWG measuring up to its statements about reducing income/wealth inequality with clear statements as to how their suggested modifications to our tax system will indeed achieve the objective of reducing this inequality Many thanks for listening Peter Malcolm General Secretary of Income Equality Aotearoa NZ Inc “Closing the Gap” 31 st Oct 2108 1 From:Graham Robertson Sent: Thursday, 1 November 2018 1:45 PM To: Peter Malcolm Cc: TWG Submissions; Bryan Winters; Chris Lee; Colette & Brian MacKenzie; Fiona Proudlock; Gray Southon; Ian McLean; John Garwood; John Robson; Julian Fitter; Gary Ware; Peter Jensen; Ron Lopert; Ron Major; Sheelagh Leary; Jenny Ricks; Manu Caddie; Merrill Simmons-Hansen; Robertson, Neville; Nick Jennings; Nick Wright; Ron Cormack; Tracey Sharp Subject: Re: submission to the Interim Report Hi Peter A good response. I am not sure about a blanket support for a financial transaction tax. If you look in Wikipedia there are a myriad of forms this might take but they appear to be most popular (as an idea if not yet implemented) as a tax on the transfer of assets. We had such a tax once on land sales called stamp duty. I am sure if it meant here to apply to all transactions. Big difference between trading in shares or buying the groceries. Is it a feel good slogan that gets bandied around without folk knowing that it should be more specific? There will always be ways around inheritance taxes and the rich people with highly paid lawyers will place assets in trusts where beneficiaries can change but the trust ownership of assets does not. Needs a great deal of work to be done on it and it is possible someone has done so. Not sure what is meant by GST on financial transactions. Does this involve GST added to all transfers that are not otherwise a "taxable activity". Or that the business doing a transaction eg a conveyancing lawyer, have GST applied to their input. I would be surprised if that is not presently the case as they are providing a service (the S in GST) We should really go for the tax take not being limited to the current 32% of GDP. A recent comparison by the NY Times (having a look at policies that in the US are labelled "pure socialistic evil" eg Nordic countries) concluded that with taxes of 44% of GDP these countries delivered comparable benefits to their wealthy people as found by the wealthy in USA due to free health care and education. (Plus longer holidays) It goes without saying that the less well off were incomparably better than poor people in the US. There is no evidence that the 32% tax take is better economic policy for growth etc. In fact there are plenty of economists who disagree with this theory that apparently was developed in the Chicago School of Economics. Therefore I support all that you have said on that subject and particularly inviting the TWG to tell the government of the fallacy of sticking to this 32% target.

Kind regards, Kyla Bottriell External Affairs Manager Philip Morris (New Zealand) Ltd \[1\] \[1\] 1 PHILIP MORRIS (NEW ZEALAND) LIMITED FISCAL POLICY CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ACHIEVE SMOKEFREE AOTEAROA 2025 Summary Philip Morris International (PMI) is a leading tobacco company engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and smoke-free products. We are building our future on smoke-free products that are a much better consumer choice than continuing to smoke cigarettes. Our vision is to replace cigarettes as soon as possible, to the benefit of adults who would otherwise continue to smoke. Since 2008, we have invested more than USD 4.5 billion (NZD 6.8 billion) to achieve this business transformation, in areas such as fundamental research, product and commercial development and production capacity. 1 Philip Morris (New Zealand) Limited (PMNZ) is the New Zealand subsidiary of PMI. PMNZ welcomes the Government’s initiative to improve the fairness, balance, and structure of the tax system and we thank the Tax Working Group for the opportunity to contribute to the national conversation on the future of the tax system and how it underpins the living standards of New Zealanders. We particularly welcome the Group’s interim report and its findings on corrective taxation. 2 As the interim report notes, corrective taxes are primarily intended to change consumer behaviour. Given the serious health risks linked to smoking, and the associated externalities, we support the Government using the tax system to discourage it. However, the interim report also acknowledges that high tobacco taxes have led to some unwelcome and unintended consequences, including a disproportionate impact on the poorest in society, 3 and increasing criminal activity, 4 while their effectiveness appears to be reducing. 5 The above situation creates a dilemma for policy makers who have to weigh the positive aspects of increased tobacco taxation in reducing consumption against the economic welfare effects on those who continue to smoke. However, technological innovation over the last decade, and the launch of smoke-free products, present an opportunity and a solution to address this dilemma for adult smokers who would otherwise continue to smoke. Smoke-free products have significant potential to reduce smoking rates and the harms caused by smoking, and are essential to achieve the Government’s goal of a smoke-free New Zealand by 2025. Fiscal policies can play an important role in supporting a smoke-free transition through changing consumer and producer behaviour. We suggest that the Tax Working Group recommends changes to the tax system to encourage such an approach, helping to ensure that smoke-free products are affordable for all adult smokers who have not quit smoking, and direct industry to focus its research and innovation towards less harmful alternatives. PMNZ engaged TDB Advisory to analyse the current tobacco tax policy and provide independent advice on how New Zealand’s tax system can be updated to include smoke-free products, consistent with the government’s evolving policy on tobacco harm reduction. 1 PMI’s Latest Clinical Results: Findings Add to Extensive Evidence Package on Risk Reduction, 15 June 2018, available at: https://www.pmi.com/investor- relations/press-releases-and-events/press-releases-overview/press-release-details/?newsId=2354720 2 Future of Tax Interim Report, 20 September 2018, available at: https //taxworkinggroup govt.nz/sites/default/files/2018-09/twg-interim-report-sep18 pdf 3 Chapter 10, para 13. 4 Chapter 10, para 13. 5 Chapter 10, para 13. New Zealand also lags countries such as the UK where smoking rates are falling faster and tax increases are smaller. In the UK, the smoking rate decreased from 20.4% in 2010 to 16.1% in 2016, whereas over the same period, in New Zealand, the rate decreased from 16.7% to 15.5%. New Zealand data based on Health Promotion Agency data, available at: https //www.tcdata.org.nz/HLS%20data/HLS\_05.aspx, UK data based on Office for National Statistics, available at: https://www ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/drugusealcoholandsmoking/datasets/adultsmokinghabitsingreatbritain 2 Current fiscal policy can be improved to deliver a Smokefree 2025 In 2011, in response to the recommendations of a Parliamentary inquiry by the Māori Affairs Select Committee, New Zealand adopted the Smokefree 2025 goal to reduce smoking incidence from 15% to less than 5% of the population by 2025. 6 PMNZ supports this objective, but notes that progress towards this goal has slowed, at least for certain sectors of the smoking population, and that ASH New Zealand have said New Zealand “is not on track to meet the Smokefree 2025 goal set by the Government in 2011”. 7 Today, 13.8% 8 of the population continues to smoke, but smoking is significantly more prevalent among certain population groups. Smoking rates amongst Māori are over twice the national average at 32.5 %. 9 Adults living in the most socioeconomically deprived areas were 3.8 times more likely to be daily smokers than adults living in the least deprived areas, after adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity. 10 Therefore, the heaviest burden of the excise increases have been borne by those who can least afford it and many have continued smoking despite measures to encourage quitting. The Government currently collects approximately NZD 1.8 billion annually from smokers in tobacco tax. 11 Yet despite having one of the highest excise levels on cigarettes within the OECD, and among the most stringent tobacco control regulations in the world, smoking incidence in New Zealand has declined at a slow rate in recent years, as recognised by the Treasury: “The effectiveness of excise increases appears to be reducing. Regulatory impact analysis prepared by the Treasury in 2016 indicates that reductions in smoking prevalence are expected to be quite small relative to the size of the increases in the excise rates (Treasury 2016).” 12 (Page 77) As many New Zealanders continue to smoke, the Smokefree 2025 goal seems increasingly likely to be missed. While the interim report identified concerns linked to the current tax policy for smoking products, it seems appropriate that the Tax Working Group also considers adjustments to fiscal policy to help reduce smoking in New Zealand much faster, as well as mitigating the unintended consequences of the current tax policy. Science and innovation can accelerate the decline in smoking rates Many experts agree that nicotine, while addictive, is not the primary cause of smoking-related diseases. 13 Instead, it is the toxic compounds that are found in tobacco smoke – most of which are formed when tobacco combusts. Thus, smoke-free products that deliver nicotine without combustion have the potential to reduce individual risk compared to continued smoking. Decades of scientific research show that eliminating combustion from tobacco can eliminate or significantly reduce the toxicants from tobacco use.

For smokers and their families, smoke-free products represent a much better choice than cigarettes or smoking tobacco. For policy makers, these products represent a new opportunity to help achieve public health objectives and effectively eliminate smoking. Encouraging smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke, to switch to smoke-free alternatives, may well be the most effective additional measure the Government can take to accelerate reductions in smoking incidence and reduce the harm caused by smoking. Fiscal policy can play an important role in supporting that transition, as well as its traditional role in encouraging smoking cessation, and reducing initiation. Philip Morris International – A Smoke-Free solution The most popular category of smoke-free products in New Zealand is e-cigarettes. E- cigarettes have become increasingly popular in recent years as an alternative product for smokers, aided by an increasingly supportive international evidence base that they are less harmful than smoking cigarettes. 14 We estimate that there are approximately 71,000 regular e-cigarette users in New Zealand. 15 At PMI, we believe that a portfolio of different smoke-free products is essential to achieve a reduction in harm otherwise caused by continued smoking. That is why we are commercializing heated tobacco products as well as e-cigarettes. Our first smoke-free product available in New Zealand is a heated tobacco product comprising of an electric heating device “IQOS”, used with a specifically designed tobacco product “HEETS”. IQOS heats rather than burns tobacco and generates a nicotine containing vapour that yields on average less than 10% of the levels of harmful constituents found in cigarette smoke. 16 This heated tobacco product is available in over 40 countries and, to date, almost six million adult smokers worldwide have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. While e-cigarettes offer an important alternative, evidence shows that smokers require a portfolio of alternatives to maximize switching. In the UK, a survey from Action on Smoking and Health (UK ASH), estimated that 63% of e-cigarette users returned to smoking. 17 The IQOS tobacco heating system has a very high rate of switching – in other words, approximately 70%-90% of people who buy IQOS use it exclusively or predominantly. 18 This indicates that heated tobacco products are more accepted as a smoke-free product alternative to many smokers. As no single category of smoke-free product will appeal to all smokers, a range of alternatives that smokers find appealing will be necessary to switch New Zealand’s remaining smokers in the shortest possible timeframe. Several government reports, including from the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as over 20 independent publications confirm that IQOS vapour drastically reduces levels of harmful chemicals compared to cigarette smoke. 19 14 See for example, Evidence Review of e-cigarettes and heated tobacco 2018, commissioned by Public Health England, available at: https://assets.publishing.service gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment data/file/684963/Evidence review of e- cigarettes and heated tobacco products 2018.pdf 15 Kaiser Associates, January 2016, Understanding the Competitive Landscape for E-cigarettes in New Zealand 16 Average of the reductions in the concentrations (weight per stick) of individual harmful and potentially harmful constituents measured in the IQOS™ aerosol compared to the smoke from a standard 9.4 mg ‘tar’ reference cigarette (3R4F). Aerosol and smoke collections performed under the Health Canada Intense machine-smoking regime (55 mL puff volume, 2 second puff duration, 30 second interval puff). Reduction calculations exclude nicotine, glycerine and water. 17 See Figure 2, Use of e-cigarettes (vapourisers) among adults in Great Britain, September 2018, published by ASH UK, available at http://ash org.uk/media-and-news/press-releases-media-and-news/ash-news-release-new-data-shows-smokers-are-getting-the-message-on-e-cigarettes/ 18 Exclusive and predominant use is defined as equal to or more than 70% of an individual’s tobacco use is with the IQOS heating device and tobacco heat sticks. 19 For a full list of independent scientific studies and reports on IQOS see Philip Morris International’s Scientific Update, Issue 05, June 2018, available at: https://www pmiscience.com/resources/docs/default-source/Scientific-Updates/pmi\_scientific\_update\_issue\_ 57684a8852f88696a9e88ff050043f5e9.pdf 4 “Compared with cigarettes, heated tobacco products are likely to expose users and bystanders to lower levels of particulate matter and harmful and potentially harmful compounds.” 20 “...our data confirm absolute values for selected toxicants in the emissions of the analysed HNB that are in agreement with data published by the manufacturer." 21 This independent research from around the world helps demonstrate that HEETS, alongside e-cigarettes, and other smoke-free products have the potential to play a pivotal role in changing the lives of millions of smokers and make a positive impact on public health. Advancing New Zealand’s tobacco excise system to support Smokefree 2025 New Zealand does not apply any excise tax to e-cigarettes. Although e-cigarettes are not risk- free, experts agree that they are a much safer option than smoking. Refraining from corrective taxation makes them more affordable, encourages smokers to switch and drives the industry to invest and innovate in this category. We therefore support the current approach. The current tobacco excise system does not distinguish smoke-free tobacco from smoking tobacco products, as it applies the same rate of taxation to smoke-free heated tobacco as smoking tobacco products, with all categories subject to ‘CPI plus 10%’ annual tax increases. Consistent with the purpose of taxation – to change behaviour and ensure individuals take into account the costs of their behaviour 22 – we believe that the level of tobacco taxation should be consistent with a products’ risk profile, and that smoke-free products such as heated tobacco should be distinguished from the most harmful products i.e., smoking tobacco. Creating a separate excise duty category for heated tobacco We recommend that a new and separate excise category is created for heated tobacco products to ensure New Zealand’s tobacco system reflects and effectively captures this new category. Excise treatment based on the presence or absence of combustion is consistent with international practice and should be a fundamental component of New Zealand’s future approach to tobacco taxation. Currently, from an excise tax classification standpoint, heated tobacco products are captured in a ‘catch-all’ category based on customs tariff code under HS 2403.99.90 23 . This classification is defined as “Other Manufactured Tobacco” “Other” “Other” and is not defined to clearly accommodate a new growing category of heated tobacco products. A separate excise category for “tobacco products intended for inhalation without combustion” is necessary to properly classify these products and efficiently apply a much lower excise level than smoking tobacco products to encourage consumer switching away from cigarettes. So far, over 20 countries around the world recognize the fundamental distinction between smoking and smoke-free tobacco products. For example, the United Kingdom is in the process of updating its tobacco excise system with the aim to “help maintain the integrity of the duty system going forward.” Draft provisions were published in 2018, which explain that: 20 McNeill, A. et al.

Prominent economists focusing on tobacco control and taxation introduced the concept of differential taxation as a tool to maximize incentives for smokers to switch to less harmful products, and also to encourage manufacturers to develop less harmful alternatives. As some of the leading scholars in tobacco control have stated in the New England Journal of Medicine: “Policymakers should consider an approach that differentially taxes nicotine products in order to maximize incentives for tobacco users to switch from the most harmful products to the least harmful ones.” 25 While such a fiscal approach is relatively new to the tobacco sector, it has been successfully applied to other industries. Differential taxation has been used successfully in areas such as mobility (electric motor vehicles) and energy (carbon taxes, leaded and unleaded petrol), as a means to encourage consumers to change behaviour. Summary of recommendations In designing the future of tobacco tax in New Zealand, it is important that the overall system supports public health objectives and operates in a fair and coherent manner. A dedicated excise category for heated tobacco products, with a much lower tax rate than smoking tobacco, would help achieve the realisation of New Zealand’s Smokefree 2025 goal. We therefore recommend: 1. Create a new heated tobacco product excise tax category and definition. 2. Establish a tax rate for heated tobacco products significantly below the tax rate for all smoking tobacco products. 24 HM Treasury, Tax Treatment of Heated Tobacco Products, March 2018, available at: https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/tax-treatment-of- heated-tobacco-products/tax-treatment-of-heated-tobacco-products 25 Frank J.

Treasury:4059219v1 RISK FREE RETURN METHOD For: Tax Working Group From: Robert McLeod Date: 14 December 2018 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ I have been asked to set out an explanation of the risk-free return method (RFRM) for taxing returns to risk from certain asset classes, as considered by the 2001 Tax Review (the McLeod Review). Risk Free Return Method 1. The return on a financial asset for a period is calculated as (a) the sum of the peri od c hange in its market value plus the period cash flow divided by (b) the opening market value of the asset. 2. Returns can either be expected (ex ante or future) returns or actual (ex post or historical) returns. 3. The expected return on an asset can be divided between (a) the riskless rate and (b) a risk premium. 4. The riskless rate of return is the return on an asset that promises the same sure return in every eventuality. 5. Riskless rates of return are often approximated by those paid by the government on i ts borrowing. Other borrowers have to promise a premium over the government rate in order to entice lenders away from lending to the government. 6. Investors have differing personal risk appetites and valuations. The market risk premium is set by the marginal investor and issuer where there is alignment between personal and market values. 7. Using the example of a fair toss, assume a person is offered a bet that for heads h e g ets $1m but for tails he pays $1m. The expected value of the toss is nil. If the bet is taxed at 50% it becomes a $500k bet with an expected value of nil. The tax has n o e ffect on the taxpayer. The expected value is the same as the personal value of a risk neutral person. Because the dominant risk profile of investors is risk averse, most people are not indifferent between taking this bet and not betting. A risk averse person would have to be paid a risk premium to accept the bet (meaning it woul d ot herwise have a negative value to that person). The bet might have to be altered to say, heads you get $1.1m and tails you pay $1m. The expected value of this bet is $50k, but the market price of the bet will be 0. 8. If an investor can invest $100 in the government for say a return of 3%, a non- government issuer may have to promise a risk premium of say 2% (total 5%) t o at tract that same $100. Given that both securities have a market value of $100 and the only two things differentiating them are (a) the differences in risk and (b) the premium to compensate for that difference in risk, it follows that the market value of those two things is nil (100-100). 9. To further develop this example, assume the following: a. a flat tax rate on all taxpayers of 50% ; Treasury:4059219v1 b. a taxpayer holds two bonds. First, a government bond with a market value of $9,000 bearing a coupon of 3%. Secondly, a corporate bond with a marke t v alue of $1,000 bearing a coupon of 5%; c. the taxpayer has funded both bonds by way of equity of $10,000; d. the tax system currently does not tax returns to risk. 10. The taxpayer’s expected return and tax calculations are as follows: 11. The taxpayer’s expected return on the corporate bond is 5%, 2 percentage points of which is compensation for the added risk over and above the government b ond ( which is the risk premium or return to risk). The remaining 3% expected return is the safe return to non-risk taking (sometime referred to as the return to riskless time). From an efficiency point of view, we can show that the government is economically indifferent to taxing the return to risk of 2% (being $20 of the taxpayer’s expect ed in come). 12. Assume the government changes the tax system to impose a tax on risk. The calculation most people make assumes that the taxpayer doesn’t change its bond portfolio, in which case, expected pre-tax income will be $320 and expected post tax income will be $160 (320\*0.5), viz: 13. However, by the government taxing the risky return it actual ly decreases the r iskiness of the taxpayer’s risky bond because the government now also shares i n t he downside risks of the risky return to the extent of the tax rate. If the taxpayer prefers its original riskier/return position it can achieve that by grossing up its risky assets by a factor of 2 (1/(1-0.5)) from $1,000 to $2,000 and selling $1,000 of corporate bonds, giving an expected pre-tax return of $340 and an expected post-tax return of $170, viz: Bonds Principal Return % Pre-tax Tax rate Tax Post-tax 0.03 30 0.5 15 15 0.02 2020 Corporate1000 0.05 5015 35 Government9000 0.03 270 0.5 135 135 10000320150 170 Bonds Principal Return % Pre-tax Tax rate Tax Post-tax 0.03 30 0.5 15 15 0.02 20 0.5 10 10 Corporate1000 0.05 5025 25 Government9000 0.03 270 0.5 135 135 10000320160 160 Bonds Principal Return % Pre-tax Tax rate Tax Post-tax 0.03 60 0.5 30 30 0.02 40 0.5 20 20 Corporate2000 0.05 10050 50 Government8000 0.03 240 0.5 120 120 10000340170 170 Treasury:4059219v1 14. The risk/return portfolio in para 13 in a system of fully taxing returns to risk reinstates the taxpayer’s precise risk/return position depicted in para 10 in a system of tax exempting returns to risk. 15. The government has higher tax revenue of $20 under para 13 than para 10 but as stated at para 10, it also has increased its own risk as part of the change. The market value of the increased tax and the increased risk zeroes out to a nil market value. 16. Like the taxpayer, the government can also restore its original position by portfolio adjustment. It can also achieve exposure to the risky return by direct investment in risky assets funded by an issuance of government stock rather than by complicating the income tax system. 17. The above points can be further explained by reference to the above examples. The safe bonds have an expected return of 3% and a market value of $1,000. The risky bonds have to offer an additional expected return of 2% (total 5%) in order to compensate an investor for the added risk of not acquiring the government bond. The difference in the expected returns of the two bonds is the risk premium of 2% whereas the difference in their market values is nil, meaning that the market value of the risk premium is also nil. The risk premium is the source of the governments’ additional expected tax revenue. Others are making this same point when they refer to a capital gains tax increasing the volatility and riskiness of the government taxes. 18. The standard economic definition of income is Haig Simons. From an efficiency viewpoint, taxing that definition of income is the same as taxing the risk-free return on the market value of assets irrespective of actual returns, given that the only difference between them is tax on the risk premium which has zero market value. The Haig Simon system raises greater expected revenue since it taxes the risky component of returns whose expected value is positive (although this difference in expected tax revenue disappears once the economy engages in portfolio adjustment). 19. When considering the implications of the above analysis for a realised capital gains tax in New Zealand, the point is that to the extent that exempt capital gains are a return to risk, there is no efficiency benefit in taxing them. Furthermore, to the extent there is full portfolio adjustment in the economy, there will also be no revenue from taxing them. 20. In practice there will be various assets where full taxation is desirable, namely where the return to the asset is dominated by imputed returns, like an owner-occupied home, or where the asset return is dominated by an expected capital gain, such as a gold bar. 21. To illustrate the above point, take an asset such as rented residential property. It is not unusual for the rent income to be less that the riskless rate of return because the market price of the property impounds an expected capital gain. To illustrate, assume that the certain cash coupon on the land is 2%, the riskless rate of return is 3% and the expected rate of return is 8%. From this we can calculate that the risk premium is 5%. The current income tax system would tax only 2%, which is 1% less than the riskless rate of return. Obviously either an ex ante or Haig Simon’s taxation would get us closer to efficient taxation. Treasury:4059219v1 22. The McLeod Review tried to identify specific assets that were systematically undertaxed and to address those with specific measures such as the RFRM. It identified equity in rental and owner-occupied houses as material examples. Having done that, the final question was whether a comprehensive capital gains tax was warranted. The practical capital gains tax option for countries is a realised capital gains tax with its concurrent lock-in and avoidance effects. By the time we reach this residual realm of untaxed capital gains (having regard to the many targeted measures introduced over the years), we are deep in risk premia country. Our question for the McLeod Review, which to my mind will be the same for the 2018 Tax Working Group, is whether trying to tax these remaining capital gains with a comprehensive capital gains tax would pass a marginal cost benefit test. Questions and Answers During the McLeod Review we worked through some anticipated Questions and Answers and these are repeated below: 1. We tax risk premia elsewhere so why not here? We are indifferent to taxing risk premia from an efficiency viewpoint. Taxing it is neither good nor bad per se, but if you get no benefit from taxing it in under an idealised capital gains tax, why would you be keen to incur the economic costs of a realised capital gains tax? If there is flexible portfolio adjustment in the economy there would also be no revenue collected from taxing risk premia. 2. What about economic rents that we currently do not tax? It would be important to know precisely what these are and if they are not taxed whether they should be, according to standard criteria, and if so whether a “rifle shot” mechanism (such as RFRM) is more appropriate than a comprehensive realised capital gains tax “shotgun”. An RFRM based on market value would impose tax on rents because rents would be capitalised into the asset’s market price upon which the RFRM would be calculated. 3. Why do we see realised capital gains taxes in other countries but not in NZ and why didn’t risk premia analysis prevent the spread of capital gains taxes? Haig Simons is the major tax economic benchmark, which has been around for many years. Capital gains tax systems have also been around for many years. Tax economic analysis of RFRM and risk premia have not been part of the standard tax tools of tax policy for as long. Although not widely applied in tax policy, the relevant framework is well settled in the field of corporate finance and the CAPM. 4. Are there not systematic returns on assets that are not currently taxed in NZ? Yes there are. However, their presence does not necessarily justify a comprehensive realised capital gains tax but may justify a specific measure depending on the asset and context. 5. What if a realised capital gains tax generates significant tax revenue? Research would be required to determine what that tax base was picking up. Specific targeted measures may be still be superior. If that tax revenue is purely the expected value of risk premia, then the observation is irrelevant to tax policy because the government can access that revenue in ways that do not require it to incur the economic costs of a realised capital gains tax. This latter argument is reinforced by the adjustments that would be made by the public and private sectors to reinstate their pre-tax change portfolios.

The tax system matters to everybody Few areas of public policy contribute as much to the welfare of New Zealanders as taxation. Taxes allow the Government to fund the vital public services – such as healthcare, education, justice, expenditure on healthy ecosystems, and defence – that underpin our living standards. The calculation and payment of tax also imposes obligations on New Zealanders and the tax system affects different groups of people in different ways. As a consequence, tax is not just for ‘experts’ – all New Zealanders have a stake in the design of our tax system. About the Tax Working Group The Government has established the Tax Working Group (the Group) to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group has also been directed to apply a particular focus on the future to its work, with a view to exploring the major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond. 4Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper We want to hear your views This paper calls for public submissions on a range of issues that the Group considers important to its work. Public submissions will inform the Group’s consideration of proposals for improving the tax system. The Group will provide an interim report on these proposals to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in September 2018. There will be further opportunities for public comment following the publication of that interim report. In the spirit of openness and inclusion, the Group would now like to encourage all New Zealanders to share their own views about what is working – and what is not – in the current tax system. Challenges, risks, and opportunities Tax systems have always had to evolve alongside changing practices in business, technology, and society. However, technology today – particularly in the area of digital communications – is having a radical impact on the way businesses operate, both within and across national borders. Within this context, the Group has identified eight broad challenges, risks, and opportunities that will affect the tax system over the coming decade and beyond: • changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring; • te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards; • the changing nature of work; • technological change and the different business models that will bring; • falling company tax rates around the world; • environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species; • growing concern about inequality; and • the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. Our tax system will need to be sufficiently robust to deal with these challenges, and sufficiently nimble to take advantage of the opportunities. There will also be other shocks and surprises that we have not considered and cannot foresee. The Group would therefore like to hear your views on how these challenges and opportunities might affect the tax system, and, equally importantly, whether you consider there are any other key issues that policymakers will need to prepare for. The purposes and principles of a good tax system Even as the tax system evolves in response to these risks and opportunities, it will still need to fulfil the central purpose of tax policy: to provide sufficient revenue to the Government to fund the provision of public goods, services, and transfers. But the design of the tax system will also have broader impacts on the wellbeing of New Zealanders across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The Group intends to be mindful of these impacts as it develops recommendations for reform. In recognition of the broad basis of wellbeing, the Treasury uses the Living Standards Framework to incorporate a more comprehensive range of factors into its analysis. The Living Standards Framework identifies four ‘capital stocks’ that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing: • Financial and physical capital, such as roads, factories, and financial assets. • Human capital, such as skills and knowledge. • Social capital, such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections. • Natural capital, such as soil and water. The Living Standards Framework encourages us to consider how policy change is likely to impact each of the four capitals, and broadens our assessment beyond strictly economic considerations. 5Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper The established criteria that have been used in past tax reviews (both domestically and overseas) are also useful when considering the costs and benefits of various reforms: • Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions (biases) to the use of resources. • Equity and fairness: achieve fairness including through ‘horizontal equity’ (the same treatment for people in the same circumstances) and ‘vertical equity’ (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay). Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system. • Revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. • Fiscal adequacy: raise sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements. • Compliance and administration costs: minimise the costs of compliance and administration, and give taxpayers as much certainty as possible. • Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system. As you read this paper, the Group would encourage you to consider which principles and frameworks are most important to you in evaluating the tax system, and to test your own ideas and proposals against them. The design of the current tax system New Zealand currently has a ‘broad-based, low-rate’ tax system. The Government raises about 90% of its tax revenue from three tax bases: 1 • Individual income tax • Goods and services tax (GST) • Company income tax. There are very few exemptions to these three taxes (which is why our tax system is described as ‘broad-based’). The benefit of having a broad base is that it allows the Government to raise substantial 1 This figure excludes local government rates, which are sometimes included in measures of total tax revenue for ease of comparison with other OECD countries. revenue with relatively low rates of taxation. Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP. New Zealand’s tax system is distinct in other ways. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not generally use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour – with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes, which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking. New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings is also distinct. The tax system does not offer large concessions for retirement savings; retirement savings contributions are taxed when they are made and as investment income is earned, rather than when the savings are drawn down in retirement. The Group’s work provides an opportunity to examine whether a broad-based, low rate system remains fit-for-purpose, and whether there is a case to depart from the internationally distinctive approaches to behavioural taxes and retirement savings. It is also an opportunity to explore whether there is a case to broaden the base further, for example with new taxes such as a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home). The results of the current tax system Revenue outcomes New Zealand’s broad-based, low-rate system succeeds at raising relatively high amounts of revenue with relatively low rates. Compared with other OECD countries: • New Zealand has one of the lowest top personal tax rates, but the proportion of income tax to GDP is high. • New Zealand’s company tax rate is relatively high, and the proportion of company tax revenue to GDP is high. • New Zealand’s GST rate is relatively low, but the proportion of GST revenue to GDP is high. 6Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper New Zealand’s GST is one of the simplest and most comprehensive in the world. There are two main exemptions – for financial services, and for low- value imported goods. 2 These exemptions reflect past judgements that it would be too administratively complex to include financial services and low-value imported goods in the tax. Distributional outcomes Higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. According to established income measures, the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest incomes) pay around 35% of all income tax, whereas households in the lowest five income deciles (that is, 50% of households) collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax. The tax and transfer system (transfers are payments like Jobseeker Support and New Zealand Superannuation) reduces income inequality, although by less than most of our comparator countries. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to the Canadian system, but a smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average. Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income. Savings There is some debate about the influence of our tax settings on the rate and composition of saving in New Zealand. In a broad-based, low-rate tax system, there should ideally be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between different types of investments. Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform, but it may be possible to achieve more consistency in the treatment of different types of investments. 2 Long-term residential accommodation is also not subject to GST, but applying GST to rent would raise various practical and fairness issues. Overall outcomes The Group is keen to hear public views on the overall performance of the tax system, and has a particular interest in assessments of the fairness and balance of our tax settings. Thinking outside the current system New Zealand has reduced its use of other tax bases under the broad-based, low-rate tax system. Previous reforms have eliminated the sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty and cheque duty. New Zealand also does not levy financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes, or a general capital gains tax. The Group will examine whether there is a case to introduce any additional taxes, particularly in light of growing international debate about income and wealth inequality. The Group also acknowledges public concerns about the tax practices of some multinational corporations, which exploit inconsistencies and mismatches in domestic tax rules in order pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. In this regard, New Zealand is currently implementing a suite of measures – developed in cooperation with other OECD countries – that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment in New Zealand. But we also need to consider the taxation of income from the digital economy. Internet-based firms can trade with customers over the internet without having a physical presence in the customer’s country that is necessary for income tax to be charged under present rules. This issue is becoming increasingly important as the digital economy accounts for a greater proportion of business activity. The Group invites comment on what the public sees as the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system, and which of these should be addressed most urgently. 7Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Specific challenges In addition to the issues discussed above, the Government has directed the Group to advise on a number of specific challenges: • How would a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) or a land tax (excluding the land under the family home) affect housing affordability, and would these taxes improve the current system for capital income taxation? Relevant considerations will include: the impacts of these taxes on property-owners and renters; the ease of administering these taxes; the interaction of these taxes with the rest of the tax system; the extent to which the tax will incentivise productive investment as opposed to speculation; and the possibility of allowing for reductions in other taxes as a result of introducing them. • Is there a case to introduce a progressive company tax (i.e. lower company tax rates for smaller businesses) in order to support small business? • Is there a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base? • Could the Government assist low-income people by introducing GST exemptions for certain goods and services? The Group seeks public views on all of these matters. It also invites submissions on the question of which taxes should be lowered if new sources of tax revenue can be found (keeping in mind the guidance in the Terms of Reference for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP). Concluding thoughts New Zealand’s tax system has many strengths, but it cannot stand still. We are living in an era of rapid technological change, rising economic uncertainty, and mounting environmental challenges. Our tax system must be robust to these challenges, even as it takes advantage of the administrative and other opportunities afforded by innovation. However, it is important that we maintain the trust and confidence of all New Zealanders in the integrity of the tax system. In a democracy such as ours, the ability of the Government to raise revenue rests ultimately on the consent and acceptance of all New Zealanders. In order to maintain this acceptance, and fulfil the trust of New Zealanders, we must ensure that the tax system is fair, balanced, and administered well. This is the goal the Group is working towards. Your submissions will help us achieve it. 8Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper The Tax Working Group (the Group) has been established by the Government in order to examine improvements in the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. This paper is a call for public submissions on a range of issues that the Group thinks are important for the purpose of carrying out its work. Specific questions that we are particularly interested in your views on are contained throughout the paper at the beginning of each chapter. Submitters may submit on other issues, but should be aware of the exclusions in the Terms of Reference. The Terms of Reference are attached as an appendix to this paper. To help submitters, this paper also provides information and context on New Zealand’s current tax system and tax concepts. Terms that are italicised are explained in more detail in the glossary. Process The Group is chaired by Hon Sir Michael Cullen and is supported by a secretariat of officials from the Treasury and Inland Revenue. The Chair has appointed an independent advisor to assist the Group with its deliberations and understanding of the issues. The Group held its first meeting in January 2018 and will continue to meet regularly until February 2019, when the Group’s final report to the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Revenue will likely be issued. The indicative timeline for the Group’s work also includes an interim report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue in September 2018. There will be a further opportunity for public submissions on the Group’s proposals contained in the interim report following its publication. Submissions The Group seeks submissions on the issues set out in this paper. In particular, the Group is interested in solutions to problems that the Group, or submitters, have identified. Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for the Group and the secretariat to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. Submissions should be made by 30 April 2018 and can be emailed to submissions@taxworkinggroup. govt.nz or submitted online at https://taxworkinggroup. govt.nz Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to: Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Submissions will be proactively released and only redacted or withheld on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or any other reason under the Official Information Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. In addition to seeking written submissions, the Group intends to discuss the issues raised in this paper with key interested parties. 1 Introduction 9Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper 2 • What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? • How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? • How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future- focussed tax system? Predicting the future is inherently difficult. We want to make sure we are taking into account the most important changes and, with that in mind, we describe some below. We also want your ideas and welcome submissions on challenges and opportunities that we have missed. Future challenges and opportunities that we believe could affect New Zealand include: • changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring; • te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards; • the changing nature of work; • technological change and the different business models that will bring; • falling company tax rates around the world; • environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species; • growing concern about inequality; and • the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. Along with challenges there will be opportunities. Technology will undoubtedly provide new and low-cost ways of collecting tax information and tax revenue and monitoring compliance. Initiatives in the tax system could assist in achieving other, broader outcomes, such as improving fairness or responding to environmental concerns. The future environment 10Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Changing demographics – the aging population and fiscal pressures Like much of the developed world, New Zealand has an aging population. In He Tirohanga Mokopuna – the latest statement on New Zealand’s long-term fiscal position – the Treasury describes the fiscal consequences of an aging population as: 3 • slower revenue growth from lower labour force participation, and • increased expenses, largely due to higher spending on healthcare and New Zealand Superannuation. It is also important to note other demographic changes. The ratio of people aged 65 and over as a proportion of people aged 15-64 is projected to more than double, from 23 percent in 2016 to 50 percent in 2068. 4 At the same time, projections suggest that Māori, Pacific and Asian populations will continue to have a much younger age structure than the total New Zealand population. These groups are not only younger; they are growing faster than the overall New Zealand population, and will play an increasingly important role in our economic future. However, if the educational, employment and income outcomes of Māori and Pacific groups remain behind the total population, this transition carries risk. The Government’s fiscal objective for the tax system is to support a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). If the Government is to continue providing healthcare and superannuation at current levels, then the level of taxation will need to increase, or spending on other transfers or publicly provided goods and services will need to fall. 3 New Zealand Treasury, He Tirohanga Mokopuna: 2016 Statement on the Long-Term Fiscal Position.

The primary balance is revenue excluding investment revenue less primary expenses. These projections represent a “what if” scenario. Note that the primary balance may not sum to components owing to rounding. Source: New Zealand Treasury, He Tirohanga Mokopuna: 2016 Statement on the Long-Term Fiscal Position, p.60. Table 1 illustrates the timing and magnitude of the issue.

The same occurs when governments operate continuously in deficit; today’s deficits need to be funded by tomorrow’s taxes. The current tax system will face changes of its own due to the aging population, even if spending requirements do not increase. The tax mix will change. Taxes on capital income (for example, interest on term deposits, dividends, etc.) and consumption (for example, goods and services tax (GST)) may become relatively more important and taxes on labour income relatively less important as a source of future revenue, if the proportion of those earning capital income relative to labour income increases. Over time it is likely that a focus on capital income taxation will be increasingly important in ensuring that the tax system is as fair and efficient as possible. The flexibility of the tax system is important for the future. At the same time certainty – the ability to signpost the desired direction of tax policy and avoid unexpected policy shocks – is also important. 11Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Te ao Māori and the future Māori economic development will be a key driver of improved living standards in Aotearoa New Zealand Māori – as employees, owners, governors, managers or kaumātua – are the cornerstone of Māori economic development. Māori economic development can be characterised in two parts: ‘the Māori economy’ and ‘Māori in the economy’. ‘Māori in the economy’ refers to people identifying as Māori participating in the economy. This happens in many ways (for example, as taxpayers, business owners, entrepreneurs and consumers). The ‘Māori economy’ refers to a spectrum of business activities – from small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) directly lifting the living standards of individuals and whānau, to purpose-driven collective businesses and asset holding companies reinvesting in hapū and iwi. The Māori economy also includes capital stock that is specifically identified as Māori (e.g. Māori freehold land, Iwi assets and Māori businesses). The Māori economy is growing and there is potential for further growth. Between 2010 and 2017, the Māori asset base grew from an estimated $36.9 billion to approximately $50 billion. 6,7 Māori also have a thriving entrepreneurial base. With approximately 8,500 Māori- owned SMEs and a further 21,000 Māori classified as self-employed, Māori SMEs will continue to add to a growing asset base. 8 6 KPMG, He Kai Kei Aku Ringa: Māori Economy Investor Guide (Wellington: Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment, 2017). <http://www.mbie.govt.nz/info-services/infrastructure-growth/maori-economic-development> \[accessed 1 March 2018\]. 7 To understand the composition of the Māori asset base, refer to BERL’s 2010 estimate: Dr Ganesh Nana, Fiona Stoke and Wilma Molano, ‘The Asset Base, Income, Expenditure and GDP of the 2010 Māori Economy’, BERL (2011) <http://berl.co.nz/assets/Economic-Insights/Economic-Development/Maori-Economy/BERL-2011-The-Asset-Base-Income- Expenditure-and-GDP-of-the-2010-Mori-Economy.pdf> \[accessed 1 March 2018\]. 8 KPMG, He Kai Kei Aku Ringa: Māori Economy Investor Guide. 9 Statistics New Zealand, ‘Māori unemployment rate at nine-year low, but twice New Zealand rate’, Statistics New Zealand (2018) <https://stats.govt.nz/news/maori-unemployment-rate-at-nine-year-low-but-twice-new-zealand-rate> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 10 Benefit Fact Sheets for the quarter to 31 December 2017, Ministry of Social Development (2017) <http://www.msd.govt.nz/ about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/benefit/index.html> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 11 Note that 95% of people on the Social Housing Register already receive some form of housing support such as accommodation supplement from the Government. See: Housing Quarterly Report, Ministry of Social Development (2017) <https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/statistics/housing/housing-quarterly-report.html> \[accessed 1 March 2018\]. 12 Housing Quarterly Report, December 2017, Ministry of Social Development. The growth of the Māori economy can be characterised by a strong focus on intergenerational sustainability, diversification, and tikanga Māori. Values such as manaakitanga (the care of land and each other), whanaungatanga (wider kindship ties) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship and sustainability) drive business, investment and distribution decisions. While the promise of the Māori economy continues to grow, disparities persist between Māori and other New Zealanders The Māori unemployment rate of nine percent is double that of the national unemployment rate. 9 In addition, over a quarter of working-age Māori adults and their whānau receive a benefit, whereas the national rate sits at approximately 10 percent. 10 These disparities also appear in the context of housing in Aotearoa New Zealand. Forty-four percent of people on the Social Housing Register 11 (that is, people assessed as being eligible for public housing) are Māori. Fifty-seven percent of emergency housing grants are required by Māori. 12 We want to hear from Māori The Group is interested in hearing from Māori on a range of issues. All Māori individuals, companies and trusts under which Māori benefit are subject to the tax system, and Māori will have a number of cross-cutting interests in issues on the Group’s agenda. This includes issues like housing, capital gains tax (CGT), charities and land taxes covered elsewhere in this paper. 12Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper However, with changing demographics and the growing role of the Māori economy, we also encourage submissions on: • Whether the Māori authority tax regime supports or hinders Māori economic and social development. • Whether there are parts of the current tax system that warrant review from the point of view of te ao Māori • How tikanga Māori might be able to help create a more future-focused tax system. The changing nature of work The gig economy generally refers to workers who have less regularity in their sources of income, working hours and conditions, and often operate as independent contractors. Our pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) system currently provides a highly efficient way of collecting revenue, which is easy to comply with and has relatively low administration costs. However, if self-employment rates increase in the future, this could put pressure on the PAYE system and affect compliance rates. In particular, growth in the ‘gig economy’ may mean that changes need to be made to the way that independent contractors pay their tax to ensure that compliance remains high and that the cost of complying with tax for these workers is low. It is not just technological change that is driving the changing nature of work. Patterns of globalisation and the aging population (both discussed elsewhere) also intersect with the way we work and will require adjustments. Labour adjustments are not always easy, particularly for people who are already experiencing economic hardship. While the gig economy can bring more flexibility for some workers, it can also increase economic insecurity for other New Zealanders, leading to an increased sense of precariousness and vulnerability. This emphasises the importance of accessible and effective social services, resilient families and whānau, and the wider need for the tax and transfer system to work effectively. 13 Kevin Jenkins, ‘Platforms in Aotearoa: Our fast-growing sharing economy’, Policy Quarterly 14.1 (2018), 10-17. <https://www.victoria.ac.nz/\_\_data/assets/pdf\_file/0006/1347234/PQ14-1-Jenkins.pdf> \[accessed 1 March 2018\]. In addition, labour is becoming more internationally mobile. As a result it is likely that it will become more common for people to be working for short periods in New Zealand, and for New Zealanders to be working for short periods abroad. It is important that the tax system minimises double taxation while ensuring that double non-taxation does not occur. Technological change and its impact on tax bases The internet will continue to change the way that businesses operate. Tax systems have always had to evolve with evolutionary changes in business practices and technology. However, recent changes in technology, particularly with digital communications, are changing business practices and the way people earn income. The traditional company tax model was created in a very different economy. Services can now be supplied into New Zealand by businesses that do not have any physical presence here, which limits New Zealand’s ability to tax those businesses. There is rapid growth in the sharing economy. 13 The sharing economy generally refers to people using online platforms to share assets such as their house or car with third parties. It is now common for people to rent out their homes (or part of their homes) for short periods of time. As this becomes a larger part of the economy, the amount of income that might not be subject to third-party withholding or reporting regimes will increase. This raises the question of how to ensure that tax compliance overall remains high. Technological advancements in transport may affect the traditional base of fuel excise duty as vehicles become more fuel efficient. Blockchain technologies and the use of cryptocurrencies may allow sizable transactions to be made without using traditional intermediaries. This could undermine third-party reporting and withholding of tax. Encryption hides the transaction and may remove information that can be used in audits. 13Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper There are other, more speculative arguments that the future will bring great disruption to the returns to labour and capital. While technological advancement has historically resulted in both job destruction and creation, some commentators question whether the coming wave of technological change will actually create jobs. If material overall job destruction occurs, then the implications for society would be far wider than the implications on the tax system. However, we might expect the tax revenue from labour taxation to fall. It is possible that there will also be a permanently larger number of people who are persistently under- employed, and this could put pressure on the transfer system (for example, transfer payments such as Working for Families tax credits and Jobseeker Support). At the same time, if business costs reduce as a result of technological change, company taxes should raise additional revenue from greater profits to the extent that those companies remained in the New Zealand tax base. There is and will be uncertainty and disagreement about what direction New Zealand and the world are headed, but New Zealand must have a tax system flexible enough to gather revenue to fund government services and transfers. Opportunities for tax administration and policy from technological change The shift to digital technology and greater globalisation has reshaped how businesses and individuals interact and connect, as well as their expectations of government. A modern, digital revenue system needs to serve the needs of all New Zealanders. Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme aims to help people get their tax and social policy payments right from the start, avoid errors, and give them a clearer view of what they have paid and what they owe during the 14 This is done by companies attaching an imputation credit for the company tax paid when it pays dividends to domestic shareholders. 15 This statistic does not include the recent corporate tax rate cuts in the USA, from 35% to 21%. year. This creates new opportunities to help people spend far less time and effort ensuring they have met their obligations and received their correct entitlements, as tax will be withheld correctly and assistance provided at the time it is needed. It is intended that in the future Business Transformation will provide opportunities to make wider tax system changes. As an example, one area that is likely to grow in importance is the treatment of data held by the tax administration as Inland Revenue looks to improve the value of information it holds and make greater use of it. Another example is the recently enacted Accounting Income Method for paying provisional tax. This has been an opportunity for the efficient administration of existing tax bases, created by the increased use of cloud accounting systems. The tax system must be able to seize these opportunities. Company tax pressures At 28%, New Zealand’s company tax rate is relatively high. For domestic shareholders, New Zealand’s imputation regime means that the final tax rate on investments in companies is normally taxed at the shareholder’s marginal tax rate. 14 When factoring in imputation, New Zealand’s tax rate on domestic shareholders is the sixth lowest in the OECD. Foreign shareholders do not receive imputation credits and for them it is the company rate that is relevant. As at 2017 New Zealand’s company rate is the tenth highest in the OECD, with the unweighted OECD average being 24.9%.

As noted in Chapter 7, Australia has a (temporarily) lower tax rate for smaller firms. It is in New Zealand’s best interests to set its corporate tax rate according to its own circumstances and constraints; it is not simply a matter of trying to have a tax rate that is lower than the rest of the world or our immediate neighbours. The top personal tax rate, and the rate for trusts, is 33%. The 5% rate differential between the company and personal tax rates encourages what are referred to as tax sheltering arrangements. There is a risk of tax sheltering when the company tax rate is significantly lower than the top personal rate. By world standards, New Zealand has a relatively small gap between its company rate and its top personal rate but New Zealand has experienced significant tax sheltering in the past and has relied on a high degree of alignment with relatively few protections against this form of sheltering. Additional protections would need to be considered to support a larger difference between company and personal rates if such a difference comes about in the future. New Zealand must be aware of the international environment and future governments should have the option of reducing the company tax rate if this is considered sensible without the possibility of greater personal tax sheltering being an overwhelming obstacle. Environmental challenges Climate change is having, and will continue to have, significant impacts on people, the environment, and the economy. New Zealand has committed to reducing net emissions by 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, and the Government has announced that it will develop a new emissions target for 2050. Due to the proportion of emissions that come from the agriculture sector, where emissions- reduction options are limited, New Zealand may face higher costs than other countries to meet its targets. 15Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Using the tax system to ensure that consumers and producers face the costs of emissions and other environmental harm could be one way we can meet our international obligations and encourage innovative ways to reduce pollution. The Government has recently announced the creation of an independent Climate Change Commission. Although still being established, the Commission is expected to advise the Government on climate policy including changes to how we price carbon. The treatment of agricultural emissions, which are currently excluded from New Zealand’s Emissions Trading Scheme, has been flagged as an initial area of focus for the Commission. Environmental challenges extend well beyond climate. New Zealand is a biodiversity hotspot, and the unique species and ecosystems make up the country’s natural capital. New Zealanders’ wellbeing is closely linked to the ecosystem services that natural capital provides. Indigenous biodiversity has rapidly declined and continues to be threatened, especially on private land. New Zealand now has one of the highest proportion of native species at risk, and in a review of 71 rare ecosystems in New Zealand 45 species were found to be threatened with extinction. 16 It is possible for pricing and tax instruments to play a role in addressing these challenges. Government responses to such challenges have also included targeted regulations aimed at discouraging unwanted behaviours. As well as being valuable in its own right, the natural environment supports tourism – a significant part of New Zealand’s economy. Concern about inequality The New Zealand public, like the public in many countries, is concerned about inequality. The tax system can play a major role in combatting inequality both through taxing people with higher incomes at higher rates, and through redistribution and spending. It will be important that New Zealand’s tax system can play that role now and in the future. 16 Ministry for the Environment and Statistics New Zealand, ‘Rare ecosystems’, Statistics New Zealand (2015) <http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/environment/environmental-reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/ Biodiversity/rare-ecosystems.aspx> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. Tax systems can be thought to affect inequality through three dimensions: the progressivity of taxes, the overall level of taxation, and the mix of taxes. As progressivity of taxes increases, and overall levels of taxation increase, inequality falls. The mix of taxes is important because some taxes are likely to be more or less progressive than other taxes. Changing patterns of globalisation Globalisation has allowed New Zealanders to engage internationally in an unprecedented way. The array of products and services available to New Zealanders and the opportunities to produce for a global market are greater than they have ever been. At the same time, changing patterns of production and employment can impose significant costs on local communities. In the tax context, the shifting of economic activity that was previously located in New Zealand limits New Zealand’s ability to tax those firms under the traditional model for taxing cross-border investment. Looking to the future, it is an open question as to the direction of globalisation. Recent events (for example, “Brexit” – the majority vote in the UK referendum to leave the European Union) might suggest that in some countries globalisation may retreat. We must have a tax system that meets our revenue needs while not unduly restricting our ability to engage with the rest of the world. 16Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper • What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? • How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? 17 U.S. Supreme Court Case, Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v. Collector of Internal Revenue, 275 U.S. 87, Argued and Submitted Oct. 18, 1927; Decided Nov. 21, 1927. What are taxes? The primary objective of tax policy is to provide revenue for the government to fund the provision of public goods and services, and redistribution. Oliver Wendell Holmes put it more succinctly: “Taxes are what we pay for civilized society”. 17 Increasingly there are other objectives for tax systems: for example, to influence behaviours, or encourage sustainability. Public goods and services provided to its residents by the New Zealand Government include healthcare, education, policing, and defence. Transfers are payments to residents who might be on low incomes, or who live in hardship, or meet some other criteria like having young families. The Government raises the revenue for the public goods and services and transfer payments from a number of sources. Some services provided have a direct charge (for example, renting DOC hut space on tramping tracks). Some revenue is raised from imposing fines in order to discourage unwanted behaviour (for example, speeding fines). However, by far the largest source of revenue is taxation, which is a legal requirement imposed on individuals and entities (such as companies and trusts) to pay some amount of money to the government (without any direct connection with the supply of goods or services). There are some things that a government is best placed to do. A justice system, parliamentary democracy, social support entitlements, public health, public education, roads, natural disaster relief, standard setting, regulation, national parks, protection of ecosystems and species conservation are all examples of expenditure that create a modern, compassionate, and prosperous society. These are goods and services where provision by the government can ensure that society is made better off. We may debate the extent of these examples, but few would doubt the need to provide them. Taxes also fund a safety net that maintains a minimum standard of living. In this way, taxes could be seen as a payment for a kind of social insurance that mitigates the impact of unexpected economic shocks with the intention that everyone regardless of income can participate in society. 3 Purposes and principles of a good tax system 17Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 2: Tax as a proportion of GDP and GDP per capita (USD ) in OECD countries (2015) New Zealand 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 45% 50% $0$20,000$40,000$60,000$80,000$100,000$120,000 Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP Per capita GDP (USD, current purchasing power parity) Source: OECD Few areas of public policy can contribute as much to New Zealand’s welfare as a well-performing tax system. Tax is half the story when considering the Government’s overall budget and roughly equivalent to one-third of New Zealand’s GDP. A well-performing tax system ensures that society can fund the things it cares about, while ensuring that households and businesses have appropriate incentives to work, save, innovate and invest. As illustrated in Figure 2, high-income countries have a variety of tax levels relative to GDP, and it is generally the lower-income countries that have the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios. This may be because as incomes increase, countries choose to spend a greater proportion of national income on transfer payments and publicly provided goods and services. Taxes and wellbeing The ultimate purpose of public policy is to improve the wellbeing and living standards of New Zealanders. Many factors affect New Zealanders’ living standards, and many of these factors have value beyond their contribution to material comfort. Aggregate national income, or GDP, is an important enabler of higher living standards – not least because of its direct connection to the tax base – but it is not designed to be a measure of wellbeing. To measure wellbeing comprehensively, income measures therefore need to be supplemented with measures of other factors, such as health, connectedness, security, rights and capabilities, inequality, and sustainability. In recognition of the broad basis of wellbeing, the Treasury uses the Living Standards Framework to incorporate a more comprehensive range of factors, distributional perspectives, and dynamic considerations into its analysis. The Living Standards Framework identifies four capital stocks that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing: financial and physical capital; human capital; social capital; and natural capital. The Treasury represents the ‘four capitals’ visually as flax strands. When woven together (raranga), the strands come together to produce a strong mat (kete). Wellbeing is best achieved, metaphorically, when the four capitals are all strong and supporting each other. 18Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Source: The Treasury Businesses, households, and the government combine the four capital stocks in various ways to generate fl ows of tangible and intangible goods and services that enhance wellbeing now and in the future. Intergenerational wellbeing depends on the sustainable growth and distribution of the four capitals, which together represent the comprehensive wealth of New Zealand. The Living Standards Framework is evolving, and the Treasury will be doing further work to ensure it is in synergy with te ao Māori. While many concepts already refl ect a Māori worldview of te pae tawhiti (a long-term, intergenerational view), whanaungatanga (connectedness) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship), work continues to further refi ne and test this framework. Source: The Treasury 19Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper The Framework is intended to be a flexible tool that can help identify dynamics and trade-offs across social, economic, and natural domains. These dynamics are complex, and our knowledge about them is incomplete. The Framework is intended to encourage analysis that pushes beyond the more easily measured (but narrow) financial dimensions, and to identify complementarity, substitutability, interactions and trade-offs between the different capital stocks. The Living Standards Framework has aspects in common with other, international frameworks developed overseas. New Zealand is a signatory to the Sustainable Development Goals – a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations. The goals are more outcome-specific than the four capitals, but capture many of the same ideas. The key benefit of applying the Living Standards Framework to policy analysis is therefore that it encourages a broad consideration of the wellbeing impacts of policy change. In this spirit, the Group encourages people reading and responding to this paper to explore and share their own views about how the design of the tax system affects the wellbeing of New Zealanders. The established criteria that have been used in past tax reviews (both domestically and overseas) are also useful when considering the costs and benefits of various reforms. These criteria include: • Efficiency: Taxes should be efficient and impose as little cost on society as possible. By this it is meant that taxes should be imposed in a way to maximise national welfare, by not creating biases between different investments or activities, unless there are sound reasons to believe that there are wider social costs that these taxes are addressing. • Equity and fairness: The tax system should be fair. This involves both horizontal equity (fair treatment of those in similar circumstances) and vertical equity (fair treatment of those with differing abilities to pay tax). • Revenue integrity: The tax system should minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage and provide a sustainable revenue base for the government. • Fiscal adequacy: The government should raise sufficient revenue to meet its requirements. • Compliance and administration costs: Taxpayers’ costs of complying with the tax system and the government’s costs of administering the tax system should be kept to a minimum. One important aspect of this is to provide as much certainty to taxpayers as possible as to what tax is due. • Coherence: Individual reform options should make sense in the context of the entire tax system. While a particular measure may seem sensible when viewed in isolation, implementing the proposal may not be desirable given the tax system as a whole. Coherence is really a means of satisfying the other objectives outlined above rather than being an end in itself. A coherent tax system is one that fits together. For example, it is common internationally for governments to decide that personal income should be taxed at a set of increasing marginal tax rates. For such a system to be coherent it is vital that the statutory tax rates on personal income “stick”. The tax system loses coherence if this progressive tax system can be circumvented by, for example, individuals sheltering income in trusts or companies. Similarly, the tax system loses coherence if there are arbitrary differences in the ways that different forms of savings or investment are taxed. Distribution and equity Taxation has a number of fairness implications. The taxes imposed on each person must be seen to be fair in light of the person’s income, consumption, wealth, or other measure in relation to other people subject to the tax. Fairness implications are usually referred to as ‘equity’ considerations in tax policy. What is fair to one person might not seem fair to another. To help frame this difficult discussion, tax policy has traditionally relied on the concepts of horizontal and vertical equity to guide reform. 20Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Horizontal equity is a principle whereby those in the same circumstances should pay the same amount in taxes. Vertical equity is a principle whereby those in better circumstances should pay higher amounts (and often higher proportions of income and/or assets) in line with their greater economic capacity to pay. As expressed through the political system, it is clear that New Zealand as a society accepts that a progressive tax system (where those on higher incomes pay higher proportions of tax) is a fair system. The Group also understands that a key part of horizontal equity relates to the rules that apply to different structures. Some people have more than one option for structuring their business affairs, whereas others do not. For example, an employee will always have tax deducted at source by their employer through the PAYE system. A contractor doing broadly equivalent work may be able to conduct their business as either a sole-trader, a partner in partnership, through a company or through a trust. Such decisions can allow tax rate benefits as well as the ability to access work-related deductions. This has implications for horizontal equity. It is also important to recognise that sometimes the principles of horizontal and vertical equity are, for various reasons, not adhered to. Inconsistencies in the system are referred to in Chapter 5. Another important aspect of fairness is procedural fairness. Taxpayers should have as much certainty of their tax situation as possible, and should be treated fairly by the tax department. The adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system is outside the scope of the Group’s review (the Terms of Reference note that this will be considered as part of a separate review of the welfare system). However, when looking at fairness as a concept, the Group considers that the amount of tax paid per person or group is only one side of the consideration. Because tax revenue is used to fund government services, looking at how the tax revenue is spent and on whom it is spent are also an important part of the fairness question. Therefore, when thinking about the distribution of taxes, equity and fairness, it is best to think of the tax and transfer system overall, rather than individual taxes in isolation. Efficiency and other impacts of tax Tax funds expenditure that raises the living standards of New Zealanders, both collectively and individually. Without the revenue to fund that expenditure, the public goods that households and businesses enjoy would be absent. Tax policy generally focuses on how to raise that revenue in the fairest and most efficient way possible. Putting aside the ‘use’ of the revenue, transferring the equivalent of a third of GDP from individuals and entities in the economy to government may have (usually unwanted) other impacts. Tax policy concentrates on how to raise the revenue at the least cost to society. The unwanted impacts are sometimes called the deadweight costs of taxation. These are costs imposed on society by people changing their behaviour in response to the tax. For example, if two different investments were taxed at different rates, the tax system would be inducing people to invest in the more lightly-taxed investment. This will mean that even when a lightly-taxed investment is making lower returns before tax, investors may still invest in it because its after-tax returns are higher. This is a cost because society will end up poorer as investment is directed toward investments with lower pre-tax returns, solely for tax reasons, rather than the most efficient investments. Another example is tax on income from labour. In the absence of taxation, the private returns from working would be higher. In such a situation, people might make different choices about how often they work and for how long, and at what sort of job. In short, labour taxation changes the relative reward to work and this can cause people to change their behaviour. In the business context, a tax system will be least distortionary if it taxes economic income and provides deductions for the true cost of inputs in creating that income. This is because a tax on profits (i.e. after allowing deductions for costs) will generally lead to firms continuing to make similar businesses decisions with a tax that they would without the tax. 21Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper As an example, consider a firm that can spend $9 to make $10 in revenue. If there is a 20% tax on profit then the firm will still have the incentive to make the investment as they will make a post-tax return of $0.80 (that is, 80% of the $1 profit). However, if instead the firm was not allowed to take deductions and there was a 20% tax on revenue, the firm will not make the investment because after tax they will make a $1 loss (they would be taxed $2 on the $10 revenue). Other taxes that promote efficiency seek to ensure that consumers and producers face the social costs of their activities. These taxes try to approximate the social costs of an activity. A tax or price on traffic congestion is one example of this. Tax incidence One other important principle is that of tax incidence. This principle intersects both fairness and efficiency considerations. Tax incidence is about who ultimately bears the costs of a tax. A good example is excise tax. While firms that produce alcohol and tobacco are statutorily and administratively liable for excise tax, it is normally assumed that the incidence (that is, who actually bears the cost of the tax) is felt by consumers of these products. Another example is a payroll tax. A payroll tax is paid by an employer, generally as a percentage of an employee’s wages. While the employer administratively pays the tax to the tax department, employees’ wages may be reduced by some or all of the tax. The result is that the employee pays the tax to the extent his or her wages are reduced. The incidence point is an important point because if we confuse statutory incidence with who really bears the cost of the tax, our intuitions may lead to erroneous conclusions on fairness. While it is hard to estimate actual incidence with precision, it is vital to keep in mind when thinking about tax changes. 22Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper • New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? • Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? • Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? 18 New Zealand’s total tax revenue as measured against GDP includes around 2 percentage points of local government revenue – most of which is rates on property. 19 One important difference between New Zealand and Australia is that New Zealand funds a universal pension scheme out of taxation, whereas Australia funds a near-universal superannuation scheme out of compulsory employer contributions (which are not counted as taxation). If the same effect were achieved instead by levying a tax on employers and the Government accumulating the funds, the Australian tax to GDP ratio would be considerably higher. This chapter compares New Zealand’s tax system to others in the OECD to provide an international perspective. International comparisons are always difficult because inevitably there are nuances that make like-with-like comparisons difficult. Nevertheless, comparisons can be useful to provide context for New Zealand. Other countries can and do have tax systems that vary materially from New Zealand’s own. How much does New Zealand tax? In New Zealand, the central government spends an amount equivalent to about 30% of GDP on services and transfers, so it needs to raise about the same amount of revenue each year in order to maintain spending without increasing debt. Over time there has been some fluctuation in government revenue, with the current level slightly below the OECD average of tax revenue equivalent to 34% GDP, as illustrated in Figure 3. Note that these OECD figures include local government taxes (such as rates) for ease of comparison, but the Group is not considering any changes to local government taxation in New Zealand. 18,19 4 The current New Zealand tax system 23Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 3: Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 198019811982198319841985198619871988198919901991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015 Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP Year Australia New Zealand OECD Average Source: OECD 20 Social security contributions are compulsory payments to government that provide an entitlement to receive a future benefit. Payroll taxes are taxes paid by employers, employees or the self-employed, either as a proportion of payroll or as a fixed amount per person, and that do not provide entitlements to social benefits. What does New Zealand tax? In general terms, a tax base refers to the application of tax to a revenue stream or activity. The largest tax bases for central government in New Zealand are: •Individual income (individual income tax) •Company income (company income tax) • General consumption (goods and services tax) •Consumption of specific goods and services (excise taxes imposed on sales of tobacco products, alcoholic drinks, and motor fuels) Broad base, low rate New Zealand is generally described as having a “broad-based, low-rate” tax system. This refers to the tax base, and tax rate. A broad base means that few things are exempt from a particular tax. As shown in Figure 4, New Zealand gets approximately 90% of its tax revenue from three tax bases (excluding local government taxes) – individual income, company income, and general consumption. This is a more concentrated source of revenue than most OECD countries, which raise significant proportions of revenue from social security contributions and payroll taxes, as shown in Figure 5. 20 24Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 4: New Zealand source of taxation revenue (2017) Individual income tax, 40.2% Company income tax, 16.3% GST (including customs GST), 31.4% Fringe Benefit Tax, 0.6% Resident withholding tax, 2.6% Non-resident withholding tax, 0.7% Excise taxes & duties, 6.1% Other, 2.0% Source: The Treasury Figure 5: Source of taxation revenue 2015 – OECD countries 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% Percentage of taxation revenue IndividualsCorporatesGST (customs inclusive)Other Source: OECD Fr ance Ja pan Slovak R epubli c Czech R epub li c Pola nd Netherla nds Spain Italy Sloveni a Kore a Germ any Belgi um Luxembour g Hungar y Austri a Gr eec e Switzerla nd Turk ey Estonia United State s OECD Averag e Latvia Finland United King dom Portu gal Mexic o Norway Isr ael Cana da Swed en Ireland Icelan d Austra lia Ch ile New Zeala nd Denmark 25Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper One example of a broad-based tax in New Zealand is our GST, which has almost no exemptions. Similarly, our income tax has few exemptions (one notable gap is particular capital gains). In contrast, other countries’ tax systems often allow deductions for things like superannuation contributions, health care expenses, and mortgage interest on owner-occupied dwellings. Having a broad tax base allows New Zealand to raise substantial tax revenue with relatively low tax rates. Fewer exemptions also means a simpler tax system and less opportunity for tax avoidance. The top income tax rate in New Zealand is currently 33%, which is low for developed countries. Our GST rate of 15% is also low internationally. 21 For this analysis, family is defined as a one-earner married couple with two children and earnings at the average wage level, and calculations do not include consumption taxes. 22 In Figure 6, “core government services” is expenses relating to government departments not covered under other classifications, and “primary services” is expenditure relating to primary industries. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not have a tax-free threshold on income earned by individuals, companies or trusts. Consequently, our income tax applies broadly – from the very first dollar of income. Although they often have a tax-free threshold, most other OECD countries have a payroll tax or social security tax that applies to the first dollar of wage income. When these are included, for 2016 New Zealand has the lowest average effective tax rate in the OECD for families with children. 21 The Government spends in a variety of areas, as shown in Figure 6, but the three primary areas are social security and welfare (which includes NZ Superannuation), health, and education. 22 Figure 6: Core Government Expenses (Year ending 30 June 2017) 05,00010,00015,00020,00025,00030,000 Social security and welfare Health Education Core government services Law and order Finance costs Economic and industrial services Transport and communications Defence Environmental protection Heritage, culture and recreation Primary services Housing and community development GSF pension expenses Other Socia l s ecuri ty and w e lfare H ea lthE du c a t i o n Core go v ern m en t ser vices Law and orderFinance costs Econom ic and industrial ser vices Transport and comm unicatio ns D ef e n c e Env ironmental protection H er itag e, culture and re cre ation Prim ary ser vices Housing and community devel opment GSF pe ns ion e xp en s es Other ($ mill ions) 2 5, 2 941 6, 2 231 3, 2 813,9573,8823,5342,5442,1762,1468 718 506 445 392 171 81 Source: The Treasury 26Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Taxes and behaviour Some tax systems aim to incentivise certain types of behaviour. There are two main justifications for using tax to modify behaviour. The first justification is that an activity has social costs (and so is taxed at a higher rate), or has social benefits (and so is taxed at a lower rate or subsidised). These are taxes based on externalities and are sometimes called Pigouvian taxes. Environmental taxes often have these goals. Pigouvian taxes are consistent with a broad-based low-rate system. The second justification is that an activity may be harmful or beneficial to an individual, and for some reason the individual may not be able or willing to act in their best interest. The tax therefore seeks to discourage the individual from partaking in the harmful behaviour. New Zealand does, in a few selected cases, deliberately incentivise or discourage particular behaviour (for example, tobacco and alcohol excise tax). Recently there have been calls for further exceptions – in particular for sugary drinks. Tax and retirement savings In New Zealand, personal income from capital (other than some non-taxed capital gains) is taxed at the same rate as income from labour under our income tax. Some commentators think that New Zealand should tax income from capital at a lower rate to encourage more saving, particularly for retirement. New Zealand’s lack of concessions for retirement savings is rare among OECD countries. However, the Government does provide material support to those in retirement through universal superannuation – expenditure on payments of New Zealand Superannuation is expected to be $13.7 billion in the 2017/18 financial year – more than all other benefit payments combined. When thinking about retirement savings, there are three possible taxation points. These are: at the stage of contribution, when the contribution itself earns income, and when all savings (the contribution and the income earned on the contribution) are 23 In other words, a TTE approach is consistent with the broad-base, low-rate framework. withdrawn. In most OECD countries, contributions to retirement savings are made out of income that is not taxed. Investment earnings on retirement savings are also exempt, and it is not until the drawdown phase where withdrawals of capital and accumulated earnings are taxed. This approach is often described as EET – Exempt-Exempt-Taxed. At the same time, social security pensions are means-tested in many countries. This means that additional retirement savings directly reduce the cost of social security pensions to the government (because wealthy individuals do not qualify for a means-tested pension), which may partially explain why these countries provide tax concessions for retirement savings. New Zealand takes a different approach to most other countries. Our comprehensive income tax is often described as TTE – Taxed-Taxed-Exempt. This means that contributions are made out of income that is taxed (usually an individual’s labour income), the income earned from the investment is taxed (regardless of whether it is earned before or during retirement), but amounts “withdrawn” from the investment are not taxed. This approach ensures that economic distortions to save in a retirement account instead of through other savings are minimised. 23 New Zealand is also unusual compared to other OECD countries in that New Zealand Superannuation is universal, so additional retirement savings do not reduce the amount of New Zealand Superannuation paid out. If New Zealand were to switch to a system where income earned on the investment was not taxed, the fiscal cost would be significant. Along with the non-taxation of particular capital gains, there are other exceptions to New Zealand’s general tax neutrality across different types of savings – some small concessions for retirement savings have been introduced in recent years with the establishment of Portfolio Investment Entities (PIEs) and KiwiSaver, both in 2007. KiwiSaver provides modest incentives to save for retirement, and the automatic enrolment of employees when they take up new jobs means that many people are ‘nudged’ into saving. 27Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper •Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? • Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business ? • Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? •Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of e xcessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Individual income tax The New Zealand tax system raises relatively high amounts of revenue considering its relatively low rates. The comparison of OECD countries in Figure 7 shows New Zealand collects the fifth highest proportion of taxes on personal income as measured against GDP, despite having the sixth lowest top statutory personal rate. This can be explained by New Zealand’s relatively low threshold for the top marginal personal tax rate ($70,000) compared to our average wage. This suggests that New Zealand’s broad-base low-rate system lives up to its name in collecting large amounts of revenue by taxing income earned by individuals broadly, but at relatively low rates. It is important to note that the personal income taxes in the above chart do not include social security contributions or payroll taxes.

Company income tax In the year ended 30 June 2017, the Government collected $12.6 billion in company tax. 24 This represents 4.6% of GDP in 2017. 25 In 2015, New Zealand’s collection of company tax was the highest in the OECD as measured as a proportion of GDP (as shown in Figure 8), but when New Zealand data is reported on a consolidated 26 basis it is the fifth highest in the OECD. 27 Once more this suggests a broad and robust tax base. It should be noted, however, that New Zealand’s company tax rate is higher than average. As at 2017 New Zealand has the tenth highest company rate of the 35 OECD countries. 28 Because of New Zealand’s imputation system, there is only limited additional tax at the shareholder-level when dividends are paid out of income that has been taxed at the company level. This additional tax applies for taxpayers on the top marginal rate, and is the difference between the corporate rate and the taxpayer’s marginal tax rate. Many other countries have an additional layer of tax at the shareholder level for domestic shareholders with no credit for tax at the company level. Those additional shareholder- level taxes are not taken into account in Figure 8 but are taken into account in the taxes on personal income in Figure 7. When factoring in imputation, New Zealand’s tax rate on domestic shareholders is the sixth lowest in the OECD.

The company tax rates in Figure 8 are statutory rates. If some sectors of the economy habitually pay lower effective rates, perhaps because they can apply excessive deductions, or benefit from timing regimes or some of their income is not taxed, it may be appropriate to consider whether those tax concessions are still relevant and fair. Conversely, some business expenses may not be deductible under existing rules and consideration should be given to whether this is appropriate. Goods and services tax GST is a broad-based value-added tax on general consumption in New Zealand imposed at a single rate of 15 percent with very few exemptions. Having few exemptions and a single rate creates a relatively simple system. However, there are concerns that New Zealand’s GST is regressive in that lower- income households tend to pay a larger proportion of their income in GST. New Zealand’s GST is among the most comprehensive in the world. To the extent there are exemptions, they pale in comparison to the multitude of exemptions and differential rates across the rest of the world. As shown in Figure 9, New Zealand collects the highest equivalent percentage of GDP through its GST in the OECD (based on 2015 data), despite having one of the lower value-added tax rates across the OECD. This reflects a very broad GST base, but also a different treatment of government spending compared to other countries. If we were to calculate GST on government spending on the same basis as other countries, we would have the eleventh highest level of GST as measured against GDP. Goods and services excluded from GST include financial services, and low-value imported goods. 29 New Zeala nd Norwa y Luxembour g Ch ile Austra lia Ja pan Slovak R epubli c Czech R epub li c Belgi um Korea Mexic o Cana da Portu gal Switzerla nd Isr ael Swed en Netherla nds Irela nd Denmar k United King dom Spain Icelan d Austria United State s Finlan d Gr eec e Estoni a Fr ance Italy Pola nd Hungar y Germ any Latvi a Sloveni a Turkey 30Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 9: Value-added taxes as a percentage of GDP (2015) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 VAT as a percentage of GDP / VAT rates for 2015 VAT revenue as a percentage of GDPVAT rates Source: OECD Financial services are difficult to apply GST to because it is difficult to isolate and separate out the service provided by financial institutions from the savings component of a loan. Banks and financial institutions generally charge for the service they provide through a margin between the interest rate that they charge and the interest rate that they pay. In principle this charge for the service should be subject to GST, but it is difficult to accurately identify the amount of this margin on a transaction by transaction basis and therefore difficult to apply GST to it. Due to the growth of online shopping there is an increasing volume of imported goods on which GST is not collected. This is because the GST (and other duties) owing on these goods is below an administrative de minimis. The rationale for the de minimis is to achieve a balance between the administrative costs of collecting the GST at the border and the revenue collected, as well as to facilitate the clearance of goods at the border. The Group has been asked for advice on this by the Minister of Finance and has already provided that separately. Recent developments suggest there may be cost- effective options for collecting GST on low value imported goods. In particular, from 1 July 2018 Australia will become the first country to require offshore suppliers that sell more than AU$75,000 per year of goods valued below AU$1000 to Australian consumers to register for and charge GST on these sales. This follows on from the fact that many countries, including New Zealand, have required offshore suppliers of digital services to domestic residents to register for and collect GST. Cash transfers and income tax paid The following charts give indications of the level of redistribution given by New Zealand’s tax and transfer system. It is important to note that the income measure used for these charts does not include untaxed capital gains and some other important benefits associated with owner-occupied housing. As a result, it will understate the income of some households, in particular some higher income New Zeala nd Hungar y Denmar k Swed en Finlan d Portu gal Icelan d Norwa y Austri a Gr eece Czech R epub li c Pola nd Germ any Fr ance United King dom Slovak R epubli c OECD Averag e Belgi um Netherla nds Luxembour g Spain Italy Turkey Irela nd Canada Ja pan Mexico Kore a Austra lia Switzerland 31Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 10: Percentage of income tax and transfers across deciles 12% 22% 17% 10% 9% 7% 6% 6% 5% 6% 1% 2% 3% 5% 6% 8% 10% 12% 17% 35% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 40% 12345678910 Percentage of overall tax received or paid Deciles of equivalised disposable household income Government transfersIncome tax Source: Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, 2017. Data based on Household Economic Survey 2015 30 Figures 10 and 11 use equivalised household income, which means they need to be interpreted as comparisons of the consumption capabilities for those in the various deciles. Equivalised household income is intended to enable comparisons in the purchasing power between households with different sizes and characteristics, which reflects that larger households need more income to have the same purchasing power as smaller households. For example, a one person household with no children earning $13,000 of income is treated the same as a two person, two child household earning $28,100. As a result of using equivalised household income, the amount of income a household needs to earn to be in each income decile differs depending on the characteristics of the household. For a sense of scale, a two adult, two-child household earning less than $42,300 is in the bottom decile, while a household with the same characteristics earning between $71,400 and $82,100 is in decile 5 and one earning more than $175,400 is in the top decile. 31 Bryan Perry, Household incomes in New Zealand: Trends and indicators of inequality and hardship – 1982 to 2016 (Wellington, New Zealand: Ministry of Social Development, 2017) <https://www.msd.govt.nz/documents/about-msd-and- our-work/publications-resources/monitoring/household-income-report/2017/2017-incomes-report-wed-19-july-2017.pdf> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. households. A related issue is that this is based on survey data, and surveys exclude extreme outliers, particularly those who have extremely high incomes or wealth. It should also be noted that the transfer measures used only include cash transfers and not other government spending that can reduce inequality such as education or health spending. Higher-income households play an important role in funding the government. Figure 10 illustrates how the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases over the deciles – with decile 1 being the 10% of households with the lowest incomes and decile 10 being the 10% with the highest household incomes. 30 Households in the top income decile pay one third (35%) of all income tax collected while receiving 6% of all transfers (almost entirely from New Zealand Superannuation). 31 Those in the bottom five income deciles collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax. Figure 11 shows the difference between income tax paid and government transfers for each household income decile. For the bottom four income deciles the amount households receive in transfers is greater than what they pay in income tax. The difference is greatest for decile 2 households, which is due to the high number of New Zealand Superannuation recipients in this group. 32Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 11: Income tax less government cash transfers -$30,000 -$20,000 -$10,000 $0 $10,000 $20,000 $30,000 $40,000 $50,000 $60,000 12345678910 Difference in ordinary dollars Deciles of equivalised disposable household income Source: Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, 2017. Data based on Household Economic Survey 2015 32 The ‘Gini’ score is a method of measuring income inequality by comparing the share of total income in a country held by each person in that country. A score of 100 represents maximum inequality where one person has all the income and a score of 0 represents full equality where everyone has the same income. It is important to note that the Gini score is only one way of measuring inequality, albeit a very common one. The data in Figure 12 is based on the age 18-65 population rather than the entire population. 33 Bryan Perry (2017). Income inequality refers to the uneven distribution of income among households. Income inequality is often used as a measure of fairness across society. Figure 12 shows the inequality-reducing impact of taxes and transfers by comparing the ‘Gini’ scores for households before and after taxes and transfers. 32 Inequality is greater when considering household income after housing costs. Figure 13 shows that inequality after housing costs has been increasing over time. This reflects both that housing costs generally make up a greater proportion of household income for lower income households than for higher- income households, and that housing costs have been growing faster than incomes. 33 Looking at expenditure inequality is also a useful indicator. Income inequality is partly attributable to households having different incomes over their lifetime (generally relatively low when young, high when middle aged, and low when retired). The other limitations of income data are that it excludes capital gains and imputed rents, and will not account for income earned in entities owned by the household or individual (e.g. trusts, companies). Looking at expenditure inequality mitigates these problems. Expenditure data has less of a lifetime income problem as households will generally “smooth” their consumption to some extent and try to consume based on their expected lifetime income. If households or individuals have received substantial capital gains, or have income in entities, this will influence their expenditure, which will tend to increase with their greater income or wealth. 33Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 12: Income inequality before and after taxes and transfers 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 1985198619871988198919901991199219931994199519961997199819992000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012201320142015 Gini score x 100 (18-65 years) Year Before taxes and transfers (market income) After taxes and transfers (disposable income) Source: Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, 2017 Figure 13: Income inequality before and after housing costs 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 19821983198419851986198719881989199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013201420152016 Gini score x 100 Year Before housing costs After housing costs Source: Bryan Perry, Ministry of Social Development, 2017 34Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 14: Inequality of household spending 1984 to 2013: Expenditure 25 27 29 31 33 35 37 198419851986198719881989199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001200220032004200520062007200820092010201120122013 Gini score x 100 Year Source: Treasury WP 15/06: Inequality in New Zealand 1983/84 to 2013/14 At the same time, expenditure data has its own limitations. Survey data on expenditure systematically fails to match national aggregate data. The survey data tends to underestimate consumption, suggesting some under-reporting of expenditure by survey recipients. Similar to income inequality, the expenditure inequality measure in Figure 14 shows increasing inequality from 1984 until the mid-1990s. However, unlike income inequality, expenditure inequality has decreased since the mid-1990s. Expenditure inequality is an aggregate concept and there can be important nuances that are not picked up in aggregate measures if the price of particular goods and services has changed over time. Figure 15 shows that, compared with other OECD countries, New Zealand’s level of income inequality is above average and higher than Australia, although lower than the United Kingdom and United States. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to Canada, but a smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average, as shown in Figure 16. Other countries have chosen to have high tax and high transfer systems. The Scandinavian countries are good examples of these systems. Transfers tend not to be targeted, with the result that the fiscal cost requires substantial taxation. To date, New Zealand has used a more targeted approach. This reduces the fiscal cost of transfers, which allows lower taxes. This more targeted approach does result in high effective marginal tax rates on lower income- households as benefits are withdrawn as earnings increase, and it limits the redistributive power of the system as a whole. 35Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 15: Income inequality in OECD countries (2014/15) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Gini score x 100 Income inequality (disposable income, post taxes and transfers) Income inequality (market income, before taxes and transfers) Data is for 2014and 2015 where available Source: OECD Figure 16: Reduction in the Gini coefficient on account of the tax and transfer system 24.5% 31.9% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Reduction in Gini (as a percentage) Source:OECD Mexic o Turkey Ch ile South Afric a Korea Isr ael Switzerla nd United State s New Zeala nd Cana da Latvi a Lit huani a Estoni a Austra lia United King dom OECD avera ge Netherla nds Spai n Swed en Poland Italy Hungar y Norwa y Portu gal Icelan d Slovak R epubli c Gr eec e Luxembour g Germ any Denmar k Fr ance Czech R epub li c Austri a Sloveni a Irela nd Belgi um Finland Icelan d Sloveni a Slovak R epubli c Denmar k Czech R epub li c Finlan d Belgi um Norwa y Austri a Swed en Luxembour g Hungar y Germ any Pola nd Fr ance Kore a Switzerla nd Irela nd Netherla nds Cana da OECD avera ge Italy Estoni a Portu gal Austra lia Gr eece Spain Latvia New Zeala nd Isr ael United King dom Lit huani a United State s Turkey Ch ile Mexico 36Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper The Ministry of Social Development’s Household Incomes in New Zealand report summaries the inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax and transfer system in the following way: 34 •The inequality-reducing power of the tax and transfer system on market income inequality has steadily declined for New Zealand from 27% to 17% over the last three decades (using the Gini). 35 •The size of the impact reflects not only the original level of household market income inequality but also changes in policy settings and in the number of people receiving a main working-age benefit (the latter has declined since the mid-1990s except for a brief rise following the Global Financial Crisis). •The inequality-reducing power of New Zealand’s tax-benefit system is currently relatively low compared with that for other OECD countries, including those who (like New Zealand) have lower unemployment rates (for example, Germany, Norway, the UK and Australia). It is below the OECD average. This Group’s Terms of Reference exclude consideration of “the adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system” and instead, the Government has indicated its intention to review the welfare system. The Tax Working Group will, however, be looking at the fairness of the tax system; an important part of the tax and transfer system. 34 Household incomes in New Zealand: trends in indicators of inequality and hardship 1982 to 2016, Ministry of Social Development <https://www.msd.govt.nz/about-msd-and-our-work/publications-resources/monitoring/household-incomes/ index.html> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 35 This data is only for the 18-65 age group, whereas the data in Figure 16 is for the total population. 36 Household net worth statistics: Year ended 30 June 2015 (Statistics New Zealand, 2016) <http://archive.stats.govt.nz/~/ media/Statistics/Browse%20for%20stats/HouseholdNetWorthStatistics/HOTPYeJun15/hh-net-worth-stats-2015-tables.xlsx> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. Wealth inequality The central government taxes income and consumption, but not wealth. Wealth is distributed much less equally than income. Figure 17 illustrates the level of wealth inequality among households. Part of the reason is that wealth tends to depend on age as people accumulate assets through their working lives. On average older people are wealthier than younger people, as shown by Figure 18. There is also likely to be substantial wealth inequality within each age group. Owner-occupied housing is also strongly associated with higher-wealth quintiles: 40% of owner-occupied housing (by value) is held by the 20% of households with the highest net worth, while 1% is held by the 20% of households with the lowest net worth. 36 Excluding owner-occupied housing from the wealth statistics, illustrated in Figure 19, also shows that the vast majority of non owner-occupied housing wealth is held by the wealthiest quintile. 37Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 17: Median household net worth by quintile (2015) $8,000 $97,000 $289,000 $561,000 $1,356,000 $0 $200,000 $400,000 $600,000 $800,000 $1,000,000 $1,200,000 $1,400,000 $1,600,000 Quintile 1 Under $39,500 Quintile 2 $39,500 to $183,699 Quintile 3 $183,700 to $399,799 Quintile 4 $399,800 to $814,799 Quintile 5 $814,800+ Median household net worth Household net worth quintile Source: Household net worth statistics, Statistics New Zealand Figure 18: Median personal net worth by age group (2015) $1,000 $26,000 $96,000 $182,000 $278,000 $288,000 $0 $50,000 $100,000 $150,000 $200,000 $250,000 $300,000 $350,000 15-2425-3435-4445-5455-6465+ Median personal net worth Age group Source: Household net worth statistics, Statistics New Zealand 38Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 19: Net worth (excluding owner-occupied housing) held by each net worth quintile ($m) ($100) $28,900 $53,800 $104,800 $601,800 ($100,000) $0 $100,000 $200,000 $300,000 $400,000 $500,000 $600,000 $700,000 Quintile 1 Under $39,500 Quintile 2 $39,500 to $183,699 Quintile 3 $183,700 to $399,799 Quintile 4 $399,800 to $814,799 Quintile 5 $814,800+ Net worth (excluding owner -occupied housing) held by each quintile ($m) Net worth quintile (including housing) Source: Household net worth statistics, Statistics New Zealand Figure 20: Average tax wedge faced in OECD countries (2016) 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Average tax wedge (percentage) One-earner married couple at 100% of average earnings, 2 children Single person at 100% of average earnings, no child Source: OECD Belgi um Germ any Hungar y Fr ance Italy Austri a Finland Czech R epub li c Swed en Sloveni a Latvia Slovak R epubli c Portu gal Gr eece Spain Estoni a Luxembour g Turk ey Netherla nds Denmar k Norway OECD Averag e Poland Iceland Ja pan United State s Cana da United King dom Austra lia Ireland Korea Isr ael Switzerla nd Mexico New Zeala nd Ch ile 39Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Average tax wedge Figure 20 shows the average tax wedge (average amount of tax paid on each dollar earned) once transfers are taken into account across OECD countries, but does not include value-added taxes like New Zealand’s GST. New Zealand has one of the lowest tax wedges across all OECD countries for both single workers and for married one-earner couples. This predominantly reflects that New Zealand does not have any social security or payroll taxes. Tax on household savings One policy concern that has been raised in New Zealand is the different tax treatments of different investments – in particular, the treatment of housing as compared with other investments. If our broad-based, low-rate system is working well, there should be only minor (or no) differences in the tax treatment of different forms of investment. One way to systematically look at whether the tax system is balanced and neutral toward saving in different forms is to look at marginal effective tax rates on household savings. Marginal effective tax rates measure the tax rate on real, pre-tax income for investments that earn the same rate of return and will depend on a number of assumptions that are open to question. 37 The tax rates in Figure 21 below vary because of: •the non-taxation of capital gains when some assets are expected to earn capital gains; • the difference between the company, PIE, and personal rates; •the different tax treatment of foreign shares compared with domestic shares; 37 In this exercise it is assumed that the real risk-free return is 3%, inflation is 2%, and the statutory marginal tax rate is 33%. 38 The PIE, superannuation fund, company and foreign shares are all assumed to be holding interest-bearing deposits that earn this risk-free rate. 39 In the case of owner-occupied housing, equity has a positive tax rate (rather than 0%) because housing is subject to local property taxes (rates). In Figure 21, rates are assumed to be 0.34% of the market value of a property, based on Inland Revenue analysis. 40 The situation for foreign shares is more complicated as individual investors and trustees receive a $50,000 de minimis, whereby if the cost of the shares is less than or equal to $50,000, individuals must return the dividends as income instead of paying tax under the FIF rules. Individuals can use the ‘comparative value’ method if the cost is over $50,000 but the returns are lower than 5%. If the returns were 3%, individuals would pay tax on 3%. If the returns were -5%, individuals would pay no tax but would get no relief for losses. These more generous options are not available for PIEs that hold foreign shares. •the levying of local government taxes on real property; and •the taxation of gains that are solely due to inflation. As nominal income is fully taxed (that is, income including the inflation component), a 33% tax on the nominal return (that is, the real return plus inflation) on savings in a bank account is actually a materially higher tax on the real return. As risk-free rates have declined around the world, the relevance of taxing nominal rather than only real returns has increased. Figure 21 assumes a 3% real risk-free rate. 38 This is a low assumption relative to historical risk-free rates, but is high relative to current risk-free rates in New Zealand. As shown in Figure 21, owner-occupied and rental housing is undertaxed relative to other assets. 39 It is noted that the Terms of Reference for the Group specifically exclude any recommended changes to the tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. Foreign shares are relatively highly taxed under the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules and the fair dividend rate (FDR) system, whereby income is calculated at 5% of the opening value of the shares each income year. If real returns are only 3% (as assumed), this will overtax foreign shares. 40 Under a broad-based, low-rate system, ideally the bars in Figure 21 would line up perfectly and there would be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between the types of investments. Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates on savings are quite uniform, but there may be room for improvement to make our current system more consistent. Consistent treatment should improve both fairness and efficiency. 40Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 21: Marginal effective tax rates on savings 55.7% 47.2%47.2% 55.7% 47.2% 55.0% 11.3% 29.4% 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% Bank accountPIESuperannuation fund Company (distributes) Company (doesn't distribute) Foreign shares - FDR Owner- occupied housing - equity Rental property - equity Marginal effective tax rate Type of saving Source: Treasury/IRD analysis 41 Sources: ‘The State of New Zealand’s Environment’, Ministry for the Environment (1997) <http://www.mfe.govt.nz/ publications/environmental-reporting/state-new-zealand%E2%80%99s-environment-1997-chapter-eight-state-our-2> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. ‘Land cover’, Statistics New Zealand (2015) <http://archive.stats.govt.nz/browse\_for\_stats/environment/environmental- reporting-series/environmental-indicators/Home/Land/land-cover.aspx> \[accessed 2 March 2018\] ‘New Zealand’s wetlands at risk’, Department of Conservation (2018) <http://www.doc.govt.nz/news/media-releases/2018/ new-zealands-wetlands-at-risk/> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 42 Ministry for the Environment an d Statistics New Zealand, Our fresh water 2017 (2017) <http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/ default/files/media/Environmental%20reporting/our-fresh-water-2017\_1.pdf> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 43 Bill Kaye-Blak e, Chris Schilling, Chris Nixon and Killian Destremau, Water management in New Zealand (Wellington: NZIER, 2017) <https://nzier.org.nz/static/media/filer\_public/d2/ce/d2cef6fa-3b58-4f11-bb0b-7b2a684ac181/nzier\_public\_discussion\_ paper\_2014-01\_-\_water\_management\_in\_nz.pdf> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 44 OECD, OECD Environmental Performance Reviews: New Zealand 2017 (Paris: OECD Publishing, 2017) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/9789264268203-en> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. The environment New Zealand’s resource-based economy and the wellbeing of New Zealanders are heavily dependent on protecting our natural capital base. However, New Zealand’s natural capital is under pressure. Nearly 75% of native forests and 90% of native wetlands have been cleared, although protections have stemmed the loss of especially native forest. 41 In addition, 72% of native freshwater fish species are now threatened or at risk of extinction. 42 Surface water use is under pressure in many parts of the country, including most South Island regions. 43 Nitrate levels have generally worsened at monitored water sites, although phosphorous levels have improved. New Zealand is one of few OECD countries where emissions of major air pollutants has increased in recent years – New Zealand had the second highest level of carbon emissions in the OECD per dollar of GDP in 2017. 44 New Zealand has one of the largest and most comprehensive fishing quota systems in the world to maintain fish stocks. Nonetheless, 17% of fish stocks have been deemed to be overfished and 6% have collapsed. 41Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper New Zealand imposes royalties on the extraction of natural resources. Royalties are used to ensure the public gets a fair share of the profits generated from the use of the country’s resources. Specifically, they often attempt to capture the “rent” – the profit generated by a miner over and above a reasonable economic return. Currently, New Zealand’s royalties are typically a percentage of either the revenue or profit generated by a miner. An alternative approach is a resource rent tax, which attempts to estimate the rent generated by a miner and directly apply a tax to that rent. Charities The not-for-profit sector plays an important role in New Zealand society and our economy. It comprises over 114,000 organisations, with 28,000 charities controlling assets of over $55 billion and generating gross revenue of $18 billion. 45 Charity surpluses (including from business income) totalled $2 billion in 2016/2017 and are exempt from income tax. Tax benefits attached to donations made to not-for-profits cost the Government $274 million in 2016. 46 This cost will continue to increase as the value of donations increases and technology makes it easier for donors to claim their tax credits. The not-for-profit sector is diverse and different tax treatments can apply to different groups within the sector. It includes: •tax charities – whose status generally results in income tax exemption. This category covers organisations registered under the Charities Act 2005 (including businesses owned by charities) and a small number of non-resident charities approved as a tax charity by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue; •donee organisations – whose status gives tax benefits to donors who make monetary donations to them. This category includes charities and organisations with cultural, philanthropic and benevolent purposes; 45 Based on publicly available data held by Inland Revenue, Statistics New Zealand and the Department of Internal Affairs. 46 Based on Inla nd Revenue aggregated tax return data. 47 Lisa Marriott, ‘Justice and the justice system: A comparison of tax evasion and welfare fraud in Australia and New Zealand’, Griffith Law Review, 22.2 (2013), 403-429. 48 Lisa Marriott, ‘The Construction of Crime: The Presumption of Blue-Collar Guilt and White-Collar Innocence’ Social Policy and Society, 16.2 (2017), 237-251. •charitable organisations – organisations that benefit from various concessions under the fringe benefit tax (FBT) rules. This category is a subset of donee organisations; and • other not-for-profit organisations – organisations not otherwise covered above, which do not have the purpose of making a profit for a proprietor, member or shareholder. They can access tax exemptions or other administrative concessions provided for in both the Income Tax Act and the GST Act. Administration A good tax system is one where the tax due is actually collected. New Zealanders should not be able to avoid paying tax through evasion or avoidance arrangements. This is an area where it is difficult to collect reliable data, for obvious reasons. Whether penalties are consistent and appropriate is also relevant. Some research suggests that a higher proportion of people who commit welfare fraud are given prison sentences compared to tax evaders, for comparatively smaller offences. 47 Furthermore, tax debts are more likely to be partially written-off than welfare debts. 48 Given these differences, there is a question about whether the current administration of tax debt and tax evasion is fair. Finally, it is important that tax is not evaded through participation in the ‘informal’ sector – also referred to as the “grey” or “black” economy. These terms refer to activity that is generally unrecorded or operates outside of a set of regulatory or legal institutions. This might include people receiving payments “under the table”, and areas of the economy where regulatory institutions have not yet caught up to real activity. The tax administration system needs to be able to ensure high levels of compliance with tax obligations, in all sectors. The current approach in New Zealand is to not require taxpayers to file 42Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper tax returns unless they have income where tax has not been deducted at the source. That lowers compliance costs for those who do not have this sort of income, but a system where more people have to file and actively declare they have no other income might increase compliance. The administration of the tax system also has fairness implications. Tax that is not collected means that others must pay more. When there are disputes, these disputes should be conducted in a fair manner for all parties. Compliance and administration costs should be kept as low as possible while ensuring compliance with the law. The Inland Revenue Department collects $100 for every $0.85 spent on administering the tax system. That is around the middle of the OECD countries in terms of the costs of collection. However, international comparisons are difficult in this area because revenue authorities have different responsibilities (for example, Inland Revenue operates KiwiSaver but does not collect excise duties). Furthermore, a low cost of collection cannot necessarily be interpreted as a positive thing; it might be that the amount of audit activity should be increased, even if that would increase the cost of collection ratio. The use of technology in the future may open opportunities to reduce compliance costs and increase compliance, through targeted and cost effective audit, and low-cost ways to assess and pay tax. 43Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper •What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? •Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new tax es are introduced? 49 ‘Regulatory Impact Statement: Abolition of gift duty’, Inland Revenue Tax Policy (Wellington: Inland Revenue 2010) <http://taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2010-ris-gift-duty/overview> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. Other taxes One question is whether there are any taxes that New Zealand is not currently levying that it should be. Under our system as it is today, New Zealand has limited recourse to other tax bases. In previous reforms, New Zealand has eliminated: •Excess retention tax (for undistributed company profits) •Sales taxes (replaced with GST in 1986) •Land tax • Estate duty •Gift duty •Stamp duty •Cheque duty In addition to removing the taxes above, New Zealand has not (in recent times) had many of the other small taxes that other countries have. If technological or other developments make taxing income or consumption difficult, New Zealand may have to find other tax bases. Taxes that other countries use include stamp duties on land and financial transaction taxes, including taxes on currency transactions (sometimes called Tobin taxes). Stamp duties apply to tax some percentage of the value of a transaction (usually land, but also sometimes securities transactions). New Zealand has not had any material transaction or turnover taxes in recent times. The possibility of additional taxes on the financial sector is sometimes raised. These take the form of either financial transaction taxes (mentioned above), or financial activities taxes. Inheritance tax is outside of the scope of the Terms of Reference for the Group. Without an inheritance tax, it becomes less feasible to implement gift duty. This is because gift duty without an inheritance tax would likely discourage people from providing large gifts until inheritance and as a result, a gift duty would likely not raise much revenue. In the 2009/10 tax year (immediately before gift duty was repealed), New Zealand collected just $1.62m in gift duty revenue. 49 6 Thinking outside the current system 44Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Wealth taxes generally tax the “net wealth” – assets minus liabilities – of taxpayers each year. Internationally, wealth taxes are far less popular in practice than they used to be. Only five major countries imposed wealth taxes in 2017 (Argentina, France, Norway, Spain and Switzerland) compared to twelve countries in 1990, and many of those that do still have wealth taxes are making steps towards removing them. 50 With growing recent concern about income and wealth inequality, there has been a renewed interest in wealth taxes internationally despite the falling use of them in practice. Other countries also use payroll and social security taxes. Payroll taxes are taxes paid by employers, employees or the self-employed, either as a proportion of payroll or as a fixed amount per person. They are similar to social security taxes but they do not provide entitlements to social benefits, whereas social security taxes do. While they are legally and administratively paid by employers, they are generally assumed to be borne by workers whose wages are likely to be lower by the amount of the tax. International tax The New Zealand tax system operates on a broad principle of taxing all income that has a source in New Zealand, as well as taxing all income earned by New Zealand residents, regardless of where that income is earned. This is known as “source taxation” and “residence taxation” respectively. The taxation of non-residents raises significant amounts of revenue. In the 2016 income year, non- resident controlled companies in New Zealand paid nearly $4 billion of company income tax, which is around 36% of the total corporate tax take. 51 This figure does not take into account tax attributable to non-resident ownership of companies in New Zealand that are controlled domestically. In the year to 30 June 2017 non-residents also paid $599 million by way of non-resident withholding tax. 52 The question of who bears the cost of these taxes is particularly important. While these taxes are paid by companies, some 50 OECD, The Role and Design of Net Wealth Taxes in the OECD (Paris: OECD Publishing, 2018) <http://dx.doi. org/10.1787/9789264290303-en> \[available15 March 2018\]. 51 Based on Inland Revenue aggregated tax return data. 52 ‘Financial Statements of the Government of New Zealand for the year ended 30 June 2017: Notes to the Financial Statements: Note 3’, The Treasury (Wellington: The Treasury, 2017) <http://www.treasury.govt.nz/government/ financialstatements/yearend/jun17/27.htm> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. argue that the cost is at least partly – and perhaps mainly – borne by domestic residents through higher prices and lower wages. Base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) The issue of some multinational corporations paying little or no tax anywhere in the world by way of exploiting inconsistencies and mismatches in countries’ domestic tax rules – a practice known as BEPS – is an issue that has received significant comment and concern worldwide. In response to this global concern, the OECD developed a 15-point Action Plan, which was finalised at the end of 2015, recommending a combination of domestic reforms, tax treaty changes, and transparency and administrative measures that would allow countries to strengthen their laws in a consistent manner and work together in combatting BEPS. New Zealand is currently in the process of implementing new measures that will strengthen the existing rules for taxing income from investment into New Zealand. These new measures are contained in the Taxation (Neutralising Base Erosion and Profit Shifting) Bill, which was introduced into Parliament on 6 December 2017. The Terms of Reference for the Group state that the technical aspects of New Zealand’s BEPS agenda are not our focus. The digital economy The BEPS Action Plan is largely focussed on steps needed to repair and reinforce existing international tax norms. One of these norms is the principle that income should generally be taxed in the place where the activities or assets giving rise to that value occur or are located. Applying this principle, non-residents who sell goods or services to residents without having any physical presence in the resident country are not generally subject to income tax. 45Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper “The digital economy” is a phrase often used to refer to internet-based platforms that can serve customers anywhere. Others prefer the term “digitising economy” to reflect the fact that there is not a separate digital sector of the economy and that more and more activity in all areas of business is moving online. Although the taxation of the digital economy was considered in the development of the BEPS Action Plan, there was no consensus for change and so the Action Plan recommended that further work be conducted on how to address the tax challenges posed by the digital economy. Since the release of the Action Plan, concern about the application of the current international tax framework to the digital economy has increased. Internet-based companies can trade with customers over the internet without having the physical presence (a permanent establishment) in the customer’s country necessary for income tax to be charged under the existing framework. This allows them to derive significant income from a country without being liable for income tax there. In addition, the internet-based company may derive some of its value from data or content provided by consumers in a country, but this value is also not currently able to be taxed by that country. Media reports have noted that many of these companies have also managed to minimise residence-based taxation (that is, tax in the company owners’ countries of residence). This issue is becoming increasingly important with the rapid growth of the digital economy. In 2015, the total consumer online shopping market in New Zealand was estimated by Nielsen to be $4.7 billion. 53 Of that, approximately $2.1 billion was spent on purchases from offshore – a growth rate of approximately 13% on the previous year. There is also a significant business-to-business e-commerce market. There is general agreement about the need for a long-term solution for the taxation of income arising in the digital economy. Some countries have also called for an equalisation tax as an interim measure. 53 Nielsen, New Zealand E-Commerce Report 2016 (Nielsen New Zealand, 2016) <http://www.shopnielsen.com/all/what- makes-kiwis-click-new-zealand-e-commerce-report-2016> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 54 The levy reve nue to HPA was $11.8m in the year ended 30 June 2017. Source: ‘Health Promotion Agency Annual Report for the year ended 30 June 2017’, Health Promotion Agency (2017) p. 54, <https://www.hpa.org.nz/sites/default/files/HPA%20 Annual%20Report%202017\_web.pdf> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. An equalisation tax is a flat tax on gross payments by a country’s own residents to non-resident internet companies that are not subject to income tax in the payer’s country. For example, an equalisation tax of 5% would require an offshore internet company to pay $5 of tax for every $100 it received from New Zealand customers for certain transactions (with no deduction for expenses). Important questions to consider are who is likely to bear the cost of these taxes – domestic residents or foreign companies, and the potential impact of such taxes on New Zealand companies trading offshore. The OECD is considering the issue and will provide a draft report to the G20 in April 2018. However, there is still significant disagreement internationally over whether such equalisation taxes are desirable, and to what they should apply. Hypothecating tax revenue Under the current public finance system, New Zealand seldom dedicates particular tax revenues to particular spending objectives (sometimes called “hypothecation”). There are exceptions. The Health Promotion Agency (HPA) levy funds the HPA (along with additional funding from the Government). This is a small levy on produced and imported alcohol (separate and additional to excise tax). 54 ACC levies may be regarded in some ways as a “hypothecated” tax, as the levy directly funds ACC payments. Hypothecation can ensure that the public understand and support the need for the tax (if they understand and support the need for the spending it funds). But there are some downsides to hypothecation. The government spending may be justified regardless of how much money is raised by the tax – hypothecation might limit worthy spending in the area if the tax revenue falls short. At the same time the level of spending in other areas might be more worthy than the hypothecated area – hypothecation might limit worthy spending in other areas if the tax can only fund spending in one particular area. 46Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper •How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? • Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that e xcludes the family home)?

In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? • Should the tax system e xclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue? In its Terms of Reference, the Government asked the Group to look at some specific areas: • whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system; •whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment; and • what role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. The Group will also consider whether New Zealand should remove GST from any particular goods. This chapter sets out some information on these areas but first discusses housing affordability, on the basis that it has been argued that our current tax rules (and in particular the lack of tax on rental property gains) may have contributed to unaffordable housing. 7 Specific challenges 47Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Housing affordability House prices are high relative to costs of living, income, and rents in many parts of New Zealand. They are particularly high in growing cities such as Auckland, Hamilton, Tauranga and Queenstown. The ‘median multiple’ (the median house price to median income ratio) is commonly used to measure housing affordability, with ratios above 3 representing unaffordable housing markets. In 2017, median multiples stood at 8.8 in Auckland, 5.5 in Wellington and 5.4 in Christchurch, with the highest being 8.9 in Tauranga. 55 Increases in house prices could be a possible cause of the observed increase in wealth inequality in developed economies. In New Zealand, although there has been little sustained change in household income equality before housing costs over the past decade, household incomes after housing costs have become much more dispersed, with greater inequality since the mid-2000s. 56 High house prices and rents also lead to increases in overcrowding and homelessness, and impose heavy costs on society. There are many causes of housing unaffordability, which have been documented in previous reports and reviews. 57 Of particular interest to us, however, is the impact of the tax system on the housing market. Rental property investments are taxed on the ‘net rental income stream’ (that is, rent received minus expenses such as rates, insurance and maintenance) but any capital gains (including both the inflation component and any real increases in value) on the rental property are normally untaxed. Rates paid to local authorities are also due on both rental and owner-occupied housing. Any capital gains on non-owner-occupied properties that are bought and sold within two years are currently taxable under the bright-line test. 58 55 ‘14 th Annual Demographia International Housing Affordability Survey: 2018’, Demographia (2018) <http://www.demographia. com/dhi.pdf> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 56 Perry (2017). 57 See, for example, the New Zealand Productivity Commission’s 2011 report on Housing Affordability: <https://www. productivity.govt.nz/inquiry-content/1509?stage=2> \[accessed 2 March 2018\]. 58 The Government has introduced legislation to increase the bright-line period to five years. Land affected by changes to zoning, consents, or other specified changes may be taxed on sale, if the sale is within 10 years of acquisition, and at least 20% of the gain on disposal arises from the change (subject to an exclusion for residential land). If at least 20% of the gain is attributable to the change, the whole gain on sale is taxable. However, the taxable amount is reduced by 10% for each year the taxpayer has owned the land. Land disposals may be taxed if an undertaking or scheme involving more than minor development or division was commenced within 10 years of the land being acquired. Land disposals may also be taxed if none of the other land provisions apply, and there has been an undertaking or scheme of division or development involving significant expenditure on specified works (subject to a number of exclusions). In addition, if someone is a dealer in property, or it is their purpose or intention to sell the property for a profit, their gains are taxed as ordinary income. Enforcement of these rules can be difficult, given the fact-specific and subjective nature of the tests. Taking all of this into account, real property held for more than two years (soon to be five) is undertaxed relative to other investments when there are capital gains. The Government has signalled its intention to extend the existing bright-line test from two years to five years and introduce a policy of ‘loss ring- fencing’. These measures are still being finalised but are intended to make the tax system fairer. The Government intends these measures to improve housing affordability for purchasers and reduce demand from speculators. Under a loss ring-fencing policy, a property investor will no longer be able to use tax losses on rental properties to offset their tax on other income. 48Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Capital gains tax A capital gains tax taxes the increase in the value of a capital asset like property or company shares. While New Zealand does not have a general CGT it does tax certain categories of capital gains. These include certain land transactions described above, shares that are regularly bought and sold, and gains on financial instruments. Gains on the sale of owner-occupied residential property and long-term investments in rental properties are not taxed. Gains attributed to farmland are not taxed when farms are sold, nor is the increase in value of a business when sold, nor are gains on most shares. The latter includes shares held as investments as well as shares in private companies. The costs and benefits of capital gains taxes have been discussed at length in previous tax reviews (for example, the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group) 59 . Capital assets are owned disproportionately by higher income households and so introducing a capital gains tax would make the tax system more progressive. A capital gains tax would allow for more government spending, or cutting of other taxes. Not having a CGT favours investment in assets that are expected to appreciate over assets that earn taxable income. These favoured assets are primarily land and shares. A CGT that is due on “realisation” (when an asset is sold) raises some practical issues. It can create a degree of “lock-in”, whereby a taxpayer defers selling an asset to defer the tax. There is also potential for double taxation of shares if income is taxed at the company level and increases the share price, and the share price gain is also taxed. Another significant issue is the treatment of capital losses. Most countries limit capital losses to be offset only against capital gains. This is generally to prevent revenue loss from taxpayers accelerating their capital losses and deferring their capital gains. However, it may be viewed as unfair if a person with a real capital loss is not allowed to deduct it. 59 Page 49: <https://www.victoria.ac.nz/sacl/centres-and-institutes/cagtr/pdf/tax-report-website.pdf> 60 Pages 50-51. More technical questions on a CGT are attached as an appendix to this paper and we invite submissions on these. We note that the Terms of Reference specifically exclude any changes to owner-occupied housing and the land underneath it, so any consideration of CGT will proceed on that basis. One other issue we encourage submitters to engage with is the possible impacts a CGT could have on Māori assets. We are also interested in suggestions from Māori on an appropriate framework to use when exploring the impacts of a CGT on Māori. Land tax A land tax imposes an annual tax liability on landowners, calculated by reference to the value of land owned by them. A land tax was considered in some detail by the 2010 Victoria University Tax Working Group. 60 A universal land tax is efficient because land is in fixed supply. In other words, no more or less land can be created or directed to particular uses, so long as the tax applies to all land. This conclusion needs to be softened if the land tax excludes some forms of land (as the Terms of Reference to the 2018 Tax Working Group do with respect to owner-occupied land). Because of that exclusion a land tax would introduce a preference in favour of land used for owner-occupied housing over other uses (including rental housing unless land used for rental housing were also exempt). A land tax is generally regarded as having low administration and compliance costs given the existence of local authority land valuation systems for imposing rates. A land tax taxes one asset type and accordingly impacts those people and organisations holding their capital in that form. Annual payment of land tax raises cash flow issues for some landowners with lower income levels. 49Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper As with the capital gains tax discussion, the Tax Working Group encourages submissions on what the appropriate treatment of Māori land might be when it is a taonga asset. Again we note that the current Terms of Reference exclude any changes to the taxation of the family home, and so the Group will consider a land tax on that basis. Progressive company tax New Zealand’s company tax rate is 28% with no lower tax rates for smaller firms. The Terms of Reference direct the Group to examine the impact of a lower tax rate for small companies. This would provide more support for smaller firms. Some other countries do provide lower tax rates for small firms. Currently, Australia has a small business company tax rate that is lower than the usual company rate. For the 2017-18 income year, the small business company tax rate is 27.5%, applying to businesses with revenue less than $25 million. The usual company tax rate is 30%, although the Australian Government has announced that it intends to lower the usual company rate so that eventually the rates are the same. We would be interested in views on how such a differential tax regime might interact with our imputation system (and any proposed CGT on the sale of private company shares) and what consequential changes would be needed to counteract tax sheltering arrangements (where income is moved from higher rate activities into lower rate private companies). The tax system and positive environmental outcomes Environmental taxes are charges levied on tax bases that have a proven, specific negative impact on the environment. They include both charges on pollution (for example, a landfill waste levy) and charges on resource use (for example, a water 61 OECD, Working Party No. 2 on Tax Policy Analysis and Tax Statistics – OECD Tax Policy Developments (2016) CTPA/CFA/ WP2(2016)1. consumption charge when the supply of clean water is limited). They sit alongside regulation, incentive programmes and trading schemes (such as our emissions trading scheme) as policy options for government to address environmental challenges. New Zealand collects relatively little revenue from environmental taxes as a percentage of GDP compared to other OECD countries, as shown in Figure 22. Environmental taxes amount to approximately 4.2% of total tax revenue, which is equivalent to 1.3% of GDP. Environmental taxes that generate more revenue are not necessarily better taxes. The OECD notes that many environmental taxes in OECD countries are poorly designed and targeted. 61 The definition of “environmental” is also broad: as an example, in some cases the tax revenue on petrol excise taxes is ring-fenced to be used to build roads. Nevertheless petrol taxes are included in the list of environmental taxes because they are environmentally related. Environmental taxes can be a powerful tool to efficiently reduce pollution and encourage better use of natural resources. Other tools to achieve these outcomes include government regulation (fines and penalties under industry specific regimes) and limiting supply through quota systems. If an environmental tax is set to reflect the cost of pollution to society (that is, the externality), the price of the activity will increase to reflect its true cost. This encourages polluters to do less of the polluting activity and to switch to lower polluting alternatives. It also creates incentives for producers to find innovative ways of lowering pollution. New Zealand offers some tax incentives to promote activities that align with environmental objectives. However, tax incentives can have disadvantages relative to the levying of an environmental tax. They can involve ‘picking winners’, which may prejudice other good alternatives. They are also fiscally costly. 50Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Figure 22: Environmental tax revenue across OECD and other countries (2013) 0% 2% 4% 6% 8% 10% 12% 14% 16% 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 3.0% 3.5% 4.0% 4.5% Denm ark Tu rkey Slovenia Ita ly Netherlands Finland Austria Isr ae l Czech Republic Gr ee ce Hungary Korea Es to nia Mauritius Sweden United Kingdom South Africa Costa Rica Ireland Luxembourg Portugal Norway A us t ra lia Germany Belgium Dominican Republic Honduras Iceland France Poland Spain Switzerland Slovak Republic Uruguay OECD average Japan China New Zealand Nicaragua Rwanda Tunisia Canada Chile Argentina Senegal Colom bia I nd ia Guatemala Cameroon United States Bra zil Peru Malaysia Philippines Côte d'Ivoire Me xico Tax revenue, % of GDP (left axis)Tax revenue, % of total tax revenue (right axis) Source: OECD Existing tax incentives include accelerated deductions of forestry capital costs (for example, planting or tending costs), accelerated deductions for some types of environmental expenditures, and the exemption of electric vehicles (EVs) from road user charges until EVs make up 2% of the national fleet. There is also the question of whether there are areas of our income tax system that unintentionally favour environmentally-damaging activities. For example, FBT is not charged on (“on-premises”) employer-provided car parks. This will tend to encourage employers to provide car parking space instead of other compensation that would be taxed. GST exemptions for particular goods Successive governments have maintained (and even widened) the broad base of New Zealand’s GST rather than trying to increase progressivity by introducing lower rates on goods and services that low-income people disproportionately consume. However, removing GST from some goods and services is often discussed in public debate as a way to ensure that people can afford more of these goods and services. 51Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Capital gains tax (CGT): A tax on the increase in the capital value of an asset. Capital income: Income that is a return on invested capital (that is, income from owning something rather than from personal effort) such as interest, dividends, rental income and the return on capital invested in a business. Deadweight cost: A technical name for the efficiency cost of taxation. Deduction: An amount subtracted from taxable income as an allowable expense Effective tax rate: The rate at which real, pre-tax profits or income is taxed Efficiency cost of taxation: Cost to society due to individuals, households, and firms making consumption and production choices in order to pay less tax, in the case where the tax is not intended to change behaviour deliberately (i.e. is not a Pigouvian tax). Estate duty: A tax on a person’s assets at the date of their death. Environmental tax: A charge levied on a tax base that has a proven, specific, negative impact on the environment. Excise tax: A tax on the sale of a specific good. Excise taxes are indirect taxes, which means that the tax is levied on the producer of the good rather than the consumer, and the amount of the tax is generally included in the price charged for the good. Externalities: A consequence of an economic activity or transaction experienced by unrelated third parties Fair dividend rate: Method of taxing foreign shares. Income is deemed to be 5% of the opening market value of shares, and tax is paid on this amount. Fringe benefit tax: A tax on most non-cash benefits provided by employers to employees Fuel excise duty (FED): A charge on petrol purchased for road use. Currently payable at 59.524 cents per litre. Gig economy: The trend in workers having temporary jobs, less regularity in their working conditions and operating as independent contractors, in part due to technological developments. Gift duty: A tax imposed on a transfer of property without full payment for the property. Goods and services tax (GST): A broad-based value-added tax on consumption in New Zealand. Gross domestic product (GDP): The total value of goods and services produced in the economy in a year. Horizontal equity: The principle that people with similar income and assets should pay the same amount in taxes. Imputation regime: Regime that integrates company tax with personal income tax for residents, ensuring that residents are not double-taxed on their income from companies. Labour income: Income from personal effort, including salaries and wages (as well as the returns from the owner of a closely held business working in that business). Glossary 52Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Land tax: A tax liability on an owner of land, usually calculated as a proportion of the unimproved value of the land. Living standards framework: An approach developed by the Treasury, based on four capitals (human, social, natural, and financial and physical), for analysing living standards and intergenerational wellbeing. 62 Marginal effective tax rate (METR): A theoretical measure of the tax rate on real, pre-tax income for investments that only just make economic sense. Marginal tax rate: The rate of tax applied to the next dollar of income earnt. Nominal return: A nominal return on an asset is the return before accounting for the effect of inflation. Payroll taxes: Taxes paid by employers, employees or the self-employed, either as a proportion of payroll or as a fixed amount per person, and that do not provide entitlements to social benefits. Permanent establishment (PE): A physical presence in a country that gives rise to a tax liability. Pigouvian tax: A tax designed to correct the problem of externalities, by altering the price of an activity so that effects on third parties are taken into account by market participants. Portfolio investment entity (PIE): A PIE is a form of collective investment vehicle where investors combine resources to make investments. PIEs pay tax on investment income based on the prescribed investor rates of their individual investors, rather than at the entity’s tax rate. The prescribed investor rate is a final rate and is capped at the company tax rate (28%). There is no additional layer of tax when a PIE distributes money to investors, so saving in a PIE can provide a small tax break compared to saving directly by an individual. Real return: This is the nominal return adjusted for inflation. It is a closer estimation of economic income compared to the nominal return because it preserves the value of capital over time. 62 More information can be found here: <http://www.treasury.govt.nz/abouttreasury/higherlivingstandards/> Risk-free return: This is the expected rate of return that a completely risk-free investment generates. The difference between the risk-free return and the expected return on a risky investment is sometimes called a risk premium. Road user charges: A charge for vehicles powered by fuels other than petrol – primarily diesel vehicles. Road user charges very by vehicle weight, reflecting the greater level of road wear caused by heavier vehicles. Sharing economy: Consumers using online platforms to share assets (usually in return for payment) they are not currently using, such as their house or car. Social security contributions: Compulsory payments to government that provide an entitlement to receive a future benefit. Tax incidence: A concept that looks at who ultimately bears the costs of a tax. Tax sheltering: Methods of reducing taxable income for the purpose of minimising tax. Tax wedge: Total taxes (income taxes, payroll taxes, plus employer and employee social security contributions), as a percentage of gross (i.e. pre-tax) wages. Te ao Māori: The Māori world. Tobin tax: An excise tax on currency transactions. Transfers; transfer payment: Government spending paid in cash rather than in kind, including benefits and Working for Families tax credits. Value-added tax (VAT): A VAT is a type of transaction-based consumption tax that is levied at each stage where value is added in the production process and at the point of sale. New Zealand’s GST is a form of VAT. Vertical equity: The principle that those with higher income or assets should pay higher amounts of tax. Wealth tax: A tax on the “net wealth” – assets minus liabilities – of taxpayers each year. 53Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper The Tax Working Group has been established by the Government in order to examine further improvements in the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. The New Zealand tax system has been justifiably commended internationally for being a simple and efficient system. The Government’s starting position is that the guiding principle for the New Zealand tax system – namely, that tax should operate neutrally and as much in the background as possible – is sound. The Working Group will consider what improvements to this framework could improve the structure, fairness and balance of the tax system. In particular, the Working Group will consider the impact on the tax system of the likely economic environment over the next decade. The Government has the following objectives for the tax system: • A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected • A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy • A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP • A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability • A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families, and • An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. The Working Group should report to the Government on: • Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth • Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy • Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient, and • Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals. In examining the points above, the Working Group should consider in particular the following: • The economic environment that will apply over the next 5-10 years, taking into account demographic change, and the impact of changes in technology and employment practices, and how these are driving different business models • Whether a system of taxing capital gains or land (not applying to the family home or the land under it), or other housing tax measures, would improve the tax system • Whether a progressive company tax (with a lower rate for small companies) would improve the tax system and the business environment, and • What role the taxation system can play in delivering positive environmental and ecological outcomes, especially over the longer term. Appendix 1 – Tax Working Group – Terms of Reference 54Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper In considering the matters above, the Working Group should have due regard to the overall structure of the tax system to ensure it is fair, balanced and efficient, as well as simple for taxpayers to understand and comply with their tax obligations. The following are outside the scope of the Working Group’s review: • Increasing any income tax rate or the rate of GST • Inheritance tax • Any other changes that would apply to the taxation of the family home or the land under it, and • The adequacy of the personal tax system and its interaction with the transfer system (this will be considered as part of a separate review of Working for Families). In addition, the focus of the Working Group should not be on more technical matters already under review as part of the Tax Policy Work Programme, including: • International tax reform under the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting agenda, and • Policy changes as part of Inland Revenue’s Business Transformation programme. The Working Group will be able to recommend further reviews be undertaken on specific issues which the group considers it has not been able to explore sufficiently, or that were excluded from its terms of reference but which could benefit from being considered in the context of its recommendations. The Working Group’s membership will include individual(s) with expertise in Māori community and business environments. The Working Group will be supported by a secretariat of officials from Treasury and Inland Revenue, and it will be able to seek independent advice and analysis on any matter within the scope of its Terms of Reference. The Working Group will have an independent advisor to analyse the various sources of advice received by the Working Group and help to analyse and distil the information to assist the Working Group’s deliberations. The Working Group will be expected to engage with the public in developing its recommendations. The Working Group should have its first meeting no later than February 2018, issue an interim report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than September 2018, and issue a final report to the Minister of Finance and Minister of Revenue no later than February 2019. These dates may be varied with the consent of the Minister of Finance. 55Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper If you think the Group should design a capital gains tax (CGT) for Government consideration, we need your feedback now on a number of detailed design issues: • Should the CGT be a separate tax or part of the income tax? Most countries tax capital gains as part of the income tax. • Should capital gains be taxed on an accrual basis or only when realised (i.e. only when the asset is sold)? Most countries tax on a realisation basis. How should matrimonial property settlements and disposal of assets on death be treated? • What assets should be covered given that the terms of reference exclude any tax on the family home? Should it include just rental properties, shares, collectibles, private assets such as cars? • Should assets held by KiwiSaver and other savings schemes be taxed? • Should assets held offshore be subject to tax? • How would a capital gains tax integrate with current tax laws, such as when land sales are already taxable, our company imputation system and our CFC/FDR rules? • When should non-residents be subject to tax? • Should capital losses be ring-fenced to be offset only against capital gains income or should they be offset against any income? If capital gains are taxed on a realisation basis tax base maintenance considerations suggest that capital losses should be ring-fenced. • Should there be roll-over relief allowing capital gains re-invested in similar assets to be treated as unrealised? If so, when should roll-over relief apply? For example, should a farmer selling a farm and buying a new farm be taxed on the increase in value of the old farm? • How should death, emigration and immigration be handled? • How should gifts and gambling winnings be taxed? • What should the rate of tax on tax on capital gains be – the normal income tax rates, or some other rate(s)? • Should any allowance be given for inflation in calculating capital gains? • Should there be a de minimis rule? • What administrative implications would there be from a capital gains tax? • What rules should govern the transition into a capital gains tax? The options seem to be cost of the assets (retrospective taxation of past accrued gains), valuation at date of introduction or only assets acquired post introduction (the Australian rule). • How should family trusts be integrated into the system? Appendix 2 – Design issues with a capital gains tax 56Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Chapter 2: The future environment What do you see as the main risks, challenges, and opportunities for the tax system over the medium- to long-term? Which of these are most important? How should the tax system change in response to the risks, challenges, and opportunities you have identified? How could tikanga Māori (in particular manaakitanga, whanaungatanga, and kaitiakitanga) help create a more future-focussed tax system? Chapter 3: Purposes and principles of a good tax system Principles for assessment What principles would you use to assess the performance of the tax system? Defining ‘fairness’ How would you define ‘fairness’ in the context of the tax system? What would a fair tax system look like? Chapter 4: The current New Zealand tax system Frameworks New Zealand’s ‘broad-based, low-rate’ system, with few exemptions for GST and income tax, has been in place for over thirty years. Looking to the future, is it still the best approach for New Zealand? If not, what approach should replace it? Taxes and behaviour Should there be a greater role in the tax system for taxes that intentionally modify behaviour? If so, which behaviours and/or what type of taxes? Retirement savings Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Chapter 5: The results of the current tax system Fairness and balance Does the tax system strike the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy? If it does not, what would need to change to achieve a better balance? Appendix 3 – Questions for submitters 57Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper Tax and business Does the tax system do enough to minimise costs on business? Does the tax system do enough to maintain natural capital? Are there types of businesses benefiting from low effective tax rates because of excessive deductions, timing of deductions or non-taxation of certain types of income? Chapter 6: Thinking outside the current system What are the main inconsistencies in the current tax system? Which of these inconsistencies are most important to address? Is there a case to consider the introduction of any new taxes that are not currently levied? Should any taxes be reduced if new taxes are introduced? Chapter 7: Specific challenges Housing affordability How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend? Capital gains tax Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Land tax Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have? Environmental taxation What are the main opportunities for effective environmental taxation? Progressive company tax Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax? GST exemptions for particular goods Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue?

Taxes allow the Government to fund the vital public services – such as healthcare, education, justice, expenditure on healthy ecosystems, and defence – that underpin our living standards. The calculation and payment of tax also imposes obligations on New Zealanders and the tax system affects different groups of people in different ways. As a consequence, tax is not just for ‘experts’ – all New Zealanders have a stake in the design of our tax system. About the Tax Working Group The Government has established the Tax Working Group (the Group) to examine further improvements to the structure, fairness, and balance of the tax system. The Group has also been directed to apply a particular focus on the future to its work, with a view to exploring the major challenges, risks, and opportunities facing the tax system over the next decade and beyond. The Group is chaired by Hon Sir Michael Cullen and is supported by a secretariat of officials from the Treasury and Inland Revenue. The Chair has also appointed an independent advisor to assist the Group with its deliberations and understanding of the issues. We want to hear your views This summary paper and the accompanying Submissions Background Paper call for public submissions on a range of issues that the Group considers important to its work. Public submissions will inform the Group’s consideration of proposals for improving the tax system. Submitters may submit on other issues, but should be aware of the exclusions in the Group’s Terms of Reference. The Terms of Reference are published on the Group’s website: https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz To help submitters, the Submissions Background Paper also provides information and context on New Zealand’s current tax system and tax concepts. The Group will provide an interim report on these proposals to the Ministers of Finance and Revenue in September 2018. There will be further opportunities for public comment following the report’s publication. In the spirit of openness and inclusion, the Group would now like to encourage all New Zealanders to share their own views about what is working – and what is not – in the current tax system. Summary for Submitters 2Future of Tax Summary for Submitters How to make a submission Submissions should include a brief summary of major points and recommendations. They should also indicate whether it would be acceptable for the Group and the secretariat to contact those making the submission to discuss the points raised, if required. Submissions should be made by 30 April 2018 and can be emailed to submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz or submitted online at https://taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Alternatively, submissions may be addressed to: Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 Wellington 6140 New Zealand Submissions will be proactively released and only redacted or withheld on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or any other reason under the Official Information Act. Those making a submission who consider that there is any part of it that should properly be withheld under the Act should clearly indicate this. In addition to seeking written submissions, the Group intends to discuss the issues raised in this paper and the Submissions Background Paper with key interested parties. Challenges, risks, and opportunities Tax systems have always had to evolve alongside changing practices in business, technology, and society. However, technology today – particularly in the area of digital communications – is having a radical impact on the way businesses operate, both within and across national borders. Within this context, the Group has identified eight broad challenges, risks, and opportunities that will affect the tax system over the coming decade and beyond: • changing demographics, particularly the aging population and the fiscal pressures that will bring; • te ao Māori and the role of the Māori economy in lifting New Zealand’s overall living standards; • the changing nature of work; • technological change and the different business models that will bring; • falling company tax rates around the world; • environmental challenges, including climate change and loss of ecosystem services and species; • growing concern about inequality; and • the impacts of globalisation and changes in its patterns. Our tax system will need to be sufficiently robust to deal with these challenges, and sufficiently nimble to take advantage of the opportunities. There will also be other shocks and surprises that we have not considered and cannot foresee. The Group would therefore like to hear your views on how these challenges and opportunities might affect the tax system, and, equally importantly, whether you consider there are any other key issues that policymakers will need to prepare for. The purposes and principles of a good tax system Even as the tax system evolves in response to these risks and opportunities, it will still need to fulfil the central purpose of tax policy: to provide sufficient revenue to the Government to fund the provision of public goods, services, and transfers. But the design of the tax system will also have broader impacts on the wellbeing of New Zealanders across the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. The Group intends to be mindful of these impacts as it develops recommendations for reform. In recognition of the broad basis of wellbeing, the Treasury uses the Living Standards Framework to incorporate a more comprehensive range of factors into its analysis. The Living Standards Framework identifies four ‘capital stocks’ that are crucial to intergenerational wellbeing: • Financial and physical capital, such as roads, factories, and financial assets. • Human capital, such as skills and knowledge. 3Future of Tax Summary for Submitters • Social capital, such as trust, cultural achievements and community connections. • Natural capital, such as soil and water. The Living Standard Framework encourages us to consider how policy change is likely to impact each of the four capitals, and broadens our assessment beyond strictly economic considerations. The established criteria that have been used in past tax reviews (both domestically and overseas) are also useful when considering the costs and benefits of various reforms: • Efficiency: minimise impediments to economic growth and avoid distortions (biases) to the use of resources. • Equity and fairness: achieve fairness including through ‘horizontal equity’ (the same treatment for people in the same circumstances) and ‘vertical equity’ (higher tax obligations on those with greater economic capacity to pay). Procedural fairness is also important for a tax system. • Revenue integrity: minimise opportunities for tax avoidance and arbitrage. • Fiscal adequacy: raise sufficient revenue for the Government’s requirements. • Compliance and administration costs: minimise the costs of compliance and administration, and give taxpayers as much certainty as possible. • Coherence: ensure that individual reform options make sense in the context of the entire tax system. As you read this document, the Group would encourage you to consider which principles and frameworks are most important to you in evaluating the tax system, and to test your own ideas and proposals against them. 1 This figure excludes local government rates, which are sometimes included in measures of total tax revenue for ease of comparison with other OECD countries. The design of the current tax system New Zealand currently has a ‘broad-based, low-rate’ tax system. The Government raises about 90% of its tax revenue from three tax bases 1 : • Individual income tax • Goods and services tax (GST) • Company income tax. There are very few exemptions to these three taxes (which is why our tax system is described as ‘broad-based’). The benefit of having a broad base is that it allows the Government to raise substantial revenue with relatively low rates of taxation. Overall, the current level of tax revenue, including local government rates, is equivalent to 32% of gross domestic product (GDP), which is slightly below the OECD average of 34% of GDP. New Zealand’s tax system is distinct in other ways. Unlike many other countries, New Zealand does not generally use the tax system to deliberately modify behaviour – with the notable exceptions of alcohol and tobacco excise taxes, which are intended to discourage drinking and smoking. New Zealand’s approach to the taxation of retirement savings is also distinct. The tax system does not offer large concessions for retirement savings; retirement savings contributions are taxed when they are made and as investment income is earned, rather than when the savings are drawn down in retirement. The Group’s work provides an opportunity to examine whether a broad-based, low rate system remains fit-for-purpose, and whether there is a case to depart from the internationally distinctive approaches to behavioural taxes and retirement savings. It is also an opportunity to explore whether there is a case to broaden the base further, for example with new taxes such as a comprehensive capital gains tax (excluding the family home). 4Future of Tax Summary for Submitters The results of the current tax system Revenue outcomes New Zealand’s broad-based, low-rate system succeeds at raising relatively high amounts of revenue with relatively low rates. Compared with other OECD countries: • New Zealand has one of the lowest top personal tax rates, but the proportion of income tax to GDP is high. • New Zealand’s company tax rate is relatively high, and the proportion of company tax revenue to GDP is high. • New Zealand’s GST rate is relatively low, but the proportion of GST revenue to GDP is high. New Zealand’s GST is one of the simplest and most comprehensive in the world. There are two main exemptions – for financial services, and for low- value imported goods. 2 These exemptions reflect past judgements that it would be too administratively complex to include financial services and low-value imported goods in the tax. Distributional outcomes Higher-income households play an important role in funding the Government. According to established income measures, the share of all income tax paid increases as household income increases. Households in the top income decile (that is, the 10% of households with the highest incomes) pay around 35% of all income tax, whereas households in the lowest five income deciles (that is, 50% of households) collectively pay less than 20% of all income tax. The tax and transfer system (transfers are payments like Jobseeker Support and New Zealand Superannuation) reduces income inequality, although by less than most of our comparator countries. New Zealand’s tax and transfer system provides a similar reduction in measured income inequality to the Canadian system, but a smaller reduction than Australia or the OECD average. 2 Long-term residential accommodation is also not subject to GST, but applying GST to rent would raise various practical and fairness issues. Income inequality in New Zealand rose rapidly in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, but has been broadly stable in New Zealand since then. Information about wealth is less comprehensive than for income, but the information we do have indicates that wealth is distributed much less equally than income. Savings There is some debate about the influence of our tax settings on the rate and composition of saving in New Zealand. In a broad-based, low-rate tax system, there should ideally be no difference in marginal effective tax rates between different types of investments. Relative to other countries, New Zealand’s marginal effective tax rates are quite uniform, but it may be possible to achieve more consistency in the treatment of different types of investments. Overall outcomes The Group is keen to hear public views on the overall performance of the tax system, and has a particular interest in assessments of the fairness and balance of our tax settings. Thinking outside the current system New Zealand has reduced its use of other tax bases under the broad-based, low-rate tax system. Previous reforms have eliminated the sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty and cheque duty. New Zealand also does not levy financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes, or a general capital gains tax. The Group will examine whether there is a case to introduce any additional taxes, particularly in light of growing international debate about income and wealth inequality. 5Future of Tax Summary for Submitters The Group also acknowledges public concerns about the tax practices of some multinational corporations, which exploit inconsistencies and mismatches in domestic tax rules in order pay little or no tax anywhere in the world. In this regard, New Zealand is currently implementing a suite of measures – developed in cooperation with other OECD countries – that will further strengthen the rules for taxing income from investment in New Zealand. But we also need to consider the taxation of income from the digital economy. Internet-based firms can trade with customers over the internet without having a physical presence in the customer’s country that is necessary for income tax to be charged under present rules. This issue is becoming increasingly important as the digital economy accounts for a greater proportion of business activity. The Group invites comment on what the public sees as the most significant inconsistencies in the current tax system, and which of these should be addressed most urgently. Specific challenges In addition to the issues discussed above, the Government has directed the Group to advise on a number of specific challenges: • How would a capital gains tax (excluding the family home) or a land tax (excluding the land under the family home) affect housing affordability, and would these taxes improve the current system for capital income taxation? Relevant considerations will include: the impacts of these taxes on property-owners and renters; the ease of administering these taxes; the interaction of these taxes with the rest of the tax system; the extent to which the tax will incentivise productive investment as opposed to speculation; and the possibility of allowing for reductions in other taxes as a result of introducing them. • Is there a case to introduce a progressive company tax (i.e. lower company tax rates for smaller businesses) in order to support small business? • Is there a case to make greater use of environmental taxation to improve environmental outcomes and diversify the tax base? • Could the Government assist low-income people by introducing GST exemptions for certain goods and services? The Group seeks public views on all of these matters. It also invites submissions on the question of which taxes should be lowered if new sources of tax revenue can be found (keeping in mind the guidance in the Terms of Reference for tax revenue to remain at approximately 30% of GDP). Concluding thoughts New Zealand’s tax system has many strengths, but it cannot stand still. We are living in an era of rapid technological change, rising economic uncertainty, and mounting environmental challenges. Our tax system must be robust to these challenges, even as it takes advantage of the administrative and other opportunities afforded by innovation. However, it is important that we maintain the trust and confidence of all New Zealanders in the integrity of the tax system. In a democracy such as ours, the ability of the Government to raise revenue rests ultimately on the consent and acceptance of all New Zealanders. In order to maintain this acceptance, and fulfil the trust of New Zealanders, we must ensure that the tax system is fair, balanced, and administered well. This is the goal the Group is working towards. Your submissions will help us achieve it.

Unclaimed Money Act 1971
========================

Archived legislative commentary on the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 from PIB vol 65 Feb 1972.

This commentary item was published in _Public Information Bulletin_ Volume 65, February 1972

[More information about _Public Information Bulletins_](/about/about-our-publications)
.

The Unclaimed Money Act 1971 revises and consolidates the Unclaimed Moneys Act 1908 and its Amendments. The new Act, which applies from 1 June 1971, is the first comprehensive revision of the law relating to unclaimed money in more than 60 years.

The main features of the new Act are -

### To Whom the Act Applies

It applies mainly to companies, banks, building societies and insurance offices that hold defined classes of unclaimed money. It also has limited application to the following six classes of individuals when they are in possession of clients' or principals' unclaimed balances -

*   Money-lenders
*   Sharebrokers
*   Auctioneers
*   Accountants
*   Real Estate Agents
*   Motor Vehicle Dealers

**These companies and individuals are referred to in the Act as holders.**

### Some May Elect to Use the Facilities of the Act

The individuals specified in the Act can voluntarily elect to take advantage of the full facilities available to companies. Any other individual or organisation also can elect at any time to take advantage of those facilities.

### Some Organisations No Longer Included

The following organisations included in the 1908 Act will no longer be holders unless they elect to become voluntary holders at any time:

*   Local authorities
*   Public bodies
*   Incorporated societies
*   Religious societies
*   Religious, charitable or educational trusts.

### Cessation of Business or Death of an Individual

The Act includes further special facility whereby early payment can be made to the Crown, when a business ceases or an individual dies. The special clearing facility applies to any kind of money held or owed, unclaimed, for 6 months after the cessation or death.

### What is Unclaimed Money

*   The Act relates chiefly to deposit money in trading and savings banks. It includes also trade debts and proceeds of insurance.
*   Company dividends, Co-operative society rebates on store trading, and benefits payable from pension or superannuation funds WILL NO LONGER BECOME unclaimed money unless an election to pay them to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue is made when business ceases or an individual dies.
*   Any holder can elect not to pay in unclaimed money where it does not exceed $20 in respect of any one owner.

### When Does Money Become Unclaimed Money

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| Trading and savings bank deposits | 6 or 25 years, depending on the deposit terms |
| Insurance proceeds | 6 years |
| Trade debts | 6 years |

### Requirements for Holders

Holders are required to -

*   Keep an unclaimed money register in the form prescribed in the Act.
    *   Enter on 1 June the name of the owner of the unclaimed money which has arisen during the 12 months ending on 31 May, and the amount of the money
*   Send a notice to the owner at his last known address, by 30 June.
*   Send a copy of the register entries to the Commissioner by 30 September.
*   Pay to the Commissioner by 31 October any unclaimed money which the owner has still not claimed by 30 September.

### Option when Business Ceases or Individual Dies

*   Pay to the Commissioner the money held or owed, unclaimed, for 6 months after cessation or death.
*   Send the Commissioner details of the payment and of the owner of the money (no register entries are required).

### Commissioner Will Repay Unclaimed Money

*   Any owner who establishes his identity can obtain a repayment of unclaimed money at any time from the Commissioner.
*   Repayments for Post Office Savings Bank deposits which have become unclaimed money are made by the Director-General of the Post Office.

### Payment to Masterton Office

All unclaimed money records are now held in Masterton District Office. It would help us to give you a better service if all payments and enquiries are made direct to that office.

### Sections of the Act

Unclaimed money payable to Commissioner
=======================================

2011 case note - bank cheques and foreign currency drafts which remain unclaimed will be treated as unclaimed money under the Unclaimed Money Act 1971.

Case

Westpac, BNZ & ANZ v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (unclaimed money)

Legislative References

Unclaimed Money Act 1971

### Summary

The Supreme Court has followed the Privy Council decision in _Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd_ and held that unclaimed foreign exchange drafts and bank cheques are to pass to the Commissioner as custodian six years after legal demand may be made for payment to the payee.

### Impact of decision

It is now clear that bank cheques and foreign currency drafts which remain unclaimed will be treated as unclaimed money under the Unclaimed Money Act 1971.

### Facts

The appeal relates to the meaning and effect of s 4(1)(e) of the Unclaimed Money Act 1971 ("UMA"). In the High Court, McKenzie J was satisfied that in respect of bank cheques and foreign currency drafts the issuing banks are holders of unclaimed monies under s 4(1)(e) of the UMA. McKenzie J had held that the decision of the Privy Council in _CIR v Thomas Cook (New Zealand) Ltd_ \[2006\] 2 NZLR 722 (PC) was dispositive of the case. That case concerned the same provision of the UMA and its operation specifically on unredeemed travellers' cheques.

The Court of Appeal also found for the Commissioner, holding as well that they were bound by the _Thomas Cook_ case; that there was no effective difference between travellers' cheques and foreign currency drafts and bank cheques.

The instruments in question are drawn by a bank, issued to a customer, made payable to a person who may or may not be the customer (the payee) and, in the case of foreign currency drafts, cashed by the payee at an overseas bank in that country's currency. In the case of bank cheques, the bank issues a cheque to a customer made payable to a person who may or may not be the customer (the payee) drawn on its own account (having debited the customer's account). A very small minority of drafts and bank cheques are never presented for payment. These, the Commissioner contends, are "unclaimed money".

The years before the Court ranged from 1990 to 2001 for the three banks and the sums in dispute exceed $7 million, plus interest for that period.

### Decision

The Court was concerned that there would have to be compelling reasons to overturn the _Thomas Cook_ case. Pivotal to their finding were arguments on the interpretation of s 4(1)(e) of the UMA:

*   **4 Unclaimed money**  
    1\. Subject to this section, unclaimed money shall consist of -  
        ...
    5.  Any other money, of any kind whatsoever, which has been owing by any holder for the period of 6 years immediately following the date on which the money has become payable by the holder: ...

In the _Thomas Cook_ case, both the High Court and the Court of Appeal had held that cheques could not be called "unclaimed" until there was a legal liability to pay. This did not occur until the cheque was presented. This finding was based upon an interpretation of certain provisions in the Bills of Exchange Act.

Nonetheless the Court of Appeal also held that after a cheque becomes stale, the requirement for presentment was dispensed with and Thomas Cook became liable for payment. In the Privy Council, such reasoning was dismissed and the term "payable" was held to mean no more than legally due if demanded.

In the present matter, the parties being in agreement that the banks are "holders" under the UMA, argument centred on the meaning of the words "payable" and "owing". The appellants argued that a consistent theme in previous iterations of the UMA led to an interpretation of "a present obligation to pay". The Commissioner supported the _Thomas Cook_ interpretation.

In order to resolve the conflicting, tenable, views the Court consulted Hansard and had regard to the purpose of the legislation whereby money paid for but not collected was never intended to be revenue for the holder. Against that, the Court considered earlier legislative definitions prior to consolidation into the 1971 Act, noting also that the UMA also had amending properties. So noting, the Court dismissed interpretations urged by the appellants based upon earlier definitions and banking law \[46\]:

*   In these circumstances, the purpose of the 1971 Act, as summarised above, is a more reliable aid to the meaning of "payable" than comparisons with its use in the earlier statutes. To adopt the technical rules of when liability arises, under which there would in all cases have to be a present obligation to pay, would defeat that purpose. And to read s 4(1)(e) as having effect in its application to money payable under foreign currency drafts and bank cheques only if demand is made for the dormant moneys would introduce a self-defeating element to the meaning of the definition that Parliament would not have contemplated.

The Court addressed certain concerns of the appellants as to the scope of such a finding by noting that this interpretation did not extend to conditional liabilities.

The Court emphasised at \[49\] that the decision was consistent with the maintenance of stability in the law:

*   Had we favoured the appellants' approach to this difficult question of construction, it would have been necessary to consider whether our preference for that different view was sufficient to justify departure from the meaning which had been adopted by the Privy Council. That would have raised questions concerning, on the one hand, desirability of stability in the law and respect for the principle of _stare decisis_ and, on the other, whether there are cogent reasons for reconsideration of, and departure from, that judgment.

This includes agencies reusing information to improve the quality and speed of services to customers. IR understands that its customers are sensitive about how increased information sharing would affect their right to confidentiality. Therefore, as part of its policy development, IR has conducted multiple research projects in the last seven years to gather the opinions of the general public, businesses, and tax professionals. These earlier studies have focused on understanding the circumstances and safeguards that would make increased information sharing acceptable, and the impact of increased information sharing on the integrity of the tax system. These studies showed that people generally accept information sharing between government departments, as long as: strong protocols are in place; there is a definite improvement in customer service, and/or; a specific need is being addressed such as combating crime. However, one finding from our prior research was that the business community had particular concerns about commercially confidential business information being potentially being exposed outside of IR. IR wanted to explore this further, in particular, to understand the impact on businesses views of (i) the purpose that the information would be used for (for example gaining insights to contribute to a more productive economy) and (ii) what type of organisation would be accessing it. This study was, therefore, undertaken to get a deeper understanding of the business community’ views. We explored how the business community’s attitudes differ depending on whether IR shares information with government or non-government organisations. We also explored how the type of information being shared and the aim of the information sharing affect these opinions. Information Sharing Survey \[2\] Executive summary Within government, there has been increasing focus on improving access to data held by government departments that could potentially help improve people’s economic and social wellbeing. Regarding the possible value in widening this sharing outside of government departments, prior research with business owners indicated they have concerns about this widening. The research findings outlined in this report are aimed at further clarifying this aspect of public opinion, and adds to Inland Revenue’s understanding of attitudes towards data sharing. Overall support for Inland Revenue sharing business data with government and non- government organisations Overall support for sharing of business data by Inland Revenue is highest when sharing this information with other government departments (46% total support) and also with university researchers working on government projects (41%) 1 . Support declined significantly if university researchers (19%) or consulting companies (14%) were working on projects for private companies indicating that who the project was for was an important consideration in data sharing. An SME interviewed during cognitive testing explained that while he was supportive of data sharing for New Zealand’s benefit he did not want his IR data shared with private companies 2 . A microbusiness owner who was interviewed was very positive about sharing data, opining that transparency was likely to benefit not only researchers and government departments but other businesses as well 3 . 1 The questionnaire included a number of 5-point-scale questions which asked respondents for their level of support/agreement/comfort for various statements. In all of these questions 1=strongly against or disagreeing with the statement and 5=strongly for or agreeing with the statement. Percentages for agreeing strongly were calculated from the number of respondents selecting 4 or 5 and opposing were 1 or 2. 2 SME interview, March 2016.\[ Five cognitive interviews were conducted at the beginning of this project as well as eight in-depth interviews with key stakeholders (both internal IRD and external tax experts).\] 3 Interview with microbusiness owner, March 2016 SMEs - less supportive of IR sharing information with consulting companies working on projects for private sector companies than other business groups. (note small sample size) Support for IR sharing business data with university researchers is relatively strong when working on government projects and less so if working on private company projects. Support for business data sharing is less strong for consulting companies working on private sector projects. Support for sharing business information with the general public was very weak. Information Sharing Survey \[3\] Increased support for data sharing Support rose for business data sharing by Inland Revenue when business respondents had the opportunity to consider the risks and benefits of information sharing. Business support increased the most for university researchers working on projects for private companies (30%, up 11 percentage points) and university researchers working on government projects (51%, up 10 percentage points). For consulting companies working on projects for private companies (19%, up 5 percentage points) and government projects (34%, up 7 percentage points) there was less support. Businesses are therefore more comfortable data sharing for government projects. Significant enterprise - more in favour of data sharing with government departments and university researchers for a government project. Less supportive for data sharing with consulting companies working on projects for private sector companies than other business group. Micro-businesses - less supportive of sharing business information with university researchers working on projects for private companies. Self-employed - there were no significant differences compared to other business groups. (note small sample size) Sharing business data with non-government organisations with safeguards There are indications that having safeguards in place lifts support for sharing business information with non-government organisations. Anonymised data: If all financial and business information was anonymised and no individual business was identifiable, 40% of respondents support business data sharing with non-government organisations. Nonetheless a majority of business respondents still opposed Inland Revenue sharing business data with the general public even if anonymised. Purpose of data sharing: The majority of business respondents supported sharing of business data by Inland Revenue if:  The sharing of the information would aid Government policy and decision-making.  The sharing of the information would help a particular business sector grow. However, they were less likely to support business data sharing if the benefit was to a specific business. The owner of an SME who was interviewed was concerned that increased data sharing might give competitors an advantage, locally, nationally and even internationally, especially if overseas countries did not have the same tax reporting requirements as New Zealand. 4 4 Interview with SME, March 2016 Information Sharing Survey \[4\] How comfortable businesses are with information sharing Business respondents were most comfortable with Inland Revenue potentially sharing anonymised individual business information with other government departments, (50% comfortable,) and with university researchers (45%). One not-for-profit interviewed, a charity, was very willing to share their information, pointing out everything was readily available from the Charities Commission 5 . Not-for-profits most supportive of data sharing with all organisations including the general public. Types of information businesses are comfortable with IR sharing To explore how different types of business information being shared with different non- government and government organisations impacted on levels of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing, four scenarios were tested with business respondents:  Scenario one - Inland Revenue sharing small business information with university researchers.  Scenario two - Inland Revenue sharing large corporation information with business and economic consulting groups.  Scenario three - Inland Revenue sharing small business information with government departments.  Scenario four - Inland Revenue sharing large business information with the general public. 6 Business information that could potentially be shared included taxable income, tax paid by business, level of tax debt, employee numbers, GST return data, broad geographic location, profit and loss. In all four scenarios the respondents were more willing to share general information like ‘broad geographic information’ (between 70% and 85%) and ‘employee numbers’ (between 67% and 82%) 7 . More sensitive information such as ‘profit and loss’ was the type that respondents were least comfortable sharing (between 42% and 65%). 5 Interview NFP charity, March 2016 6 The four scenarios were tested with sub-samples within the total sample due to questionnaire length and the need to reduce respondent burden. 7 Broad geographic information was individually interpreted by each respondent - no definition was applied during the survey. Support for IR sharing business data with university researchers is relatively strong when working on government projects and less so if working on private company projects. Support increases when risks and benefits are explored for business data sharing for university researchers working on projects for private companies. Support for business data sharing is less strong for consulting companies working on private sector projects and the general public. Information Sharing Survey \[5\] One of the issues raised in the cognitive testing was that the financial information may be misinterpreted, for example, carrying tax debt may be perceived as a negative if the reasoning behind this was not fully understood 8 . Businesses were therefore less comfortable sharing sensitive or specific information types. Scenario summary table: information and sharing Scenarios Type of information Purpose for the sharing Information sharing (%) Comfortable sharing Scenario one University Researchers Small business Grow sector locally and internationally 65% plus Share all Scenario two Consulting group Large corporation Increase profitability and efficiency 51% plus Share all Less comfortable sharing Profit and Loss Scenario three Government Departments Small business Grow sector locally and internationally 57% plus Share all Least comfortable sharing tax debt Scenario four General public Large business Increase profitability and efficiency 38-44% Share general location and employee numbers only (67% plus) Respondents were generally more comfortable sharing small business information with university researchers and with other government departments. Benefits of information sharing Main benefit: Respondents thought that the main benefit for New Zealand business overall if non-government organisations were given access to anonymised individual business information was an ‘improvement in business productivity and/or efficiency’ (16.5%). The microbusiness owner interviewed felt that the more information available, the better, in order to improve business 9 . 8 Interview self-employed, March 2016 9 Interview micro-business owner, March 2016 There are indications that safeguards make a difference if sharing with non-government organisations; although not with the general public. There is less support if the benefit of the data sharing is for a specific business. Business respondents indicated they are comfortable in sharing ‘Employee numbers’ with non-government organisations; they are less comfortable sharing profit and loss information. Information Sharing Survey \[6\] Scenario benefits: The perceived benefits of sharing the anonymised business data by respondents varied depending on the scenario:  Scenario one (university researchers) - ‘improved information is made available to small businesses in your industry who are then able to make better investment decisions’ (60%).  Scenarios two and three (consulting groups and government departments) - ‘government is more informed about businesses in your industry sector and is able to provide better support to businesses to grow internationally’ (48% and 56% respectively).  Scenario four (general public) - ‘improved information is made available to members of the general public which encourages New Zealanders to invest in your industry sector’ (37%). Risks of information sharing Main risk: Respondents thought that the main risk to New Zealand business overall if IR gave non-government organisations access to anonymised individual business information was that it could result in a ‘breach of individual business privacy’ (39%). The problem of keeping data anonymised in a small country like New Zealand was one of the issues raised by both a self-employed business owner and a tax expert. Drilling down to regional and territorial authority level data or using high value data sets could allow larger businesses to be re-identified 10 . Scenario risk: For each of the four scenarios, if non-government organisations were given access to anonymised individual business information, the risk respondents thought most likely to occur was ‘there is potential for misuse of the data e.g. by the media’ ranging from 54% in scenario one to 69% in scenario four. Views of Inland Revenue and non-government organisations Most respondents (69%) have trust and confidence in the Inland Revenue indicating IR is seen by the majority of respondents as a safe and responsible custodian of business data. Issues of client confidentiality were a predominant concern of the not-for-profits who were interviewed and worked in a sensitive area. The trust component in relationship between IR and this not-for-profit for keeping their data safe was vital for data sharing 11 . However, respondents’ trust and confidence in university researchers (38%) and consulting companies (18%) in using anonymised business information, was significantly less when compared to the Inland Revenue. 10 Interview 1st March with tax expert and self-employed, March 2016 11 Interview with not-for-profit, March 2016 Information Sharing Survey \[7\] Views on current information sharing and ownership of business information Forty-four percent of all respondents believe that the IR does not currently share any financial and business information it holds about individual businesses with non- government organisations. Nearly all respondents (91%) agree with the statement that they own their business and financial information and 79% agree with the statement that their consent is needed for this information to be shared with non-government organisations such as universities and private business organisations. The evidence suggests that ownership and consent are likely to be significant considerations for businesses when data sharing. The following summary table also highlights any significant differences between individual business types and the overall figure.  The majority of respondents have trust and confidence in IR.  Almost half of the respondents believe IR does not share any financial and business information it holds.  Business and financial information is viewed by nearly all respondents as the property of the business owner.  Over three-quarters of respondents want a consent requirement for business and financial information to be shared with non-government organisations.

It also identifies which business types have the highest or lowest level relative to the other types where appropriate, even if the differences are not significant from the overall figure. Generally the significant differences are among the ‘significant enterprise’ and ‘not-for-profit’ groups. There were no significant differences between the ‘self-employed’ group and the overall figure, but this is a result of the fact that the self-employed business sector makes up 66.59% of the weighted ‘all’ figure, hence the results in the ‘self-employed’ group drive the results in the ‘all’ figure. A similar reasoning can be applied to the ‘microbusiness’ group which makes up 23.78% of the weighted ‘all’ figure. Information Sharing Survey \[10\] Introduction and methodology Within government, there has been a considerable focus on improving access to data about people for research and analysis. Frameworks and practices for the release of businesses’ data are less advanced. Improving access to businesses’ data involves resolving issues around the use of commercially sensitive data. In this research, ‘commercially sensitive’ means that the data could lead to: i. A business being financially disadvantaged, and, or ii. Other entities gaining a financial or other benefit. For IR, it also involves consideration of the impact of wider access on the integrity of the tax system, specifically whether greater access to data that businesses are required to provide to Inland Revenue for tax purposes may impact on businesses’ willingness to provide this data to Inland Revenue. Previous research with business has shown that they dislike the idea of Inland Revenue sharing businesses’ information with private-sector companies. Sharing information with government agencies was more acceptable as long as information sharing matched businesses’ expectations of the purpose for this sharing. This research is to support IR’s understanding of businesses’ attitudes towards wider data sharing. Objectives The study was designed to explore:  Level of comfort and support for Inland Revenue business data sharing with a range of government and non-government organisations.  What types of information does business consider acceptable to share.  Which government and non-government organisations/ general public is business comfortable sharing with.  Impact of wider data sharing on the integrity of the New Zealand tax system. Information Sharing Survey \[11\] Method Questionnaire design The research design included a prior round of eight stakeholder interviews that included internal Inland Revenue staff, other interested government staff and external business community representatives. The findings from these interviews were then reported on in an internal Inland Revenue workshop where key areas for the telephone questionnaire were explored and developed. The resultant draft questionnaire underwent a round of cognitive testing (n=5) and also refinement with input from the Inland Revenue research team. The questionnaire included four hypothetical information-sharing scenarios designed to test a range of options for business data sharing that highlighted potential business benefits, types of information to be shared and differentiated with who this business information would be shared. Due to the complexity and length of the questionnaire half of the sample were asked scenarios one and two and the other half of the sample were asked scenarios three and four. Key audiences The survey was designed to gather the opinions of a range of business owners and managers about the sharing and other new uses of information collected. In order to have views from all business types the sampling regime was designed in such a way so that each business type sub-group had at least 100 respondents. However, due to time constraints and telephone sample issues, only 80 surveys were completed for Significant Enterprises. The table below shows the number of surveys achieved for each sub-group as well as the true population. The total survey sample (n=480) represented 0.04% of the total number of businesses (n=1,261,500) in the true population count. Information Sharing Survey \[12\] TRUE POPULATION VS.

Fieldwork and margin of error Fieldwork was conducted from the 21st April to the 10th of May 2016. The margin of error for a 50% figure at the 95% confidence level for a sample size of 480 is +4.5%.  The margin of error for a 50% figure at the 95% confidence level for a sample size of 239 is +6.3%.  The margin of error for a 50% figure at the 95% confidence level for a sample size of 241 is +6.3%.  The margin of error for a 50% figure at the 95% confidence level for a sample size of 100 is +9.8%.  The margin of error for a 50% figure at the 95% confidence level for a sample size of 80 is +11%. All fieldwork was conducted using the Quancept survey system which is a leading Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing system. It is known for its power and flexibility, as well as the ease of use for supervisors and interviewers. It works in conjunction with a fully customizable sample management system, as well as a predictive dialler. 12 The survey was carried out in two waves to shorten the overall length. Numbers for each sub-group by wave can be found in the Appendix. Information Sharing Survey \[13\] Sample make-up BUSINESS DEMOGRAPHICS Unweighted % Weighted % Base: n= 480 480 Including yourself.

Information Sharing Survey \[15\] Support for and comfort with sharing information Overall support Sharing information with government and government projects garners the best support from business Respondents were asked how much they support, in principle, Inland Revenue sharing anonymised business information with a range of different groups.  In general, the highest level of support for information sharing was with groups that are government related.  The highest level of support was for Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with other government departments (46%). o 41% supported Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with university researchers working on government projects, however, only 19% supported sharing with university researchers working on projects for private companies. o 27% supported Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with consulting companies working on government projects, although there was only 14% support for Inland Revenue sharing with consulting companies working on private company projects.  The lowest level of support was for sharing anonymised individual business information with members of the general public (9%). Figure 1: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing Information Sharing Survey \[16\] Sub-group differences  Not-for-profit businesses gave the highest level of support for Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with each group.  Significant enterprises had the second highest level of support for the following groups: o 55% support for Inland Revenue sharing information with other government organisations. o 31% support for Inland Revenue sharing information with consulting companies working on projects for the government. o 21% support for Inland Revenue sharing information with university researchers working on projects for private companies.  Micro-businesses had the second highest level of support for university researchers working on government projects at 48%.  SME’s were significantly less supportive of Inland Revenue sharing information with consulting companies working on projects for private companies (7% support).

Information Sharing Survey \[19\] Support with safeguards and in certain situations There is some support for sharing information with non-government organisations with safeguards in place  Two in five respondents (40%) support Inland Revenue sharing information with non- government organisations if all financial and business information will be anonymised and no individual business will be identifiable.  Over a third of respondents (37%) support Inland Revenue sharing anonymised business information with non-government organisations if the safeguards meet the standards for privacy similar to the Privacy Act for individuals.  Conversely, around a third oppose sharing business data with non-government organisations even with safeguards.  Note there appears to be some lift in support when compared to results ‘support for Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with other non- government organisations’ see Figure 1. Figure 2: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing with non-government organisations with safeguards Information Sharing Survey \[20\] Sub-group differences  Not-for-profits were significantly more supportive about Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with non-government organisations than the whole sample for both safeguards (58% and 49% respectively).  Micro-businesses (41%) and self-employed (40%) were also fairly supportive if all financial and business information will be anonymised and no individual business will be identified.  The least supportive were significant enterprises and SME’s at 36% respectively.  Micro-businesses (38%) and self-employed (38%) were fairly supportive if the safeguards meet the standards for privacy similar to the privacy act for individuals.  The least supportive were significant enterprises and SME’s at 33% respectively. Figure 3: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing with non-government organisations with safeguards - sub-group differences Information Sharing Survey \[21\] There is low support for sharing information with members of the general public  Around one in five respondents support Inland Revenue sharing anonymised business information with members of the general public if the following safeguards are in place: o ‘All financial and business information will be anonymised and no individual business will be identifiable’ (23%). o ‘The safeguards meet the standards for privacy similar to the Privacy Act for individuals’ (22%).  However, a majority are opposed/ neutral regarding Inland Revenue business data sharing with the general public even with safeguards in place. Figure 4: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing with general public with safeguards Information Sharing Survey \[22\] Sub-group differences  Not-for-profits were significantly more supportive about Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with members of the general public than the whole sample for both safeguards at 43% and 40% respectively.  Other groups were less encouraging. A quarter of microbusinesses and 23% of SME’s were supportive if all financial and business information will be anonymised and no individual business will be identifiable.  Only 22% of microbusinesses and 21% of SME’s and self-employed were supportive if the safeguards meet the standards for privacy similar to the privacy act for individuals. Figure 5: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing with general public with safeguards - sub-group differences Information Sharing Survey \[23\] Highest support was for sharing business and financial information to aid Government policy and decision-making AND to help a business sector grow  Over half of respondents supported Inland Revenue sharing anonymised business and financial information in the following situations: o ‘The sharing of the information to aid Government policy and decision-making’ (56%). o ‘The sharing of the information to help a particular business sector grow (e.g. grow local or international market)’ (53%).  A third of respondents (32%) supported Inland Revenue sharing anonymised business and financial information to aid one specific business (e.g. help them develop an innovative product or move into a gap in the market), conversely, a third opposed and a third were neutral. Figure 6: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing in the following situations Information Sharing Survey \[24\] Sub-group differences  Not-for-profits were the most supportive of the sharing of business and financial information if it is to aid government policy and decision making at 73%.  Significant enterprises had the second highest level of support for sharing information if it was to aid government policy and decision making (66% support); however, they had the lowest level of support in the remaining two situations. o 49% support if sharing the information will help a particular business sector grow (53% for all). o 26% support if sharing the information will aid one specific business (32% for all).  Microbusinesses (57%) had the highest level of support for the sharing of information to help a particular business sector grow.  There was less support overall (32%) for the sharing of information to aid one specific business with not-for-profits showing the most support on 39%, followed by a third of SME’s. Figure 7: Level of support for Inland Revenue business data sharing in the following situations - sub-group differences Information Sharing Survey \[25\] Level of comfort with information sharing Businesses are most comfortable with sharing information with other government departments and university researchers  Half of businesses said they were comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information with other government departments. o 45% of businesses also said they were comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing anonymised information with university researchers.  Businesses were much less comfortable with the idea of Inland Revenue sharing anonymised information with either consulting companies (20%) or members of the general public (12%).  Significant enterprises were more comfortable than the other four business groups with having Inland Revenue share anonymised information with other government departments (57%).  Not-for-profits were more comfortable than the other four business groups with Inland Revenue sharing anonymised information with university researchers (50%) and members of the general public (22%).  Self-employed business people were more comfortable than the other four business groups with having Inland Revenue sharing anonymised information with consulting companies (23%). Figure 8: Level of comfort with Inland Revenue sharing business data with the following organisations Information Sharing Survey \[26\] Businesses are most comfortable sharing employee numbers; least comfortable sharing profit and loss information Businesses who had already stated they were comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information were asked their level of comfort on sharing specific information types.  The level of comfort was greatest for sharing the tested information types with other government departments.  Generally, ‘employee numbers’ was the information type businesses were most comfortable with Inland Revenue anonymising and sharing, while ‘profit and loss’ was the type of information businesses were least comfortable with Inland Revenue anonymising and sharing.  However, the majority of businesses (who were already comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing anonymised individual business information) were also comfortable sharing all information types tested with Government, university researchers and consulting companies and to a lesser extent the general public.

The four scenarios are outlined below, wave one (n=216) was presented with scenarios one and two, while wave two (n=264) was presented with scenarios three and four. Scenario one: Small business information shared with university researchers In the first scenario respondents were presented with a situation where anonymised business and financial information on small businesses could be used by university researchers. The information would be shared with the industry sector to support and grow the sector locally and possibly internationally. Scenario two: Large corporate information shared with business and economic consulting group In the second scenario respondents were presented with a situation where individual business information could be shared with the private sector such as business and economic consulting companies. In this scenario business information from a number of large corporations in their sector could be used to identify the key drivers of profitability and efficiency, for example, looking at the impact of capital and the use of labour. This could be shared with those businesses not doing so well to help them increase profitability and efficiency. Scenario three: Small business information shared with government departments In the third scenario respondents were presented with a situation where business and financial information could be used by other government departments. In this scenario business information on small businesses, employing five or less employees, is used to identify the potential for growth locally and internationally. Scenario four: Large business information shared with general public In the fourth scenario respondents were presented with a situation where anonymised business and financial information on large businesses could be shared with members of the general public. In this scenario business information from a number of large corporations in their sector could be used to identify the key drivers of profitability and efficiency, for example, looking at the impact of capital and the use of labour. This could be shared with those businesses not doing so well to help them increase profitability and efficiency. Information Sharing Survey \[29\] Types of information businesses are comfortable with Inland Revenue sharing Broad geographic location and employee numbers are the types of information businesses are most comfortable with sharing across all four scenarios  The sharing of broad geographic location information rated highly for all four scenarios (85%, 75%, 84%, and 70% for scenarios one through four respectively).  This was followed by employee numbers with a significant majority stating they were comfortable with sharing it for all four scenarios (82%, 75%, 80%, and 67%, for scenarios one through four respectively).  Respondents were least comfortable with sharing profit and loss information o Rating lowest of all the information types for scenarios one and two, and the second lowest for scenarios three and four.  However, the majority stated ‘Yes’ to sharing all information types tested with university researchers, consulting companies and other government departments. We note that there were lower majorities for the sharing of financial information and more specifically sharing with consulting companies.  Respondents were least comfortable with sharing large business information with the general public. (scenario four) o On average respondents who said ‘yes’ to being comfortable with sharing each type of information in scenario four was 14% lower than the next lowest response from the other three scenarios (which in every case was scenario two). o The difference was lowest for broad geographic information (5% lower), and highest for GST return data (23% lower).  They were more comfortable sharing information with university researchers and other government departments. o Scenarios one and three received the top two percentages of ‘yes’ responses for each type of information discussed.

[All Student loans dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Student loans])

The 'Financial period' for a student loan statement is the same as the tax year (1 April to 31 March). Tax years are referred to by the year they end in, for example the 2023 tax year ends on 31 March 2023. When you get a loan determines what tax year the transaction will be under, for example if you study and got a loan:

*   before 31 March 2022, this will be a transaction for the 2022 tax year
*   from 1 April 2022 onwards, this will be a transaction for the 2023 tax year.

The following transaction types are amounts that you may see on your student loan statement.

Increases to your loan
----------------------

Show all

Administration fee

We charge a $40 administration fee each year to cover the costs of managing your loan. You're not charged an administration fee in the same year that you are charged an establishment fee.

Compulsory course fees

Course fees you borrowed from StudyLink that are paid directly to your education provider.

Course-related costs

Amounts you borrowed from StudyLink to cover your course-related costs while studying.

Establishment fee

StudyLink charges a $60 establishment fee when you open a new loan account. The fee is added to your loan as soon as your first payment comes out.

Interest

Loan interest you have been charged less interest that has been written-off.

While you’re living in New Zealand your loan is interest-free.

*   Up until April 2020, loan interest was added to your loan and then written-off.
*   From April 2020 interest is no longer added to your loan.

If your loan is not interest-free, interest is calculated daily and added to your loan balance at the end of each tax year (31 March).

If your loan started before April 2012, Interest may show in 'Decreases to your loan'. This is because some of the interest charged is included in StudyLink amounts, but interest written-off is included here.

Living costs

Amounts you borrowed from StudyLink to cover your living costs while studying.

Opening loan balance

This is your loan balance for earlier periods and includes all loan increases, such as amounts you have borrowed, and loan decreases like payments you have made. You will usually see this amount if your loan started before April 2006.

Penalties

Any penalties you have been charged including:

*   late payment interest (previously called late payment penalty) - may be charged on overdue amounts from the day after a loan payment is due
*   shortfall penalty - may be charged if you underpaid your student loan assessment because your return of income was wrong
*   underestimation penalty - may have been charged if you underestimated your interim payments (up until the 2020 tax year)
*   amnesty penalty - may have been charged as part of an amnesty of student loans for the 2007 and 2008 tax years.

Any remission of penalties is also included here.

Refunds and other increases

Any overpayments we've refunded to you at your request, or other increases to your loan.

StudyLink amounts

If your student loan started before April 2012, these are the amounts you borrowed, and any interest charged by StudyLink from when you first got your loan until the loan was transferred to us. Any payments you made to StudyLink are also included here.

Transfers

Any amounts transferred to your loan such as:

*   a loan transfer (the amount you borrowed from StudyLink)
*   interest transfer from StudyLink (interest charged by StudyLink while the loan was with them. This may be written-off)
*   an income tax refund to help pay it off
*   significant overpayments transferred to another account at your request (to your KiwiSaver for example).

Depending on the transfer type, these may show in 'Increases to your loan' or in 'Decreases to your loan'.

Decreases to your loan
----------------------

Show all

Payments

Loan payments you've manually made to us, including voluntary payments.

Salary and wage deductions

Loan payments deducted from your salary or wages by your employer. These include:

*   repayment deductions - standard deductions from your salary or wages
*   recovery deductions - extra student loan deductions to make up for an earlier significant under-deduction
*   voluntary deductions - if you’ve asked your employer to make extra deductions to pay off your loan faster.

Write offs and other decreases

Any amounts written-off (for example a small balance offset), or other decreases to your loan.

A voluntary repayment bonus was given in the 2010 to 2013 tax years. Any bonus you received will be included here.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

You can access your income information anytime in myIR. The information here will help you understand and get the most out of your income summary.

Overview of your income
-----------------------

To get to your income summary in myIR select 'Income summary' from your 'Income tax' account.

An overview of your income by source is displayed, along with the amount (income before tax) and any deductions. You can change the period the summary is for by selecting 'Other' and changing the 'From' and 'To' fields. You can select any time period from 1 April 2015 onwards.

The following income sources will display on this overview, but only if you have income from that source.

*   Salary, wages, benefits and taxable pensions.
*   Schedular income.
*   Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income.
*   New Zealand interest received.
*   Dividends treated as interest.
*   New Zealand dividends received.
*   Māori authority distributions.
*   Estate and trust income.
*   Partnership income.
*   Look-through company income.
*   Shareholder-employee salary.
*   Non-resident interest received.
*   Non-resident dividends received.
*   Royalties.

If you enter any non-business expenses, these will also display on your overview.

Breakdown of your income
------------------------

To get a breakdown of each income source, select 'View breakdown'. This shows a breakdown of gross amount, deductions, and totals per payer for each period reported in the source return - for example, each pay period. There is also an additional table that sums up the figures for each income source in case you have more than 1.

Each payer will have a 'Source total' row so you can see the split of income totals. There will also be a table that combines all of the income and deductions for salary, wages, benefits and taxable pensions. This way, you can see the:

*   total gross income
*   PAYE deducted
*   ACC earners' levy deducted
*   tax deducted
*   student loan amounts deducted
*   earnings not liable for ACC.

Select 'More detail >' on any of the rows in the breakdown to get detailed information about that income source for that period. For example, when you select 'More detail >' on an employer's income row, the pay details, including the tax code used, will display.

Printing proof of income and income details
-------------------------------------------

For income, there are 2 exportable PDFs called:

*   Proof of income
*   Income details.

You can download both of these for different periods using the 'From' and 'To' boxes.

### Proof of income

The proof of income PDF provides a total of your income and deductions, by source type (for example salary or a benefit), held by us for the selected date range.  
You can use this as proof of income for StudyLink, the council rates rebate or for anyone else needing the information.

The Proof of income PDF does not include:

*   self-employed income
*   rental income
*   Working for Families Tax Credits adjustments
*   Working for Families from work and income figures
*   student loan adjustments
*   non-business expenses
*   splits by employer or financial institution
*   any monthly figures
*   extinguished tax credits for payroll giving or imputation credits
*   student loan deductions
*   earnings not liable for ACC
*   the ACC earner premium amount of the PAYE deductions.

You can run the more detailed income export if you need more information.

This PDF is available for individual customers. Intermediaries can also create this PDF for their clients.

### Income details

This is a more detailed PDF that you can use to file an income tax return or provide monthly income details for Work and Income.

The first section provides a total of your income and deductions held by us for a selected date range.

The second section breaks down the income and deduction totals by source type for each tax year in the date range selected. It will then show the ACC earner levy and the total tax paid.

Other income or adjustments that may be required to file a tax return are in the Other income types section. The following income or adjustments will only show if you have them.

*   Working for families from Work and Income.
*   Working for Families Tax Credits adjustments.
*   Student loan adjustments.
*   Non-business expenses.
*   Non-resident interest received.
*   Non-resident dividends received.
*   Royalties.
*   Portfolio investment entity (PIE) income.

The detailed income breakdown section splits all the income from any of the above types by financial year. The breakdown will show monthly figures received, by employer. This section will show PAYE deductions, earnings not liable for ACC and student loan deductions for each line item.

If you have any other income sources, their information will be broken down by payer and show the gross amount and tax deducted line items.

This PDF is available for both individual and non-individual customers. Intermediaries can also create this PDF for their clients.

After the end of each tax year, we send out income tax assessment letters showing whether people have a tax refund, tax to pay or have paid the right amount. You do not get a letter if you need to file an individual income tax return - IR3. 

The definitions on this page will help you understand your letter and how your tax has been worked out for the year.

**Tip:** definitions are grouped by topic. For example, you’ll find ‘Total PIE deductions’ under ‘Portfolio investment entity (PIE)’.

Show all

ACC earners' levy

Everyone who earns salary or wages in New Zealand pays the ACC earners’ levy. This covers injuries that happen at work, at home, or anywhere else.

Like tax, the levy is automatically taken from your salary or wages.

Benefits

These are payments from the Ministry of Social Development (MSD). Some have tax taken from them and are included in your end-of-year tax assessment, like the Jobseeker or Sole Parent Support benefits. Some other benefits are not taxable and are not included in your end-of-year tax assessment, like the accommodation supplement or Unsupported Child benefit.

Claimable expenses

You can claim some expenses against your income, which reduces the tax you pay. For example, the cost of income protection insurance.

Find out what you can claim as expenses in your income tax assessment.

[Types of individual expenses](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-expenses)

Completing your assessment

If your letter asks you to complete your assessment, you need to check our records are correct and give us any missing information. The letter will give you more instructions, or you can read more on our page 'Change my income tax assessment details'.

[Change my income tax assessment details](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/income-tax-assessments/change-my-income-tax-assessment-details)

Credit/debit - tax calculation result

We work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax. Credit means you’ve paid too much and have a refund (or money to transfer to a different tax debt like child support). Debit means you have more tax to pay.

Earnings not liable for ACC levy

The ACC earners’ levy is not deducted from income-tested benefits, NZ Super or Student Allowance. Our website has examples of income-tested benefits.

[Benefits, New Zealand superannuation and Student Allowance](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/types-of-individual-income/benefits-nz-superannuation-student-allowance)

Entitlement (Working for Families)

Working for Families Tax Credits are payments you can get to help raise your children. Your entitlement depends on your income and family circumstances.

Find out more about any entitlement you may be able to get.

[About Working for Families](/working-for-families/about)

Gross income

This is your income before tax or expenses are taken away.

Gross payments (for schedular payments)

These are payments to contractors (schedular payments) before tax is taken away.

IETC

The independent earner tax credit (IETC) is a payment or credit for New Zealand tax residents earning $24,000 to $70,000 for the 2025 tax year (or $48,000 for the 2024 tax year and earlier). You can use it to:

*   pay less tax during the year
*   get a refund at the end of the year
*   reduce your tax debt at the end of the year (including child support).

Find out if you can get the IETC.

[Independent earner tax credit (IETC)](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/individual-tax-credits/independent-earner-tax-credit-ietc)

Income tax assessment

This shows the income you earned, how much tax you paid during the year and how much you should have paid. It also shows if you paid too much tax and have a refund, or not enough tax and have more to pay.

[Automatically issued income tax assessments](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year/income-tax-assessments)

Interest/gross interest

Interest is money you earn from having investments (for example, KiwiSaver) and savings in bank accounts. You pay tax on interest you earn.

**Gross interest** is your interest income before tax is taken away.

[Interest and dividends](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/types-of-business-income/interest-and-dividends)

Portfolio investment entity (PIE)

An organisation that invests money for its customers (investors) in different types of passive investment (like KiwiSaver).

**PIE income** – the interest you earn from your investment is counted as income, and you pay tax on it.

**PIE loss** – if your investment loses money, the PIE organisation claims a tax refund from Inland Revenue. They may then refund money to you.

**Total PIE deductions** – the total tax you’ve paid on your PIE income. Your provider (the PIE organisation) takes away tax as you earn interest, based on the tax rate (PIR) you’ve given them. You need to make sure your PIR is right or you may have tax to pay at the end of the tax year.

**Portfolio investment entity/PIE calculation** – we work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax on the interest you earned from KiwiSaver or other PIEs.

### Competent Authority Arrangement

The Competent Authorities of New Zealand and the United States of America have entered into a Competent Authority Arrangement (CAA) to establish and prescribe rules and procedures necessary to implement the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA (the IGA).

See the full text of the arrangement: [PDF](/-/media/project/ir/tp/tax-treaties/united-states-america/2015-other-iga-nz-usa-caa-main.pdf?sc_lang=en&modified=20201126165304&hash=234F5749A60BCEC746E8387D55E6DD44)

### Competent Authority Arrangement for trusts

### U.S. and New Zealand agree on meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” under the IGA for a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust)

The Competent Authorities of New Zealand and the United States have entered into a Competent Authority Arrangement (CAA) concerning the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” as that term applies to a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) under Article 1(1)(l) of the Agreement between the Government of New Zealand and the Government of the United States of America to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA, signed on 12 June 2014 (the IGA).

The CAA has been entered into pursuant to Article 1(2) of the IGA and paragraph 3 of Article 24 (Mutual Agreement Procedure) of the Convention between New Zealand and the United States of America for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, with Protocol, done at Wellington on 23 July 1982, as amended by a Second Protocol, done at Washington on December 1, 2008.

#### Background

Article 1(1)(l) of the IGA provides that the term "New Zealand Financial Institution" means "any Financial Institution resident in New Zealand, but excluding any branch of such Financial Institution that is located outside New Zealand" and "any branch of a Financial Institution not resident in New Zealand, if such branch is located in New Zealand."

The laws of New Zealand provide residency rules for income tax purposes for individuals and certain entities that have a separate legal personality. Trusts (with the exception of unit trusts) are not separate legal entities in New Zealand, and thus New Zealand does not have residency rules for income tax purposes for trusts (other than unit trusts).

Under Article 1(2) of the IGA, "\[a\]ny term not otherwise defined in this Agreement \[the IGA\] shall, unless the context otherwise requires or the Competent Authorities agree to a common meaning (as permitted by domestic law), have the meaning that it has at that time under the law of the Party applying this Agreement \[the IGA\], any meaning under the applicable tax laws of that Party prevailing over the meaning given to the term under the laws of that Party."

Pursuant to Article 1(2), the Competent Authorities of New Zealand and the United States have entered into a CAA, which sets out a common understanding of the meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” as that term applies to a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) under the IGA.

#### Common meaning of the term “resident in New Zealand” for a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust)

The CAA has an initial transitional period (prior to 1 April 2017) in which a trust (other than a unit trust) may rely on any reasonable definition of the term “resident in New Zealand” under the IGA including, for instance, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that is established under the laws of New Zealand, whereby the trust is settled, executed, and governed by New Zealand law.

Beginning on or before 1 April 2017, the term "resident in New Zealand" under the IGA means, in the context of a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust), a trust that has one or more trustees resident in New Zealand for New Zealand income tax purposes at any time during the reporting period, or is managed by a branch of a trustee located in New Zealand provided that the branch of the trustee is subject to regulatory supervision in New Zealand. However, a Financial Institution that is a trust (other than a unit trust) would not be considered "resident in New Zealand" if the trust is resident in a Partner Jurisdiction or in another jurisdiction that permits the trust to comply with the requirements of a participating Foreign Financial Institution under the United States Treasury Regulations, and the trust reports all the information required to be reported pursuant to the Partner Jurisdiction's IGA or the United States Treasury Regulations, as applicable, with respect to Financial Accounts maintained by the trust.

Unsuccessful appeal by Trinity investors in respect of statutory demands issued by the Commissioner

2014 case note - unsuccessful appeal in respect of statutory demands issued by the CIR - Trinity, creditor, insolvency.

Redcliffe Forestry Venture Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CA 791/2013); Bristol Forestry Venture Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CA 633/2013); Accent Management Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue (CA 23/2014), \[2014\] NZCA 349

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993, Tax Administration Act 1994, Income Tax Act 1994

### Summary

This matter involved three appeals against High Court decisions dismissing the appellants' applications to set aside statutory demands issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner"). The Court of Appeal found that the Commissioner was able to issue statutory demands and dismissed the appeals.

### Impact of decision

The Court of Appeal preferred the characterisation of the Commissioner as an officer of the Crown exercising certain functions on the Crown's behalf rather than as being part of the Crown. In any event the Commissioner is able to recover tax due to the Crown.

The Court of Appeal agreed with the view that the public has an interest in the end of litigation as the public purse sustains litigation to a large degree.

### Facts

This appeal relates to the Trinity scheme that was confirmed as tax avoidance by the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 ("_Ben Nevis")._ This appeal was one of a number of related matters heard by the Court of Appeal on 18 to 20 March 2014. This proceeding specifically relates to the Commissioner's attempts to enforce assessments confirmed by _Ben Nevis_ by issuing statutory demands against the appellants in accordance with section 289 of the Companies Act 1993.

The appellants applied for the demands to be set aside under section 290 of the Companies Act 1993 on the basis that there is a substantial dispute whether or not the debt is owing (section 290(4)(a)) and the demand ought to be set aside on other grounds (section 290(4)(c)). All appellants relied on the on-going litigation to argue there was no final determination of their challenges to the Commissioner's assessments and so only a contingent not present debt owing. In addition, some of the appellants argued the Commissioner was not authorised to issue a statutory demand on behalf of the Crown, the Commissioner not being a creditor for the purposes of section 289.

These applications were heard as three separate proceedings in the High Court, each of which was dismissed by Associate Judge Faire (as he then was), who also awarded indemnity costs to the Commissioner in two of the matters.

The appellants appealed both the substantive decisions and the costs awards to the Court of Appeal.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal found for the Commissioner on all grounds.

#### _The Commissioner as creditor_

The Court considered whether the Commissioner was part of the Crown and considered the better view is that the Commissioner, as an officer of the Crown, can exercise certain functions on the Crown's behalf and section 156 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") makes it clear this includes conducting litigation to recover tax.

The Court found that the source of the Commissioner's statutory powers to collect tax and issue a statutory demand came from section 6A read in conjunction with sections 156 and 176.

However, even if the Commissioner lacked the statutory power to issue a statutory demand in her own name, she could do so as an agent or officer of the Crown. In this case, the only defect in the demands issued was the omission of the words "on behalf of the Crown", but that omission was at worst a trivial defect, and the Court thought it not an omission at all.

#### _Whether there was a substantial dispute_

The Court dismissed the appellants' arguments that Part 8A challenges had not been finally determined. The Court considered that if the appellants' arguments were accepted, it would mean any defaulting taxpayer could defer payment of tax simply by commencing proceedings attacking the judgment in which his or her challenge failed.

#### _Other grounds_

The Court rejected all other reasons for setting aside the statutory demands. With regard to the appellants' claim that there was a public interest in the proceedings by virtue of the Commissioner's questionable motives - in this case to remove challenges to her assessments by liquidating the taxpayers - the Court said there was in fact a public interest in the finality of litigation. This also applied to the appellants' argument that setting aside the statutory demand was in the public interest because there was no other creditor.

In relation to a tangential point as to whether Goods and Services Tax credits could be offset against costs awarded by the High Court, the Court of Appeal agreed with the Commissioner that section 46(6) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 did not provide for this.

#### _Costs_

The Court found the appeal points brought were hopeless from the outset and were motivated by an intention to delay the collection of tax. Accordingly, the Court awarded indemnity costs in the Commissioner's favour.

Unsuccessful application by Trinity investors to the Supreme Court for leave to appeal three previous decisions
===============================================================================================================

2014 case note – unsuccessful leave to appeal application by investors in Trinity Scheme to Supreme Court - presumptive bias, tax avoidance.

Case

Clive Richard Bradbury and Gregory Alan Peebles and Anors v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2014\] NZSC 174

Legislative References

Supreme Court Act 2003, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

All the applications for leave involved proceedings which, in one way or another, were sequels to the judgment of the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289. The Supreme Court dismissed all three leave applications finding no points of public and general importance in the proposed appeals and no appearance of any miscarriage of justice.

### Impact of decision

The Supreme Court reiterated that for leave to be granted, a matter of public and general importance or an appearance of a miscarriage of justice must be found in any proposed appeals.

These Supreme Court decisions should signal the end of the bias and subpart EH arguments that have been advanced by Trinity investors in multiple proceedings over a number of years.

### Facts

This judgment addressed three related applications for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court:

1.  _Bradbury v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (SC 87/2014);
2.  _Accent Management Ltd v Attorney-General_ (SC 90/2014); and
3.  _Bradbury v Judicial Conduct Commissioner_ (SC 103/2014).

All the applications for leave involved proceedings which, in one way or another, are sequels to the judgment of the Supreme Court in _Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2008\] NZSC 115, \[2009\] 2 NZLR 289 _("Ben Nevis SC"),_ which addressed the Trinity tax avoidance scheme.

In SC 87/2014, the applicants in the High Court sought an order setting aside the _Ben Nevis_ High Court judgment in the Trinity litigation on the basis that the first instance Judge was biased (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 2361, (2013) 26 NZTC 21-032). A protest to jurisdiction by the Commissioner was upheld by Katz J and the applicants' appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed (_Ben Nevis Forestry Ventures Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZCA 350, (2014) NZTC 21-086). Both courts concluded the High Court does not have jurisdiction to set aside for bias an earlier High Court judgment that has been upheld on appeal.

In SC 90/2014, the applicant asserted that when the High Court heard the original Trinity case, it wrongly analysed the Trinity scheme under subpart EG of the Income Tax Act 1994 rather than (the purported mandatory) subpart EH. The applicant's contention is that implementation of the judgment would therefore involve the collection of tax otherwise than as authorised by Parliament and that the judgment should be set aside as unlawful.

In SC 103/2014, the applicants sought leave to appeal decisions of the High Court and Court of Appeal (_Muir v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2007\] NZCA 334, \[2007\] 3 NZLR 495) dismissing an application to judicially review the Judicial Conduct Commissioner's findings that the first instance Judge was not biased.

### Decision

The Supreme Court dismissed all three leave applications finding no points of public and general importance in the proposed appeals and no appearance of any miscarriage of justice and found:

1.  In SC 87/2014, that the position of the applicants being if the High Court judgment is set aside, the judgments of the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court would fall away as nullities had no supporting authority aside from the special case of judgments obtained by fraud. However, fraud was not one of the grounds in this leave application.
2.  In SC 90/2014, that the argument raised by the applicants was either the same as, or at best only inconsequentially different from, that already addressed in the Supreme Court's previous _Redcliffe_ judgment (_Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Redcliffe Forestry Venture Ltd_ \[2012\] NZSC 94, \[2013\] 1 NZLR 804).
3.  In SC 103/2014, that although the subject matter of the proposed appeal was undoubtedly of public importance - as it involves complaints against a Judge - the case primarily involved the application of the Judicial Conduct Commissioner and Judicial Conduct Panel Act 2004 to the very particular facts of the present case. The underlying arguments as to the merits of this did not raise any issue of public or general importance and no appearance of a miscarriage of justice.

Further, the Supreme Court found the various applications for leave to appeal the various awards of indemnity costs held no arguments that would warrant the granting of leave.

Unsuccessful application for review
===================================

2014 case note – unsuccessful application for review - security for costs, disputes process, strike out.

Case

Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Judicature Act 1908, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Facts

This decision relates to an application for review of an Associate Judge's decision filed by Peter William Mawhinney as trustee of the Forest Trust ("the Trust"). The decision which the Trust sought to review was that of Associate Judge Christiansen striking out part of the Trust's Statement of Claim in damages and ordering the Trust to pay $40,000 in security for costs (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 1554).

The underlying dispute involves a claim for a GST refund of $67,011.65, which the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") has reassessed to nil pursuant to s 89C(eb) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA").

On 12 July 2012, the Trust filed a statement of claim containing claims for 19 separate breaches of statutory duty; a claim for money had and received; and claims for six breaches of duty of care. The Trust sought damages and/or compensation of $5,113,810.72.

The Trust has filed two further iterations of its Statement of Claim, the third of which contained an additional fourth cause of action purporting to be a challenge under Part 8A of the TAA.

In April 2014, the Commissioner applied to strike out the fourth cause of action and for further security for costs. These matters were heard by Associate Judge Christiansen who delivered his judgment on 4 July 2014 (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZHC 1554). Associate Judge Christiansen determined that the fourth cause of action was a duplication of process (being already subject to the TAA disputes procedures, determined by Cooper J (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2013\] NZHC 3564), and before the Court of Appeal (_Mawhinney v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2014\] NZCA 450; (2014) 26 NZTC 21-101 per Ellen France J), was prima facie vexatious and should be struck out.

Further, the Associate Judge ordered security for costs in the sum of $40,000 to be paid into Court and to be held pending determination of the proceeding. He stayed the proceeding until lodgement of the payment.

### Decision

The application for review was dismissed.

#### _Strike-out application_

The Trust submitted that the Associate Judge erred in holding that the fourth cause of action was duplicitous in the sense it had already been determined by Cooper J, arguing that the disputes procedure set out in Part 4A of the TAA had been concluded. Further, it said the Associate Judge had erred in striking out the fourth cause of action on the basis that no challenge notice had been issued because only s 138B(3) of the TAA requires the issuance of a challenge notice. The Trust submitted that Cooper J concluded that the dispute should be determined by a challenge under s 138B(1) of the TAA.

The Trust further submitted that the Associate Judge erred in his interpretation of _Allen v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (\[2006\] NZSC 19, \[2006\] 3 NZLR 1,because that was a decision under s 138B(3), not s 138B(1). Once the Part 4A disputes procedure had come to an end, it was up to the taxpayer to choose the forum for a challenge under Part 8A (either the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court) and that adding the fourth cause of action was an appropriate response to Cooper J's decision.

The Commissioner, in reply, pointed out that s 138B(3) of the TAA applies to a situation where the taxpayer is the initiator of the dispute, and as the Trust is the initiator of this dispute, it must apply. The Commissioner also drew Justice Brewer's attention to Cooper J's determination that the Part 4A procedure must be determined by the statutory processes before any challenge under Part 8A arises. Accordingly, no cause of action purporting to invoke Part 8A could stand.

The Court held that the Associate Judge was right to strike out the fourth cause of action as the Trust was bound by the decision of Cooper J that the issue of the assessment of GST which is the subject of the fourth cause of action is to be decided within the statutory disputes and challenge procedures in the Act. Justice Brewer reiterated an assertion that the Part 4A procedure has concluded is itself a matter for the Part 4A process.

#### _Security for costs application_

Mr Mawhinney submitted that the Associate Judge erred by focusing on the ability of the Trust to pay an award of costs; rather, he should have focused on whether Mr Mawhinney, as plaintiff, was able to pay costs. This submission is based on the premise that a Trust is not itself a legal person and can only act through trustees.

Mr Mawhinney further submitted that even if security for costs should have been ordered, the Associate Judge should not have directed that the security be paid into Court in money, as security is able to be provided by other means and it is up to the plaintiff how security for costs should be satisfied.

In response, the Commissioner submitted that the Associate Judge was correct to look to the assets of the Trust because the Trust is the plaintiff, not Mr Mawhinney acting in his personal capacity. Even if a trustee is personally liable, the fact that he would have recourse to the assets of a third party (referred to at \[15\] of Brewer J's judgment) for security might in itself suggest that security is appropriate (_Highgate on Broadway Ltd v Devine_ \[2012\] NZHC 2288, \[2013\] NZAR 1017); and r 5.45 of the High Court Rules 2008 says that an order for security can be by way of payment or by some other means. The Associate Judge was entitled to prefer cash.

Justice Brewer determined that Associate Judge Christiansen did not make an error in the exercise of his discretion, commenting that having considered the matters he was required to consider, the Associate Judge made the decisions that were open to him.

His Honour found there was no doubt that the Trust could not meet an order for costs out of its own resources and that it was clear that Mr Mawhinney had not provided sufficient evidence to show that he, personally, could meet any award of costs.

Justice Brewer further determined that r 5.45 of the High Court Rules leaves it up to the Judge to decide whether security should be given by paying a sum into Court or by giving some other security.

#### _Addendum_

The Court further ordered that the Trust could apply to the Associate Judge to vary his order to allow security for costs to be provided by a second mortgage over the property. However, the Trust would still have to satisfy the Associate Judge that this would constitute proper security.

Unsuccessful application to set aside statutory demand after taxpayer's breach of binding agreement with the Commissioner regarding tax debt
============================================================================================================================================

2017 case note - unsuccessful application to set aside statutory demand for unpaid taxes - binding agreements, contractual remedies, estoppel, delegated authority.

Case

Elementary Solutions Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2017\] NZHC 32

Legislative References

Companies Act 1993 ss 289, 290, 291 Contractual Remedies Act 1979 s 7 Tax Administration Act 1994 ss 6, 6A, 7

### Summary

Elementary Solutions Ltd (“the applicant”) was unsuccessful in its application to set aside the Commissioner of Inland Revenue’s (“the Commissioner”) statutory demand for unpaid taxes. The Court held that the parties had reached a binding agreement, where the Commissioner would not pursue the debt pending the outcome of a separate defamation proceeding. The Court held that an essential term of the agreement was that for the next 12 months the applicant and its director meet their ongoing tax obligations. When they failed to do so, the Court held that the Commissioner was entitled to cancel the agreement and pursue recovery of the applicant’s tax debt.

### Impact

This judgment makes it clear that the Commissioner can enter a binding agreement under which she may accept payment of less than the full amount of tax that she considers is lawfully due (and assessed).

It is not clear whether, for such a binding agreement, consideration is required and the rule in _Foakes v Beer_ (1884) App Cas 605 that a promise to pay part of a debt is not consideration for forgiveness of the balance applies.

The Commissioner may be estopped from serving a statutory demand where an estoppel defence is made out: an expectation is created through the actions or representation of the Commissioner, the expectation is relied on, detriment will be suffered if the expectation is departed from and it would be unconscionable for the Commissioner to depart from the expectation.

Inland Revenue staff can bind the Commissioner only if they have delegated authority. Here the High Court considered that there is nothing to suggest that an acting manager does not have the same authority and powers as an ordinary manager.

### Facts

The applicant brought proceedings to set aside a statutory demand dated 18 February 2016 issued by the Commissioner for unpaid taxes.

The applicant did not dispute its liability for any of the taxes, but said that the demand should be set aside under s 290(4)(a) of the Companies Act 1993 (“the Act”). The applicant contended that it made an arrangement with the Commissioner in May 2013 for enforcement of its tax debt to be stayed pending the outcome of a separate defamation proceeding, for which the gross proceeds would be paid to the Commissioner. The applicant said the statutory demand was in breach of contract and that the Commissioner was estopped from claiming payment. The applicant also ran arguments as to counterclaim under s 290(4)(b) and other grounds under s 290(4)(c).

The Commissioner denied making any binding arrangements with the applicant in May 2013 but stated that she entered into an agreement with the applicant and its director, Daniel Ayers, in September 2013 to stay enforcement against them in return for receiving the proceeds of the defamation case. The Commissioner said that it was a term of the agreement that they would meet their ongoing tax obligations and as they breached these conditions, she was entitled to cancel the agreement.

### Setting aside under s 290

His Honour noted that the general purpose of s 290 is to allow statutory demands to be set aside. On application under s 290(4)(a) the onus is on the applicant to show a substantial dispute, and that there is a fairly arguable basis for it to succeed. He noted that the Court does not resolve disputed questions of fact on affidavits and if there is a genuine dispute it should be more properly decided in other proceedings.

### The Commissioner’s ability to enter into agreements for the collection of taxes

The applicant’s grounds for the dispute were based on the argument that it had entered into a binding contact with the Commissioner for the payment of its tax arrears, and that the Commissioner was estopped from issuing the demand because of representations by her officers.

Associate Judge Bell stated that that there was no dispute that the Commissioner was able to enter into binding agreements under which she may accept payment of less than the full amount of tax due, and that this was consistent with ss 6(1) and 6A(2) and (3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (“TAA”). The Judge also noted that under s 7 of the TAA the Commissioner may delegate her powers, and that officers can bind the Commissioner only if they have the delegated authority to do so. His Honour said that ordinary principles of contract law, agency law and the law as to equitable estoppel apply.

### The meeting of 8 May 2013 and following events

Since 2009 the applicant had been a non-compliant taxpayer. Towards the end of 2012 the Commissioner advised that a statutory demand would be served, which occurred on 15 April 2013.

On 8 May 2013, a meeting took place between two collections officers on behalf of the Commissioner and the applicant’s director, Mr Ayers, and his tax agent. The parties disagreed as to whether a binding agreement had been reached at that meeting, with the applicant asserting that the Commissioner had agreed to cease enforcement action in return for receiving the proceeds of the defamation action. The collections officers referred to the need to obtain an appropriate undertaking from the applicant’s solicitor, which was not forthcoming.

The Judge noted that neither collections officer had the delegated authority to bind the Commissioner as the arrangement exceeded their level of financial delegation. A further meeting was held on 27 May 2013, where it was discussed that recovery options would need to be discussed with the Area Manager. Mr Ayers was also asked to supply further information, including a report from a health professional.

His Honour noted that the Commissioner’s evidence appeared more persuasive, but added that there were obstacles to the applicant’s claim that there was a binding agreement concluded on 8 May 2013. First, even Mr Ayers accepted the Commissioner’s requirements for his defamation lawyer to give an undertaking so as to assure payment of the litigation proceeds. Second, the collections officers did not have the authority to enter into an agreement binding the Commissioner given the level of unpaid taxes.

The Court held that equitable estoppel was not available as on the facts of the case there is nothing in the evidence to suggest the collections officers were clothed with any ostensible authority to bind the Commissioner, and the arrangements were always subject to obtaining the solicitor’s undertaking.

### **The meeting of 17 September 2013**

A further meeting took place on 17 September 2013 between Mr Ayers and the Group Manager Collections and Collections Principal Advisor. Mr Ayers contended that he had never conceded that the proposed arrangement from the previous meeting had ended. Mr Ayers did not accept that he entered into a new agreement on 17 September.

The Group Manager acknowledged that Mr Ayers may have left the 8 May meeting under the impression an agreement had been reached, even though Inland Revenue’s position was that none had.

Various email correspondence was exchanged between Mr Ayers and the Group Manager and, even if there was uncertainty as to what was discussed on 17 September, that was cleared up by the emails. The email exchange shows that Mr Ayers, the applicant and the Inland Revenue entered into a binding agreement. The Judge considered that there was no difficulty with questions of consideration as the agreement resolved a dispute – whether an agreement was made on 8 May 2013. Whatever prior discussions that had taken place had been replaced by a new agreement, with both Mr Ayers and the applicant being parties to the agreement giving cross-undertakings as to each other’s tax obligations.

The agreement required the following from the applicant and Mr Ayers:

1.  Ongoing compliance with tax obligations for the next 12 months;
2.  Continuing with the defamation case, which arose implicitly from the promise to pay from the litigation proceeds; and
3.  Voluntary payments as and when able.

The Court did not accept Mr Ayers’ claim that the first term was subject to a condition that his compliance was not to be impeded by his health.

### Cancellation of the agreement of September 2013

His Honour noted that the only way to cancel the agreement was for a breach under s 7 of the Contractual Remedies Act 1979 (“CRA”).

The Commissioner relied on failures to comply with tax obligations for the following 12 months as the basis for cancelling the contract. The applicant failed to file three GST returns by the due date and Mr Ayers filed his 2013 income tax return late. The Court held that in accordance with s 7(4)(a) of the CRA it was an essential term of the contract that tax obligations must be kept up to date for the next 12 months. Accordingly, it did not matter how minor the breaches were.

On 19 January 2016 the Commissioner advised the applicant that she no longer considered herself bound by the earlier agreements for payment to be deferred. The Court held that notice was appropriately given under s 8 of the CRA. As at 19 January 2016 the taxes owing under the assessments referred to earlier had not been fully paid.

The Court held that the Commissioner had not affirmed the contract in any of its subsequent correspondence.

The Court also noted that unpaid GST that had accrued in the 12 months after 17 September 2013 was not part of the moratorium for the historic debt under agreement, and the Commissioner was entitled to recover it without first cancelling the agreement.

### The applicant’s estoppel argument

The applicant argued that the respondent was estopped from serving the statutory demand because of the representations made in the September 2013 meeting, that the applicant had acted to its detriment in continuing with the defamation proceeding and incurred legal costs. The Judge concluded that any estoppel argument would fail in light of the respondent’s entitlement to cancel the contract and no longer be bound by any representations she had made. Further, the meeting also set expectations for the applicant (to meet its ongoing tax obligations for the next 12 months) and when it failed to meet those expectations, in circumstances where the Commissioner was entitled to cancel the agreement, it cannot be unconscionable for the Commissioner to move from the arrangement made.

His Honour concluded he was not persuaded that there was a substantial dispute under s 290(4)(a) of the Act whether the debt is owing or due.

### Counterclaim under s 290(4)(b)

The applicant also raised a counterclaim against the Commissioner for lost earnings as a result of the Commissioner’s breach of the alleged May 2013 agreement by filing and serving a liquidation application in June 2013. The Court held that as this was raised for the first time in the applicant’s submissions, the Commissioner would be prejudiced by this issue being raised late. His Honour further noted that the claim was implausible on questions of causation and damage, as the report from the health professional included in Mr Ayers’ affidavit was that Mr Ayers had said that the initial defamation (2-3 years earlier) had had a serious effect on the company and Mr Ayers’ health problems had also affected its business for some time already. His Honour noted that this was against very heavy tax liabilities that were long overdue. The Court considered that any suggestion that the Commissioner caused the downfall of the company by her liquidation application is fanciful.

### Other grounds under s 290(4)(c)

The applicant asserted that the statutory demand was an abuse of process.

The Judge noted that the applicant had been in default of its tax obligations since 2009. The Court further noted that any difficulties in funding litigation and taxes were there at the time before the statutory demand in April 2013 and the demand did not cause any difficulties, it merely exposed them. The Court concluded that there were no circumstances that made it unjust for non-compliance with the demand to lead to a presumption of insolvency.

### Decision

The Court held that:

1.  1.  The application to set aside the statutory demand was dismissed.
    2.  Under s 291(1)(a) of the Act, the applicant is to pay the Commissioner $343,182.30 by 24 February 2017.
    3.  The time for complying with the statutory demand expires on 24 February 2017.
    4.  The applicant is to pay the costs of the application.

Unsuccessful claim for recovery of a statutory debt owing under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act, unsuccessful application for judicial review
==========================================================================================================================================================

2013 case note - Unsuccessful claim for recovery of a statutory debt owing under section 46 of the GST Act and unsuccessful application for judicial review.

Case

Inbound Tour Services Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue

Legislative References

Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, Limitation Act 1950, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The taxpayer was unsuccessful in its claim for a statutory debt owing as the Court held the Commissioner of Inland Revenue ("the Commissioner") had not breached her obligations under section 46 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 ("GST Act"). The grounds for Judicial Review were rejected.

### Impact of decision

The complicated and somewhat unusual facts in this case limit the implication of the decision on section 46 of the GST Act.

### Facts

In 2000 Ernst and Young ("EY") approached a number of inbound tour operators ("ITOs"), including Inbound Tour Services South Pacific Limited ("ITS"). EY advised ITS that it had formed a view that a proposed legislative amendment to the GST Act (the proposed introduction of section 11 (2A) of the GST Act 1985, introduced by section 80 of the Taxation (Remedial Matters) Act with application on or after 20 May 1999 and later renumbered to section 11A(2)) meant that members of the ITO industry should have been zero-rating travel packages sold to overseas clients.

Consequently, ITS claimed a goods and services tax ("GST") refund of $545,255.48 for GST accounted for between 1993 and 20 May 1999.

A section 46 letter was sent to the taxpayer's agent on the 15th working day but was not received until some days later. As this occurred prior to _Commissioner of Inland Revenue v Sea Hunter Fishing Ltd_ (2002) 20 NZTC 17,478 (CA)("_Sea Hunter_")_,_ all parties were of the view that section 46 of the GST Act had been complied with. However, the taxpayer's agent was told verbally by Inland Revenue staff that there would be an investigation into the GST return within the 15-day period.

A number of similar GST claims were made by other members of the ITO industry and a fiscal risk of $150–$200 million was identified. An ITO project was commenced by Inland Revenue and advice sought from the Solicitor General. Following consultation, a decision was made by Parliament that, to avoid doubt, the amendment to the GST Act would be made retrospective. The retrospective legislation contained a "savings provision" (section 241(6) of the Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001). The effect of the retrospective legislation was that the GST refunds claimed by members of the ITO industry (including ITS) would not be payable as claimed. However, a decision was made that the ITO industry's profit margin (known as the "facilitation fee") could be zero rated.

Accordingly, the Commissioner entered into two "agreed adjustments" with ITS, one to record that the original GST claim of $545,255.48 would not be paid and the second agreement recorded an agreement for a partial GST refund of $119,000 for ITS's facilitation fee.

ITS filed proceedings against the Commissioner in 2012 for a statutory debt owing due to a breach of section 46 of the GST Act and for Judicial Review.

### Decision

#### _Limitation Act_

The Commissioner filed an amended Statement of Defence and sought leave to raise a defence based on the application of the Limitation Act 1950 to ITS's claim after the close of pleadings.

Ronald Young J allowed the Commissioner to raise the Limitation Act defence but held section 163 acted to "effectively disengage" (paragraph 70 of the judgment) the Limitation Act. His Honour rejected the Commissioner's argument that section 163 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") only applied to the Commissioner's power to recover tax and did not apply to the current case (being a claim for a statutory debt). His Honour found that the plain wording of section 163 did not suggest its application was limited to the Commissioner, and that the other provisions in Part 10 of the TAA suggested section 163 applied to taxpayers and the Commissioner alike. His Honour also agreed with ITS's counsel that section 45 of the GST Act acted as a limitation period, so that section 33 of the Limitation Act 1950 (which states that the Limitation Act will not apply where an enactment prescribes its own limitation period) applied.

**_Breach of section 46 GST Act_**

Section 46 of the GST Act requires that once the Commissioner receives a GST refund, she must either pay the GST refund claimed or notify the taxpayer that an investigation will be conducted or request further information from the taxpayer within 15 working days (under section 46 of the GST Act). At the time ITS's refund was claimed, the Commissioner believed the requirements of section 46 were complied with if the Commissioner sent the required notification to the taxpayer by the 15th day. The later decision in _SeaHunter_ held that this was incorrect and Inland Revenue has since changed its practice. ITS claimed that because they had not received notification of a further investigation of the GST return within 15 working days of filing their return, the Commissioner had breached section 46 and was required to pay the GST refund to ITS.

His Honour referred to the fact that notification given under section 46(5) of the GST Act did not have to be in writing in 2001 (paragraph 114 of the judgment). His Honour held that notification had been given within the timeframe so the Commissioner had complied with section 46(5) of the GST Act. His Honour referred to the policy behind section 46 of the GST Act (at paragraphs 96-97) as outlined in _Contract Pacific v CIR_ \[2010\] NZSC 136 and to the evidence of the correspondence between the Commissioner and EY. This showed that EY had known a refund was unlikely to be paid within 15 days from the outset and had expected the Commissioner to make a comprehensive review of the GST claim.

#### _Retrospective legislation and the savings provision_

Section 11A(2) of the GST Act, as retrospectively enacted, confirmed that GST would be payable where the performance of service would be received in New Zealand. The Taxation (Taxpayer Assessment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 ("TAMP Act") also contained a "savings provision".

His Honour found the purpose of the savings provision must have been to ensure that taxpayers who had received a refund would be entitled to keep the refund and that the savings provision applied to claims "affirmatively approved by the Commissioner", and not refunds which were generated by the Commissioner's legislative obligation under section 46. His Honour stated that even if ITS had received the refund after 15 working days, they would have known that (pending investigation) they may not retain the refund. His Honour held that while the Commissioner processed the GST return she did not assess whether ITS was entitled to it on the merits before the enactment of the TAMP Act, and so the savings provision does not apply (paragraphs 156 - 158 of the judgment).

#### _Judicial Review_

ITS applied for Judicial Review on a number of grounds. The Commissioner argued that Judicial Review was not available to ITS, as following the decision in _Tannadyce Investments Ltd v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2011\] NZSC 158; \[2012\] 2 NZLR 153 ("_Tannadyce_")_,_ Judicial Review in tax disputes is only available in "exceptionally rare cases".

His Honour agreed that the effect of _Tannadyce_ is that Judicial Review will only be available in "exceptionally rare cases" but held that by entering into the Agreed Adjustments, the disputes resolution process was no longer available to ITS, therefore Judicial Review was available to it. His Honour then went on to consider each of the grounds of Judicial Review as alleged.

_(a) Natural justice and procedural fairness_

ITS claimed the Commissioner failed to disclose that the savings provision could apply to ITS and that the Commissioner did not consider ITS fell within the provision, and that ITS could receive the partial refund without forfeiting the right to the full amount.

His Honour found the Commissioner had always maintained that the savings provision did not apply to ITS, and there was nothing to suggest the Commissioner had ever thought the savings provision could apply to ITS. The Commissioner considered the agreed adjustments reflected the law, and ITS had received independent legal advice.

ITS also claimed that the Commissioner breached natural justice by saying if the refund was paid, it would be before March 2001 (when the TAMP Act was enacted).

His Honour found that there was no reviewable error. The comment allegedly made was an unreviewable comment, and not an undertaking (paragraphs 187 - 188 of the judgment).

_(b) Maladministration_

ITS claimed the Commissioner deliberately deferred payment of the refund to prevent the savings provision applying to ITS, because while the Commissioner had all the information to make the decision by February 2001, the Commissioner did not make a decision until May of the same year.

His Honour found that the Commissioner had complied with section 46 of the GST Act and so could not have acted with maladministration. He also found the Commissioner's decision to freeze all GST claims that were under investigation was innocuous (paragraphs 196-197 of the judgment).

Update on Hidden Economy real estate campaign
=============================================

**21 June 2022**

The Inland Revenue campaign focussing on the real estate sector has resulted in a drop in the amount of private expenses claims being made.

IR expanded its hidden economy focus to include the real estate sector last year, concerned at both the under reporting of income and the overstating of expenses.

IRs Hidden Economy Lead, Trevor Jeffries, says with more than 90% of the expected returns filed for 2021, IR has run its data analytics and compared the results to earlier tax years.

"What the analysis tells us is that the trend we identified of increasing private expenses being claimed has been reversed and we are now seeing less private expenditure being claimed," Trevor Jeffries says.

Inland Revenue started the campaign because a number of real estate agents appeared to be:

*   claiming private expenses against their business income and/or claiming expenses without supporting business records
*   using net versus gross values when reporting GST
*   not including wage subsidy payments received within their annual income tax return.

"IR has monitored and reviewed 2021 tax returns that fell outside industry norms. Common errors include claims for gifts, personal clothing and grooming, meals, and entertainment expenses, alongside issues such as calculation of home office and vehicle expenses.

"Another common error was the underreporting of income for GST purposes, where customers incorrectly used the net amount deposited to their bank account as income for GST purposes.

"If we are concerned that someone has overclaimed expenses, they will receive a letter from us requesting they prove the expenses claimed. That 'proof' can include things like bank statements, invoices, a logbook, and any other information to confirm the expense is deductible.

"Only a small number have been referred for audit action. Prosecution is an option of last resort."

Mr Jeffries says he has no doubt real estate agents are well aware of our campaign and have had the opportunity to see our marketing and educational materials to make it easier for them to file correct returns.

"We have had tremendous support from real estate firms and continue to work with them to support their agents. Our online and live webinars have proved a hit and we have been encouraged by the engagement and questions that flow from these sessions.

"Our expectation is that agents should now be well aware of the common errors and how to file correct return. However, we will continue to use our data analytics to monitor 2022 returns as they are filed, and where necessary we will take the take appropriate enforcement action.

"Our approach is to raise awareness and self-help materials first. We would far rather encourage customers to do the right thing from the start. So, we recommend people approach us before we contact them."

Revised Guidance Related to Obtaining and Reporting Taxpayer Identification Numbers and Dates of Birth by Financial Institutions Notice 2017-46 I. PURPOSE This Notice provides procedures for certain foreign financial institutions (FFIs) required to report U.S. taxpayer identification numbers (U.S. TINs) for certain accounts under a Model 1 intergovernmental agreement (IGA). If such FFIs comply with the procedures described in this Notice, then the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not determine that there is significant non-compliance with the obligations under a Model 1 IGA solely as a result of a failure to report U.S. TINs associated with the FFI’s U.S. reportable accounts maintained as of the determination date specified in the applicable Model 1 IGA. This Notice also announces that the Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the IRS intend to amend certain provisions of the temporary regulations under chapter 3 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). The amendments would provide limitations on, and a phase-in of, the requirement for certain withholding agents to obtain and report the taxpayer identification number issued by an account - 2 - holder’s jurisdiction of tax residence (Foreign TIN) and, for an account holder that is an individual, the account holder’s date of birth. The changes described in this Notice are intended to facilitate an orderly implementation of the obligation to obtain and report taxpayer identification numbers. II. BACKGROUND On March 18, 2010, the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-147, 124 Stat. 71 (2010) (HIRE Act), added chapter 4 of Subtitle A (chapter 4), comprised of sections 1471 through 1474, to the Code. Chapter 4 (commonly known as the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA) addresses non- compliance by U.S. taxpayers holding foreign financial accounts or assets. FATCA requires certain FFIs to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers or foreign entities in which U.S. taxpayers hold certain ownership interests. In order to facilitate the exchange of information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers, the Treasury Department collaborated with foreign governments to develop two alternative model IGAs (Model 1 IGA and Model 2 IGA) that are intended to provide an effective and efficient means for complying with FATCA while reducing the burden FATCA compliance imposes on financial institutions. The Model 1 IGA provides that a reporting Model 1 FFI will report certain information on U.S. reportable accounts maintained by the FFI to the partner jurisdiction tax authority, which will automatically exchange such information with the U.S. Competent Authority. - 3 - On January 17, 2013, the Treasury Department and the IRS published final regulations under chapter 4 (T.D. 9610, 78 F.R. 5873) (2013 final chapter 4 regulations). On March 6, 2014, the Treasury Department and the IRS published temporary regulations under chapter 4 (T.D. 9657, 79 F.R. 12812) (2014 temporary chapter 4 regulations). On March 6, 2014, the Treasury Department and the IRS also published temporary regulations under chapters 3 and 61 and section 3406 (T.D. 9658, 79 F.R. 12726) (temporary coordination regulations) to coordinate the regulations under those provisions with the 2013 final chapter 4 regulations and the 2014 temporary chapter 4 regulations. On January 6, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS published final regulations under chapter 3 (T.D. 9808, 82 F.R. 2046) (final chapter 3 regulations) and chapter 4 (T.D. 9809, 82 F.R. 2124) (final chapter 4 regulations), which generally incorporated the 2014 temporary chapter 4 regulations and the temporary coordination regulations. At the same time, the Treasury Department and the IRS published temporary regulations under chapter 3 (temporary chapter 3 regulations) and chapter 4 to supplement certain provisions of the final chapter 3 regulations and the final chapter 4 regulations. III. REQUIREMENT FOR REPORTING MODEL 1 FFIS TO REPORT U.S. TINS A. Background Each Model 1 IGA provides that a reporting Model 1 FFI shall be treated as complying with, and not subject to withholding under, section 1471 of the Code if the partner jurisdiction complies with its obligations under the IGA with respect to such financial institution and such financial institution complies with its reporting and - 4 - registration obligations in accordance with the IGA. Each Model 1 IGA also provides that the United States shall not require a reporting Model 1 FFI to withhold tax under section 1471 or 1472 of the Code with respect to an account held by a recalcitrant account holder (as defined in section 1471(d)(6) of the Code) or to close such account if the U.S. Competent Authority receives certain information specified in the Model 1 IGA with respect to such account. The information required to be reported by a reporting Model 1 FFI includes the U.S. TIN of each specified U.S. person that is an account holder and, in the case of a non- U.S. entity with one or more specified U.S. persons who are controlling persons, the U.S. TIN of each controlling person (required U.S. TINs). Notwithstanding this reporting requirement, before 2017, a reporting Model 1 FFI was not required to report a required U.S. TIN for an account maintained as of the determination date specified in the applicable Model 1 IGA (preexisting account) that is a U.S. reportable account if the U.S. TIN was not in the reporting Model 1 FFI’s records. Similarly, a reporting Model 1 FFI was required to report the date of birth only if the date of birth was in the reporting Model 1 FFI’s records. Partner jurisdictions have committed to establish rules for 2017 and subsequent years requiring reporting Model 1 FFIs to obtain and report the required U.S. TINs for such accounts. Each Model 1 IGA requires that the partner jurisdiction obtain and exchange the information specified in the Model 1 IGA (including each required U.S. TIN) with respect to each U.S. reportable account. The suspension of withholding under sections 1471 - 5 - and 1472 of the Code pursuant to each Model 1 IGA is conditioned on adequate reporting and exchange of information. If a reporting Model 1 FFI fails to report required U.S. TINs for U.S. reportable accounts, the U.S. Competent Authority may notify the partner jurisdiction competent authority that there is significant non-compliance with respect to the reporting Model 1 FFI, in accordance with the Model 1 IGA. If the reporting Model 1 FFI remains noncompliant for 18 months after such notification, under the relevant Model 1 IGA, the United States may treat the reporting Model 1 FFI as a nonparticipating financial institution that is subject to withholding under section 1471 of the Code. B. U.S. TIN Reporting by Reporting Model 1 FFIs The Treasury Department and the IRS understand that some reporting Model 1 FFIs need additional time to implement practices and procedures to obtain and report required U.S. TINs for preexisting accounts that are U.S. reportable accounts. Accordingly, with respect to reporting on preexisting accounts that are U.S. reportable accounts, for calendar years 2017, 2018, and 2019, the U.S. Competent Authority will not determine that there is significant non-compliance with the obligations under an applicable Model 1 IGA with respect to a reporting Model 1 FFI solely because of a failure to obtain and report each required U.S. TIN, provided that the reporting Model 1 FFI: (1) obtains and reports the date of birth of each account holder and controlling person whose U.S. TIN is not reported; (2) requests annually from each account holder any missing required U.S. TIN; and (3) before reporting information that relates to calendar year 2017 to the partner jurisdiction, searches electronically searchable data - 6 - maintained by the reporting Model 1 FFI for any missing required U.S. TINs. The IRS expects to provide further instructions regarding appropriate reporting for the TIN data element for preexisting accounts that are U.S. reportable accounts with missing required U.S. TINs. Reporting Model 1 FFIs should implement practices and procedures promptly to ensure that financial accounts are documented in accordance with the applicable Model 1 IGA and that U.S. reportable accounts are adequately and timely reported in future years. Nothing in this Notice affects a reporting Model 1 FFI’s obligations under chapter 3 or 61 with respect to a reportable amount or reportable payment. IV. REQUIREMENT TO OBTAIN AND REPORT FOREIGN TINS AND DATES OF BIRTH A. Background Before the temporary chapter 3 regulations were published, the instructions for Forms W-8BEN and W-8BEN-E and the Instructions for the Requester of Forms W- 8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP, and W-8IMY outlined circumstances under which the person providing the form was required to provide a Foreign TIN and, for an individual, a date of birth. The instructions for Form 1042-S, “Foreign Person’s U.S. Source Income Subject to Withholding,” for calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016 described circumstances under which certain withholding agents were required to report these additional items of information on Form 1042-S. The temporary chapter 3 regulations provide additional changes to the temporary coordination regulations that modified the due diligence and reporting obligations of - 7 - withholding agents. In particular, the temporary chapter 3 regulations generally incorporate the requirement from the aforementioned form instructions for certain withholding agents to obtain and report the Foreign TINs of their account holders and, in the case of an individual account holder, a date of birth. These revisions were made to ensure, in part, that the IRS would have adequate information about foreign account holders to facilitate the exchange of foreign account holder information pursuant to an agreement authorizing or requiring the exchange of such information. Section 1.1441- 1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) provides that, beginning January 1, 2017, a beneficial owner withholding certificate provided to document an account maintained at a U.S. branch or office of a withholding agent that is a financial institution is required to contain the account holder’s Foreign TIN and, in the case of an individual account holder, the account holder’s date of birth in order for the withholding agent to treat the withholding certificate as valid. For withholding certificates associated with payments made on or after January 1, 2018, an account holder that does not provide a Foreign TIN must provide a reasonable explanation for its absence in order for the withholding certificate not to be considered invalid under §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B). The temporary chapter 3 regulations also provide that if the withholding certificate does not contain the account holder’s date of birth and the withholding agent has the date of birth in its files, the withholding certificate will not be considered invalid. For calendar year 2017, the instructions for Form 1042-S provide that a withholding agent that is a U.S. office or branch of a financial institution is required to report on - 8 - Form 1042-S a recipient’s Foreign TIN when the recipient has furnished documentation that provides a Foreign TIN. The instructions provide that, beginning for the 2017 calendar year, the withholding agent is also required to report on Form 1042-S an individual recipient’s date of birth when the recipient has furnished documentation that provides a date of birth or the recipient’s date of birth is identified in any of the withholding agent’s files. B. Revised Scope and Phased-In Timeline of Requirements for Certain Withholding Agents to Obtain and Report the Foreign TIN and Date of Birth of Account Holders After the publication of the temporary chapter 3 regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS received comments from withholding agents regarding the difficulty in obtaining and reporting Foreign TINs and dates of birth from account holders in the time provided. In response to these comments, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to narrow the circumstances in which a Foreign TIN and date of birth are required, as described in sections IV.B.1 and IV.B.2 of this Notice; to provide exceptions from the Foreign TIN requirement for certain account holders, as described in section IV.B.3 of this Notice; and to provide a phase-in of the rules for obtaining a Foreign TIN, as described in section IV.B.4 of this Notice. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide relief from obtaining a date of birth with respect to certain withholding certificates signed before January 1, 2018, as described in section IV.B.5 of this Notice. - 9 - For purposes of this section IV, the term “withholding certificate” means Forms W- 8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W-8EXP and, with respect to a qualified intermediary acting as a qualified derivatives dealer (QDD) claiming treaty benefits for dividends, Form W-8IMY. The term “withholding agent” when used in this section IV refers to a withholding agent that is a U.S. branch or office of a financial institution (as defined in section IV.B.1 of this Notice). 1. Accounts and Financial Institutions to Which §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) Applies The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) to clarify that the term “account holder” has the meaning described in §1.1471-5(a)(3) and that the term “account” means a financial account, as defined in §1.1471-5(b) (substituting “U.S. office or branch of a financial institution” for “FFI”). In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) to clarify that the term “financial institution” means an entity that is a depository institution, custodial institution, investment entity, or a specified insurance company, each as defined in §1.1471-5(e). 2. Payments to Which §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) Applies Section 1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) provides that a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) and a date of birth (for an individual) are required for withholding certificates associated with “payments,” which includes any payments under sections 1441 through 1446, chapter 4, and chapter 61 (due to references in those sections and chapters to beneficial owner - 10 - withholding certificates used to establish foreign status). The Treasury Department and the IRS believe that it is not necessary for a withholding agent to obtain a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) or (for an individual) a date of birth on a withholding certificate that the withholding agent obtains solely to avoid Form 1099 reporting and backup withholding or in other cases where a payment associated with a withholding certificate is not otherwise subject to reporting on Form 1042-S. Therefore, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) to limit its scope for this purpose such that a withholding certificate is required to be treated as invalid under §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) only for payments of U.S. source income reportable on Form 1042-S (before the application of §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B)). Due to this limitation, a withholding agent will not, for example, be required to withhold under section 3406 on gross proceeds paid to an individual account holder as a result of the application of the section 1441 presumption rules when the account holder provides a withholding certificate that is valid but for the absence of a Foreign TIN and the account holder’s date of birth. 3. Exceptions from Foreign TIN Requirement for Certain Accounts i. Accounts Held by Residents in Jurisdictions With Which the United States Does Not Have an Agreement Relating to the Exchange of Tax Information in Force The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that a withholding agent is not required to obtain a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why an account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) for an account held by a resident in a jurisdiction that does not have in effect with - 11 - the United States an income tax or other convention or bilateral agreement relating to the exchange of tax information within the meaning of section 6103(k)(4) of the Code pursuant to which the United States agrees to provide, as well as receive, tax information. This limitation is consistent with the limitation on the information reporting requirement in §1.6049-8(a) on U.S. source deposit interest paid to nonresident alien individuals. A list of jurisdictions that a withholding agent is required to reference for purposes of the limitation on reporting under §§1.6049-8(a) and 1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) (as revised in accordance with this Notice) is published in section 3 of Revenue Procedure 2014-64, 2014-53 I.R.B. 1022, as supplemented by Revenue Procedure 2016-56, 2016-52 I.R.B. 920, and which may be further updated in future published guidance. If the Treasury Department and the IRS further supplement the list of jurisdictions in section 3 of Revenue Procedure 2014-64, subject to the limitations described in this Notice, a withholding agent must obtain the Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why an account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) of each account holder resident in any such jurisdiction before the time for filing Form 1042-S (with any applicable extension) for the calendar year following the calendar year in which the jurisdiction is added to the list. ii. Accounts Held by Residents in Jurisdictions That Do Not Issue Foreign TINs The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) to provide that a withholding agent is not required to obtain a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why an account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) for an - 12 - account held by a resident of a jurisdiction that has been identified by the IRS on a list of jurisdictions that do not issue Foreign TINs to their residents. A list of such jurisdictions (when made available) may be viewed at www.irs.gov/FATCA . As of the date of this Notice, the following jurisdictions have been identified as ones that do not issue Foreign TINs to residents and that will be included on the list: Bermuda British Virgin Islands Cayman Islands Taxpayers may rely on the jurisdictions identified above for purposes of this Notice. The IRS intends to update this list to add jurisdictions that do not issue Foreign TINs (after consultation with the competent authority of any such additional jurisdiction), including in response to taxpayer comments that identify additional jurisdictions that do not issue Foreign TINs. The list maintained by the IRS of jurisdictions that do not issue Foreign TINs to residents will also be updated if a jurisdiction included on the list begins to issue Foreign TINs to its residents. iii. Accounts Held by a Government, International Organization, Foreign Central Bank of Issue, or Resident of a U.S. Territory The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend §1.1441-1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) to provide that a withholding agent is not required to obtain an account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder has not been issued a Foreign TIN) if the withholding agent has obtained an otherwise valid withholding certificate on which it can rely under the section 1441 regulations to treat the account - 13 - holder as a government, an international organization, a foreign central bank of issue, or a resident of a U.S. territory. 4. Phase-In of Requirement to Obtain a Foreign TIN Under §1.1441- 1T(e)(2)(ii)(B) The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide additional time for a withholding agent to comply with the requirement to obtain a Foreign TIN. As described in more detail below, this section IV.B.4 describes how the requirement to obtain a Foreign TIN under the temporary chapter 3 regulations will be phased in over a period ending on December 31, 2019. Section IV.B.4.i of this Notice provides rules that will apply to withholding certificates signed on or after January 1, 2018, including rules for determining whether a withholding agent may rely on a Foreign TIN provided on a withholding certificate. Sections IV.B.4.ii, iii, and iv of this Notice generally provide rules for determining the validity of a withholding certificate without a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) signed before January 1, 2018, during the phase-in period. Section IV.B.4.v of this Notice provides an alternative procedure for obtaining a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) for a withholding certificate signed before January 1, 2018. If a withholding agent obtains the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) in accordance with the alternative procedure (rather than obtaining a new withholding certificate), an otherwise valid withholding certificate will remain valid after the end of - 14 - the phase-in period until the earlier of when its validity period ends or it otherwise becomes invalid. i. Withholding Certificates Signed On or After January 1, 2018 The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that a withholding certificate signed on or after January 1, 2018, by an account holder (other than an account holder excepted under section IV.B.3 of this Notice) to document an account maintained at a U.S. branch or office of a withholding agent must contain a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN). The Treasury Department and the IRS also intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that a withholding agent may rely on the account holder’s Foreign TIN unless the withholding agent has actual knowledge or reason to know (as described in §1.1441-7(b)(2)) that the Foreign TIN is incorrect. Therefore, a withholding agent will not be required to validate the format or other specifications of the Foreign TIN against the applicable jurisdiction’s TIN system. For purposes of §1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(D) (prescribing the requirements for a change in circumstances), a withholding agent’s reason to know that a Foreign TIN is incorrect will include a notification from the account holder of a new residence address outside the jurisdiction provided on the withholding certificate. The temporary chapter 3 regulations provide that if an account holder does not have a Foreign TIN, the account holder is required to provide a reasonable explanation for its absence (for example, that the jurisdiction of residence does not issue TINs). This - 15 - requirement will be clarified in the regulations to specify that the reasonable explanation must address why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN to the extent provided in the instructions for, as applicable, Forms W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E, W-8ECI, W- 8EXP, and, for a QDD claiming treaty benefits for dividends, Form W-8IMY. Those instructions have each been amended (with revision dates of June or July 2017) to provide that a reasonable explanation for why an account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN is a statement that the account holder is not legally required to obtain a Foreign TIN. If an account holder provides an explanation other than the one described in those instructions, the withholding agent must determine whether the explanation is reasonable. A withholding agent will be permitted to rely on a reasonable explanation unless it has actual knowledge that the account holder has a Foreign TIN. In addition, if a withholding agent maintains an account on December 31, 2017, that is documented with a valid withholding certificate as of that date, the withholding agent’s reason to know that a Foreign TIN is incorrect, or actual knowledge that an account holder has a Foreign TIN despite providing an explanation, is limited to electronically searchable information (as defined in §1.1471-1(b)(38)) that is in the withholding agent’s files. ii. Withholding Certificates for Payments Made Before January 1, 2018 The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that an otherwise valid withholding certificate will not be treated as invalid for payments made to the account holder before January 1, 2018, solely - 16 - because the withholding certificate does not include the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN). iii. Withholding Certificates Signed Before January 1, 2018, That Have a Three-Year Validity Period The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that an otherwise valid withholding certificate signed before January 1, 2018, that has a three-year validity period under §§1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(A) and 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(A) will not be treated as invalid for payments made on or after January 1, 2018, solely because the withholding certificate does not include the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN), until the time provided in this section IV.B.4.iii. Such a withholding certificate will be treated as invalid for purposes of this section IV.B.4.iii for payments made after the earlier of (1) December 31, 2019; (2) the expiration date of the validity period of the withholding certificate; or (3) if applicable, the date when a change in circumstances requiring a revised withholding certificate occurs. However, for payments made after December 31, 2019, a withholding agent may rely on the alternative procedure described in section IV.B.4.v of this Notice to obtain a Foreign TIN (or reasonable explanation). iv. Withholding Certificates Signed Before January 1, 2018, That Have an Indefinite Validity Period The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide that an otherwise valid withholding certificate signed before January 1, 2018, that is indefinitely valid under §§1.1441-1(e)(4)(ii)(B) and 1.1471- - 17 - 3(c)(6)(ii)(B) will not be treated as invalid for payments made on or after January 1, 2018, solely because the withholding certificate does not include the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN), until the time provided in this section IV.B.4.iv. Such a withholding certificate will be treated as invalid for purposes of this section IV.B.4.iv for payments made after the earlier of (1) December 31, 2019, or (2) if applicable, the date when a change in circumstances requiring a revised withholding certificate occurs. However, for payments made after December 31, 2019, a withholding agent may rely on the alternative procedure described in section IV.B.4.v of this Notice to obtain a Foreign TIN (or reasonable explanation). v. Alternative Procedure for Obtaining and Associating Foreign TINs with Withholding Certificates Signed Before January 1, 2018 An otherwise valid withholding certificate that does not include the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) signed before January 1, 2018, will continue to remain valid for payments made after December 31, 2019, if the withholding agent (1) obtains from the account holder its Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) on a written statement (including a written statement transmitted by email) that the withholding agent associates with the account holder’s withholding certificate; or (2) otherwise has the account holder’s Foreign TIN in the withholding agent’s files and the withholding agent associates the account holder’s Foreign TIN with the account holder’s withholding certificate. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, - 18 - an otherwise valid withholding certificate signed before January 1, 2018, that does not include the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or reasonable explanation) ceases to be valid for payments made after the earlier of the expiration date of the validity period of such withholding certificate (in the case of a withholding certificate with a three-year validity period) or the date when a withholding agent determines that a revised withholding certificate is otherwise required (if applicable), and the withholding agent must obtain on a new withholding certificate the account holder’s Foreign TIN (or reasonable explanation). A withholding agent’s reliance on a Foreign TIN (or a reasonable explanation for why the account holder was not issued a Foreign TIN) obtained pursuant to the alternative procedure is subject to the standards of knowledge described in section IV.B.4.i of this Notice for a withholding certificate. 5. Requirement to Obtain Date of Birth The temporary chapter 3 regulations provide that an otherwise valid withholding certificate that does not contain the account holder’s date of birth will not be considered invalid if the withholding agent has the account holder’s date of birth in its files. The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to provide an exception to this requirement such that an otherwise valid withholding certificate signed before January 1, 2018, will not be treated as invalid for payments made before January 1, 2019, to an account holder that is an individual, solely because the withholding certificate does not include the account holder’s date of birth and the date of birth is not in the withholding agent’s files. This allowance is provided to give - 19 - withholding agents additional time to comply with the date of birth requirement for withholding certificates signed before January 1, 2018. In addition, the Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the temporary chapter 3 regulations to clarify that a withholding agent will be considered to have the account holder’s date of birth in its files if it obtains the date of birth on a written statement (including a written statement transmitted by email) from the account holder. C. Form 1042-S Reporting The IRS intends to revise the instructions for Form 1042-S to provide that, beginning with reporting for calendar year 2018, a withholding agent must report on each Form 1042-S required to be filed with respect to a financial account maintained at a U.S. branch or office of the withholding agent the account holder’s Foreign TIN in any of the following cases: (1) the account holder has furnished to the withholding agent a withholding certificate that includes its Foreign TIN; (2) the withholding agent has obtained the Foreign TIN under the alternative procedure described in section IV.B.4.v of this Notice; or (3) the withholding agent has identified the account holder’s Foreign TIN in any of the withholding agent’s electronically searchable information (as defined in §1.1471-1(b)(38)). The instructions for Form 1042-S for calendar year 2017 will be revised with respect to withholding certificates furnished on or after January 1, 2017, to require the reporting of an individual account holder’s date of birth if the date of birth is on the withholding certificate or is available in the withholding agent’s electronically searchable information - 20 - (as defined in §1.1471-1(b)(38)). Furthermore, beginning with reporting for calendar year 2018, the instructions for Form 1042-S will require the reporting of an individual account holder’s date of birth if the date of birth is on the withholding certificate or is identified in any of the withholding agent’s files. Penalties for failure to comply with reporting obligations may apply to a failure to report an account holder’s Foreign TIN or an individual account holder’s date of birth on Form 1042-S to the extent the instructions for Form 1042-S require such information to be reported. V. TAXPAYER RELIANCE Before the issuance of the amendments to the temporary chapter 3 regulations described in section IV of this Notice, taxpayers may rely on the provisions of this Notice regarding the content of the amendments. VI. DRAFTING INFORMATION The principal author of this Notice is Kamela Nelan of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (International).

Determination - Use of fair dividend rate method for a type of attributing interest in a foreign investment fund
================================================================================================================

Covers NZ investors' ability to use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from a type of attributing interest in a FIF.

### Determination

### Reference

This determination is made under section 91AAO(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This power has been delegated by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to the Deputy Commissioner, Policy, under section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

### Discussion (which does not form part of the determination)

Units in a non-resident issuer to which this determination applies are an attributing interest in a FIF for NewZealand resident investors. New Zealand resident investors are required to apply the foreign investment fund rules to determine their tax liability in respect of their units in the non-resident issuer each year.

Due to the presence of specified lock-in thresholds, section EX 40(9) of the Act applies to units in the non-resident issuer and prevents use of the fair dividend rate method in the absence of a determination under section 91AAO of the Tax Administration Act 1994.

Despite the presence of specified lock-in thresholds, I consider that it is appropriate for New Zealand resident investors in this arrangement to use the fair dividend rate method. The overall arrangement (as described to me by the applicant) contains sufficient risk so that it is not akin to a New Zealand dollar-denominated debt instrument that effectively provides guaranteed returns.

### Scope of determination

The investments to which this determination applies are units in a non-resident issuer which:

1.  is one of the Credit Suisse PL100 series of trusts;
2.  is a unit trust constituted under New South Wales law;
3.  issues New Zealand dollar denominated units (not being fixed rate shares or non-participating redeemable shares) to New Zealand resident investors;
4.  indirectly offers New Zealand resident investors the benefit of capital protection and rising capital protection;
5.  invests proceeds from the issue of units in a physical basket of securities upon which dividends may be paid;
6.  converts any dividends derived from the physical basket of securities to New Zealand dollars and distributes such dividends to New Zealand resident investors from time to time; and enters into a specified call and put option arrangement in relation to a hedging portfolio.

### Interpretation

In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires-  
"Capital protection" means an arrangement under which an investor receives an amount from the issuer equal to the New Zealand dollar issue price for each unit held by the investor at maturity;

"Fixed rate share" means a fixed rate share under sectionLF 2(3) of the Act;

"Hedging portfolio" means a notional portfolio of shares and fixed income securities that requires 25% minimum participation in notional share investments at all times;

"Non-participating redeemable share" means a non-participating redeemable share under section CD 14(9) of the Act;

"Non-resident" means a person that is not resident in NewZealand for the purposes of the Act;

"Physical basket of securities" means a portfolio of shares or other securities physically held by the issuer;

"Rising capital protection" means an arrangement under which an investor receives an amount from the issuer which exceeds the New Zealand dollar issue price for each unit held at maturity if any specified lock-in threshold is reached, irrespective of the value of the issuer's underlying investments at maturity;

"Specified call and put option arrangement" means an arrangement consisting of two separate option contracts entered into simultaneously by the issuer and a counterparty under which:

1.  the issuer is able to transfer the physical basket to the counterparty in exchange for an amount equal to the value of the hedging portfolio (in New Zealand dollars) if the value of the hedging portfolio at maturity (less a portfolio fee) is equal to or greater than the value of the physical basket; and
2.  the counterparty is able to require the issuer to pay the counterparty the shortfall in value between the physical basket and the hedging portfolio (in New Zealand dollars) if the value of the hedging portfolio at maturity (less a portfolio fee) is less than the value of the physical basket;

"Specified lock-in threshold" means the level of growth in value of the hedging portfolio (adjusted downwards for dividends paid to investors on their units), expressed as a percentage of the value of the hedging portfolio at the commencement of the investment term, which is determined by the issuer at the commencement of the investment term to be a specified lock-in threshold;

"The Act" means the Income Tax Act 2004.

### Determination

An attributing interest in a FIF to which this determination applies is a type of attributing interest for which a person may use the fair dividend rate method to calculate FIF income from the interest.

### Application date

This determination applies for the 2007-08 and subsequent income years.

Use of section 17 notices upheld
================================

2005 case note – CIR entitled to issue section 17 notices despite the existence of court proceedings - litigation, discovery.

Case

Vinelight Nominees Limited v CIR

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

The Commissioner was entitled to issue section 17 Notices despite the existence of court proceedings.

### Facts

On 30 March 2005, the Commissioner formed the opinion under section 108(2) of the Tax Administration Act ("the Act") that returns filed by the plaintiff for tax years ending in 1998 and 1999 were either fraudulent or wilfully misleading. The Commissioner was therefore entitled to issue a new assessment for those years.

On 25 May 2005 the plaintiff filed proceedings in the High Court challenging the Commissioner's decision under section 108(2). It was said the "re-opening" decision under section 108(2) is a disputable decision under the Act, and the plaintiff is entitled to challenge it, independent of any challenge to a consequent assessment.

Accompanying the primary proceedings, the plaintiff filed two other applications. The first application was seeking two questions of law to be determined prior to trial.

The second application (determined in this Judgment), sought the Court's direction that the Commissioner is not entitled to use his powers under section 17 of the Act.

This application sought orders:

1.  restraining the Commissioner from using or purporting to use his powers in section 17 to require the production of information relevant to the subject matter of this litigation and/or
2.  declaring that the defendant Commissioner has no power to issue notices under section 17 and/or
3.  requiring the defendant Commissioner to withdraw notices already issued since the commencement of this proceedings and relevant to its subject matter, and
4.  costs.

Counsel for the Commissioner challenged the Court's jurisdiction to deal with the application.

### Decision

His Honour first considered the Commissioner's challenge of the Court's jurisdiction to deal with the application. It was considered that there was a matter being raised by the plaintiff concerning the conduct of a party to proceedings before the Court, and that it was appropriate for the Court to hear it.

In relation to the primary issue, the plaintiff submitted that the Commissioner is not entitled to use his powers in relation to the subject matter of existing proceedings. He sought some form of declaration from the Court to this effect. The primary focus of his argument was that the Commissioner would be in contempt in issuing or enforcing the Notices.

The Commissioner submitted that the Act contains a scheme of information-gathering leading to an assessment. It then contains capacities to challenge that assessment. Section 17 Notices are part of that process. It would subvert the whole scheme if a taxpayer could, by means of issuing proceedings, stop the information gathering and prevent the issuing of proper processes.

It would also disadvantage the Commissioner if material that ought to be available under a section 17 Notice were only obtainable, if at all, under the rules of discovery with its restrictions on subsequent use. The Commissioner submitted that the existing authority is clear that the Commissioner can use his power in order to obtain evidence for upcoming Court proceedings, and this is so even if the new assessment has already been issued. A _fortiori_, he must be able to use them pre-assessment and this is unaffected by the taxpayer issuing proceedings.

His Honour considered the statutory scheme in his analysis. The present scheme was introduced in 1996 and is summarised in _CIR v Delphi Fishing Co Limited_ (2004) 21 NZTC 18,525. The Commissioner stressed that one of the objectives of the new scheme was that communication between the taxpayer and Inland Revenue is to be direct and open to ensure that all information relevant to the dispute is available as soon as possible.

The Commissioner submitted that this scheme contemplates an information-gathering process that allows the Commissioner to confirm or amend his earlier opinion as to fraud. The use of a section 17 Notice is a part of the information-gathering process and ensures that the assessment is taken on the basis of all the relevant information. In his submission it is not correct to seek to circumvent the process by restricting use of section 17 prior to assessment.

The plaintiff although accepting this analysis to a point, focused on a different aspect of the scheme. The plaintiff referred to the concept introduced in 1996 of a "disputable decision". This broadened the range of decisions that could be the subject of a challenge before a "hearing authority". Included in "disputable decision" was the re-opening decision. The plaintiff submitted that it can be challenged in its own right, and that the new process of reassessment contemplates that it may be many months before all required steps have been taken. The plaintiff's pivotal proposition is provided in section 138F. Section 138F provides that a disputant may challenge an assessment made by the Commissioner that takes account of or relies on a disputable decision.

His Honour was referred to decisions _CIR v McDougall's Holdings Limited_ (1983) 6 NZTC 61,505 and _Green v Housden_ (1993) 15 NZTC 10,053 in support of the Commissioner's right to continue to use section 17. These confirmed the ability to use section 17 after assessment and expressly for the purpose of obtaining information for upcoming Court proceedings.

The plaintiff submitted that the Commissioner's position failed to take into account the statutory change that allows a taxpayer to institute proceedings, and at an earlier stage. The cases relied on by the Commissioner dealt with notices issued prior to Court proceedings commencing, and in circumstances where control of the proceedings lay with the Commissioner.

The plaintiff's strongest authority was _Bramble Holdings Ltd_. This was a decision of Franki J of the Federal Court of Australia. Notices were served upon the defendants, which is broadly comparable to section 17 of the Act. The Court ruled that the statutory power to issue the Notices did not extend to situations where proceedings had been commenced.

In conclusion His Honour stated it would not be correct to say that section 17 must generally be read down so that the power is not available when the intended subject matter of the Notices is also the subject of concurrent proceedings. His Honour looked at the motivation for the Notices and was satisfied that the purpose is not to gain an advantage as a litigant, but rather to assist the making of a revised assessment. The Department's evidence is that the Notices are in respect to the plaintiff advising them of the variation on 30 May 2005 and His Honour received no evidence from the plaintiff to the contrary.

His Honour also found the timing of the Notices to be relevant. The Notices were issued in response to a Notice of Response filed by the taxpayer after issue of the proceedings.

His Honour accepted it cannot be enough for the Department to simply point to an alternative or second purpose. There must be an enquiry as to the dominant reason for the notices.

Other facts that were taken into consideration were whether the present primary proceedings are available at this stage of the process, and whether based on the facts there is a real issue. His Honour also acknowledged the potential for proceedings to be used to thwart the statutory dispute process. The possible advantage that might accrue to the Commissioner as litigant as a by-product of the Notices was also taken into consideration.

His Honour after weighing up all the factors declined to make the declaration sought by the plaintiff.

Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services 21 May 2019 UNCLASSIFIED To use this worksheet, you’ll need to know: Income •The total income you received from boarders for the year. Deductions There are 3 elements you may be able to include for your standard-cost deductions. Here’s what you’ll need for each element: For Element 1: “Weekly standard-cost” •The total income you received from boarders for the year. •What the “weekly standard-cost” for the ye ar i s (see the Inland Revenue website). •The number of weeks each boarder stayed with you. For Element 2: “Annual housing standard-cost” •The cost of your home (if you own it). •The total rent you paid for your home for the year (if you rent). •The total amount of any accommodation supplement you received for the year. •The number of occupants of your home during the year. For Element 3: “Annual transport standard-cost” •The total kilometres you drove where the d ominant purpose of the trip was to transport the boarder. For most people, the total of Elements 1 and 2 will be more than their boarding income. This means there won’t be any tax obligations for the boarding income, and Element 3 won’t need to be added. If you have a boarder in your home, the starting point is that the income you get from them is taxable. You can keep track of your actual costs and use them as the basis for your deductions. Or alternatively, if you’re eligible you can use “standard costs” for your deductions. This is simpler, and for many boarding hosts will mean there’s no need to file a tax return. If you’re using the “standard cost” approach (in DET 19/01), this worksheet will help you work out if you need to include any of your boarding income in a tax return. Total boarding income \_\_\_ Less: Total “weekly standard-cost” \_\_\_ \_\_\_ Less: “Annual housing standard-cost” Less: “Annual transport standard-cost” \_\_\_ Net income to include in tax return \_\_\_ Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services 2 UNCLASSIFIED Step 1: Total boarding income Put your total boarding income for the income year in this box: Step 2: Total weekly standard-cost deductions The “weekly standard-cost” is an amount set by Inland Revenue and CPI-adjusted each year. It represents the direct day-to-day expenses involved in having boarders (eg, food, utility bills, use of furniture, entertainment). For the 2019-20 income year, the “weekly standard-cost” has been set at $186 per boarder per week, subject to CPI adjustment. At the start of each year tax year, Inland Revenue will publish the updated “weekly standard-cost” amount for the previous income year on its website. For each boarder you had during the income year, fill in the number of weeks they boarded with you. Multiply that by the “weekly standard-cost” amount for the income year (check Inland Revenue’s website for this). Boarder 1: Name \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Boarder 2: Name \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ No◦ of weeks \_\_\_ × \*$186 = \_\_\_\_\_\_ No◦ of weeks \_\_\_ × \*$186 = \_\_\_\_\_\_ If you had more than 2 boarders add the weekly standard-costs on for them too.

It reflects the cost of you using your home to earn boarding income (eg, home loan interest or rent, insurance, rates, etc). Put your “annual housing standard-cost” for the income year in this box: Step 4: Subtotal Copy the amounts from Box 2 and Box 3 above, and add them together: If your Subtotal is more than or equal to the amount in Box 1 —You don’t need to do anything else.

You need to include it in a tax return. •If you do use your motor vehicle to provide transport to your boarder — Continue with this step You can add your “annual transport standard-cost”. This is an amount you calculate (see page 5 for how to do this). It reflects the cost of using your vehicle to earn boarding income (eg, fuel, insurance, registration, etc). Put your “annual transport standard-cost” for the income year in this box: Step 6: Total standard-cost deductions Copy the amounts from Box 2, Box 3, and Box 4 above, and add them together: If your Total costs amount is more than or equal to the amount in Box 1 — You don’t need to do anything else.

The following examples explain the annual housing costs calculation in straightforward situations. There are examples showing more complex situations in Appendix C of the Commentary on DET 19/01. Example 1: Hosts own their home Norma and Frank own their home. They bought it for $480,000. They have one boarder for the whole year. Norma, Frank and the boarder are the only people who live in the house. Norma and Frank don’t receive any accommodation supplement. The formula is: (a – b) × c × d a = $19,200 ( 4% of the cost of the home – ie, 4% of $480,000) b = 0 (because Norma and Frank don’t receive any accommodation supplement) c = 33.33% (because 1 3 of the occupants of the home (33.33%) are boarders) d = 1 (the number of weeks the boarder is there (52) divided by 52 weeks in the year) Norma and Frank’s annual housing cost = $6,399.36 ($19,200 – 0) × 33.33% × 1 = $6,399.36 Example 2: Host rents their home Harry rents his home for $350 per week. He has one boarder for 48 weeks of the year. Harry and the boarder are the only people who live in the house. Harry doesn’t receive any accommodation supplement. The formula is: (a – b) × c × d a = $18,200 (the total rent Harry paid for the year) b = 0 (because Harry doesn’t receive any accommodation supplement) c = 50% (because 1 2 of the occupants of the home (50%) are boarders) d = 0.92 (the number of weeks the boarder is there (48) divided by 52 weeks in the year) Harry’s annual housing cost = $8,372 ($18,200 – 0) × 50% × 0.92 = $8,372 Annual housing costs Using DET 19/01 – Worksheet for calculating standard-costs for private boarding services 5 UNCLASSIFIED Examples of calculating annual transport costs You calculate your annual transport costs using the formula on page 5 of the Determination. The following example explains the annual transport costs calculation in a straightforward situation. Bear in mind that if the vehicle travels more than 14,000 km in the year t here is a lower kilometre rate for any kilometres over 14,000 km. Example of annual transport costs calculation Jacqui has a teenage boarder. Part of the boarding agreement is that Jacqui will provide transport to the boarder when required. Jacqui drives the boarder to their sports and other activities. Jacqui keeps a log book of these and any other trips she makes where the dominant purpose of the trip was to transport the boarder. The total kilometres travelled on all of the eligible trips for the year was 2,000. Jacqui’s car travels less than 14,000 kilometres during the year. The formula is: kilometre rate × kilometres travelled Kilometre rate = 79 cents per km (The relevant motor vehicle kilometre rates for the year (set by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue) are 79 cents per km for the first 14,000 km, and 30 cents per km for any kilometres over 14,000 km) Kilometres 2,000 (the total kilometres travelled where the dominant purpose of the trip travelled = related to providing the boarding service) Jacqui’s annual transport cost = $1,520 2,0 00 × 0.79 = $1,580 Annual transport costs See OS 18/01: Commissioner’s statement on using a kilometre rate for business running of a motor vehicle for more information on using Inland Revenue’s kilometre rates.

======================================================================================================================

Sometimes you may sell a property in a portfolio that has other property still in it. When you do, its excess deductions or net income stay with the rest of the property in the portfolio, whether the sale was taxable or not.

Excess deductions and a non-taxed property sale

Most of the time there's no tax to pay when you sell a residential rental property and make a gain. Having a non-taxable sale sets what you can do with excess deductions for your portfolio property.

When you've sold all the residential rental property in a portfolio and any sale was not taxed the excess deductions are:

*   transferred to another residential rental property (if you have one)
*   carried forward from year to year if you've no residential rental property to transfer them to.

When you get more residential property you transfer your unused excess deductions to it. (These are the ones you've carried forward.) You then:

*   treat them as transferred to that individual property or portfolio.
*   deduct them when you earn income from your residential rental property.

Excess deductions and a taxable property sale
---------------------------------------------

Sometimes there is tax to pay when you sell your residential rental property. This could be when you sell within the bright-line period.

[The bright-line test](/property/buying-and-selling/when-you-need-to-pay/the-brightline-test)

If you sell all the property in a portfolio and each sale was taxable you can use your excess deductions. You can use them against:

*   the net income from the property sales
*   your other income, such as salary and wages.

If your excess deductions are more than your other income they become part of your [net loss](/api/glossary/item?id={01DBE1C1-4489-436E-B8DD-0189A11B6EF3})
. You can carry them forward and use them against other income in future years like any other net loss. 

You cannot include any transferred excess deductions from another residential property. If you have transferred excess deductions make sure you remove them from your excess deduction total before using them against your other income.

[Transferred residential rental property excess deductions](/property/renting-out-residential-property/residential-rental-property-deductions/using-excess-deductions-when-selling-property/transferred-residential-rental-property-excess-deductions)

Wang Shu uses excess deductions when selling her portfolio property

Wang Shu owns a portfolio of two residential properties. She has not owned other residential rental properties before.

In the 2019-20 income year, Wang Shu sells both of these properties. Both sales are taxed and the net income from the sales is $10,000.

In the same year Wang Shu also has:

*   gross rental income of $20,000 from the properties
*   rental deductions for the properties of $35,000
*   a salary of $70,000.

Wang Shu has a total of $30,000 residential income from the portfolio for the year (the gross rental income and the net rental income from the sale of the properties).

Wang Shu can use $30,000 of the rental deductions against her residential income.

Because the sales of both properties in the portfolio were taxed, the remaining $5,000 of rental deductions can be used against Wang Shu’s salary income.

If the sale of only one of the properties had been taxable, any excess deductions would remain. They could not be used against Wang Shu's salary income. Wang Shu would have to carry them forward into the next tax year and use them against her future residential income.

Te whakamahi i ngā pāpātanga kaihaumi kua tūtohua Using prescribed investor rates
=================================================================================

Different [prescribed investor rates](/api/glossary/item?id={512D9328-39AB-4FC1-8E40-B4782AD917E5})
 (PIRs) apply to investors in [multi-rate PIEs](/api/glossary/item?id={410C66D9-6D77-4180-BAED-71164C774ECD})
. You'll need to use the PIR that applies to your situation so you're paying the right amount of tax.

Once you've worked out your PIR, make sure you give it to your [portfolio investment entity (PIE)](/api/glossary/item?id={9CD61045-FED6-44C1-9CFD-3B99ED60EC4B})
. You'll also need to give them your [IRD number](/api/glossary/item?id={9790312F-B4BA-4722-A470-3DCD1DBAE206})
.

If we notice you are not using the correct PIR, we'll:

*   let you know
*   tell your PIE to start using the correct PIR.

This does not remove your responsibility to let your PIE know your correct PIR. It's a good idea to review your PIR each [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
 and let your MRP know of any changes.

If you do not give your PIR to your PIE, they'll need to apply the default PIR of 28% to your PIE income. This rate could be higher than your PIR.

Income tax assessments
----------------------

Your income tax assessment will include your PIE income and tax – like KiwiSaver. Where you've overpaid PIE tax, we’ll factor this into your overall income tax assessment. This means you may receive a refund. The PIR you should be on will be displayed in your myIR account.

Individual tax residents
------------------------

Individuals who are [New Zealand tax residents](/api/glossary/item?id={CC613A0F-B2AE-4755-B947-A74A5002A8EF})
 have different PIRs depending on their [taxable income](/api/glossary/item?id={3D6B2FBF-12ED-4BB4-8C17-4F7280AE4ACE})
 in each of the last 2 [tax years](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
. You'll need to work them out separately. If they are different, you can then choose the lower of those PIRs for the current tax year.

It’s important that if you earn income outside of New Zealand, you’ll need to include this [worldwide income](/api/glossary/item?id={6C6937DA-4F22-4566-8CBF-A870CB1AAE54})
 when working out your PIR.

The table shows the income amounts that qualify you for each PIR in a tax year. You'll need to meet the amounts in both columns to be able to use that row's PIR.

| Taxable income without your PIE income | Taxable income with your PIE income | PIR |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $14,000 or less | $48,000 or less | 10.5% |
| $48,000 or less | $70,000 or less | 17.5% |
| All other cases |     | 28% |

Keep in mind that if you have a 4-year temporary tax exemption, you can use a 0% PIR if you invest in a zero-rate PIE.

[Temporary tax exemption](/roles/nz-tax-residents/exemption)

### Calculate your prescribed investor rate (PIR)

There are a few ways we can help you calculate your prescribed investor rate.

#### Calculate your PIR in myIR

You can work out your prescribed investor rate (PIR) in myIR if you have PIE funds.

There's no need to add income details if you've already added them to your myIR account. If any of your income types are not listed in your account, make sure you add them.

[Update my income type](/managing-my-tax/updating-my-details/update-my-income-type)

You'll still need to tell your portfolio investment entity (PIE) which rate to use.

In myIR, you'll be able view your:

*   income listed with us
*   PIR, if we're able to calculate it for you.

[Log in to myIR](https://myir.ird.govt.nz "Online self-service tool for tax customers")

  

If you do not have a myIR account, you can either register for one or give us a call.

[Register for a personal myIR account](/topics/myir-secure-online-services/register-for-a-personal-myir-account)

[General enquiries and myIR support](/contactus/general-enquiries)

  

#### Use our online tool to work out your PIR

You'll need your income details for this.

[What is my prescribed investor rate?](/roles/portfolio-investment-entities/find-my-prescribed-investor-rate)
 

Non-resident taxpayers
----------------------

Make sure you're a [non-resident taxpayer](/api/glossary/item?id={629D26DB-A2DC-4E9F-88E8-397C0AA00D67})
 by checking your tax residency status.

[Tax residency status for individuals](/international-tax/individuals/tax-residency-status-for-individuals)

[Tax residency status for companies](/international-tax/business/tax-residency-status-for-companies)

  

As a non-resident investor, you'll have a:

*   28% PIR if you do not invest in foreign PIEs
*   PIR that depends on the type of investment and the country the investments are in, if you invest in a variable rate PIE
*   0% PIR if you invest in a zero-rate PIE.

Non-individual tax residents
----------------------------

Investments held by companies, incorporated societies, charities or PIEs have a PIR of 0%.

Trusts can often choose a PIR to suit their beneficiaries.

Using the right resident withholding tax (RWT) rate
===================================================

#### Income tax Dates

If you're a New Zealand tax resident, you'll have [resident withholding tax (](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
RWT) deducted from interest and dividends you earn from New Zealand bank accounts and investments. Your payer (bank or fund manager) deducts the tax before they pay you.

When you open an account
------------------------

If you have not given your IRD number to your interest payer, they will deduct tax from interest paid to you at a rate of 45%

### Companies

You must notify your interest payer that you're a company.

If you've given your interest payer your IRD number and company status, you may use either the 28%, 33% or 39% rate. If you do not choose a RWT rate, tax will be deducted at a rate of 28% from interest paid to you.

If the RWT rate you choose does not match your income tax rate you may receive an end of year tax bill.

There are 2 exceptions.

*   Trustees are not required to notify their company status and may use the 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% rate. If you are a trustee of a testamentary trust, you may use the 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% rate.
*   Māori authorities are not required to notify their company status and may use the 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% rate.

### All others

If you've given your interest payer your IRD number, you may use the 10.5%, 17.5%, 30%, 33% or 39% rate. This is the amount of tax to be deducted during the year. It should match your income tax rate.

If the RWT rate you choose does not match your income tax rate you may receive an end of year tax bill. If you do not choose a RWT rate, tax will be deducted from your interest payments at 33%.

### From 31 July

| Your total taxable income | Resident withholding tax (RWT) rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $15,600 | 10.5% |
| $15,601 to $53,500 | 17.5% |
| $53,501 to $78,100 | 30% |
| $78,101 to $180,000 | 33% |
| $180,001 and over | 39% |

### Up to 30 July 2024

| Your total taxable income | Resident withholding tax (RWT) rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to $14,000 | 10.5% |
| $14,001 to $48,000 | 17.5% |
| $48,001 to $70,000 | 30% |
| $70,001 to $180,000 | 33% |
| $180,001 and over | 39% |

If your circumstances change
----------------------------

Check if the change affects your tax rate. If it does, you need to tell your payer. Using the wrong rate may mean you receive an end-of-year tax bill.

Find investment income updates in myIR
--------------------------------------

Details of all investment income paid to you (and tax withheld on it) are reported to us. Financial institutions that pay investment income need to report to us the month after they’ve paid you. You may notice investment income updates in your myIR account as a result.

Investment income across joint accounts
---------------------------------------

Income reported for joint investments will be split equally between the account holders who have provided valid IRD numbers to their payer.

If you need to, you can change the split of income and set a rate for a future split to make sure the income is directed correctly in the future. You can change this allocation through myIR or by contacting us. Alternatively, you can amend this allocation when we complete your income tax assessment at the end of the year or when you file your income tax return.

If you have a joint account, you can only use one RWT rate. So you'll need to decide which is the most appropriate rate. For example, if you both earn over $180,000, choosing the 39% rate will avoid an end of year tax bill. If one account holder earns over $53,500 and the other $53,500 or less, choosing the 30% rate will avoid the higher earner having an end-of-year tax bill.

If a resident and a non-resident hold a joint account, [resident withholding tax](/api/glossary/item?id={BEA5D13B-2EC0-45C7-881F-46537F7BF005})
 must be deducted from all interest paid on the account. The non-resident may claim a refund by completing either an IR3NR tax return or a New Zealand non-resident withholding tax refund request - IR386 form.

At the end of the tax year
--------------------------

At the end of the tax year we work out if you’ve paid the right amount of tax. We ask you to check your income tax assessment and tell us about any changes. We might ask you to give us more information about your income, including your interest and dividends.

We might tell your investment Income payer (such as your bank) your correct IRD number if you have given them an incorrect IRD number. This does not remove your responsibility to let your investment Income payer know your correct IRD number.

[What happens at the end of the tax year](/income-tax/income-tax-for-individuals/what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-tax-year)

Dividend Payments
-----------------

The RWT rate for dividend payments is 33%. The company paying the dividend will deduct this RWT before making the dividend payment to you.

Imputation credits
------------------

A New Zealand company or unit trust may attach 'imputation credits' to dividends. These imputation credits represent income tax the company has already paid. These credits may offset the RWT that is deducted from the dividend paid to you.

[Imputation for companies](/income-tax/income-tax-for-businesses-and-organisations/income-tax-for-companies/imputation-for-companies)

Am I on the right tax rate for my interest or dividends?
--------------------------------------------------------

You need to make sure that tax on your interest and dividends is deducted at the right rate to avoid receiving an end-of-year tax bill.

[All Income tax dates](/index/key-dates#f:@irsccoresubject=[Income tax])

If you’re a business owner and use part of your family home for work, you can make a claim for this as a business expense. In order to claim the expenses, there must be a connection between the use of your home and the business income being generated.

You can claim a portion of your household expenses, such as rates, insurance, power and mortgage interest. The portion you can claim relates to the area of your home that you use for business.

Companies claiming expenses for the use of your home
----------------------------------------------------

If your business is a company and does not pay anything towards the home office expenses, it cannot claim an expense.

However, if your company reimburses you for the use of your home, then it may be able to claim an expense. The company needs to be able to prove that there is a link between the money paid for the use of your home and the income the company makes. It also needs to keep accurate records that show how and when it paid for the use of your home, the amounts paid, and how it arrived at the amount to pay.

If you are a shareholder-employee/employee and the amount paid is a fair reimbursement for the use of your home, then it is exempt income and you do not need to pay income tax on the amount.

Splitting your household expenses
---------------------------------

If part of your home is set aside and mainly used for business purposes, you can use a simpler square metre rate option.

If you choose not to use the square metre rate option or this option is not available for you, you need to consider the amount of time and space that part of your home is used for income-earning activities.

If you are registered for GST, the business expenses you claim will not include GST, when this applies. If you are not registered for GST, these expenses will include GST.

If you have a mortgage, you can claim a portion of your mortgage interest (but not the principal) paid during the year. There is no GST involved in this.

For GST, you can claim a portion or percentage of the GST on the expenses.

Like you do for any other business expenses you are claiming, you need to keep invoices and other records for these expenses.

Depreciation
------------

You cannot claim depreciation on your home. Depreciation could be claimed before 1 April 2011 – if you did this, when you sell your home or stop using it for business purposes you will need to include the depreciation recovered in your tax return.

You can claim depreciation on capital items such as a computer, office furniture and fittings used for business purposes in your home.

Telephone costs
---------------

If you run your business from home you can claim a deduction of 50% of the rental of a telephone landline if this is also your private line. Business-related toll calls are 100% deductible.

If you have a separate business line, you can claim the full cost of this for both income tax and GST. If you make any private calls on the business line and are charged for these, you will have to make an adjustment.

Internet costs
--------------

If you run your business from home and have an internet plan for both business and private use, you can claim part of this as a business expense.

You can decide how to work out the business proportion, but it needs to give a fair and reasonable result. You must also meet normal record-keeping requirements.

Square metre rate option
------------------------

Instead of working out how much of your household expenses will be allocated to your business, you can use the square metre rate option if the business area is set aside and used mainly for business purposes. This option uses a rate that we set each year based on the average cost of utilities per square metre of housing for the average New Zealand household.

This rate does not include premises costs of mortgage interest, rates or rent. You can also claim a portion of these based on the percentage of floor area used for the business. The equation for the square metre rate option is: (a x b) + (c x d) Where:

**a** is the total amount of mortgage interest, rates and rent you have paid during the year

**b** is the area calculated by c divided by the total floor area of your home

**c** is the total area (in square metres) of your home that is separately identifiable and used primarily for the business

**d** is the square metre rate that is published by Inland Revenue

If this option is used, you cannot claim any other expenses or depreciation costs relatedin relation to the business use of your home.

### Square metre rates for each tax year

For the [tax year](/api/glossary/item?id={963329E3-7E3C-493A-9C3B-6EDA8DB83DDC})
 that you're claiming business expenses for, make sure you're using the correct square metre rate.

| Tax year | Square metre rates |
| --- | --- |
| 2023-2024 | $53.10 per square metre |
| 2022-2023 | $51.05 per square metre |
| 2021-2022 | $47.85 per square metre |
| 2020-2021 | $44.75 per square metre |
| 2019-2020 | $42.75 per square metre |
| 2018-2019 | $41.70 per square metre |
| 2017-2018 | $41.10 per square metre |

More detailed information on using the square metre rate option can be found in Operational Statement (OS) 19/03 - Square metre rate for the dual use of premises.

Validity of Commissioner's assessments
======================================

2015 case note - preliminary hearing dealing with the disputant's challenge as to the validity of the CIR's assessments – partnership, s 138P and validity.

Case

XXX v Commissioner of Inland Revenue \[2015\] NZTRA 13

Legislative References

Tax Administration Act 1994, Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994

### Summary

This is a preliminary hearing dealing with the disputant's challenge as to the validity of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue's ("the Commissioner") assessments.

### Impact

This case will be a useful precedent, in particular as it relates to the powers of a hearing authority under s 138P(1)(a) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 ("TAA") and the Commissioner's power/obligation to amend under s 113 of the TAA.

### Facts

Following an investigation, the Commissioner took the view that there was a three-person partnership comprising the disputant, AB and XZ that was engaged in the business of breeding, agistment and selling of horses.

During the 2007-2011 income tax years, amounts totalling over $5 million were transferred from overseas to the alleged partnership by or on behalf of the disputant. The Commissioner formed the view the transfers were income of the alleged partnership's activities and default assessed the disputant for a one-third share of the partnership's income.

The disputant filed returns and issued a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") contending the overseas transfers were derived from non-taxable activities (namely gambling) undertaken by him personally.

The dispute proceeded to the Disputes Review Unit ("DRU") with the Commissioner adding the further ground that the business of the alleged partnership included the gambling activities of the disputant and XZ.

The DRU concluded that the only partnership was that between the disputant and AB in relation to the horse related activities, and that the gambling was a business activity carried on by the disputant on his own behalf.

However, the DRU found that the disputant had not satisfied the onus of proving that the default assessments were wrong and by how much they were wrong. In particular, the disputant had not shown that his gambling was not a business activity, nor had he shown that the amounts default assessed did not reflect the net income from his combined income-earning activities.

The Commissioner issued a challenge notice, and the disputant challenged the assessments on grounds which included the validity of the assessments in light of the DRU's decision.

The Taxation Review Authority ("the Authority") ordered that the validity question be dealt with by way of preliminary hearing.

### Decision

#### _Adjudication report - amended assessment envisaged?_

The disputant argued that the DRU report suggested the Commissioner should have amended the default assessments on the basis they were wrong both as to liability and quantum. Furthermore, as tax returns had been filed, new default assessments could not be issued, and therefore the Commissioner is required to recast her view of the disputant's liability in a NOPA in anticipation of then seeking an amendment to the assessment pursuant to s 113 of the TAA.

The Authority did not agree that the DRU envisaged or intended the Commissioner to issue amended assessments - there was no statement or direction of that nature. The Authority also noted that while a matter of good practice, the Commissioner is not bound as a matter of law to the determination or reasoning of the DRU (_Ch'elle Properties (NZ) Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ \[2004\] 3 NZLR 274; (2004) 21 NZTC 18,618 (HC), at \[21\] to \[32\]).

Importantly, there was no obligation on the Commissioner to amend the assessments under s 113 of the TAA. Even when she has formed the view that the assessment is incorrect, she will not exercise the power unless or until she can be satisfied that the amendment will ensure correctness (as best this can be achieved). In this case, the disputant provided only limited information during the dispute process, and the Commissioner is not in a better position to make a correct assessment. Prima facie, the assessments remain correct until the disputant can show they are incorrect and, if so, by how much.

#### _Validity of assessments - fresh liability?_

The disputant argued that the Commissioner was seeking in this challenge proceeding to increase the quantum of the disputant's liability by the Authority imposing a fresh liability (using the hearing authority's powers under s 138P of TAA), and that this was inappropriate without having engaged in the disputes process as required by ss 89C and 89N(2) of the TAA.

The Authority agreed with the Commissioner that she was simply proceeding on the existing default assessment. The Authority noted that the disputant's liability to pay tax and the quantum (if any) will be matters for determination by the Authority on the eventual hearing of the challenge.

#### _Authority's powers_

The Authority agreed that a hearing authority has the power under s 138P(1)(a) of the TAA on considering a challenge to confirm or cancel or vary an assessment, or reduce the amount of an assessment, or increase the amount of an assessment, to the extent to which the Commissioner was able to make an assessment of an increased amount at the time the Commissioner made the assessment to which the challenge relates. These powers are reinforced by those contained in s 16(2) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994.

The disputant contended that s 138P powers are to be applied in the context of, and for the purposes of, addressing the correctness of an assessment that is properly advanced by the Commissioner and is under challenge. It does not envisage the assessment process being handed over to the Authority so that a liability greater than that originally assessed by the Commissioner can be argued for on grounds not maintained by the Commissioner.

The Authority disagreed, stating the Commissioner is not somehow abrogating or abandoning the assessment process in favour of the Authority. The Authority's powers are wide under s 138P and the focus of the hearing will be on determining the correct position in relation to the disputant's tax liability on the evidence before it.

The Authority also rejected the disputant's contention that an inference can be drawn from the Supreme Court's judgment in _Tannadyce Investments Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue_ (2011) 25 NZTC 20,103 (SC) that challenge proceedings may not always be the most appropriate forum for resolution of a dispute where there is an issue as to procedural fairness. The Authority was of the view that, had there been any issue of unfairness or invalidity (which was not accepted), the de novo hearing before the Authority would cure that defect. Accordingly, it is not necessary or appropriate for the matter to proceed again through the Part 4A disputes process.

#### _Prejudice_

The Authority did not accept there was any prejudice to the disputant if the challenge remains before the Authority. The issues in dispute were live during the disputes process and are well known to the disputant. The disputant has the opportunity in discovery to ensure that all relevant documents are before the Authority.

The Authority noted that the disputant may make an application under s 138G(2) of the TAA if there are any additional issues or propositions of law which have not been sufficiently referred to by the parties in their respective Statements of Position.

#### _Orders sought_

The Authority did not consider it had the power under reg 12 of the Taxation Review Authorities Regulation 1998, or r 7.37 of the District Court Rules 2014, to direct the Commissioner to withdraw the default assessment and that the proceedings be abandoned. Nor could the Authority direct the matter back to the disputes process. It did not follow that if the matter was referred back, the Commissioner would necessarily issue a NOPA if she was not satisfied that there was sufficient information to propose an amendment under s 113 of the TAA.

The Authority did not accept the disputant's alternative submission that it ought to decline jurisdiction on the basis the assessments were no longer a valid expression of the Commissioner's opinion as to the disputant's liability to tax because the assessments were incorrect. In the Authority's view, the assessments continue to be a genuine attempt by the Commissioner to arrive at the amount of the disputant's taxable income on the information available.

Valuation and hindsight
=======================

2006 case note - evidence of subsequent events can be relied on to help determine whether valuation reasonable and justified - discovery, hindsight, sham, avoidance.

Case

TRA Number 145/04, Decision Number 006/2006

Legislative References

District Court Rules, Tax Administration Act 1994

### Summary

When a purported valuation is subject to review, evidence of events that have occurred post that valuation date can be relied upon to help determine whether a valuation made was reasonable and justified at the time.

### Facts

This was an interlocutory application by the Disputant seeking an order limiting the scope of discovery.

In 1997 the Disputant transferred its registered office to New Zealand from Luxembourg and became a New Zealand resident company. Once resident in New Zealand the Disputant began depreciating the rights to particular software using a straight line method and taking NZ$76,125,375 as the cost price for depreciation purposes.

The Commissioner disallowed the depreciation deductions on the basis that the sale price was a sham (as at December 1994), that the sale price is part of a tax avoidance arrangement and that the so-called price (as at December 1997) cannot properly form the basis of the depreciation claim by the Disputant.

The Commissioner sought discovery by the Disputant of all documents including those evidencing sales and licensing of the software post December 1997.

The Disputant applied for an order that discovery be restricted so that information relating to the Disputant's sales and licensing of the relevant software post December 1997 not be required; or, alternatively, that events after December 1997 not be subject to discovery as irrelevant to the substantive issues.

The Commissioner opposed that application and claimed neither order was warranted or necessary because:

1.  The Disputant mischaracterises the case as one of valuation alone. In fact it is a case involving allegations of sham, tax avoidance and technical arguments as to the correct depreciation basis of the copyright.
2.  In tax cases where sham and tax avoidance and valuation have been in issue the Court has accepted as relevant any evidence both pre and post the transaction date.
3.  The sales history from 1 January 1998 is relevant to the sham argument, the tax avoidance argument and the technical argument about the correct depreciation basis.
4.  Even in a strict valuation context, which this is not, evidence post dating the transaction is admissible.

### Decision

For the reasons advanced by the Commissioner (as set out above) His Honour agreed that neither order sought by the Disputant was warranted or necessary. He concluded that the sales history of the software after December 1997 and up to the date of the substantive hearing would be relevant and important to the issues and therefore discoverable.

In regards to the sham and tax avoidance issues, His Honour stated that in his view the law was clear that the Courts would allow evidence to be called of events which occurred after the transaction in question. His Honour cited Glenharrow Holdings Ltd v The Commissioner of Inland Revenue (2006) 22 NZTC 19,319 as an example of where the High Court allowed evidence of events occurring post transaction where sham was in issue.

His Honour noted that sales post-December 1997 could well be relevant to the intentions of the parties at the material times and certainly to their credibility. His Honour went on to explain those figures could well show quite some disparity between predictions on which the Disputant wishes to rely as compared to what actually happened and what might be thought to have actually happened.

In the context of valuation His Honour stated the law provided for the admission of evidence post valuation date (hindsight), where the purpose was to determine the proper weight to attach to the circumstances relied upon at the valuation date, see Brian Russell Gilfoyle v Patrica Joan Gilfoyle unreported judgment of Laurenson J, 3 September 2001, High Court, Auckland, and Wood v Wood \[1984\] FRNZ 576 at 581.

In the present case the Disputant's sales projections are alleged by the Commissioner to have been too optimistic. Evidence of actual sales since 1994 through to the present will be relevant to assessing the reasonableness of those assumptions.

His Honour concluded that in this pre-trial context, the information in issue was both relevant and reasonably necessary for the purpose of discovery. His Honour also referred to the question of weight and noted that that was different to the question of relevance for the purpose of discovery. His Honour however noted that weight of the evidence must be determined at trial and not at this preliminary stage.

Although His Honour did not accept the Disputant's submission that requiring discovery of material covering 12 years would be excessive he was prepared to reserve leave for the Disputant to apply from time to time regarding any particular aspect of the discovery which may seem to be unduly onerous. His Honour however, noted that in general, the discovery should not be onerous on the Disputant.

Value of gain in kind when calculating FIF income or loss was market value of shares disposed of
================================================================================================

2009 case note – Court held that taxpayer obtained a gain from the transfer of the shares but it was a gain in kind not in money – forfeiture, FIF, shares.

Case

Govind Prasad Saha v Commissioner of Inland Revenue CA 617/2008

Legislative References

Income Tax Act 1994, Foreign Investment Fund Rules

### Summary

The Commissioner treated the forfeiture of shares as a disposal at market value. Dr Saha maintained that the shares were not disposed of for gain; rather there was an adjustment to the original purchase price. The Court held that Dr Saha obtained a gain from the transfer of the shares to Cap Gemini, but it was a gain in kind and not in money. There was no evidence of the market value of the gain in kind but as it could not be less than the market value of the shares at the time of disposition, the market value of the shares was to be used.

### Impact of decision

Where there is no valuation evidence of the market value of the gain derived in kind but if it is less than the market value of the shares at the time of disposition, this market value must be adopted in accordance with section CG 23(5) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA).

### Facts

This was an appeal against the decision of Simon France J delivered on 23 September 2008.

Dr Saha was a partner in Ernst & Young (EYNZ). In 2000, EYNZ sold a portion of its business to an overseas company, Cap Gemini. The then partners in EYNZ were paid by means of an allocation of shares in Cap Gemini. Part of the sale arrangements was that some EYNZ partners, including Dr Saha, would work for Cap Gemini for five years; and agreements were entered into to give effect to this commitment. The agreements included a share forfeiture regime, which was to apply if the partner stopped working for Cap Gemini before the five years was up. This is what happened with Dr Saha, and he was later required to return some of the shares he had received.

The share allocations and disposals were caught by the Foreign Investment Fund (FIF) Rules. Dr Saha chose to return his FIF income/losses under the comparative value method (section CG18 of the ITA) whereby if the value of a person's holding has increased during the course of a tax year, that increase will be treated as income, and if it has decreased it will be treated as a deductible loss. In the 2001 tax year Dr Saha applied the formula in section CG 18 of the ITA to the acquisition of his parcel of shares, sales he had made, and the market value of the shares at the time of acquisition and at year's end. Because the value of Cap Gemini shares had dropped over the year, he was able to claim a loss of $1,210,651.

During the 2002 year, Dr Saha forfeited 2095 shares as he had left the employment of Cap Gemini. The Commissioner and Dr Saha disagreed as to the treatment of these shares in the formula in section CG 18 of the ITA. The Commissioner treated the disposal of the forfeited shares as a gain at market value to Dr Saha. Dr Saha maintained that the forfeiture operated as a purchase price adjustment.

In the High Court, Simon France J treated the forfeiture of shares as an adjustment to the original purchase price. However, he concluded that because the shares were disposed of for nil consideration, section CG 23(5) of the ITA deemed that disposal to be at market value.

### Decision

The Court of Appeal focused on the settlement deed agreed to between Dr Saha and Cap Gemini upon termination of his employment, rather than the deed of covenant; the settlement deed effected a new contractual arrangement between the parties.

Clause 4 of the settlement deed provided:

*   CGE&EYNZ and Cap Gemini agree that 50% of Unreleased Transaction Shares (being 2095 shares) will not be forfeited. The remaining Unreleased Transaction Shares will be transferred to Cap Gemini or as it directs. The Deed of Covenant will remain in full force and effect.

In respect of the matters it covered, the settlement deed was expressed to supersede all previous agreements and understandings between the parties and recorded various agreements to end the employment dispute between them.

The Court stated that Dr Saha agreed to relinquish half of his unreleased transaction shares as part of his side of the bargain. The shares were not forfeited but transferred as part of an overall settlement of his employment dispute, and in return Dr Saha received certain benefits such as the freedom to undertake other employment.

In reaching its decision, the Court took a different line of reasoning from the High Court and considered the position was covered by section CG 14(2) of the ITA:

*   **CG 14(2) \[Non-monetary gain\]** For the purposes of the FIF rules, where any gain is derived in kind and not in money, the amount of gain shall be equal to the market value of the gain derived in kind, measured at the time derived.

The Court held that Dr Saha did obtain a gain from the transfer of the shares to Cap Gemini, but it was a gain in kind and not in money. There was no valuation evidence of the market value of the gain but if it was less than the market value of the shares at the time of disposition, section CG 23(5) of the ITA deemed that consideration received was the market value of the shares. Accordingly, the Court held that it was the market value of the shares that was to be applied in the formula in section CG 18 of the ITA.

If your business has trading stock, you must value it at the end of each income year using one of the methods below. There are specific rules for valuing livestock.

Valuing trading stock can be complicated, and we recommend you speak to a tax professional.

Methods for valuing trading stock
---------------------------------

Generally, the method you use for your financial statements is the method you use for tax purposes. Each of these methods has specific rules and criteria that you must follow. 

**Cost**  
The value is the cost of the trading stock. This includes all costs like purchase price, import duties, manufacturing costs, inwards freight cost and overheads.

**Discounted selling price**  
The value is the retail selling price, minus the normal gross profit margin for a department or category of goods. There are special rules for retailers with a turnover of $1 million or less. 

**Replacement price**  
The value is the price that you would pay to replace the items on the last day of the income year, or if there is no such value then the last price that you paid for it during the year.

**Market selling value**  
The value is the price you would expect to receive from the sale of the trading stock. You must be able to provide evidence of this price. You can only use this method if the market selling value is less than cost. 

**Valuing livestock**
---------------------

There are specific rules for valuing livestock in subpart EC of the Income Tax Act 2007. These rules are reviewed in 'Herd scheme elections' on our Tax Policy website.

[Herd scheme elections (Tax Policy)](https://www.taxpolicy.ird.govt.nz/publications/2011/2011-ip-herd-scheme-elections)

Cost-flow methods for stock purchased at different prices
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are using the cost method to value trading stock and you purchased stock at different prices, you can use two cost-flow methods for remaining stock at the end of the year. You must be able to identify the stock separately. The methods are:

*   the ‘First–In–First–Out’ cost method (FIFO)
*   the ‘Weighted Average Cost’ method (WAC). 

If the stock cannot be identified separately, you can only use one of the methods. 

For tax purposes, your business must also use the same cost–flow method that you use in your financial statements.

Low-turnover traders
--------------------

You are a low-turnover trader if you have sales of less than $3 million for an income year.

There are concessionary rules for low-turnover traders under each of the 4 valuation methods described above. These can be found in the Income Tax Act 2007, section EB 13 to EB 22.

Low value trading stock 
------------------------

Your business may use the same closing value of trading stock as the opening value when:

*   sales are less than $1.3 million for the income year, and 
*   a reasonable estimate of your closing stock is less than $10,000. 

In this case, your business only has to value the trading stock once and you do not have to stocktake at the end of the year.

**Employer superannuation contribution tax** [Video information](#)

#### Visual

Title screen with IR logo and Changing for You logo shows on teal background.

#### Audio

Soft music plays in the background throughout the video.

#### Visual

Teal background with Jennie appearing with Kiwisaver, ESCT, 3% and other schemes appearing in circles

#### Audio

Are you an employer? If you make contributions to an employee’s KiwiSaver account, you’ll need to pay employer superannuation contribution tax (ESCT). ESCT is a tax deducted from the employer contributions you pay into the employee’s KiwiSaver account.

Employer contributions are compulsory, and the minimum amount you need to pay is 3% of the employee’s gross salary or wage.

You pay ESCT to Inland Revenue along with your PAYE and other employer deductions.

ESCT is also paid on employer contributions to superannuation schemes other than KiwiSaver. Inland Revenue’s website has more information about these other schemes.

#### Visual

Zoom out from Jennie, header of Salon Jennies with employees standing next to Jennie, Date 01 April appears in top right

#### Audio

Jennie owns a busy hairdressing salon in town. All four of her employees belong to KiwiSaver.

At the beginning of the tax year, Jennie works out the ESCT rate for each of her employees.

#### Visual

Zoom onto Daniel, Customer in salon chair next to Daniel appears, Year calendar appears in Top right

#### Audio

She starts with senior stylist Daniel.

Last year, Daniel worked at the salon for the full 12 months. That means Jennie can use his last year’s salary to work out his ESCT rate for the coming year.

#### Visual

Table with all Employees and their salary Bracket and ESCT rate appears

#### Audio

Here’s the table of ESCT rates.

#### Visual

Table minimises to bottom left; Daniel appears top left with Salary, KiwiSaver contributions percentage and total appearing on right side of screen.

#### Audio

Daniel’s salary for last year was $65,000. Jennie’s 3% KiwiSaver employer contribution of $1,950 added to his salary gives a combined figure of $66,950,

making Daniel’s ESCT rate 30% of the employer contribution.

#### Visual

Slide up, Daniel with ESCT rate of 30% and calendar year appear. Gets replaced by www.ird.govt.nz

#### Audio

Jennie will use this rate for Daniel for the whole of the coming year.

If your employee wasn’t with you for all 12 months of the previous year, you work out the ESCT rate based on what you estimate or expect their salary and your contributions will be for the coming year.

Visit our website and use our tool to work out your employees ESCT rate.

#### Visual

All five employees slide into view along with their different salaries underneath them. Daniel becomes focus again with his Weekly Salary, Employer contributions, ESCT rate with corresponding figures appear.

#### Audio

Jennie has both full time and part time employees who earn different salaries. This means they each get their own ESCT rate.

Let’s see how Jennie calculates Daniel’s ESCT every payday.

Daniel’s salary for the week is $1,250. That means Jennie’s employer contribution is $37.50. ESCT is a tax on the employer contribution. For the purpose of calculating ESCT, you use whole dollars only. Jennie removes the cents and applies Daniel’s ESCT rate of 30%.

She must pay ESCT of $11.10.

#### Visual

Daniel disappears and leaves employer contribution and ESCT with added figure of Net employer contribution. Employer contribution disappears to leave ESCT and net contributions behind.

#### Audio

Jennie needs to calculate one more figure: the net employer contribution. That’s easy. All she does is deduct the ESCT from the employer contribution including the cents.

Jennie must include both figures in her employment information return.

#### Visual

Orange box with PAYE calculator and PAYE person symbols appear in front of background. Both symbols are replaced with a bigger calculator symbol with PAYE on it, then replaced with IRD website.

You don’t have to work out your ESCT manually. Why not do it the easy way? Here are two tools that can help you. Alternatively, a PAYE intermediary could also help you. To check these out, click on the links under the video.

You’ve just seen how most employers calculate their ESCT. There’s another method you can use, which taxes the employer contributions under the PAYE rules. Please visit our website for more information.

#### Visual

Saloon Jennie appears on left-hand side with the righthand side showing the weekly table with figures for employee, net employer contribution and ESCT along with a total. Table shifts left for a IR348 Employment Information symbol to take right side.

#### Audio

Meanwhile, back at the salon, Jennie has worked out ESCT for all her employees. Jennie takes the figures for each of her employees weekly pays and includes these in her employment information return. Remember the two figures she needs for her employment information return? The net employer contribution and ESCT.

ESCT is paid to Inland Revenue along with your PAYE by the due date.

#### Visual

IR384 Return appears with two circles over the total net employer contribution and ESCT in the respective boxes

#### Visual

IR348 Employment Information symbol with green tick appear in the centre of the screen. Shifts up to show calendar symbol with due date in the centre, to be replaced with computer and mouse symbol in the same spot.

#### Audio

And that’s all there is to it!

Please remember to file and pay your ESCT and other employer deductions by the due date. Inland Revenue’s pay day filing service makes the job a whole lot easier. Check out the link under the video.

#### Visual

Arrow bullet points appear on screen with contact and information on where to go for ESCT services. Fades to be replaced with IRD and New Zealand government logos and web address for ESCT

#### Audio

Are you behind with your ESCT? Made a mistake? Phone us on 0800 377 772. Our friendly team can help you get back on track.

If you need more information, go to our website where you will find more information on ESCT and tools to work out your employees ESCT rate and how to calculate how much ESCT is required to be deducted from the employer contribution using the PAYE calculator.

Your tax agent or PAYE intermediary can also advise you about ESCT, and help you choose the calculation method that’s right for your business.
