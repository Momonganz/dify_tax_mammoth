13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Thin capitalisation Part FG, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction A thin capitalisation regime has been introduced which will prevent non-residents from allocating an excessive proportion of their worldwide interest expenses against their gross New Zealand income. The regime also acts as a backstop to the transfer pricing regime. Without the thin capitalisation regime, the benefits to the New Zealand tax base resulting from the transfer pricing regime would be offset by taxpayersí ability to shift profits from New Zealand using thin capitalisation techniques instead. Background The lighter tax treatment of debt compared to equity investment provides an incentive for non-residents to invest into New Zealand through debt rather than equity. In conjunction with the other reforms in the Income Tax Act 1994 Amendment Act (No. 3) 1995 and the Tax Administration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1995, the thin capitalisation regime is consistent with the Govern- mentís ìbroad-base/low-rateî tax strategy. The thin capitalisation regime, together with the transfer pricing rules, is intended to help determine the amount of New Zealand-sourced income of non-resident investors. Key features ï The regime is fundamentally designed to deny a deduction for interest if a non-resident allocates an excessive proportion of its worldwide debt to its New Zealand operations. An excessive allocation exists if a taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage exceeds 110% of the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage. ï The regime potentially applies to all of the following: - non-residents who derive New Zealand-sourced income - New Zealand companies controlled by a single non-resident person (together with persons associated with that person) - non-qualifying trusts that are 50% or more settled by a single non-resident person. ï For compliance cost reasons, a 75% safe harbour debt percentage has been introduced. Taxpayers with a consolidated New Zealand group debt percentage that does not exceed 75% will not be subject to the regime. ï A concession exists for on-lent funds. One effect of this is that financial intermediaries are effectively removed from the regime. Application date The thin capitalisation regime applies from the start of the 1996-97 income year. Process for applying regime A number of steps must be followed to determine whether the thin capitalisation regime applies to a taxpayer, and the extent to which it will apply. These steps are illustrated in the flow diagram on the follow- ing page. Note, however, that the flow diagram is indicative of the process, rather than exhaustive - space constraints dictate that the diagram cannot cover all possibilities. The following analysis of the thin capitalisation regime follows the process outlined in the flow diagram, and provides further detail on specific aspects of the regime. Application of the regime (section FG 2) The regime can apply to three classes of taxpayers: 1. Taxpayers not resident in New Zealand Non-resident taxpayers that operate a branch or fixed establishment in New Zealand will automatically be subject to the regime in relation to their New Zealand operations. This is to ensure that non-residents do not allocate an excessive portion of their worldwide interest expense to their New Zealand branch or permanent establishment. However, there is one exception to this rule. If a single New Zealand resident holds a 50% or greater direct ownership interest in the non-resident, that non-resident will generally not be subject to the regime. In practical terms, this means that first tier CFCs that are either operating a fixed establishment in New Zealand, or that are dually resident in New Zealand and another country or countries, will not be subject to the regime if they are controlled by a single New Zealand resident. There is an exception to this exception. If another non- resident person holds a 50% or greater direct ownership interest in the first non-resident person (likely to arise only if that other non-resident is associated with the single New Zealand person), the first non-resident will remain subject to the thin capitalisation regime. Non-resident individuals who derive income from New Zealand can also be subject to the thin capitalisation regime. continued on page 15 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Example 1 Non-resident 1 NZ Sub 1 NZ Parent 1 25% 60% 30% Non-resident has: ï a direct ownership interest in NZ Parent of 60% ï a direct ownership interest in NZ Sub of 25%. However, because NZ Parent holds a direct owner- ship interest in NZ Sub, and Non-resident has a direct ownership interest in NZ Parent, Non- resident holds an indirect ownership interest in NZ Sub traced through NZ Parent. Because Non- resident is able to control NZ Parent (by virtue of an ownership interest at least equal to 50%), it is deemed to hold all interests held by NZ Parent in other companies (section FG 2†(4)(b)). Non-residentís ownership interest in NZ Sub is therefore calculated as: Direct ownership interest25% Indirect ownership interest 30% Total ownership interest55% Example 2 Non-resident 1 NZ Sub 1 NZ Parent 1 25% 30% 30% The difference between this example and the previous one is that Non-resident now holds only a 30% direct ownership interest in NZ Parent. Assuming that no persons associated with Non- resident hold an ownership interest in NZ Parent, the indirect interest in NZ Sub is now calculated as 30% x 30% = 9% (section FG 2†(4)(a)) Non-residentís ownership interest in NZ Sub is calculated as: Direct ownership interest25% Indirect ownership interest ††9% Total ownership interest34% 2. Companies resident in New Zealand and controlled by a single non-resident This class of taxpayers is the one most likely to be affected by the regime. A New Zealand resident com- pany will be subject to the regime if a single non- resident person either: ï holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in the company; or ï in conjunction with all persons associated with the single non-resident person, controls the company by any other means whatsoever. The concept of an ownership interest is dealt with in detail in the next section. Essentially though, it is a test of whether control exists on a tier-by-tier basis down a chain of companies traced from the non-resident person to the relevant New Zealand company. 3. Non-qualifying trusts settled by a non-resident A non-qualifying trust that is 50% or more settled by a person not resident in New Zealand will be subject to the regime. A trust will be treated as settled by a single non-resident person if the value of settlements made by that person, together with settlements made by persons associated with that person, total 50% or more of the total value of settlements made on the trust (section FG†2†(7)). The discussion below focuses on the application of the regime to New Zealand companies, as it is anticipated that these persons will be the primary group affected by the regime. The application of the regime to trusts and individuals is dealt with at the end of the article. Control test (extent of person’s “ownership interest”) The test of whether a company is controlled by a single person is contained in section FG 2†(2)-(6). The test is based on tier-by-tier control. Its essential argument is that if company A controls company B, and company B in turn controls company C, then company A will be held to also control company C by virtue of its ability to control company B. Formally, control is said to exist when a person has an ìownershipî interest in a company of 50% or greater. This ownership interest includes the personís direct and indirect ownership interests in the company, as well as direct and indirect interests held by persons associated with that person (section FG 2†(2)). The following examples illustrate the direct and indirect interest concepts: from page 13 continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Section FG 2 (3) A personís direct ownership interest in a company is the highest interest held in any of the categories of income interest applied under the CFC regime. Thus, if a person directly holds 75% of the voting rights relating to distributions by the company, but only 60% of the total shares of a company and rights to vote in any other matters, the personís direct ownership interest in the company will be 75%. Implications for taxpayers meeting conditions in section FG 2 If a taxpayer meets any of the criteria in section FG†2†(1), it will be necessary for the taxpayer to calcu- late its New Zealand group debt percentage. This is a consolidated calculation for all members of that taxpay- erís New Zealand group. Once the New Zealand group debt percentage of the taxpayer is determined, it is compared to these two threshold debt percentages: ï a 75% safe harbour debt percentage ï 110% of the worldwide group debt percentage of the taxpayer. Both of these threshold debt percentages must be exceeded before the regime will apply to a taxpayer. Safe harbour debt percentage The purpose of the thin capitalisation regime is to deny a deduction for interest to the extent that the taxpayerís non-resident parent has over-allocated interest expense to New Zealand, compared with the debt percentage of its worldwide group. To this end, an interest deduction will be disallowed to the extent that the New Zealand group debt percentage of a taxpayer exceeds 110% of the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage (section FG 3†(b)). For compliance cost reasons a 75% safe harbour debt percentage has also been included. This safe harbour is intended to ensure that most normal commercial structures will not be subject to the regime. Further flexibility has been provided by two additional features of the regime. In calculating a taxpayerís NZ group percentage: ï Interest-free debt will be treated as equity (section FG†4†(2)). ï A concession exists for funds on-lent by taxpayers (section FG 6). Inland Revenue envisages that for most taxpayers, existing financial statements or tax accounts will make it quite easy to demonstrate that the 75% safe harbour debt percentage will not be breached by the taxpayerís New Zealand group, without the need for the formal NZ group consolidation calculations in section FG 4 to be performed. New Zealand group debt percentage There are two aspects to determining a taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage. First, it is necessary to Example 3 Non-resident 1 NZ Parent 1 NZ Sub 1 1 NZ Sub 2 1 60% 30% 30% In this example, Non-resident holds: ï a 60% direct ownership interest in NZ Parent ï a 30% indirect ownership interest in NZ Sub 1 ï a 9% indirect ownership interest in NZ Sub 2. The indirect ownership interest in NZ Sub 2 arises because Non-resident holds a direct ownership interest in NZ Parent, and NZ Parent holds an ownership interest in NZ Sub 2 (there is no require- ment that the ownership interest held by NZ Parent be a direct ownership interest for the tracing rule to apply). Example 4 Non-resident 1 NZ Sub 1 1 NZ Parent 1 20% 60% 30% NZ Sub 2 1 30% In this example, Non-resident holds an ownership interest in NZ Sub 2 of 30%. This arises because: ï Non-resident holds a direct ownership interest in NZ Sub 1. ï Non-residentís direct ownership interest in NZ Sub 1, when aggregated with direct ownership interests held by persons associated with Non- resident (NZ Parent) is 50%. ï Non-resident is therefore deemed to hold all ownership interests held by NZ Sub 1 in any other companies. Note: Ordinarily, Non-resident would also hold an additional 9% indirect ownership interest in NZ Sub 2 traced through its direct ownership interest in NZ Parent. However, because this would result in the double counting of the same ownership interest, the ownership interest is only counted once (section FG 2†(5)). from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) determine which taxpayers will be members of the taxpayerís New Zealand group. This involves determin- ing the New Zealand parent of the taxpayer, and that New Zealand parent then determining the group members. Once the New Zealand group is determined, the gener- ally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of consoli- dation for the elimination of intra-group transactions are applied to the group to calculate the New Zealand group debt percentage of the taxpayer. New Zealand group (section FG 4 (10)-(13)) The definition of a New Zealand group is built around three fundamental concepts: ï The group will contain those companies for which control can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from the taxpayerís New Zealand parent company. ï At the election of the New Zealand parent company, the threshold for tier-by-tier control will be based on either GAAP (greater than 50% control) or an alternative 66% threshold. ï The New Zealand group will be consistent for all companies in that group (if, in relation to any tax- payer, Co A is in the same New Zealand group as Co†B, the New Zealand group for Co A will be the same New Zealand group that applies for Co B). It is this last requirement for consistency between members of the New Zealand group that has resulted in the detailed rules in section FG 4†(10) and (11) to determine the taxpayerís New Zealand parent. The New Zealand parent is identified in relation to a number of taxpayers, and is required to make consistent grouping elections for all companies for which it is the New Zealand parent (section FG 4†(13)). New Zealand parent A taxpayerís New Zealand parent will be the top tier company resident in New Zealand which holds an ownership interest in the taxpayer. A top tier company is one in which non-residents hold a 50% or greater direct ownership interest. If more than one top tier company is identified, the New Zealand parent will be the one for which the direct ownership interests held by non-residents multiplied by the top tier companyís ownership interest in the taxpayer produces the highest value (section FG 4†(10)). Example 5 NR Co 1 1 NZ Co 1 1 NR Co 2 1 NZ Co 2 1 Taxpayer Co 1 100% 100% 60% 10% In the diagram, both NZ Co 1 and NZ Co 2 meet the conditions of section FG 4†(10)(b) to be the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co. Both companies hold an ownership interest in Taxpayer Co, and non-residents hold a direct ownership interest in each of the companies. Under the tie-breaker rule in section FG 4†(10)(c), the New Zealand parent of Taxpayer Co will be NZ†Co†1. This is because the direct ownership interests held by non-residents in NZ†Co†1 (100%), multiplied by NZ†Co†1ís ownership interest in Taxpayer Co (60%) produces a greater result than multiplying the direct ownership interests held by non-residents in NZ†Co†2 (100%), by NZ†Co†2ís ownership interest in Taxpayer Co (10%). Election to vary New Zealand parent (section FG 4 (11)) The potential New Zealand parents identified by section FG 4†(10)(b) can mutually elect for the tie-breaker rule in section FG 4†(10)(c) not to apply. In that case, the New Zealand parent will be that company determined by joint election. Determination of New Zealand group (section FG 4 (12)) The taxpayerís New Zealand group is determined once the taxpayerís New Zealand parent is identified. The group is defined in relation to the New Zealand parent. The group will contain all companies which are either resident in New Zealand or are carrying on a business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment, and which are, at the election of the New Zealand parent: ï in the New Zealand parentís GAAP group; or ï in a group for which 66% aggregate direct ownership interests can be traced on a tier-by-tier basis from the New Zealand parent. Example 6: GAAP group NR Parent 1 NR Sub 1 NZ Co 1 1 NZ Co 2 1 100% 100% 100% The GAAP group of NZ†Co†1 will include NZ†Co†2, as control of both companies can be traced on a tier- by-tier basis to NR Parent. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Example 8: Consolidation NR Co 1 NZ Co 1 1 NZ Co 2 1 100% 100% NR†Co is a non-resident company, and NZ†Co†1 and NZ†Co†2 are resident in New Zealand. Suppose that the balance sheets of NZ†Co†1 and NZ†Co†2 at 31 March 1997 read as follows: NZ†Co†1 Investment in NZ†Co†2 100 Equity from NR†Co 100 Other assets 300 Debt300 400400 NZ†Co†2 Assets400Equity from NZ†Co†1 100 ††††††Debt300 400400 In isolation, it would appear that NZ†Co†1 and NZ†Co†2 each have a debt percentage of 75% and are therefore not subject to the thin capitalisation regime. However, the same $100 used by NR†Co to provide equity for NZ†Co†1 has also been used by NZ†Co†1 to provide equity to NZ†Co†2. The consolidated accounts for NZ†Co†1 and NZ†Co†2 would read as follows: Consolidated balance sheet Assets700 Equity from NR†Co 100 ††††††Debt600 700700 Thus once the double counting of equity is elimi- nated through consolidation, the true debt percent- age for the New Zealand group of 85.7% is deter- mined. The New Zealand group may therefore be subject to the thin capitalisation regime. The thin capitalisation regime may require taxpayers to calculate their group debt percentages for both of the following: ï New Zealand group (section FG 4) ï Worldwide group (section FG 5). Measurement dates (section FG 4 (5)-(6)) The consolidation calculations can be performed, at the taxpayerís option, based on any of three alternative measurement bases: ï the last day of the taxpayerís income year ï an average of the amounts at the end of each three- month period in the year; ï an average of the amounts at the end of each day in the year. Example 7: 66% group NR Parent 1 NZ Co 1 1 NZ Co 4 1 NZ Co 2 1 NZ Co 3 1 100% 100% 70% 40% 30% The 66% group of NZ†Co†1 will consist of NZ†Co†1, NZ†Co†2 and NZ†Co†3. NZ†Co†2 is included by virtue of the 66% or greater direct ownership interest in the company held by NZ†Co†1. NZ†Co†3 is included by virtue of the fact that aggregate direct ownership interests of 66% or greater are held by members of a 66% group (NZ†Co†1 and NZ†Co†2). Unlike the GAAP group, NZ†Co†4 will not be a member of NZ†Co†1ís New Zealand group. NZ†Co†4 will therefore form a New Zealand group by itself. Calculation of New Zealand group debt percentage (section FG 4) The taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage is calculated as the total debt of the taxpayerís New Zealand group divided by the New Zealand groupís total assets. Section FG 4 provides specific rules for how the amount of these assets and debt are to be measured. Requirement to consolidate The taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage is determined by consolidating the assets and debt of the members of the taxpayerís New Zealand group to eliminate transactions between companies in that group. This consolidation is performed in accordance with the principles in SSAP-8 (section FG 4†(9)). If the taxpayerís New Zealand group contains any member that is not resident in New Zealand, the assets and debt of that member will be included in the consoli- dated calculation for the group only to the extent that the non-resident is carrying on business in New Zealand through a fixed establishment (section FG 4†(17)). The requirement to determine the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage on a consolidated basis is necessary to maintain the integrity of the thin capi- talisation regime. Without consolidation, it would be possible for non-residents to construct a chain of New Zealand companies, resulting in multiple counting of equity down the chain (equity in the top tier company would be used to provide the equity for the second company, and so on down the chain). The following example illustrates how consolidation works. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) If members of the taxpayerís New Zealand group do not all have the same balance date, these three alternatives apply as if the taxpayer had the same balance date as its parent (section FG 4†(6)). Example 9: Different balance dates A taxpayer has a 30 June 1997 balance date, but its New Zealand parent has a 30 September 1997 balance date. The alternative measurement bases are: ï 30 September 1997 ï the average of the consolidated amounts on each of 31 December 1996, 31 March 1997, 30 June 1997, and 30 September 1997 ï the average of every day in the period 1†October 1996 to 30 September 1997. Measurement of asset values Section FG 4†(4) provides the general rule that the measurement of the value of the assets for a taxpayerís New Zealand group is to be based on acceptable valuations under New Zealandís GAAP. As a general rule, the valuation of assets will be the valuation recorded in the financial accounts for the New Zealand group (section FG 4†(3)(a)). However, it is recognised that the valuations for financial reporting purposes are likely to have been adopted for other than tax reasons. The regime therefore allows taxpayers to adopt some alternatives for valuing assets: ï If the taxpayer could have adopted the net current (market) value for assets under GAAP but has chosen not to for financial reporting purposes, the net current value may be adopted for thin capitalisation purposes. ï If market selling value has been adopted for tax purposes, those values may also be adopted for thin capitalisation purposes (this rule overrides the requirement that asset valuations be consistent with GAAP). Definition of debt The definition of debt under the thin capitalisation regime is based on the financial arrangement definition used under the accruals rules. A financial arrangement is treated as debt under the thin capitalisation regime if both of these conditions are met: ï The financial arrangement provides funds to the issuer. ï The issuer can claim a deduction in respect of the financial arrangement in calculating its assessable income (other than a deduction solely attributable to a movement in foreign exchange rates) (section FG†4†(2)). The term ìprovides fundsî is not defined in the Act. It is intended to convey the broad concept that only arrangements that provide capital to the issuer should be included in the thin capitalisation regime. If there is any doubt over whether a particular financial arrangement provides funds, the new section 90A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 empowers the Commis- sioner to determine whether the financial arrangement provides funds for the purposes of the thin capitalisation regime. Specified leases (section FG 9) Specified leases are included within the ambit of the thin capitalisation regime. Accordingly, for the purposes of the regime: ï Debt will include specified leases. ï Deductible expenditure incurred under a specified lease will be treated as interest. One implication of this is that specified leases will qualify for the on-lending concession. On-lending concession (section FG 6) There are rules that apply if any member of the taxpay- erís New Zealand group is the holder of a financial arrangement which is issued by and provides funds to either of the following: ï a person who is not associated with the taxpayer ï a non-resident who also does not operate a fixed establishment in New Zealand. In this situation, the amount of total assets and total debt of the taxpayerís New Zealand group are both reduced by the amount of the outstanding balance of that arrangement. The term ìoutstanding balanceî is not defined in the Act, but is a plain language English description of the accrued balance. Because the thin capitalisation regime generally relies on financial accounts (rather than tax accounts) to determine group debt percentages, the term has intentionally been left general in meaning. The effect of the concession will be to effectively remove the activity of financial intermediation (e.g., banking) from the regime. Example 10 A taxpayerís balance sheet at 31 March 1997 reads as follows: Loan to unassociatedEquity100 non-resident250 Other assets 150 Debt300 400400 When consolidated calculations are performed for the taxpayerís New Zealand group, the amount of debt included in the calculation will be only $50, and the total assets taken into account will be $150. Both total assets and total debt are reduced by the amount of $250 qualifying for the on-lending concession. continued on page 20 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) The taxpayerís worldwide group includes the following companies: ï the taxpayer ï the taxpayerís New Zealand group ï the taxpayerís worldwide GAAP group ï the taxpayerís ultimate non-resident parent ï the worldwide GAAP group of the ultimate non- resident parent. The following example illustrates this rule: Example 11 JV Parent Co 1 NR Co 1 1 NR Co 2 1 NZ Co 1 50% 100% 70% NR Co 3 1 NR Parent Co 1 50%100% The other interests in NR†Co†1 are held by a number of unrelated parties. In the diagram, NZ Coís worldwide group consists of: ï the taxpayer and its New Zealand group, being NZ Co only ï NZ Coís worldwide GAAP group, including NR†Co 1 and NR†Co†2 ï NZ Coís ultimate non-resident parent, NR Parent Co ï NR Parent Coís worldwide GAAP group, includ- ing JV Parent Co. Note that NR†Co†3 will not be a member of NZ†Coís worldwide group under this test. Joint venture partners (section FG 5 (9)) If, at some point in the chain, a company is controlled 50% by each of two joint venture partners, the taxpayer may elect to exclude one of those partners from its worldwide group. Members of that partnerís worldwide GAAP group will also be excluded from the taxpayerís worldwide group if such an election is made. Ultimate control by non-corporate The taxpayerís worldwide group will also include any non-corporate person who holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in the taxpayer, together with persons associated with that non-corporate person. The following example illustrates this rule: Assets and debt denominated in foreign currencies The value of assets and debt must be measured in New Zealand dollars. If the value of an asset or debt is denominated in a foreign currency, the taxpayer must convert the value of that asset or debt to New Zealand currency using either of the following: ï the close of trading spot exchange rate applying on the relevant measurement day (section FG 5†(6)) ï the forward exchange rate applying on the first day of the income year for the relevant measurement day (section FG 7). Anti-avoidance provision (section FG 4 (8)) Because of the potential for manipulating the amount of total assets and debt around a measurement date, the regime contains an anti-avoidance provision. Any temporary reduction in the amount of a financial arrangement or temporary increase in the value of an asset must be excluded from the calculation of the New Zealand group debt percentage if that reduction or increase has a purpose or effect of defeating the intent and application of the thin capitalisation regime. This rule does not have the effect of requiring an adjustment to be made for temporary changes in the level of debt and assets that occur in the ordinary course of a taxpayerís business. To be caught by the anti- avoidance rule, there must be a purpose or effect to defeat the intent or application of the regime. Tempo- rary changes that occur in the ordinary course of a taxpayerís business would be unlikely to have an attendant avoidance purpose or effect and would therefore not be caught. Application of safe harbour debt percentage (section FG 3 (a)) Once the New Zealand group debt percentage of the taxpayer is determined, it is compared to the 75% safe harbour debt percentage. If the New Zealand group debt percentage is less than 75%, the thin capitalisation regime will not apply to the taxpayer. If the New Zealand group debt percentage does exceed 75%, it is necessary to calculate the taxpayerís world- wide group debt percentage to determine whether the regime will apply. Worldwide group (section FG 5 (8)) Broadly speaking, the taxpayerís worldwide group is based around the worldwide GAAP group of which the taxpayer is a member. However, if the top tier company of the taxpayerís worldwide GAAP group is 50% controlled by another company, the taxpayerís world- wide group will include that other company, as well as any other members of that other companyís worldwide GAAP group. from page 19 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Example 12 Mr X 1 NR Co 1 NZ Co 1 100% 100% Mrs X 1 Because Mr X holds a 50% or greater ownership interest in NZ†Co, he will be a member of NZ†Coís worldwide group (section FG 5†(8)(e)). Any persons associated with Mr X (e.g., Mrs X) will also be members of NZ†Coís worldwide group (section FG†5†(8)(f)). The purpose of this rule is to prevent a non-corporate person thinly capitalising a non-resident company to circumvent New Zealandís thin capitalisation regime. If this were not prevented, the worldwide group debt percentage of the taxpayer could be made sufficiently high that any New Zealand group debt percentage would fall within the threshold debt percentage. This would make the thin capitalisation regime ineffectual. Calculation of worldwide group debt percentage (section FG 5) The calculation of the worldwide group debt percentage is similar to the calculation of the New Zealand group debt percentage. As with the New Zealand group debt percentage, the worldwide group debt percentage is calculated by applying GAAP principles of consolida- tion to the taxpayerís worldwide group to eliminate intra-group transactions (see page 5). There are, however, certain important differences. The key differences are: ï The worldwide group debt percentage is generally calculated on the last day of the accounting year of the worldwide group ending most immediately before the income year of the taxpayerís New Zealand group. ï The amount of total debt and assets is calculated under a financial standard consistent with New Zealandís GAAP (debt will include non-interest bearing debt if it is included as debt in the worldwide groupís financial accounts). These differences are intended to reduce compliance costs. It is anticipated that the required details will generally be readily available in the existing financial statements of the taxpayerís worldwide group. However, for consistency with the determination of the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage, the taxpayer may elect either or both that: ï debt for the worldwide group be measured based on the definition of debt used in calculating the taxpay- erís New Zealand group debt percentage (i.e., finan- cial arrangements that provide funds and are deduct- ible); ï the total assets and debt of the worldwide group be calculated on the basis of the average daily or quar- terly measurement bases able to be used to determine the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage (section FG 5†(5)). Consistencies with determination of New Zealand group debt percentage The rules for determining the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage are very similar to the rules for determining the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage in the following respects: ï The value of total assets and total debt is required to be denominated in New Zealand currency, and subject to the same exchange rate conversion rules (section FG 5†(6)). ï The amount of total assets and debt of the worldwide group must be reduced by any amount that is on-lent by a member of the group to a person not associated with the taxpayer and which provides funds to the recipient (section FG 6†(2)). ï An anti-avoidance rule applies so that any temporary increase in the amount of total debt or temporary decrease in the amount of total assets is disregarded in calculating the worldwide group debt percentage (section FG 5†(7)). Default worldwide group debt percentage If it is impractical or impossible for the taxpayer to determine the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percent- age in accordance with the rules in section FG 5, the taxpayer may elect for the Commissioner to estimate it. The taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage will then be the amount so estimated by the Commissioner. If the Commissioner cannot reasonably make such an estimation, the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage will be treated as being 68.1818% (section FG 5†(12)). (The amount 68.1818% is used because that amount, when multiplied by 1.1, results in 75%, the safe harbour debt percentage.) If the taxpayer is unable to determine its worldwide group debt percentage, and the Commissioner is not approached to estimate it, the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage will also be treated as being 68.1818%. If there are no members of the taxpayerís worldwide group that are not resident in New Zealand, the taxpay- erís worldwide group debt percentage will be treated as being 68.1818% (section FG 5†(13)). Amount of interest expense denied a deduction (section FG 8) The thin capitalisation regime will apply to deny an interest deduction if the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage exceeds both of the following: ï 75% ï 110% of the taxpayerís worldwide group debt percentage. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) NZDP - TDP is a deflator applied to the amount of NZDPinterest determined under the other parts of the formula which determines the proportion of affected interest to be denied a deduction. The basis for the calculation of this deflator is that, following the denial of an interest deduction, the amount of debt to which the remaining deductible interest applies will be the highest amount of debt in relation to the New Zealand groupís assets for which no interest expense would be denied. Elections (section FG 10) There are a number of elections to be made under the thin capitalisation rules. In most cases, these are effected merely by completing a tax return that is consistent with the election made. The only exceptions are if a taxpayer is required to make an election on behalf of another taxpayer (e.g., elections made by a taxpayerís New Zealand parent). In such cases, the election must be made in writing and submitted with the tax return of the person making the election. Ability to revoke election and make new one Section FG 10†(2) provides that a taxpayer may, on receipt of an assessment from the Commissioner, revoke an election to measure total assets and debts based on a single end of year measurement for the purposes of calculating the taxpayerís New Zealand and worldwide group debt percentages, and apply either the average of quarterly or daily values instead. This provision is intended to apply if the taxpayerís calculation on the basis of a single measurement day indicated that the threshold debt percentages had not been breached, but a subsequent audit by Inland Rev- enue demonstrates otherwise. In this situation the provision allows the taxpayer to still determine the amount of interest expense to be disallowed based on an alternative measurement date basis, if the taxpayer so desires. Application of regime to trusts The application of the regime to trusts is very similar to the application of the regime to companies. The key differences are found in the definition of the New Zealand and worldwide groups of the trust: ï The New Zealand group of a trust includes all persons that are associated with the trust (section †FG†4†(15)), and that meet either of the following conditions: - They are resident in New Zealand. - They are not resident in New Zealand, but are carrying on a business through a fixed establish- ment in New Zealand (but only to the extent those persons carry on business in New Zealand). In this situation the taxpayerís deductible interest expense for the income year will be reduced in accord- ance with the formula in section FG 8: The amount of interest disallowed is calculated as: (I - GI - IFD) x TNZD - NZDA xNZDP - TDP TNZD NZDP In this formula: Iis the amount which would have been deduct- ible by the taxpayer under section DD 1†(b) but for this Subpart. GIis the amount deductible by the taxpayer under section DD 1†(b) in respect of amounts payable (excluding any amount included in item IFD) to a company included in the taxpayerís New Zealand group under section FG 4†(12) or section FG 4†(15). IFD is the amount deductible by the taxpayer under section DD 1†(b) in respect of financial arrange- ments excluded from total debt for the taxpay- erís New Zealand group by virtue of section FG†4†(2). TNZD is the total debt of the taxpayerís New Zealand group, for the income year, calculated under section FG 4 before allowing for any adjustment under section FG 6. NZDA is the amount, if any, deducted under section FG 6 in calculating the total debt of the taxpay- erís New Zealand group for the income year. (This amount must be averaged in circum- stances where section FG 4†(5)(a) or section FG†4†(5)(b) applies.) NZDP is the taxpayerís New Zealand group debt percentage for the income year. TDP is the greater of the following - (a) 75 percent (b) The taxpayerís worldwide group debt percent- age multiplied by 1.1. (Note: If the taxpayer is an individual who is not a trustee, TDP will always be 75 percent. This is dis- cussed in the section on individuals below.) The formula has three distinctive parts which achieve the following individual effects: (I - GI - IFD) is the amount of interest that would otherwise be deductible by the taxpayer under section DD†1†(b), less any amount of interest paid to another member of the taxpayerís New Zealand group or interest paid on any financial arrangement that does not provide funds to the taxpayer. TNZD - NZDA is a deflator that reduces the amount of TNZDinterest determined as (I - GI - IFD) proportionally to reflect the proportion of the taxpayerís New Zealand groupís debt that is on-lent (and to which section FG 6 applies). from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) ï The worldwide group of a trust includes all persons associated with the trust. The principles of consolidation for determining the New Zealand and worldwide group debt percentages of the taxpayer apply in the same way as they do for groups of companies. Application of regime to individuals The thin capitalisation regime will apply to individuals (other than trustees) in a somewhat different manner from that of companies. This is necessary because: ï The requirement to consolidate assets and debts of associated relatives to determine New Zealand and worldwide group debt percentages is likely to be impractical. ï To simply remove the requirement to consolidate would undermine the application of the regime - real ownership would be difficult to determine if an individualís assets and liabilities became entangled with those of other family members. The key differences in the treatment of individuals are as follows: ï Individuals are not required to calculate their New Zealand group debt percentage on a consolidated basis. Instead, the regime will focus only on their individual assets and liabilities (section FG 4†(16)(a)). ï Individuals are not able to benefit from the worldwide group debt percentage threshold. Instead, the regime will apply only on the basis of whether the 75% safe harbour threshold is exceeded (section FG 3). ï An individualís total assets will not include any private or domestic assets (section FG 4†(16)(b)). Foreign investor tax credit regime Part LE, Income Tax Act 1994 Introduction The foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime has been extended to all non-resident shareholders in New Zealand companies. The regime previously only applied to non-resident portfolio shareholders (less than 10% interest holders). The effect of the FITC regime is to reduce the maximum rate of tax (combining company tax and NRWT) on non-resident equity investors to 33%, the same rate as for New Zealand companies. The FITC regime allows a company an income tax credit (the FITC credit), which is calculated as a portion of the imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders. The company is entitled to this credit when it pays a supplementary dividend of the same amount to its non-resident shareholders. Because it is based on the amount of imputation credit attached to a dividend, the FITC regime only applies to the extent that company tax has actually been paid. The measures providing relief from double taxation for non-resident investors are mainly contained in new Part LE of the Income Tax Act 1994. Consequential amend- ments have also been made to the dividend and residual income tax definitions, and the resident withholding tax and imputation credit account provisions (sections OB†1, LD 3, ME 4 and ME 5). Background Previously, non-resident direct investors (those with 10% or greater interests) were taxed twice on income distributed from New Zealand companies. A New Zealand company paid tax at a rate of 33%. A further 15% was levied on dividends, in the form of NRWT, resulting in a total New Zealand tax impost of 43% on pre-tax income. For countries with which New Zealand has no double tax agreement the NRWT rate was 30%, and the total New Zealand tax impost was 53%. In contrast, the total tax levied on New Zealand com- pany income which is distributed to New Zealand shareholders does not exceed 33% because of the effect of the imputation system which prevents double taxation of New Zealand shareholders. The reason for the different treatment is that resident shareholders can use imputation credits to reduce tax on dividend income, but non-residents cannot. A FITC credit has been allowed to companies paying supplementary dividends to non-resident portfolio shareholders (less than 10% interest holders) in respect of dividends paid on or after 28 September 1993. Key features ï The regime applies to all non-residents with equity investments in New Zealand companies. ï The amount of FITC credit is based on the amount of imputation credit attached to a dividend. This means that the FITC regime can only apply to the extent that company tax has actually been paid. ï A portion of the underlying company tax is effectively refunded to non-resident investors, resulting in the total New Zealand tax (combining company tax and NRWT) on company income distributed to non- resident investors being limited to 33%. ï The refund of company tax is achieved by allowing New Zealand companies a tax credit, which they are entitled to when they pay a supplementary dividend of the same amount to non-resident investors. Non- resident investors remain liable for non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) on dividends (including continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Although the supplementary dividend does not need to be paid by the company at the same time as the normal dividend, it does need to be paid in the same income year as the dividend to which it relates. References to income years in the FITC provisions should be read as including non-standard accounting years (section OF 2). Calculating the tax credit (section LE 2 (2)) The FITC regime reduces the tax which is charged on income earned by a company to the extent it is distrib- uted to (and therefore attributable to) non-resident investors. The regime uses the imputation credits already allocated to dividends paid to non-resident investors (which were previously unusable) to calculate the value of the FITC credit received by the company. The company in turn passes these credits on to non- resident investors in the form of a supplementary dividend. To take advantage of the FITC mechanism, a company must attach a different proportion of imputation credits to dividends paid to non-resident shareholders than it attaches to dividends paid to its resident shareholders. Section LE 2†(12) ensures that this treatment does not breach the anti-streaming rules in the imputation regime (see page 27). Part LE determines the amount of FITC credit by reference to the amount of imputation credit actually allocated to the non-resident shareholder (as adjusted to take advantage of the FITC mechanism). The FITC credit is calculated by multiplying the amount of this imputation credit by the fraction 67/120 (equivalent to 0.5583 recurring). This means the credit is set at approximately 55.83 cents for every dollar of post-FITC adjusted imputation credits attached to dividends paid to non-resident investors. The FITC mechanism effectively reduces the underlying company tax rate so that the total New Zealand impost on company income distrib- uted to non-resident investors is no more than 33%. The amount of FITC credit a New Zealand company will receive can also be calculated directly by multiply- ing the imputation credits it would normally distribute on dividends paid to non-resident shareholders by the fraction 67/187, which is approximately equivalent to the constant 0.358275 (0.5583/1.5583). Thus if a company would have distributed $33 of imputation credit to its non-resident investors in the absence of the FITC relief, the credit would be $11.82 (67/187†x†$33). Table 1 on page 25 illustrates the calculations for a company that pays tax at 33% on $100 of profit which is fully distributed net of tax to shareholders. The table sets out the different treatments for a New Zealand investor, a non-resident direct investor before the extended FITC regime, and a non-resident direct investor under the new regime. In the last situation the total New Zealand tax take (combination of company tax and NRWT) is reduced to the level applying to New supplementary dividends) they derive from New Zealand resident companies (the NRWT rate is reduced from 30% to 15% to the extent dividends are fully imputed). ï The FITC credit is allowed against income tax payable by the company paying the supplementary dividend for the year in which the dividend is paid. ï If the company has paid no tax for that year, the FITC credit may be applied to refund tax paid in any of the four immediately preceding income years. ï If unutilised FITC credits still exist, the company can carry them forward, subject to shareholder continuity rules. Excess FITC credits are not refundable. ï A FITC credit received by a company can also be claimed against the tax liability of another company in the same wholly-owned group. ï Special rules apply to the application of the bench- mark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules. The main effect of these is that the normal level of imputa- tion credits attached to a dividend is reduced by an amount equal to the FITC credit. ï Specific statutory authority has been given to compa- nies to pay supplementary dividends to ensure that there is no conflict with company law rules. ï The payment by a trustee of a fixed trust of a supple- mentary dividend to a non-resident beneficiary will not contravene any terms of the fixed trust. ï A special mechanism has been introduced to allow use of the FITC regime by lower tier New Zealand companies in circumstances where a New Zealand holding company has insufficient tax liability to utilise the FITC credit arising from paying a supple- mentary dividend to its non-resident investors. Application date The new FITC regime in Part LE applies with respect to dividends paid on or after 12 December 1995. Availability of the tax credit (sections LE 2 (1) and OF 2) The tax credit is available only: ï to the extent of imputation credits attached to divi- dends derived by non-resident investors from New Zealand resident companies (This is necessary to ensure that full company tax has been paid before the regime can apply.); and ï if the company has paid the non-resident investor a supplementary dividend equal to the amount of the FITC credit. Only one supplementary dividend may be paid with each dividend. This is to prevent the FITC regime being used to reduce the total New Zealand tax imposed on income distributed to non-residents to less than 33%. from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) ï 55.83% of the post-FITC $21.18 of imputation credits ï 15% of the post-FITC combined dividend and supple- mentary dividend of $78.82. The supplementary dividend (which is equal to the FITC credit) of $11.82 is sufficient to pay the NRWT liability on the total dividend of $78.82. The NRWT rate is 15% (regardless of the non-resident investorís country of residence) as the dividend is fully imputed (section NG†2). Zealand shareholders (33%). Under the FITC regime the credit reduces the companyís tax bill by $11.82. The dividend received by the non-resident investor is increased by the same amount (in the form of a supple- mentary dividend) from $67.00 to $78.82. The $11.82 FITC credit is approximately equal to: ï 35.82% of the pre-FITC $33 of imputation credits (continued in opposite column) Table 1: Credit approach where dividends fully imputed New ZealandForeign directForeign direct Investorinvestor (previous)investor (current) Profit before tax100.00100.00100.00 normal company tax(33.00)(33.00)(33.00) add back credit †††0.00††††0.00††11.82† Net company tax(33.00)(33.00)(21.18) Profit after tax67.0067.0078.82 Dividends67.0067.0078.82 less personal tax (@ 33% of $100) (33.00)0.000.00 add back imputation credits33.000.000.00 less NRWT (@ 15% of dividend)†††0.00†(10.05)(11.82) Net deductions††0.00(10.05)(11.82) Net dividend to shareholder67.0056.9567.00 Tax paid to New Zealand33.0043.0533.00 Table 2 illustrates the effect of the new regime on the home tax treatment of non-resident investors.

Effect of credit carry back (section LE 2 (6)) A FITC credit may need to be applied against the tax liability of a company for an earlier income year. This could occur if a company pays dividends with imputa- tion credits but has no current year tax liability (because the imputation credits attached to the dividend paid in the current year relate to the taxable profits of prior years). This situation is addressed by allowing the credit to be used to refund tax paid in any of the four immediately preceding income years. Only tax relating to the 1993-94 or later income years is refundable in this way. Note that the base year for the purposes of the carry- back of the FITC credits is the 1993-94 income year for both direct and portfolio non-resident investors. If a company applies a FITC credit to an income year that is earlier than the one in which the relevant supple- mentary dividend is paid, use of money interest is not payable in relation to that credit and the earlier income year. This is the correct policy result. The objective in applying the credit from the FITC mechanism to an earlier year is to provide a mechanism to reduce the total level of New Zealand tax on non-resident investors to 33%. The refund of any tax under this mechanism is the means of achieving this objective, rather than reflecting an over-assessment of tax for an earlier year. It is therefore not appropriate that a use of money interest credit arise in these circumstances, and the section OB 1 definition of ìresidual income taxî has been amended to ensure that use of money interest is not paid in relation to a refund of income tax resulting from such utilisation of a FITC credit arising from a supple- mentary dividend paid during the 1995-96 income year and subsequent years. Effect of refund on imputation account A refund of income tax resulting from the carry back of a FITC credit to an earlier income year than the year in which the supplementary dividend is paid will give rise to a debit in the companyís imputation credit account (section ME 5†(1)(e)). A refund of tax resulting from the carry back of a FITC credit will always result in a debit to the companyís imputation credit account, notwith- standing any previous shareholder continuity breach. (A refund relating to income tax paid before the date on which an ICA debit arises from a shareholder continuity breach normally does not give rise to a further ICA debit to the extent that the refund does not exceed the debit arising from the shareholder continuity breach.) (section ME 5†(1)(e)(iii)). However, the Government has announced that a reme- dial amendment will be made to ensure that a debit does not arise for a FITC refund if the following sequence occurs: Utilisation of FITC credit (section LE 2 (4)-(10)) Section LE 2 contains a number of ordering rules for the utilisation of a FITC credit. Summary The FITC credit is calculated in respect of an income year in which a supplementary dividend is paid. The offset of the credit is made in the following order: ï First, against the taxpayer companyís income tax payable for the income year in which the supplemen- tary dividend is paid. ï Second, against either of the following: - the taxpayer companyís income tax payable for the previous four income years - the income tax payable by another company in the same wholly-owned group as the taxpayer company for the year in which the supplementary dividend is paid or the four previous income years. ï Third, subject to the shareholder continuity require- ments of subsection (7) being met, carried forward to a future income year and offset against the companyís income tax liability for that future year. If the carried forward credit is not able to be offset against the companyís own tax liability, the company may elect to offset the credit against the income tax liability for that future year of another company in the same wholly-owned group. The order of offset is explicitly provided in section LE†2. The credit must be applied as far as possible under step one, with step two applying only to the amount of FITC credit not able to be utilised under step one, and step three applying only to the extent that the taxpayer cannot utilise the credit under steps one and two. Options for offset in the current year A company has two options for benefiting from the FITC credit applied to a current year tax liability. The company may either: ï reduce its terminal tax payment by the amount of the credit (this occurs automatically as the FITC credit reduces a companyís residual income tax); or ï if paying provisional tax on the estimation basis, reduce its provisional tax by the amount of FITC credit it estimates it will have by the end of its income year. There is no requirement for a company to have paid any provisional tax before it pays a supplemen- tary dividend. The supplementary dividend will give rise to a FITC credit, reducing its residual income tax which will flow through to lower provisional tax payments. The use of money interest provisions in the Act will apply as normal for a current year FITC offset. The from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) 1. a company pays a dividend in respect of which a supplementary dividend will be paid. 2. a shareholder continuity breach then occurs for which a debit arises to the imputation credit account of the company. 3. a refund of FITC in respect of the supplementary dividend is not received from Inland Revenue until after the shareholder continuity breach. Credit carry forward (section LE 2 (7) and (8)) FITC credits that cannot be utilised in the current year or carried back to a previous income year can be carried forward to a subsequent year subject to shareholder continuity rules. This can occur only if a company is not able to offset the FITC credit against income tax payable by the company (or another company in the same wholly-owned group) in the income year that the company pays a supplementary dividend or an earlier income year. The shareholder continuity rules applying for the purposes of the carry forward of FITC credits are similar to those applying for the purposes of the loss carry forward rules. There must be a group of persons whose aggregate minimum voting interests (or mini- mum market value interests if a market value circum- stance exists) in the company in the period from the beginning of the income year in which the excess credit arises to the end of the year of carry forward is equal to or greater than 49%. Application of credit mechanism to wholly-owned groups (section LE 2 (6) and (9)) Under the FITC regime the company paying the supple- mentary dividend to a non-resident investor is entitled to the tax credit. However, in a group of companies the parent company paying a supplementary dividend to a non-resident investor may have no tax liability of its own that it can offset the tax credit against, as the subsidiaries themselves pay the tax within the group. This situation is addressed by allowing a FITC credit received by a company to be claimed against the tax liability of another company in the same wholly-owned group. For this to happen, the company that receives the tax credit must elect to do so by filing a written notice with its tax return for the relevant year. The four-year credit carry back rule also applies to a wholly-owned group. A company may use a FITC credit it receives to reduce tax paid by another company in the same wholly-owned group in the four years preceding the income year in which the dividend is paid. The FITC credit carry forward rule also applies to a wholly-owned group. If a FITC credit carried forward by a company cannot be utilised by the company itself, the credit may be used to reduce income tax payable in the year of carry forward by another company in the same wholly-owned group. Priority of FITC as a tax credit (section LE 2 (3) and (8)) The credit for company tax available under the FITC regime is offset against income tax payable by a com- pany after allowing for foreign tax credits available under section LC 1. If that were not the case, it is conceivable that a company might extinguish its New Zealand tax liability under the FITC regime, leaving no New Zealand tax liability against which it could offset any available foreign tax credits. Such credits are lost if they are not offset against New Zealand income tax payable on foreign income in the same income year that the foreign income is derived. The credit for company tax available under this regime is offset against income tax payable by a company before allowing for imputation credits available under section LB 2 which are attached to dividends received by the company. This ordering rule allows a company deriving fully imputed dividend income to still utilise the tax credit available under the FITC regime. Such a company can convert resulting excess imputation credits into a loss which can in turn be offset against the income of other companies in the same group or carried forward by the company (subject to normal shareholder continuity requirements). The FITC credit is also offset against income tax payable by a company before allowing for resident withholding tax credits available under section LD 3. This ordering rule is of benefit to companies receiving income from which resident withholding tax has been deducted, as excess resident withholding tax credits are refundable. Resident withholding tax credits are offset against income tax payable by a company after allowing for imputation credits (section LD 3†(3)). Meaning of term “dividend” for FITC purposes The term ìdividendî, for the purposes of the FITC regime in new Part LE, includes the amount of any imputation credit attached to the cash dividend. This is achieved by the inclusion of a reference to Part LE in Section CF 6†(1) of the Income Tax Act. Section CF†6†(1) grosses up the amount of a dividend to include any imputation credits attached to it for the purposes of certain Parts of the Income Tax Act. Application of benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules (section LE 2 (11) and (12)) If a company receives a tax credit under the FITC regime, the companyís tax payments are reduced; this in turn reduces the amount of imputation credits available for distribution with dividends. It would defeat the purpose of the regime if this reduction in tax (and corresponding reduction in available imputation credits) combined with the benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules to prevent companies from doing either of the following: continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) ï the companyís articles of association or constitution; or ï any other rule of law. This provision has been included for these reasons: ï It relieves companies of the need for and cost of changing their articles of association or constitutions to authorise the payment of a supplementary dividend to their non-resident shareholders. ï It overrides section 45 of the Companies Act 1993, which prohibits companies from having constitutions which permit differential dividends to be paid to shareholders of the same class. ï It removes any doubt that any provision of the Com- panies Act 1955 or any other rule of law could prevent companies from paying supplementary dividends even if their articles of association or constitutions specifically permit such payments. A company may still insert a provision in its articles of association or constitution which prohibits the payment of a supplementary dividend, provided such provision expressly refers to section LE 2†(13) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Interface with trusts (section LE 2 (14)) Non-resident beneficiaries of trusts will be able to benefit from the FITC regime in the normal manner if they derive dividends and supplementary dividends as beneficiary income from New Zealand resident compa- nies in terms of section LE 2†(1). Trustee shareholders will need to advise New Zealand resident companies of their non-resident beneficiaries who will derive any dividend as beneficiary income in the same manner as nominee companies currently advise companies of their non-resident investors. This is necessary so that companies can pay supplementary dividends along with normal dividends to the trustee shareholders who receive them on behalf of the non- resident beneficiaries. The trustee shareholders will then on-distribute the dividends to the non-resident benefici- aries who will derive such dividends as beneficiary income. Subject to this advice function being under- taken, the FITC regime should apply in the normal manner to trusts with non-resident beneficiaries. Section LE 2†(14) is designed for fixed trusts (under which beneficiaries are entitled to fixed amounts or proportions of distributions) and ensures that the payment by a trustee of a supplementary dividend to a non-resident beneficiary will not contravene any terms of a fixed trust. It is not necessary to apply the provision to discretionary trusts as such trusts by their very nature have a free ability to pay different amounts to benefici- aries. Section LB 1†(3) contains a rule to prevent streaming of imputation credits by trusts. This is achieved by provid- ing that the amount of imputation credit allowed to each beneficiary of a trust is proportional to the distributions made to each beneficiary of the trust during the year. ï distributing the normal amount of dividend with the normal amount of credits attached; or ï paying supplementary dividends. To deal with this, companies are relieved from the benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming provi- sions in the imputation and FDWP regimes in relation to the payment of supplementary dividends. Section LE 2†(11) states that for the purposes of the benchmark dividend and anti-credit streaming rules of the imputation and FDWP regimes, the supplementary dividend is treated as if it were not paid. This means that the anti-credit streaming rules will not be breached, even though the supplementary dividend has no imputa- tion credits attached. Section LE 2†(12) provides also that for the purposes of these imputation regime rules, a company is deemed to have attached an imputation credit to the normal dividend it pays out equal to the amount of the FITC credit. This deeming provision is necessary to enable a company to attach different levels of imputation credits to its domestic and foreign shareholders without contra- vening the anti-credit streaming rules. Just as importantly, the deeming provision also ensures that the benefit of the FITC credit that a company receives under the regime is passed on to its non- resident investors because otherwise there would be a breach of the imputation credit rules. A company that paid normal fully credited dividends to non-resident investors and a supplementary dividend would be deemed to have attached to the normal dividend addi- tional imputation credits equal to the supplementary dividend. This would result in a breach of both section ME 8†(1) (the maximum imputation credit rule) and section ME 8†(2) (the benchmark dividend rule). To avoid such breaches the company would need to reduce the supplementary dividend to zero. Only by reducing the level of normal imputation credits by the level of tax relief available (i.e., the FITC credit) can the imputation credit streaming rules be complied with. Therefore in the example in Table 1, the company may only attach $21.18 of imputation credits (not $33) to the dividend paid to the non-resident investor under the FITC regime. This is the right policy result because the tax relief itself reduces corporate tax and should therefore reduce the normal level of imputation credits. Section ME 4†(1)(a)(v) provides that income tax paid by way of crediting under Part LE does not give rise to a credit in a companyís imputation credit account. Ability to pay supplementary dividends and company law requirements (section LE 2 (13)) The payment of a supplementary dividend by a company to a non-resident investor is specifically deemed not to contravene any of the following: ï any provision of the Companies Act 1955 or section 45 of the Companies Act 1993; or from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Section LB 1†(3A) has been inserted to create an appropriate interface between the anti-imputation credit streaming rule for trusts in section LB 1†(3) and the FITC regime. The amendment will ensure that the effect of the current anti-imputation credit streaming rule for trusts is maintained. Section LE 3 holding company mechanism The holding company mechanism in section LE 3 allows the FITC regime to be used in circumstances where a New Zealand holding company will have an insufficient tax liability to utilise the FITC credit arising from paying a supplementary dividend to its non- resident shareholders. In short, the mechanism allows lower tier New Zealand companies to claim the FITC credit when paying dividends up the chain of companies to the ultimate New Zealand resident holding company with the non-resident shareholders. Eligibility requirements (section LE 3 (1), (2) and (3)) A lower tier New Zealand company is entitled to a FITC credit when it pays a dividend and a supplementary dividend to a section LE 3 holding company. A section LE 3 holding company is a New Zealand resident company which: ï has given notice in writing to the lower tier dividend- paying company before the dividend is paid, advising the company that it is a section LE 3 holding com- pany; and ï has not revoked that notice before the dividend is paid. A notice of election to be a section LE 3 holding company will be treated as having being revoked by the section LE 3 holding company in any of the following circumstances: ï More than seven years have passed since the end of the year in which the notice was given. This seven- year maximum term for any election coincides with the record retention period and is necessary to ensure that companies can provide evidence of giving notice of an election to be a section LE 3 holding company if required to do so by Inland Revenue. ï The section LE 3 holding company elects to revoke the notice. ï The section LE 3 holding company does not have the purpose, in keeping the notice alive, of enabling (directly or indirectly) the payment of a supplemen- tary dividend to a non-resident. ï The only persons holding voting interests in the section LE 3 holding company are residents of New Zealand. In other words, the section LE 3 holding company must have at least one ultimate non-resident shareholder. (Under the voting interest rules in section OD 3, voting interests in a company are traced through any interposed corporate shareholders to the ultimate individual shareholders.) ï The section LE 3 holding company is exempt from income tax on dividends (other than under section CB†10, which contains the exemption from income tax on foreign sourced dividends derived by New Zealand resident companies and the wholly-owned group inter-corporate dividend exemption). If any of the preceding circumstances occur, the section LE 3 holding company is required to give notice in writing to the lower tier dividend-paying company of the deemed revocation as soon as practicable (section LE 3†(3)). Application of section LE 3 mechanism (section LE 3 (4)) The primary section LE 2 tax credit mechanism applies in relation to the dividend and supplementary dividend paid by the lower tier dividend-paying company to the section LE 3 holding company as if the section LE 3 holding company were not resident in New Zealand. The dividend-paying company is accordingly entitled to a FITC credit because, in terms of LE 2†(1), the divi- dend and supplementary dividend it pays have been derived by a non-resident. Note that a section LE 3 holding company is not treated as a non-resident for the purposes of section LE 2 when it pays a dividend itself. Associated persons - deferral of FITC credit (section LE 3 (5)) When a company pays a dividend and a supplementary dividend to an associated section LE 3 holding company with an earlier balance date, the related FITC credit will be first allowed to the dividend-paying company in its income year corresponding with the income year of the section LE 3 holding company at the time of the dividend payment. This rule addresses the deferral opportunity that would otherwise occur if a section LE 3 holding company had an earlier balance date than the dividend-paying company. In such cases, the dividend could be assess- able to the section LE 3 holding company in a later income year than the income year of the dividend paying company in which the FITC credit arises. The benefit of the deferral to associated companies has been denied by deferring the allowance of the FITC credit to the dividend-paying company. Example 1 A dividend and a supplementary dividend are paid on 20 February 1996 by a company with a 30 June balance date to an associated section LE 3 holding company with a 31 December balance date. The FITC credit would be first allowed in the dividend- paying companyís 1996-97 income year (instead of its 1995-96 year). The dividend would be assessable in the section LE 3 holding companyís 1996-97 income year as usual. The associated persons definition in section OD 8†(3) is used for the purpose of determining whether a dividend- paying company and a section LE 3 holding company are associated. However, a modification to that defini- continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Minimum income tax payable by a section LE 3 holding company (section LE 3 (10) and (11)) Section LE 3†(10) provides that, notwithstanding any other provision in the Income Tax Act 1994, a section LE 3 holding company has a minimum amount of income tax payable for an income year equal to the supplementary dividends derived by it during that income year. The provision ensures that if a section LE 3 holding company otherwise does not have sufficient income tax payable (e.g., it is in a loss position), it would at least be required to pay as income tax the amount of any supplementary divi- dends it derives. This requirement is designed to both protect the revenue, and to ensure that the holding company has a refundable tax liability against which a FITC credit may be offset. Section LE 3†(11) converts any additional tax paid under section LE 3†(10) into a loss to carry forward. The provision will generally apply to companies in loss and allows the reinstatement of tax losses. The crediting of tax under section LE 2 constitutes payment for the purposes of section LE 3†(11). The conversion of any additional tax paid under subsection (10) into a loss carried forward is achieved by dividing the amount of additional tax by the company tax rate (expressed as a percentage). Example 3 A section LE 3 holding company with a $100 carried forward loss derives $100 of taxable profits in the income year, comprised of a $67 cash dividend, with a $21.18 imputation credit attached, and a supplementary dividend of $11.82. The company is required under section LE 3†(10) to pay $11.82 of income tax. This minimum amount payable of $11.82 is converted into a $35.82 loss under section LE 3†(11). The $21.18 imputation credit gives rise to a $64.18 loss under section LB 2†(3). Therefore the section LE 3 holding company is reinstated with $100 of losses to carry forward to the next income year. This deemed loss is additional to any other loss for the income year that the section LE 3 holding company may have. Example 4: section LE 3 holding company A New Zealand resident operating company has a pre-tax profit of $200 for an income year. The operating company is 50 percent owned by a 100 percent foreign-owned New Zealand resident holding company, and 50 percent owned by a New Zealand resident. The holding company gives notice in writing to the operating company under section LE 3†(2) that it is a section LE 3 holding company. Page 31 sets out the resulting tax calculations under the FITC mechanism. tion (for the purposes of section LE 3†(5) only) ensures that section LE 3†(5) will not apply to defer the allowance of any FITC credit in the case of a lower tier joint venture company of which two holding companies each own 50†percent. Application of wholly-owned group inter- corporate dividend exemption and RWT rules (section LE 3 (6), (7), (8) and (9)) Section LE 3†(6) overrides the wholly-owned group exemption for dividends in section CB 10†(2), except to the extent to which the dividend is not fully imputed. The formula for determining the extent to which a dividend is fully imputed is: (IC + SD) x †1 - T† +IC T In this formula: IC is the imputation credit attached to the dividend. SD is the supplementary dividend. Tis the company tax rate, expressed as a percentage. The imputation credit is deemed, for the purposes of the imputation credit entitlement provision in section LB 2, to be included in the part of the dividend which is not exempt under section CB 10†(2). Example 2 A cash dividend of $67 with a $10 imputation credit attached (post-FITC mechanism), together with a supplementary dividend of $5.58, is paid to a section LE 3 holding company. Applying the formula gives an amount of $41.63 as the fully imputed portion. The difference between this figure and the amount of the dividend ($77, being $67 cash plus $10 imputation) is $35.37, which is the amount of the cash dividend (representing the unimputed part of the dividend) which can continue to be exempt under section CB†10†(2). A dividend paid to a section LE 3 holding company is exempt from resident withholding tax (RWT) to the extent that it is fully imputed. The formula in section LE 3†(6) is used to determine the extent to which the dividend is fully imputed and therefore not subject to RWT. The part of the dividend that is not imputed therefore remains subject to the same RWT treatment as it would have been outside of the FITC regime. The imputation credit is included in the part of the dividend that is exempt from RWT under this rule (section LE 3†(7)). A supplementary dividend derived by a section LE 3 holding company is not exempt from tax under the wholly- owned group exemption for dividends in section CB 10†(2) (section LE 3†(8)). However, it will be exempt from the RWT rules (section LE 3†(9)). from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) New ZealandHolding TotalResidentCompany Operating Company Cash Position Profit before tax200.00 Tax payable(66.00) Tax credit††11.82 145.82 Dividend134.0067.0067.00 Supplementary dividend††11.8211.82 145.8278.82 Cash paid to shareholders145.8267.0078.82 Imputation Position (assuming tax paid and FITC subsequently refunded) Tax paid66.00 Imputation credits attached to dividends paid(54.18)33.0021.18 Tax refund(11.82) ††0.00 Holding Company Tax Position Dividends derived (including supplementary dividend)78.82 Imputation credits received ††21.18 Taxable dividend100.00 Tax33.00 Less imputation credits(21.18) Less FITC credit (once dividend passed on)(11.82) Net tax liability††0.00 Cash Position Dividend derived (including supplementary dividend)78.82 Dividend for foreign parent67.00 Supplementary dividend11.82 78.82 NRWT @ 15%( 11.82) Net dividend to shareholder67.00 NRWT to IRD(11.82) Net cash paid67.00 Imputation Position Credit attached to dividend received21.18 Tax paid: - Tax payable11.82 - FITC credit refund(11.82) Credits attached to dividend paid(21.18) ††0.00 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) Reduction in branch profits tax rate (Clause 5 of Part A of Schedule 1, Income Tax Act 1994) The tax rate on the New Zealand branch income of non- resident companies has been reduced from 38% to 33%, with effect from the 1996-97 income year. The reduction in the branch profits tax rate is consistent with the extension of the foreign investor tax credit (FITC) regime to non-resident direct investors. The FITC regime reduces the maximum rate of tax on non- resident investors (taking into account the combined effect of company tax and NRWT) to 33%. As a branch structure is a substitute for a majority equity investment in a New Zealand company by a non-resident, it should not be subject to a higher rate of taxation. The removal of the higher 38% rate of tax on the New Zealand branch income of non-resident companies has been achieved by simply repealing clauses 3 and 6 of Part A of Schedule 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Clause 6 set the higher 38% rate of tax for non-resident companies. Clause 3 also imposed a higher 38% on non-resident mining operators. A new clause 5 has been substituted which simply sets a 33% rate for all compa- nies. The former clause 5 referred to New Zealand resident companies. Consequential amendments have also been made to sections CN 4†(1) and DN†5†(2). NRWT rate reduction on fully imputed dividends (section NG 2) The NRWT rate has been reduced from 30% to 15% on dividends paid to non-resident investors on or after 12†December 1995 to the extent the dividends are fully imputed. Previously, investors resident in countries with which New Zealand did not have a double tax agreement were subject to a 30% NRWT rate, while investors resident in treaty countries were generally subject to a 15% NRWT rate by virtue of the maximum rate relief provision for dividends in the relevant double tax agreement. The reduction in the domestic rate of NRWT on dividends paid to non-residents from 30% to 15% ensures equal treatment of investors resident in treaty and non-treaty countries when such dividends are fully imputed. The NRWT rate reduction on fully imputed dividends is consistent with the extension of the FITC regime to non-resident direct investors. The effect of the FITC regime, in conjunction with the NRWT rate reduction, is to reduce the maximum rate of tax on non-resident investors (combining company tax and NRWT) to the New Zealand company rate of 33%, regardless of the country of residence of the non-resident. The reduction in the NRWT rate on fully imputed dividends from 30% to 15% is also consistent with the new branch profits tax rate of 33%, which applies whether or not the head office is in a treaty country. Without such a NRWT reduction, there would have been a tax preference for non-treaty country investors to adopt a branch structure for investment into New Zealand. A 30% rate of NRWT on dividends will continue to apply to dividends to the extent that they are not fully imputed. However, the portion of any dividends which are not fully imputed and which is paid to an investor resident in a country with which New Zealand has a double tax agreement will continue to be generally subject to a 15% NRWT rate by virtue of the application of the maximum rate relief provision for dividends in the relevant double tax agreement. Section NG 2†(3) contains the following formula for calculating the portion of any dividends which is fully imputed: (IC + SD) x 1 - T T In this formula: IC is the amount of imputation credits attached to the dividends. SD is the amount of supplementary dividends payable as a result of Part LE in respect of the dividend. T is the rate of resident companiesí tax, expressed as a percentage, stated in clause 5 of Part A of Schedule 1 and applying in respect of the income year that is concurrent with the imputation year in which the dividends are paid. A supplementary dividend is subject always to a 15% NRWT rate only. Example 1 A $67 cash dividend with a $21.18 imputation credit attached, together with an $11.82 supplemen- tary dividend, is paid to an investor resident in a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement. Applying the formula above gives a $67 result. Therefore the entire cash divi- dend of $67 is subject to an NRWT rate of 15%. (The $11.82 supplementary dividend is also subject to a 15% NRWT rate.) Example 2 A $67 cash dividend with a $16 imputation credit attached, together with an $8.93 supplementary dividend, is paid to an investor resident in a country with which New Zealand does not have a double tax agreement. Applying the formula above gives a $50.61 result. Therefore a $50.61 portion of the $67 cash dividend is subject to a 15% NRWT rate while the remaining $16.29 portion is subject to a 30% NRWT rate (the $8.93 supplementary dividend is subject to a 15% NRWT rate). International tax - other related amendments 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) NRWT rate on fully imputed non-cash dividends (sections NG 2 (1) (b)(ii) and OB 1) The NRWT rate on fully imputed non-cash dividends (as defined in section OB 1) paid to non-resident investors on or after 12 December 1995 is zero percent. Non-cash dividends are also excluded from the FITC regime. This is achieved by excluding non-cash divi- dends from the new dividend definition applying for FITC purposes (Part LE), contained in paragraph (ba)(ii)(A) of the definition of the term ìdividendî in section OB 1. This exclusion is appropriate as the FITC mechanism is structured on the assumption that NRWT is imposed on the dividend, whereas a zero rate of NRWT now applies to non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed. Again, the NRWT zero rating of non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed is consistent with the extension of the FITC regime to non-resident direct investors. The effect of both the FITC regime and the NRWT zero rating of non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed is to reduce the maximum rate of New Zealand tax on non-resident equity investors (combining company tax and NRWT) to the New Zealand company rate of 33%. Requiring non-cash dividends to be fully imputed before they qualify for the NRWT zero rate ensures that the zero rating only applies to the extent that full company tax has been paid on the underlying company income. The NRWT zero rating of non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed (rather than excluding such dividends from the definition of non-resident withhold- ing income) ensures that such dividends are not subject to a separate income tax liability as they qualify for ìNRWT as a final taxî treatment under section NG 3. The NRWT zero rating of non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed was intended, in part, to address the mainly transitional issue of retained earnings and imputation credits being distributed in corporate groups in such a manner so as to make the utilisation of the FITC regime difficult. This would be the case, for example, where the holding company derives only non- assessable dividend income and therefore has no tax liability against which to offset its FITC credit resulting from supplementary dividends it pays to its non-resident shareholders, while the lower tier operating subsidiary has an insufficient credit balance in its imputation credit account (because it has paid fully imputed dividends to the holding company) to allow a refund of the FITC credit. (Because the imputation rules limit a tax refund to the amount of the credit balance in a companyís imputation credit account, the absence of such a credit balance would prevent the FITC credit being refunded to the subsidiary.) The NRWT zero rating of non-cash dividends to the extent fully imputed therefore allows taxpayers to distribute earnings in New Zealand holding companies to non-resident shareholders by way of fully imputed taxable bonus issues which can be subsequently re- deemed. If such taxable bonus issues are of non-participating redeemable shares, their subsequent redemption should not be liable to tax as a dividend under section CF†2†(1)(g). This is because non-participating redeem- able shares are exempt from the brightline tests in section CF 3†(1)(b)(i). Additionally, in terms of the anti- avoidance rule in section CF 3†(1)(b)(iii), Inland Revenue is likely to be satisfied that a particular re- demption of fully imputed taxable bonus issue shares is not in lieu of a dividend. The extent to which non-cash dividends are fully imputed is calculated according to the formula in new section NG 2†(3) (see page 32). The Commissioner has made a determination under section NG 10 that all persons are relieved from the obligation to comply with section NG 9†(1) in respect of non-cash dividends which are fully imputed and accordingly subject to a zero percent NRWT rate under section NG 2†(1)(b)(ii). Section NG 10 allows the Commissioner to relieve any person (the company paying the non-cash dividend) from an obligation to deduct NRWT in accordance with section NG 9. (Section NG 9 deals with the calculation of the amount of NRWT required to be deducted by a company paying a non-cash dividend to a non-resident.) Life insurer related amendments (sections NG 2 (1)(b)(iii), NG 3 (ba) and OB 1) Most non-resident life insurers with New Zealand branch operations have elected under section OE 3 for their New Zealand branches to be treated as separate New Zealand resident companies for New Zealand income tax purposes. Section NG 2†(1)(b)(iii) imposes a zero percent NRWT rate on all non-resident withholding income (dividends, interest or royalties) derived by a non-resident life insurer on or after 12 December 1995 from its New Zealand branch that is deemed to be a separate New Zealand resident company by virtue of an election having been made under section OE 3. To ensure that the zero rate of NRWT is a final New Zealand tax on non-resident withholding income derived by a non-resident life insurer from its deemed New Zealand resident subsidiary, a reference to interest or royalties so derived by a non-resident life insurer has been included in section NG 3†(ba). Section NG 3 stipulates those cases in which NRWT is a final New Zealand tax, that is, there is no separate imposition of income tax. (NRWT is always imposed on dividends as a final New Zealand tax.) The zero percent NRWT rate on distributions made by a deemed New Zealand resident life company to its non- resident life insurer parent is consistent with the reduction in the non-resident company tax rate from 38% to 33% and the extension of the FITC regime to non-resident direct investors. continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.11 (March 1996) investor tax credit regime, and the reduction in the non- resident company tax rate from 38% to 33%, also make these project-specific tax concessions largely redundant. The provisions have only been infrequently applied since their inception. The following associated provisions have also been consequentially repealed or amended: sections CZ 5, NF†1†(2)(a)(vi), NG 1†(2)(f), NG 3, OB 5, OB 6†(1), OF†2†(2)(m)(iv), and associated definitions of terms in section OB 1. The three special development project Orders in Coun- cil relating to section KF 2 which were previously in force have also been revoked with effect from the 1996-97 income year. A savings provision (section KZ 3) allows some of the non-resident investment company rebates (those speci- fied in section KF 1†(2) and (3)) to continue to apply in respect of the development projects specified in the four non-resident investment company Orders in Council currently in force. A dividend derived by a non-resident life insurer from its deemed New Zealand resident subsidiary is excluded from the FITC regime (paragraph (ba)(ii)(B) of the definition of the term ìdividendî in section OB 1, which applies for FITC purposes). This exclusion is necessary because the FITC regime is structured on the assump- tion that a 15% NRWT rate applies to dividends paid to non-residents. Repeal of project-specific tax concessions for non-residents (sections KF 1 and KF 2) The non-resident investment company and special development project rebate provisions (contained principally in sections KF 1 and KF 2) have been repealed with effect from the 1996-97 income year. These project-specific tax concessions have been repealed because they are inconsistent with the Govern- mentís ìbroad-base/low-rateî tax strategy.

Licensed premises operators and entertainment Public ruling - BR Pub 96/5 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section DG 1 and Schedule 6A of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to any person who carries on business as a licensed premises operator (“licensee”) and who, in the ordinary course of that business: • Incurs expenditure on food or beverages and makes special offers of that food or beverages in arm’s length transactions with members of the general public. The special offers of food or beverages to which this ruling applies include: - Happy hours - where a licensee offers drinks at reduced prices during a particular time period: - Offers of free drinks to certain members of the public on certain days or at certain times: - Two meals for the price of one: - “Toss the boss” competitions - for every drink purchased, the customer can toss a coin and has the chance to win a free drink; or • Allocates an allowance to an employee (such as a bar manager) to cover the costs of the employee providing free drinks to customers. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to: • Any expenditure on food or beverages provided in a special offer to which this ruling applies; and • The payment of any allowance to which this ruling applies, within the period 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1999. The ruling When a licensee makes a special offer of food or beverages (of the type to which this ruling applies) to members of the general public, the expenditure on that food or beverages is not limited to a 50% deduction under section DG 1. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) When a licensee allocates an allowance to an employee to cover the costs of the employee providing free drinks to customers, and the employee provides the free drinks to the customers during the ordinary course of business and not at a party or similar social function, the expenditure on that allowance is not limited to a 50% deduction under section DG 1. In either case, the expenditure is fully deductible to the licensee if it is incurred in gaining or producing the licensee’s assessable income for any income year or if it is incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income for any income year. This ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of March 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/5 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. All references to a “licensee” are to any person who carries on business as a licensed premises operator. Background From 1 April 1993 certain business expenditure (on food, beverages, recreation, and related accommodation and transportation) became 50% (rather than fully) deductible under the business entertainment deductibil- ity rules. The Government subsequently modified these rules to take account of compliance cost concerns. With effect from 1 April 1995, the rules were replaced with a Schedule of expenditure which is limited to 50% deductibility. Deductible expenditure or loss on a “specified type of entertainment”, set out in Part A of Schedule 6A, is 50% deductible unless the entertainment or benefit is “excluded entertainment” in Part B of the Schedule. If the entertainment or benefit is excluded entertainment in Part B of the Schedule, the expenditure or loss is fully deductible if it is incurred in gaining or producing the taxpayer’s assessable income for any income year or if it is incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income for any income year. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 DG 1106G Schedule 6Anew Section DG 1 states: (1) This section and Schedule 6A are intended to reduce, by 50%, the deduction otherwise available for expenditure or loss incurred on certain types of entertainment, being entertainment that generally involves a significant element of private benefit (but subject always to the express provisions of this section and Schedule 6A). (2) If a taxpayer incurs expenditure or loss on a type of entertainment or benefit (whether consumed or enjoyed by the taxpayer or anyone else) specified in Part A of Schedule 6A then, unless and to the extent that the entertainment or benefit is specified as excluded entertain- ment in Part B of that Schedule, the deduction allowed for that expenditure or loss in calculating the taxpayer’s assessable income will be limited to 50% of the amount that would be deductible but for this section. Part A of Schedule 6A lists “specified types of entertain- ment”. These are: • Corporate boxes. • Holiday accommodation. • Pleasure craft. • Food or beverages: -Provided or consumed as an incidence of the above types of entertainment; or -Provided or consumed off the business premises of the taxpayer; or -Provided or consumed on the business premises of the taxpayer: -( At a party, reception, celebration meal, or other similar social function; or -( In an area of the premises, such as a board- room or an executive or client dining room, reserved for use at the time only by those at a certain level of seniority and their guests and not open to all employees working on the premises. The Schedule defines “Business premises” as: (a) The normal business premises; or (b) A temporary workplace, - of the taxpayer or of an associated person (not being premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment). from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Part B of the Schedule specifies excluded entertainment (i.e., entertainment which is not “a specified type of entertainment” for the purposes of Part A of the Sched- ule). It includes: 9. Entertainment that is provided by the taxpayer for market value (or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction) in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business which consists of providing one or more specified types of entertainment. Application of legislation Special offers of food or beverages to the public When a licensee makes a special offer of food or beverages to the public, the expenditure on that food or beverages is not a specified type of entertainment under Part A of the Schedule because: • The licensed premises where the offer occurs is the licensee’s “business premises” as it is the normal business premises of the licensee. The definition of “business premises” excludes “premises or a workplace established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment”. It is arguable that a licensed premises is established principally for the purposes of enjoying entertainment and so is not the licensee’s “business premises”. However, from the licensee’s perspective, the licensed premises is established principally for the purpose of running a business, and not for the purposes of enjoying entertainment, and so is the licensee’s business premises (note that, for the purposes of the definition of “business premises”, a licensed premises is not a temporary workplace of a person who merely conducts a business meeting at the licensed premises because, from that person’s per- spective, the licensed premises is a workplace estab- lished principally for the purposes of enjoying enter- tainment). Food or beverages which are provided or consumed on the business premises (apart from food or bever- ages consumed in a corporate box, holiday accommo- dation, or a pleasure craft) are only included as a specified type of entertainment where the food or beverages are consumed at a party or similar social function or in an exclusive dining facility. In some cases, food and beverages consumed at a licensed premises are consumed at a party or similar social function or in an exclusive area. However, special offers of food and beverages to the public by the licensee during ordinary opening hours of the licensed premises are not consumed at a social function or in an exclusive area. The costs of food and beverages provided in such circumstances are fully deductible. • Clause 9 of Part B of the Schedule specifies excluded entertainment (i.e., entertainment which is not “a specified type of entertainment” for the purposes of Part A of the Schedule). It includes expenditure on entertainment which is provided at market value, or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction, in the ordinary course of the taxpayer’s business which consists of providing one or more of the specified types of entertainment. Expenditure on such excluded entertainment is, therefore, excluded from the rules, and is fully deductible, if the entertainment is pro- vided by a business at market value or in an arm’s length transaction. It follows that clause 9 of Part B of the Schedule excludes special offers of food or beverages made by a licensee to members of the public where the food or beverages are provided either at market value, or are otherwise provided in an arm’s length transaction in the course of the licensee’s business. In particular: -Happy hours (where drinks are provided to members of the general public for reduced prices) are the provision of drinks by the licensee for either market value (if the market value of the drinks during the happy hour is the reduced “happy hour” price) or otherwise in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. The cost of the drinks is fully deductible. -The cost of free drinks provided to certain members of the public on certain days or at certain times is fully deductible when the provi- sion of the free drinks occurs in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licen- see’s business. -The cost of meals which are offered in a “two meals for the price of one” deal is fully deduct- ible when the meals are provided in an arm’s length transaction in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business. -The cost of drinks provided in “toss the boss” competitions is also fully deductible when the competitor and the licensee have an arm’s length relationship. If this is the case, the free drink prizes are provided in an arm’s length transac- tion in the ordinary course of business. Allowances for free drinks for customers A licensee may allocate a hospitality allowance to an employee, such as a bar manager, to cover the costs of providing free drinks to customers in the ordinary course of business. The expenditure on such an allow- ance is not restricted to 50% deductibility. This is because the expenditure is on beverages provided or consumed on the licensee’s business premises but that are not provided or consumed at a party or similar social function or in an exclusive area of the premises. The allowance is fully deductible if it is incurred in gaining or producing the licensee’s assessable income for any income year or if it is incurred in carrying on a business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income for any income year. Examples The following examples do not form part of the ruling. continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) If the free drinks were a fringe benefit to which fringe benefit tax applies, the expenditure on the drinks would be excluded from the entertainment regime by clause 14 of Part B of the Schedule. However, in this case, the free drinks are not a fringe benefit to which fringe benefit tax applies, because the employees cannot choose when to consume or enjoy the benefit - the free drinks are provided at a time chosen by the licensee. Example 3 A licensee holds a Christmas function and invites brewery representatives. The licensee holds the function in a function room on the licensed premises. All food and drinks are provided to the brewery representatives at no cost. The food and drinks are a specified type of enter- tainment for the purposes of Part A of the Schedule as they are food or beverages provided on the licensee’s business premises at a party or similar social function. The free food and drinks are not excluded entertainment under Part B of the Sched- ule, and so the expenditure is only 50% deductible to the licensee. Definition of “transitional capital amount” Public ruling - BR Pub 96/6 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies to the definition of factor “j” in the formula within the defini- tion of “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to companies that liquidate on or after 1 July 1994 and dis- tribute to shareholders the same class of capital that the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against its losses. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to liquidations (as defined in section OB 1) during the period 1 July 1994 to 31 March 1998 and to distributions arising from such liquidations during the period 1 July 1994 to 31 March 1998. The ruling The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the formula within the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid- up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This ruling is signed by me on the 19th day of March 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Example 1 A licensee offers half price drinks on Saint Patrick’s day to all patrons who wear a green hat. All other drinks are provided at full price. As the half price drinks are provided to the green hat wearers in arm’s length transactions in the ordinary course of the licensee’s business, the expenditure on the drinks is excluded from Part A of the Schedule and is fully deductible to the licensee. Example 2 A licensee invites staff members to a work Christ- mas function. At the function, free drinks are provided to the staff members. These drinks are provided at a party or similar social function and so are a specified type of entertainment for the purposes of Part A of the Schedule. The drinks are only 50% deductible to the licensee. The drinks are provided for less than any price at which drinks are offered to the public at that time (i.e., less than market value) and are not provided in arm’s length transactions. Expenditure on the drinks is not excluded from the entertain- ment regime by clause 9 of Part B of the Schedule. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/6 This analysis of the ruling and the example do not form part of the ruling. Background The Companies Act 1993 enacted major reforms in the company law area. One of the most significant was the removal of the concept of “paid-up capital”. Conse- quently the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 was enacted to accommodate the changes to company law. In particular, the Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 introduced, with application from 1 July 1994, a definition of “available subscribed capital” for tax purposes. The Income Tax Amendment Act 1994 also repealed section 4A(1)(h) of the Income Tax Act 1976. Section 4A(1)(h) allowed the Commissioner to exclude from dividends such amount distributed to a shareholder of the company as the Commissioner considered just and reasonable where: • The company had reduced the amount of the paid-up capital of the shareholder by writing off with High Court approval, losses incurred by the company; and • The company was subsequently wound up; and • Upon the winding up of the company, an amount (whether in money or money’s worth) was distributed to the shareholder in excess of the amount paid up on the shares of the shareholder. Taxpayers wish to know the effect of the repeal, and in particular whether or not it results in a reduction of the “available subscribed capital” of a company when the company has, prior to 1 July 1994, written off losses against paid-up capital. To calculate the available subscribed capital for companies existing prior to 1 July 1994, the “transitional capital amount” must be deter- mined. The terms “available subscribed capital” and “transi- tional capital amount” are discussed in more detail in TIB Volume Six, No. 6 - Company Law Reform (De- cember 1994). Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 Repealed4A(1)(h) OB 1 “transitional capital amount”New Section OB 1 states: “Transitional capital amount”, in relation to a share in a company at any relevant time, means the amount calculated in accordance with the following formula: j + k x m l where - jis the aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994 in respect of shares of the specified class (whenever issued), not being-...\[Emphasis added.\] kis the aggregate of qualifying share premium paid to the company before 1 July 1994... lis the number of shares in the specified class ever issued before the close of 30 June 1994; and m is the number of shares in the specified class on issue at the close of 30 June 1994. Application of legislation The “aggregate amount of capital paid up before 1 July 1994” in factor “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” includes all paid-up capital that has been, prior to 1 July 1994, written off against losses incurred by the company. This allows a company to restore the written-off capital upon liquidation, without the distribution being treated as a dividend to the shareholders. Example 1990 M Ltd issues 1,000 fully paid-up shares at $1 each. 1992 Pursuant to High Court approval, M Ltd writes off $500 (50 cents per share) of paid- up capital from its accumulated losses. 1994 Paid-up capital at 30 June 1994 is $500. 1995 Shareholders decide to liquidate M Ltd. There have been no movements in the capital of M Ltd since the capital reduction in 1992. After the sale of assets the distribution per share will be 75c. Because M Ltd existed before 1 July 1994, its “available subscribed capital” is determined by calculating its “transitional capital amount”. To calculate M’s transitional capital amount, the following formula is used: j + k x m l where- jis paid-up capital at the close of 30 June 1994$ 500 add back capital reduction $ 500 aggregate capital paid up before 1 July 1994 as defined in the ruling$1,000 k qualifying share premiumassume is 0 lnumber of shares ever issued before 1 July 1994 1,000 m shares on issue at 1 July 19941,000 $1,000 + 0 x 1,000 = $1,000 transitional capital 1,000amount The available subscribed capital per share cancelled equals $1,000/1,000 = $1 per share. The $0.75 per share distributed is not treated as a dividend as it does not exceed the available subscribed capital per share. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) GST - when the supply of leasehold land is an exempt supply Public ruling - BR Pub 96/7 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section 14(ca) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the supply of leasehold land by way of rental by a GST registered person. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to a supply of leasehold land by way of rental when the time of supply occurs between 1 July 1996 and 30 June 1999. The ruling A supply of leasehold land by way of rental is only exempt from GST to the extent that the leasehold land is used for the principal purpose of accommoda- tion in a dwelling erected on that land. When that land and any building erected on that land are used in part for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and in part for commercial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is exempt to the extent that it relates to the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. In determining whether the principal purpose of part of that land or any building erected on that land is for accommodation in a dwelling, it is neces- sary to identify that part of the land or building which is a dwelling. When the principal purpose of the dwelling is for accommodation, the lease rental is exempt to the extent that it relates to the supply of that dwelling. When apportionment is necessary under section 14(ca), the lease rental is appor- tioned on an area basis. In cases when the lease rental is expressly calculated with reference to the level of rental derived by the head lessee from the different uses of the land, or the improved value of the land, the lease rental is appor- tioned on a pro-rata basis with reference to the method used to calculate the lease rental. The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(ca) refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. This ruling is signed by me on the 25th day of March 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/7 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 unless otherwise indicated. Background Section 14(ca) exempts from GST the supply of lease- hold land by way of rental, to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) dwelling erected on that land. It expressly excludes from that exemption any grant or sale of the lease of that land. Section 14(ca) applies to the supply of leasehold land by way of rental when it is supplied separately from any buildings or other improvements to that land. This form of lease is commonly known as a “ground lease”. Under a ground lease the rental is generally based on the unimproved value of the land. In such cases the head lessor owns the land, and the head lessee usually owns the buildings and any other improvements to the land. Common examples of ground leases are those supplied by local authorities, port companies, Crown health enterprises, trust boards, and Maori authorities. Section 14(ca) was inserted into the Act by section 12(1) of the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1986. Prior to its enactment, residential owners of leasehold properties had to pay GST on their ground lease rental payments. This was seen as inequitable when compared with residential owners of freehold properties and lessees of residential accommodation. Section 14(ca) is intended to provide an extension to the exemption for rental of accommodation in any dwelling under section 14(c). There is some uncertainty regarding the scope and effect of the section 14(ca) exemption. In particular, uncer- tainty may arise when there is a supply of leasehold land used for both commercial and residential purposes. Doubt has also arisen regarding the meaning of the words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” in section 14(ca). Legislation Section 14 exempts certain supplies from GST. Section 14(ca) exempts: The supply of leasehold land by way of rental (not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land) to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on that land: Section 14(c) exempts: The supply of accommodation in any dwelling by way of - (i)Hire; or (ii) A service occupancy agreement; or (iii) A licence to occupy: Section 2 defines “dwelling” as meaning: any building, premises, structure, or other place, or any part thereof, used predominantly as a place of residence or abode of any individual, together with any appurtenances belonging thereto and enjoyed with it; but does not include a commercial dwelling: Section 2 defines “commercial dwelling” as meaning: (a) Any hotel, motel, inn, hostel, or boardinghouse; or (b) Any camping ground; or (c) Any convalescent home, nursing home, rest home, or hospice; or (d) Any establishment similar to any of the kinds referred to in paragraphs (a) to (c) of this definition; - but does not include - (e) A hospital except to the extent that that hospital is a residential establishment: (f) A dwelling situated within a retirement village or within a rest home, where the consideration paid or payable for the supply of accommodation in that dwelling is for the right to occupy that dwelling: Section 10(18) states: Where a taxable supply is not the only matter to which a consideration relates, the supply shall be deemed to be for such part of the consideration as is properly attributable to it. Application of legislation Section 14(ca) exempts the supply of leasehold land by way of rental to the extent that that land is used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling erected on it. In applying section 14(ca) to any ground lease, the use of the land from time to time must be considered. When all the land and any building erected on that land are used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling, the ground lease is exempt from GST. When all the land and any building erected on that land are used for commercial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is subject to GST. When leasehold land and any building erected on that land are used in part for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling and in part for commer- cial or other non-exempt purposes, the ground lease is exempt to the extent that it relates to the supply of accommodation in a dwelling. This involves apportion- ing the ground lease rental, and imposing GST only on that part of the rental that relates to the non-exempt purposes. Section 10(18) values the consideration for the supply. Determining the part of the consideration for the supply of the leasehold land that is properly attribut- able to the non-exempt use of that land generally involves apportioning the rental on an area basis. In each case an assessment of the degree to which the land is being used for the supply of accommodation in a dwelling, compared with its commercial or other uses, needs to be made. For example: • A six-storey building erected on leasehold land is used on an area basis as to 60% for offices, 20% for a restaurant, and 20% for residential apartments. The residential apartments are used for the principal purpose of private accommodation. 20% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. (The parts of the leasehold land and buildings used in common by residential and other occupants e.g., entrances, foyers, lifts and stairwells, should be apportioned between those uses on a pro-rata basis.) •A leasehold property is used on an area basis as to 90% for grazing and 10% for a dwelling. The dwell- ing is used for the principal purpose of private accommodation. 10% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) land” refer to any payment made for: • The creation of a leasehold interest in that land, other than a payment of rent; or • The sale of the leasehold interest in the land. Any grant or sale by the head lessor (owner of the land) of a ground lease of that land, where the ground lease is exempt from GST to the extent that it is used for the principal purpose of supplying accommodation in a dwelling, is not exempt from GST. Whether GST is payable on the sale or grant depends on whether the sale or grant is made in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by the head lessor. Comments on technical submissions received Submissions were received to the effect that section 14(ca) not only applies to the supply of leasehold land, but also to the supply of leasehold land and improve- ments. This is because under general land law the lease of a building is the lease of the building and the lessor’s interest in the land on which the building is erected. This distinction is important when considering whether the section applies to subleases of buildings situated on leasehold land. The section only refers to the supply of leasehold land. It applies to the extent that that supply of land involves accommodation in a dwelling. A distinction is drawn between the land and any dwellings erected on that land. This suggests that the supply of leasehold land refers only to situations where the land is supplied without improvements i.e., a ground lease. In addition, section 14(d) supports the interpretation of section 14(ca) as only applying to supplies of ground leases. Section 14(d) refers to “leasehold land” and refers back to section 14(ca). Section 14(d) exempts the supply of the reversionary interest in the fee simple estate of any leasehold land. This is where the leasehold land has been used by a registered person for a period of five years or more before the date of the supply exclu- sively for the making of any supply or supplies under section 14(c) or 14(ca). Section 14(d) is dealing with the leasehold interest created by the head lessor. The reference to supplies under section 14(c) and section 14(ca) indicates that section 14(c) applies when a head lessor supplies land and buildings; whereas section 14(ca) applies when only land is supplied. In addition, the legislative background to the enactment of section 14(ca) supports interpreting the reference to leasehold land as being to the supply of ground leases. Examples The following examples do not form part of the ruling. Example 1 A property investment company owns a commercial site. It leases the land by way of ground lease to a commercial property company. The commercial property company owns a three-storey commercial In some cases the ground lease rental may be expressly calculated with reference to the lease rentals derived by the head lessee from the different uses of the land. If this is the case, under section 10(18), the consideration properly attributable to the non-exempt use of the leasehold land is that part of the ground lease rental which relates to the rentals derived from that use of the land. In such circumstances, apportioning the ground lease rental simply on an area basis does not determine the part of the consideration for the supply of the leasehold land that is properly attributable to the non- exempt use of that land. For example, a six-storey building erected on leasehold land is used on an area basis as to 50% for offices, and 50% for residential apartments. The ground lease rental is set at 5% of rentals derived from the building. The rent of office space amounts to 75% of the total rent derived from the building. 25% of the ground lease rental is exempt from GST. Similarly, where the ground lease rental is expressly calculated with reference to the valuation of the im- proved value of the land, the apportionment of the ground lease rentals will be based on the pro-rata values of the different uses of that land. This reflects the consideration properly attributable to the supply of the leasehold land for those different uses. The examples set out below illustrate how the above principles apply to particular fact situations. Alternative interpretations It is acknowledged that there are alternative interpreta- tions of section 14(ca). For example, it is arguable that the section does not permit apportionment due to the inclusion of the words “principal purpose”. However, such an approach ignores the inclusion of the words “to the extent that”. These words appear in other parts of the Act and are interpreted as requiring apportionment. It is also arguable that section 14(ca) only exempts the supply of leasehold land when all the land is used for the principal purpose, i.e., more than 50%, of accommo- dation in a dwelling. The exemption then only applies to the extent that the land is so used. For example, the ground lease rental of land on which a building is situated that is used as to 75% for accommodation and 25% for offices, is exempt from GST as to 75%. How- ever, the ground lease rental of land on which a build- ing is situated that is used as to 25% for accommodation and 75% for offices, is not exempt from GST. This interpretation creates a unique approach to apportion- ment under the Act. Given that there are alternative interpretations of the section, including the interpreta- tion under this ruling, it is reasonable to assume that Parliament did not intend to create a new basis of apportionment under the Act. A grant or sale of the lease of that land The words “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that land” create an exception to the exemption under the main body of section 14(ca). The words in section 14(ca) “not being a grant or sale of the lease of that from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) building on the property. An earlier lessee erected the building. The commercial property company altered part of the building to include a two bed- room flat to provide residential accommodation. It has leased half the building, including the flat, to a butchery business. The lease expressly refers to the commercial and residential uses of the premises. The butchery business leases the flat to an unrelated individual for residential accommodation. A company which carries on a bakery business leases the other half of the building from the commercial property company. The bakery com- pany has made alterations to its half of the building, including a small studio flat that it sub-lets, for no consideration, to one of its staff who works an early shift. The bakery company’s lease with the commer- cial property company does not refer to the residen- tial use. • The supply of the ground lease between the property investment company and the commercial property company is subject to apportionment under section 14(ca). That part of the land used for residential purposes, i.e., the two bedroom flat, and the studio flat, is exempt. The supply of the balance of the land is subject to GST. It is not used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling. Section 10(18) applies to apportion the consideration on an area basis. • The supply of the lease between the commercial property company and the butchery business is subject to apportionment. It is not exempt from GST under section 14(ca) because it is not the supply of leasehold land by way of rental. How- ever, the supply of residential accommodation is exempt under section 14(c). The supply of commercial premises is subject to GST. Section 10(18) applies to apportion the consideration for the supply of the lease on an area basis. • The supply of the lease between the commercial property company and the bakery company is subject to GST. It is not exempt from GST under section 14(ca) because it is not the supply of leasehold land by way of rental. It is the supply of a leasehold interest in a building situated on that land. Section 14(c) does not apply to that part of the building being used as a studio flat because it is the bakery company, and not the commercial property company, that is supplying the residen- tial accommodation. • The supply of the lease between the butchery business and the unrelated individual is exempt from GST under section 14(c). This is because it is the supply of accommodation in a dwelling by way of hire. • The supply of the studio flat by the bakery company to its staff member is exempt from GST under section 14(c). This is because it is a supply of accommodation in a dwelling under a service occupancy agreement. Example 2 A local authority (“the Authority”) owns certain commercial land. It currently leases the land by way of ground lease to a property development company. The property development company owns an office block situated on the property that it built and, until recently, let. The building is now empty. The property development company intends to refurbish the building and turn it into city residential apart- ments. It intends to lease the apartments. It is considering retaining the two ground floor units and leasing one to a retailer. It intends to use the other unit as its office. • When the building situated on the land was used as offices, the supply of the ground lease by the Authority to the property development company was subject to GST. From the time the land is used in part for the principal purpose of supplying accommodation in a dwelling, the supply of the ground lease will be subject to apportionment under section 14(ca). That part of the land used for residential purposes, i.e., the apartments, is exempt. The supply of the balance of the land, i.e., the ground floor, is subject to GST. It is not used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwelling. Section 10(18) applies to apportion the consideration. The property development company will need to approach the Authority and inform it of the partial change in use of the building situated on the land. The apportionment of lease rental under section 14(ca) applies as and when each residen- tial apartment is let. Until each apartment is let, that part of the building is not used for the principal purpose of accommodation in a dwell- ing. A dwelling is a building or part of a building used predominantly as a place of residence by any individual. • The supply of any lease between the property development company and a retailer will be subject to GST. It is not exempt from GST under section 14(c) or section 14(ca). Example 3 A trust board (“the Board”) owns prime land on the outskirts of a city. The Board subdivides the land into 30 lots. It has decided not to sell the lots outright, but rather to retain ownership and create leasehold interests. It grants individual leases of the subdivided lots. It grants these leasehold interests to private lessees to build houses on the land. The Board intends to charge an average of $10,000 for entering into the lease. The average annual ground rental for the on-going supply of the leasehold land will be $2,000. • The initial grants of the leasehold land are subject to GST, as the Board is making the grants in the course of its taxable activity of land development. The exception to the exemption under section continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) • The supply of the ground lease to the individual is exempt from GST under section 14(ca). • The sale of the property, including the Council’s leasehold interest in the land, is potentially subject to GST. This is because the Council will be making the sale in the course of its taxable activity. Section 14(ca) does not apply to exempt the sale. This is because the exception to the exemption under section 14(ca), for the grant or sale of a lease, applies to the sale. However, provided that at the time of sale the Council has leased the land for a period of five years or more exclusively for the principal purpose of accommo- dation in a dwelling erected on that land, the exemption under section 14(d) will apply. Fletcher Challenge Ltd’s share capital reorganisation Product ruling - BR Prd 96/3 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections BB 4, BB 7, and the definition of “avail- able subscribed capital” and “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The arrangement is the proposed reorganisation (“the reorganisation”) of the share capital of Fletcher Challenge Limited (“the company”) involving the consolidation, subdivision, and reclassification of four Ordinary Division Shares into: • Two Fletcher Challenge Paper Shares; and • One Fletcher Challenge Energy Share; and • One Fletcher Challenge Building Share, - together the “New Division Shares”. Other facts of the arrangement and relevant information are as set out in the Information Memorandum to shareholders dated 28 February 1996 (being in the same form as previously supplied to Inland Revenue on 27 February 1996) and Board Resolutions dated 28 February 1996 (being in the same form as previously provided to Inland Revenue under cover of a letter dated 26 February 1996) and letters and enclosures provided to Inland Revenue dated 25 January, 5, 7, 20, and 22 February 1996 and the company’s application for a private binding ruling dated 26 January 1996 and the company’s application for a product binding ruling dated 20 February 1996. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumption that the reorganisation proceeds and that the facts will be as described in the aforementioned documentation. 14(ca) for the grant or sale of a lease applies, because consideration has been paid, i.e., the charge, for the initial grant of the leasehold interest. • The on-going supply of the leasehold land by way of rental will be exempt from GST under section 14(ca). Example 4 A local, GST registered council (“the Council”) owns a residential section. It leases the land by way of ground lease to an individual who owns, and lives in, a house situated on the property. An earlier lessee built the house some years ago. The Council intends to sell all its inner city leasehold land, including this section, to a third party. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Ruling Subject to the assumption stated above being correct: A. Assessable income/expenditure or loss The reorganisation does not give rise to any assessable income to shareholders of the company under section BB 4, nor any expenditure or loss under section BB 7. B. Dividend The reorganisation does not give rise to any dividend under section CF 2 (1). C. Cost base For the purposes of sections BB 4 (a), (c), and (d), and BB 7 the cost base of each New Division Share immediately after the reorganisation shall be a proportion- ate share of the aggregate cost of the four Ordinary Division Shares from which it has been subdivided and reclassified. For this purpose the cost base of each New Division Share shall be apportioned on the basis of the relative market values of each class of New Division Shares on the day they are first traded on the New Zealand Stock Exchange. The method used to establish the market value of each class of New Division Share on the first day of trading must be consistently applied to all New Division Shares. D. Available Subscribed Capital (i) The aggregate available subscribed capital (“ASC”), as defined in section OB 1, of the company is unaltered by the reorganisation. (ii)Immediately following the reorganisation, the ASC of each class of New Division Share will be: • In the case of the Fletcher Challenge Paper Shares, one half of the ASC of the Ordinary Division Shares, immediately prior to the reorganisation: • In the case of the Fletcher Challenge Energy Shares, one quarter of the ASC of the Ordinary Division Shares, immediately prior to the reorganisation: • In the case of the Fletcher Challenge Building Shares, one quarter of the ASC of the Ordinary Division Shares, immediately prior to the reorganisation. E. Transitional Capital Amount The reorganisation does not involve any cancellation of shares for the purposes of subparagraph (i)(A) of item “j” of the definition of “transitional capital amount” in section OB 1. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies for the period 28 February 1996 to 28 February 2001. Signed Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Farmers Mutual Group - formation of holding company Product ruling - BR Prd 96/5 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section 63 and the definitions of “gift” and “disposition of property” in section 2(2), of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The proposed arrangement is: 1. The Farmers Mutual Group consists of the Farmers Mutual Insurance Asso- ciation (referred to in this ruling as the “Association”) and its subsidiaries and other investments. The Association is a mutual insurance association which operates under the Mutual Insurance Act 1955. The Association has members, being its customers, although it has not issued shares. 2. The current members of the Association are intending to bring the Associa- tion under the Companies Act 1993. They propose to do this by way of a Private Act of Parliament to be called the Farmers Mutual Group Act 1995 (referred to in this ruling as the “Private Act”). A member is any person who, immediately prior to the “appointed day” (as defined in section 2 of the Private Act), is a “member” (as defined in section 2 of the Private Act) of the Association. Under the Private Act: • A holding company will be incorporated under the Companies Act 1993. This holding company will be called Farmers Mutual Group Limited (referred to in this ruling as the “Holding Company”). The Holding Com- pany will have capital which will be represented by shares held by its foundation shareholders (see 4. below). The Holding Company will be incorporated in New Zealand. • The character of the Association will be changed on the appointed day from that of a mutual company operating under the Mutual Insurance Act 1955 to a limited liability company established under the Companies Act 1993 called Farmers’ Mutual Insurance Limited (referred to in this ruling as the “General Insurance Company”). The General Insurance Company is incorporated in New Zealand. • The General Insurance Company will have capital which will be repre- sented by shares deemed to be issued to the Holding company. The Gen- eral Insurance Company will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Holding Company. 3. The members will cease to have a direct ownership interest in the Association and, instead, will hold shares in the Holding Company. 4. The foundation shareholders of the Holding Company, which in turn will own the General Insurance Company, will consist of two groups: • The current members of the Association; and • A shareholding trust which will be called Farmers Mutual Group Trust (referred to in this ruling as the “Shareholding Trust”). The Shareholding Trust will be established for the benefit of the rural communities in which members of the Association live. The Shareholding Trust will be estab- lished by the directors of the Association as settlors to hold shares in the 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Holding Company. The Shareholding Trust is not a charitable trust for the purposes of section 73(1) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. 5. There are approximately 40,000 existing members of the Association. It is proposed that each member will have 100 shares in the Holding Company as an acknowledgment of their existing ownership interest in the Association. The deemed issue price will be $1.00 per share. The balance of the shares in the Holding Company will be held by the Shareholding Trust. The deemed issue price for these shares will also be $1.00 per share. 6. It is proposed that the Holding Company will be established with initial capital of $20 million. 7. The shareholding in the Holding Company therefore will be: • Approximately 4,000,000 $1.00 shares held by existing members of the Association; and • Approximately 16,000,000 $1.00 shares held by the Shareholding Trust. 8. The steps to give effect to the reorganisation are provided for in the Private Act. Section 9 provides that on the appointed day the Association will be reconstituted to become the General Insurance Company. Section 10 (a) and (b) deems the General Insurance Company to have subscribed capital of $20 million to be represented by ordinary voting shares that shall be deemed to have been issued to the Holding Company. 9. Section 11 of the Private Act deals with the establishment of the Holding Company. On incorporation, the subscribed capital of the Holding Company will be $20 million represented by $1.00 shares to be held by the members of the Association and the Shareholding Trust in the proportions specified in section 11. Sections 10 and 11 will operate simultaneously, on the appointed day referred to in these sections. 10.The reorganisation contemplated by sections 10 and 11 of the Private Act is subject to certain preliminary requirements, as provided for in section 7 of the Private Act. In particular, the Association is required to advise members of the proposed reorganisation and to invite members to call for a meeting to vote on the proposed reorganisation. If more than 10% of the members re- quest a meeting, then the Association is required to convene a meeting of members to have a vote on the proposal. Accordingly, the members can be seen to be either acquiescing to the proposal, if less than 10% of the members call for a meeting, or approving the proposal by way of a vote, if a meeting is held. 11.Section 10 (g) of the Private Act also provides that, as part of the reorganisa- tion, the Association’s shares in each of its subsidiaries shall vest in the Hold- ing Company, so that the subsidiaries may become direct subsidiaries of the Holding Company. Section 10 (h) provides that the vesting shall be deemed to be for a consideration equal to the cost of the shares as recorded in the books of account of the Association immediately before the appointed day. Accordingly, it is conceivable that the shares will be transferred for an amount which is less than their true value. 12.Section 15 of the Private Act provides that the name of the company Farmers Mutual Insurance Limited (being a subsidiary of the Association) will be changed on the appointed day to Former FMI Ltd. Section 15 also provides that all of the engagements, assets and liabilities (other than the residual life insurance engagements, assets and liabilities) of Former FMI Ltd will be deemed to have vested in the General Insurance Company (subsection (3)). Section 15(5) provides that except for the purposes of the Income Tax Act continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) 1994, the consideration for the vesting shall be equal to the net book value of the engagements, assets and liabilities. It is assumed that the net book value of the engagements, assets and liabilities of Former FMI Ltd is less than their current market value. Therefore, Former FMI Ltd will be vesting these en- gagements, assets and liabilities at an undervalue to its parent company: the General Insurance Company. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumptions that: • The proposed demutualisation proceeds in a manner that is not materially different to that described above. • The demutualisation proposal document(s) which the members receive and will either acquiesce, or agree to, does not in itself release, discharge, surren- der, forfeit, or abandon the members’ voting rights in the Association. • The members of the Association are not involved in arranging or effecting the proposed demutualisation other than by acquiesing to or voting on the pro- posal (this depending on whether 10% or more of the members request a meeting). The ruling The extinguishment of a member’s voting rights and other ownership or propri- etary rights in the Association, as a consequence of the passing of the Private Act and the Association becoming a limited liability company under the Companies Act 1993, will not be a “disposition of property” under section 2(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. Therefore the extinguishment is not a “gift” under section 2(2) of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 and cannot be a dutiable gift by the member to any person under section 63 of the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968. The period for which the ruling applies This ruling applies for the period 7 March 1996 to the end of the income year in which the “appointed day” occurs or to 7 March 1999 (whichever occurs first). Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of product ruling BR Prd 96/5 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Estate and Gift Duties Act 1968 unless otherwise stated. Background The Commissioner has been asked to rule on an issue relating to the proposed demutualisation of Farmers Mutual. In essence, the issue concerns whether the members of Farmers Mutual, by agreeing or acquiescing to the demutualisation proposal, are making a gift which is liable for gift duty. The directors of Farmers Mutual are proposing, and will advise members of, the demutualisation. The demutualisation will proceed without any action by the members, unless 10% of the members request a meet- ing, in which case the members will be asked to approve the demutualisation proposal by way of vote. Nature of members’ interest in Farmers Mutual The members of Farmers Mutual have two proprietary rights. These rights are conferred by statute under the Mutual Insurance Act 1955. The first is a right to vote. Section 29 provides that every member present at the annual general meeting shall have one vote. The second from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) is a contingent right to share in the reserves if Farmers Mutual were liquidated. A recent amendment to the Mutual Insurance Act recognises the existence of reserves. Section 43 of the Mutual Insurance Act provides that Part VI of the Companies Act 1993 shall apply in the event of a liquidation with such modifica- tions as may be necessary to the Association as if it were a company formed and registered under the Companies Act. Section 313 of the Companies Act governs the distribution of the surplus assets of a company in liquidation. These proprietary rights: • Are not represented by a separate chose in action, such as a share; and • Are embedded in the insurance policies which the members hold; and • Cannot be separately traded by the members. The proprietary rights are dependent on certain condi- tions, such as the member continuing to maintain an insurance contract with the association. If the conditions are not satisfied the rights cease to apply. Under the demutualisation procedure, the members’ proprietary rights will cease as the Mutual Insurance Act 1955 will be repealed. Legislation Section 63(1) states: Subject to this Act, a dutiable gift shall include and consist of - (a) All the property, wherever situated, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled in New Zealand at the date of the gift, or is a body corporate incorporated in New Zealand: (b) All the property, situated in New Zealand, comprised in any gift made by any donor to any donee, where the donor is domiciled out of New Zealand at the date of the gift, or is a body corporate incorporated out of New Zealand. “Gift” is defined in section 2(2): “Gift” means any disposition of property, wherever and howsoever made, otherwise than by will, without fully adequate consideration in money or money’s worth passing to the person making the disposition: Provided that where the consideration in money or money’s worth is inadequate, the disposition shall be deemed to be a gift to the extent of that inadequacy only: “Disposition of property” is defined in section 2(2) as: “Disposition of property” means any conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property, whether at law or in equity; and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this definition, includes - (a) The issue of shares in a company: (b) The creation of a trust: (c) The grant or creation of any lease, mortgage, charge, servitude, licence, power, or other right, estate, or interest in or over any property: (d) The release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture, or abandon- ment of any debt, contract, or thing in action, or of any right, power, estate, or interest in or over any property; and for this purpose a debt, or any other right, estate, or interest, shall be deemed to have been released or surrendered when it has become irrecoverable or unen- forceable by action through the lapse of time: (e) The exercise of a general power of appointment in favour of any person other than the holder of the power: (f) Any transaction or series of related or connected transac- tions entered into by any person with intent thereby to diminish, directly or indirectly, the value of his own estate and to increase the value of the estate of any other person; and for this purpose the passing by a company of a resolution which, by the extinguishment or alteration of the rights attaching to any shares or debentures of the company, results, directly or indirectly, in the estate of any shareholder or debenture holder of the company being increased in value at the expense of the estate of any other shareholder or debenture holder shall be deemed to be a transaction entered into by that other shareholder or debenture holder if he could have prevented the passing of the resolution by voting against it or otherwise;- but does not include a disclaimer of an interest under a disposition made inter vivos or by will or of an interest under an intestacy: Discussion The definition of “gift” in section 2(2) requires that there be a disposition of property. The opening words of the definition of “disposition of property” in section 2(2) refer to any “conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery, payment, or other alienation of property”. Clearly in this case there is no conveyance, transfer, assignment, settlement, delivery or payment of the proprietary rights held by the members. Nor is there any alienation of these rights. Alienation implies a change of ownership or a passing of property. In this case, the ownership of the propri- etary rights of the members does not change or pass: rather, they cease to exist. Notwithstanding this, the definition of “disposition of property” also includes a number of specific actions in paragraphs (a) to (f). The members clearly do not undertake any of the actions in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), or (e). Paragraphs (d) and (f) are considered below. Paragraph (d) The first limb of paragraph (d) includes as a disposition of property “the release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture, or abandonment of any debt, contract, or thing in action, or of any right, power, estate, or interest in or over any property;...” The members will either acquiesce to the proposal (where the members do not request a meeting) or will request a meeting and vote for the proposal. However, neither the acquiescence nor the voting will in itself constitute a release, discharge, surrender, forfeiture or abandonment of the voting rights. The proprietary continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Cooke J in the Supreme Court decision in Carmody v CIR (1974) 1 NZTC 61,219, 61224 has also stated that: in the ordinary and natural use of language a shareholder does not enter into a transaction by merely casting a vote. If less than 10% of the members of Farmers Mutual call for a meeting, then no meeting will be held and the demutualisation will proceed. In this case, the members are not entering into a transaction (or series of transac- tions). Rather, they are merely accepting (knowingly or otherwise) the demutualisation proposed by the direc- tors. If 10% or more of the members call for a meeting, then a meeting will be held and members will vote on the demutualisation. However, even in this case Grimwade and Carmody support the view that the members are not entering into a transaction or series of transactions by voting for the proposal. Notwithstanding this, it is noted that in some circum- stances, a vote accompanied by other actions may mean that a transaction is entered into. This was the case in Robertson v CIR \[1959\] NZLR 492 where a director of and shareholder in a company initiated a series of events or actions (which included, but was not limited to, voting to increase the capital of a private company) designed to decrease the value of the estate of the shareholders and increase the value of another person’s estate. In these circumstances, McCarthy J in the Supreme Court held that the role played by the share- holder/director in arranging and executing the entire plan meant the shareholder/director had entered into a transaction. Robertson can be contrasted with the Farmers Mutual demutualisation proposal where the proposal has been initiated by the directors (and not its members) and the members have no involvement in the demutualisation other than by merely voting for the proposal, and then only in the possible event of 10% of members calling for a meeting. Accordingly, the members are not entering into a transaction (or series of transactions) by either acquiesc- ing to or voting on the proposal. Therefore, there is no disposition of property within the first limb of para- graph (f). The second limb of paragraph (f) applies to the passing of a resolution by a company which, by the extinguish- ment or alteration of the rights attaching to any shares or debentures of the company, results, directly or indirectly, in the estate of any shareholder or debentureholder of the company being increased in value at the expense of the estate of any other share- holder or debentureholder. Because the Association does not have share capital and has not issued shares, the members are not shareholders and the rights held by the members are not rights attaching to shares. It follows that the second limb of paragraph (f) will also not apply. rights of the members will continue after the members have acquiesced to or voted on the proposal. The rights of the members will cease to exist as a consequence of Farmers Mutual ceasing to be subject to the Mutual Insurance Act. This will happen by the passing of the proposed Farmers Mutual Group Act. It is only by force of that Act of Parliament that the members’ rights will be extinguished. Therefore the members will not release, discharge, etc., their rights: the rights will be extinguished by an Act of Parliament which repeals the Mutual Insurance Act. Paragraph (f) The first limb of paragraph (f) includes within the definition of “disposition of property” any transaction or series of related or connected transactions entered into by a person with the specified intent. As already mentioned, the members will either acqui- esce to the proposal or approve the proposal by way of vote (depending on whether 10% of members request a meeting to vote on the proposal). In neither case can it be said that the members are entering into a transaction (or series of related or connected transactions). Even if the members take some “positive” action by 10% of the members requesting a meeting to vote on the proposal, case law indicates that the mere act of voting for the proposal will not amount to “entering into a transaction”. In Grimwade v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1949) 78 CLR 199 it was contended that Grimwade, by voting or failing to vote for resolutions to reduce the share capital of a company, had entered into a transac- tion with the intent to diminish the value of his own property and increase the value of the property of other persons. Latham CJ and Webb J in the High Court of Australia stated on page 219-220: There may be a “transaction” with respect to the casting of a vote. It may be an illegal transaction, as when an elector takes a bribe in return for his vote at a parliamentary election. It may be a legal transaction, as when a shareholder ... agrees to vote in particular way for a consideration, e.g. if other shareholders will exercise their votes in a particular way. ... The commissioner did not allege that there was any agreement between E. N. Grimwade and his sons as to voting for the resolutions. But when a shareholder makes up his mind to vote in a particular way and casts his vote accordingly he cannot be said to be “entering into a transaction”. A transac- tion by a person must be a transaction with some other person. In the circumstances mentioned there is no transaction with any person. ... It was suggested that even to abstain from voting against a resolution beneficial to a class of shareholders amounted to entering a transaction within par. (f). All these contentions interpret the words “enter into a transaction” as if they had the same meaning as “do an act or abstain from doing an act.” Such an interpretation gives no real effect to the words “enter” and transaction.” from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Wrightson Limited’s co-branded charge card Product ruling - BR Prd 96/7 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section BB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies Wrightson Limited is shortly to introduce a co-branded charge card (the Card) to the market. This card will be co-branded with American Express Inc. The Card will have a loyalty programme attached to it to encourage cardholders to use the Card at certain outlets. The cardholder will accumulate loyalty points in two ways: 1. Points per dollar spent on the Card; and 2. Bonus points for shopping at particular retailers. Points are able to be accumulated and carried forward, but may expire after a certain period of time. Once certain levels of points are attained the cardholder can claim a reward under the scheme. It is expected that cardholders will be entitled to rewards irregularly. The rewards will be prizes from a catalogue. Wrightson will not give cardholders cash in lieu of prizes. However, the prizes may be of a type not convertible to money (that is, non-transferable and non- assignable) while some will be of a type convertible to money (that is, transfer- able and assignable). Other facts are set out in the application and annexure dated 23 January 1996. Assumptions The ruling is based on the assumptions that all cardholders are New Zealand resident individuals, and that the arrangement will be implemented in the manner set out in the application. It is also assumed that the individual reward levels will not be easy to achieve and the timing between redemptions under the programme will be long-term periods, if they are repeated at all. The ruling No income arises under section BB 4 for Wrightson cardholders when they accumulate or redeem points for rewards under the Wrightson Card Loyalty Programme. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies for the period from 4 April 1996 to 31 March 1999. Signed Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) The analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Background A ruling has been sought on whether prizes received by cardholders of the Card are assessable income to the cardholders. Legislation Section BB 4 states: Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, the assessable income of any person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to include, save so far as express provision is made in this Act to the contrary,- (a) All profits or gains derived from any business (including any increase in the value of stock in hand at the time of the transfer or sale of the business, or on the reconstruc- tion of a company): ... (d) Income derived from any other source. Loyalty programme Non-business expenditure giving rise to points The receipt of prizes from points earned by using the Card for non-business expenditure will not be income under section BB 4 (d). The leading case on the pred- ecessor to section BB 4 (d) (section 65(2)(l)) is Reid v CIR (1985) 7 NZTC 5,176 (CA). That decision creates three tests for “income”: • It must be something that “comes in”; and • It must be periodic, recurrent, and regular; and • It must be tested in the hands of the recipient. The second and third tests are discussed in Reid by Richardson J, at page 5,183: The major determinant \[of income\] in many cases is the periodic nature of a payment...If it has that quality of regular- ity or recurrence then the payments become part of the receipts upon which the recipient may depend for his living expenses, just as in the case of a salary or wage earner, annuitant or welfare beneficiary. But that in itself is not enough and consideration must be given to the relationship between payer and payee and to the purpose of the payment, in order to determine the quality of the payment in the hands of the payee. The sums in question were regular periodical payments made to the appellant to defray his expenses while attending teachers’ college full time as a teacher trainee. Applying the second test, it is unlikely that the rewards under the programme will be regular. The third test focuses on the quality of the receipt of a prize in the hands of the cardholder. Unlike Reid, where the bursary was used to defray the taxpayer’s personal expenses and was paid in respect of his training at the teachers college, a prize from use of the card is a bonus to the cardholder, and is not relied on for living ex- penses. Business expenditure giving rise to points The receipt of prizes from points earned by using the Card for business expenditure will not be income under section BB 4 (a), assuming the receipt of the prizes is irregular. As irregular receipts, as discussed above, the prizes do not have the appearance of income sufficient to trigger section BB 4 (a). However, if business use of the card gave rise to the regular receipt of prizes there would be a strong argument for finding that those prizes were income in the normal course of the business and subject to income tax under section BB 4 (a). Inconvertibility Inconvertibility is a further reason why receipt of prizes will not be assessable income of the cardholder. The inconvertibility principle requires that to be income the receipt must be money or money’s worth. If the receipt is not convertible to money it cannot be income. Thus benefits that are non-transferable and non- assignable cannot be income. An example is air tickets that are given to a person on condition that they are used personally, and if they are not so used the person cannot receive money or money’s worth in replacement, and cannot assign the benefit to a third party. The New Zealand case of Stagg v IRC \[1959\] NZLR 1252 is an example of the inconvertibility principle. In that case non-transferable and non-assignable air tickets for the taxpayer and his wife were not income. In the Australian decision of FCT v Cooke & Sherden 80 ATC 4140, free travel and accommodation provided to franchisees for meeting sales quotas were not assessable income as they could not be assigned or converted into cash. Therefore, independently of the above reasons, no income arises under section BB 4 for Wrightson cardholders under the Wrightson Card Loyalty Pro- gramme when they accumulate, or redeem points for rewards, and the prizes gained are inconvertible to money. This is so even if the prizes are received regu- larly as a result of points gained from business ex- penses. That is, inconvertibility will make income that may be assessable under section BB 4 (a), non-assess- able: see Cooke & Sherden at page 4,149.

This section came into force on 1 April 1995, replacing the previous section 245W of the Income Tax Act 1976. Under section 61(1) of the TAA, a person who has a control or income interest in a foreign company or an interest in a foreign investment fund (FIF) at any time during the income year must disclose the interest held. However, section 61(2) allows the Commissioner of Inland Revenue to exempt any person or class of persons from this requirement if disclosure is not necessary for the administration of the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1) contained in the Income Tax Act 1994 (ITA). Under section 61(2), the Commissioner has issued an international tax disclosure exemption which applies for the income year ended 31 March 1996. This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemp- tion ITR7”, and the full text appears at the end of this item. Scope of exemption The scope of the 1996 disclosure exemption is the same as the 1995 exemption. Disclosure is required for these interests: • an interest held in a FIF • an “income interest of 10% or greater” held in a foreign company. The disclosure obligation applies to all foreign companies regardless of the country of residence. An “income interest of 10% or greater” is defined in section OB 1 of the ITA. For the purposes of determin- ing exemption from disclosure it includes these inter- ests: 1. an income interest held directly in a foreign com- pany 2. an income interest held indirectly through any interposed foreign company 3. an income interest held by an associated person (which is not a controlled foreign company) as defined by section OD 8 (3) of the ITA. Example If a husband and wife each hold an income interest of 5% in a Cayman Islands company, the interests would not be exempt from disclosure because the husband and wife are associated persons under section OD 8 (3)(d). Under the associated persons test they are each deemed to hold the other’s interests, so they each hold an “income interest of 10% or greater” which must be disclosed. They are not required to account for attributed foreign income or loss under the controlled foreign company rules. However, they would have to account for FIF income or loss under the FIF rules. In this example the husband and wife must disclose their interests as interests in a foreign company and as interests in a FIF. However, only the FIF inter- ests should be disclosed on an IR 4H series form (see “Overlap of interests” on page 21). Foreign company interests A person who holds a control or income interest in a foreign company must disclose that interest, regardless of the company’s country of residence. The 1996 international tax disclosure exemption also makes no distinction about residence, and any interest in a foreign company which is an “income interest of 10% or greater” must be disclosed. Disclosure is to be made on form IR 4G “Interest in a Foreign Company Disclosure Schedule”. The disclosure exemption makes no distinction on the residence of a foreign company for these reasons: • attributed (non-dividend) repatriation rules apply to an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a controlled foreign company (CFC) regardless of the CFC’s country of residence. • to identify tax preferences applied by the taxpayer (whether or not specified in Schedule 3, Part B of the ITA) in respect of an interest held in a foreign company which is resident in a Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA jurisdiction (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and the United States of America). • the requirement for a CFC which is resident in a country not listed in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA to attribute foreign income or loss from 1 April 1993. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Foreign investment fund interests An interest in a foreign entity must be disclosed if it constitutes an “interest in a foreign investment fund” specified within section CG 15 (1) of the ITA. These types of interest must be disclosed: • rights in a foreign company or anything deemed to be a company for the purposes of the ITA (e.g., a unit trust) • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign superannua- tion scheme • an entitlement to benefit from a foreign life insurance policy • an interest in an entity specified in Schedule 4, Part A of the ITA (no entities were listed when this TIB went to press). However, any interest that does not fall within the above types or which is specifically excluded as an interest in a FIF under section CG 15 (2) does not have to be disclosed. The following are listed in section CG 15 (2) as exemptions from what constitutes an interest in a FIF: • an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a CFC • an interest in a foreign company that is resident and liable to income tax in a country or territory specified in Schedule 3, Part A of the ITA (i.e., Australia, Canada, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, United Kingdom and the United States of America). • an interest in an employment-related foreign superan- nuation scheme • interests in foreign entities held by a natural person, if the aggregate cost or expenditure incurred in acquir- ing the interests remains under $20,000 at all times during the income year • an interest held by a natural person in a foreign entity located in a country where exchange controls prevent the person deriving any profit or gain or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or considera- tion readily convertible to New Zealand currency • an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme acquired by a natural person before he or she became a New Zealand resident for the first time, for a period of up to four years. There is more information on exemptions from the FIF rules in Inland Revenue’s “Foreign Investment Funds” booklet (IR 275B). A person who holds an interest in a FIF at any time during the 1996 income year must disclose the interest and calculate FIF income or loss on the form “Interest in Foreign Investment Fund Disclosure Schedule and Worksheet” (IR 4H). The FIF rules allow a person four options to calculate FIF income or loss (accounting profits method, branch equivalent method, comparative value method and deemed rate of return method), so the Commissioner has prescribed four forms under the IR 4H series to disclose and calculate FIF income or loss from an interest in a FIF using one of the methods. Overlap of interests A situation may arise where a person is required to furnish a disclosure for an interest in a foreign company which is also an interest in a FIF. For example, a person with an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company which is not a CFC is strictly required to disclose both an interest held in a foreign company and an interest held in a FIF. However, to meet the disclosure obligations only one disclosure return (either form IR 4G or the appropriate IR 4H series form) is required for each interest a person holds in a foreign entity. Here are the general rules for determining which disclosure return to file: 1. Use the appropriate IR 4H series form to disclose all FIF interests, and in particular: •an interest in a foreign company which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country and is not a CFC (regardless of the level of interest held) •an income interest of less than 10% in a CFC which is not resident in a Schedule 3, Part A country •an interest in a foreign life insurance policy or foreign superannuation scheme, regardless of the country or territory in which the entity was resident. 2. Use the IR 4G form to disclose: •an “income interest of 10% or greater” in a foreign company (regardless of the country of residence) that is not being disclosed on the appropriate IR 4H series form. Disclosure is not required on either forms IR 4G or IR 4H for an income interest of less than 10% in a foreign company (whether a CFC or not) which is also not a FIF interest. An example is an interest which is excluded under the Schedule 3, Part A exemption of the FIF rules. Summary The 1996 international tax disclosure exemption removes the requirement to disclose an interest held in a foreign company (if the interest is not also an interest in a FIF) that does not constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater” (i.e., it is less than 10%). The disclo- sure exemption is not affected by the foreign company’s country of residence. Further, an interest in a FIF must be disclosed. Text of determination appears on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Persons not required to comply with section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 This exemption may be cited as “International Tax Disclosure Exemption ITR7” 1. Reference This exemption is made pursuant to section 61(2) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. It details interests in foreign companies in relation to which any person is not required to comply with the requirement in section 61 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 to make disclosure of their interests, for the income year ending 31 March 1995. This exemption does not apply to interests in foreign companies which are interests in foreign investment funds. 2. Interpretation In this exemption, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions used have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 or the international tax rules (as defined by section OZ 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994). 3. Exemption Any person who has an income interest or a control interest in a foreign company (not being an interest in a foreign investment fund), in the income year ending 31 March 1996, shall not be required to comply with section 61(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 in respect of that income interest or control interest in that foreign company and that income year, except where: • the interest held by that person during any accounting period of the foreign company (the last day of which falls within that income year of the person), would constitute an “income interest of 10% or greater”, as defined by section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, as if the foreign company was a controlled foreign company. This exemption is made by me acting under delegated authority from the Commissioner of Inland Revenue pursuant to section 7 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This exemption is signed on the 11th day of April 1996. Max Carr National Manager, Corporates Lawnmowers - draft depreciation determination Introduction Currently there are three general depreciation rates for various types of mowers as follows: • Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture: “Mowers (gang and PTO type)” 12.5 years, 15% DV, 10% SL. • Contractors, Builders and Quarrying: “Mowers (domestic type)” 5 years, 33% DV, 24% SL. • Residential Rental Property Chattels: “Lawn mowers” 4 years, 40% DV, 30% SL. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will set two new depreciation rates. These two new depreciation rates will both be added to the Agriculture, Horticulture & Aquaculture industry category and the Contractors, Builders and Quarrying category. The draft determination is repro- duced below. It will set a new depreciation rate of 63.5% diminishing value (“DV”) for domestic type lawnmowers used by lawnmowing contractors. In addition it will set a depreciation rate of 33% DV for non-domestic type lawnmowers used by lawnmowing contractors. The depreciation rate for gang and PTO (“power take off”) type mowers and the depreciation rate for lawnmowers used at residential rental properties, of 15% DV and 40% DV respectively, will remain un- changed. The proposed new depreciation rate for “Lawnmowers (domestic type in use by lawnmowing contractors)” of 63.5% DV is based on an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of two years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. Two years reflects the EUL for a domestic type of lawnmower used commercially by a lawnmowing contractor.

Interpretation In this determination, unless the context otherwise requires, expressions have the same meaning as in the Income Tax Act 1994. If you wish to make a submission on these proposed changes please write to: Assistant General Manager Adjudication and Rulings National Office Inland Revenue Department PO Box 2198 WELLINGTON We need to receive your submission by 15 May 1996 if we are to take it into account in finalising this determination. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Prizes paid in instalments - assessability to recipient Sections BB 4 and CE 1 (1)(a) (sections 65(2)(l) and (j), Income Tax Act 1976) - Items included in assessable income and annuities: A taxpayer has entered a competition which offers, as the grand prize, the option of $18,000 a year for life (paid as $1,500 a month) or a $200,000 lump sum payable immediately. If the winner elects to receive $18,000 annually, the competition organiser will pur- chase, for a once only premium, an annuity policy from an insurance company to pay the $1,500 per month to the winner for life. The taxpayer asks what the tax consequences are for each prize option. The competition does not relate to the taxpayer’s employment or business activities. Section CE 1 (1)(a) includes all annuities as assessable income. A prize is assess- able income when it is paid as an annuity (i.e. a yearly sum payable for a stipu- lated number of years or by reference to some other period such as the life of the annuitant). The prize option of $18,000 a year for life is paid as an annuity, so it is assessable income under section CE 1 (1)(a). The prize option of a lump sum of $200,000 is not a periodic, recurrent, and regular payment and is not paid in return for the taxpayer providing services or other benefits to the competition organiser. The lump sum prize option is not income according to ordinary concepts and so is not assessable as “income from any other source” under section BB 4 (d). If the lump sum of $200,000 is paid in instalments (but not under an annuity policy), these are instalments of the capital sum and are not assessable income. Travel costs incurred by person who is both employed and self-employed Section BB 7 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure or loss incurred in production of assessable income: A taxpayer lives in Napier and works there for wages 4 days a week. On the fifth day she flies to Wellington where she works as a self-employed consultant. The taxpayer has asked if she can deduct the cost of the air fares between Napier and Wellington against her self-em- ployed income. Under section BB 7, a taxpayer is able to claim a deduction against total income for any expenditure or loss, in the income year in which that expense or loss is incurred, to the extent that it is: • Incurred in gaining or producing assessable income for any income year; or • Necessarily incurred in carrying on a business so as to gain or produce as- sessable income in any income year. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) However, under section BB 8 (b) (section 106(1)(j), Income Tax Act 1976) a sec- tion BB 7 deduction is not available for any expenditure or loss to the extent to which it is of a private or domestic nature. Generally, any expenses incurred in getting to work and back home are classed as private. Section BB 8 (a) (section 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976) precludes a deduction for capital expenditure. Expenditure that puts a person into a position to earn income is classed as capital expenditure. It is necessary, therefore, for the expenditure to be incurred in the production of assessable income (or in the course of a business directed to that end) and not be of a private, domestic, or capital nature. The taxpayer will need to have records that show: • The linkage between the incurring of the expenditure and the derivation of the income (or the conducting of a business to that end); and • The fact that the costs are neither incurred to put her into a position to earn income, nor of a private nature, but rather an incident of her income earning process. If the taxpayer is to claim a deduction for the flights to and from Wellington, she must be able to demonstrate to the Commissioner’s satisfaction that her home base is also being used as an essential work base integral to her business of providing consultancy services, rather than merely a convenient place from which to do work on some occasions. If she can show that her home is an essen- tial work base, she may claim the air fares, and also be able to claim deductions under section BB 7 for a proportion of home expenses that can be shown to be incurred in running her consultancy business. She will need to keep records that show the basis for any claim. Charities whose objects are not limited to New Zealand Section CB 4 (section 61, Income Tax Act 1976) - Non-profit bodies’ and chari- ties’ exempt income: A representative of a business charity that has Inland Revenue’s charitable status approval, has asked if the charitable business’s profits are exempt from income tax. She has pointed out that the charity’s objects are not confined to New Zealand. Under section CB 4 (1)(c), income derived by trustees in a charitable trust, soci- ety, or institution, established exclusively for charitable purposes is exempt from tax, except when that income is income to which paragraph (e) applies. Section CB 4 (1)(e), exempts from tax: Income derived directly or indirectly from any business carried on by or on behalf of or for the benefit of trustees in trust for charitable purposes within New Zealand... Provided that if those purposes are not limited to New Zealand the Commissioner may apportion the income in such manner as the Commissioner deems just and reasonable between those purposes within New Zealand and the like purposes out of New Zealand, and may allow to the trustees, society, or institution a partial exemption accordingly... To enable the Commissioner to apportion the income, the charity must file an income tax return in the prescribed form, including the annual accounts. Based on this information, the Commissioner will determine whether or not a partial exemption will apply and the appropriate apportionment method to be used for the year in question. In this case, the charity qualified for only a partial exemption for the year in question. This decision was based on information that the charity had supplied to Inland Revenue with its annual tax return. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Health services provided by employer - FBT liability Section CI 1 (section 336N(1), Income Tax Act 1976) - Meaning of “fringe benefit”: In an effort to improve the employment conditions of its staff, a large company plans to provide personnel with: • a subsidised medical care scheme • the services of an industrial chaplain • the services of a nurse able to give regular health checks. The chaplaincy services and medical checks will be provided on the employer’s premises. A company representative has asked if the company will be liable for fringe benefit tax on these benefits. Section ND 1 (section 336S(2), Income Tax Act 1976) imposes tax on fringe ben- efits. The term “fringe benefit” describes benefits or advantages other than monetary remuneration passing from employer to employee and arising out of the employment relationship. A benefit will not be brought within the fringe benefit tax rules unless it is a benefit that is received in relation to, in the course of, or by virtue of the employment of an employee, and is provided or granted by the employer of the employee. Section CI 1 provides the definitions of what does and does not constitute a fringe benefit. Paragraphs (e), (f), and (h) of the section include within the defini- tion any contribution made by an employer on behalf of an employee that con- sists of: • any contribution to an approved sick, accident, or death benefit fund • any specified insurance premium or any contribution to any insurance fund of a Friendly Society • any contribution to any superannuation scheme. Specifically excluded from the definition of fringe benefit tax under section CI 1 (q) is a benefit provided on the employer’s premises, unless it is a benefit con- sisting of the use or enjoyment of free, discounted, or subsidised travel, accom- modation, or clothing. In this case, the subsidised medical care payments are liable to fringe benefit tax at the rate of 49 cents in the dollar. The value of the services of the industrial chaplain and the nurse is not subject to fringe benefit tax. Whether a taxpayer’s death constitutes “permanent departure from New Zealand” Section JB 3 (2) (section 336D(2), Income Tax Act 1976) - Determination of other income: A tax practitioner’s New Zealand superannuitant client has re- cently died. The practitioner is in the process of calculating the deceased’s “other income” for New Zealand superannuation purposes. She has asked if she should calculate the “other income” using the section JB 3 (2) formula, on the grounds that the taxpayer’s death constitutes a “permanent departure from New Zealand during the income year”. New Zealand superannuitant surcharge is calculated with reference to the super- annuitant’s “other income”. The surcharge is imposed when a superannuitant’s income, other than New Zealand superannuation, exceeds a stated exemption. Section JB 3 (2) provides a formula for calculating the “other income” of a super- annuitant who receives New Zealand superannuation for only part of the in- come year because of: 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) (a) The superannuitant’s New Zealand superannuation commencing, for the first time, after the beginning of the income year; or (b) The superannuitant’s permanent departure from New Zealand during the income year. In the context of section JB 3 (2), “Permanent departure from New Zealand” does not include death. This is because when a superannuitant dies, a tax return is filed for the period up to the date of death. New Zealand superannuation is received for the whole of the taxpayer’s income year, up to the date of death. Any income derived after the date of death is not the superannuitant’s income, and is therefore not subject to surcharge. We advised the tax practitioner that in this case she should use the section JB 3 (1) formula for calculating the deceased’s “other income”. Refund from applying FITC credit to earlier income years Section LE 2 - Credits in respect of dividends to non-resident investors: A company paid a dividend and a supplementary dividend to a non-resident shareholder in the 1996-97 income year, thereby giving rise to a foreign investor tax credit (FITC). The company’s forecasts indicate that it will have no income tax liability for the 1996-97 year. A company representative has asked whether a refund can be obtained immediately by applying the FITC credit against the company’s income tax liability for the 1995-96 income year. When a company pays a dividend and a supplementary dividend to a non- resident shareholder, under section LE 2 (4) the resulting FITC credit must be first offset against the company’s current year income tax liability. If the com- pany does not have a sufficient current year income tax liability against which to offset this credit, under section LE 2 (6) the company may elect that the credit be instead offset against the company’s income tax liability in one of the four imme- diately preceding years. Section LE 2 (6) requires that the election by the company to offset the FITC credit against a previous year’s income tax liability must be made with the company’s return of income for the income year in which the dividend and supplementary dividend are paid. Therefore, the company can only apply the FITC credit to its 1995-96 income year once it has filed its 1996-97 income tax return. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Different activities performed by registered person Section 6 - Meaning of the term “taxable activity”: A GST registered person earns her living as an odd job person. Because of work commitments, she has hired a friend as a subcontractor to help her. The friend, who is a GST registered livestock agent, is not employed by the odd job person but will be subcontract- ing for her on a regular basis. He has asked Inland Revenue if he should charge GST for the odd job work which is totally unconnected with his occupation as a livestock agent. GST registration covers all taxable activities undertaken by a registered person. Section 6(1)(a) describes a “taxable activity” as: Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) In this case, the friend is carrying out a taxable activity as a livestock agent. The occasional work he is doing also meets the “taxable activity” definition. Both activities form part of his overall taxable supplies. Different taxable activities are not registered separately. He must charge and account for GST on the payments he receives from the subcontracting work in the normal manner. Commission paid by overseas clients to New Zealand agents Section 11(2)(e) - Zero-rated services: An overseas racehorse owner has asked a New Zealand agent to find her suitable quality horses for purchase. The agent has agreed to act for the buyer, and will export any purchases once they are acquired in return for a commission payment. The agent has asked if GST on the commission can be zero-rated, as the services are provided for and to a non- resident who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Under section 11(2)(e), a supply of services is zero-rated when: The services are supplied for and to a person who is not resident in New Zealand and who is outside New Zealand at the time the services are performed, not being services which are sup- plied directly in connection with- (i) Land or any improvement thereto situated inside New Zealand; or (ii)Moveable personal property (other than choses in action, and other than goods to which paragraph (ca) of this subsection applies) situated inside New Zealand at the time the services are performed;- and not being services which are the acceptance of an obligation to refrain from carrying on any taxable activity, to the extent that the conduct of that activity would have occurred within New Zealand. In general law, the term “moveable personal property” includes horses and other domestic animals. The services provided by the agent are not zero-rated because they are provided in connection with moveable personal property which is in New Zealand at the time the services are performed. Example An Australian trainer asks a GST registered New Zealand agent to find him a suitable colt in New Zealand. The agent finds a colt that the trainer approves of, arranges its purchase, and receives a commission for her services. She must account for and return GST of one-ninth of the commission in her next GST return. However, if the agent had bought the horse herself, on-sold it to the trainer, entered it for export and arranged for that export, she would not be acting as an agent. The sale to the Australian would be a supply of goods able to be zero- rated under section 11(1)(a) or section 11(1)(ac), rather than a supply of services. Taxi licensees and GST registration Section 27(1)(b) - Commissioner may make assessment of tax: A tax practi- tioner who acts for a part-time taxi licensee has read an item on taxi licensees and GST registration on page 13 of Tax Information Bulletin Volume Four, No.10 (May 1993), and is seeking additional information. His client’s turnover is less than $30,000 per year, and she is not registered for GST. However, on the pub- lished schedule of fares displayed in the taxi, as set by the company for which the client works, the prices are clearly stated as including GST. The practitioner continued on page 28 from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) has asked if his client is required to register for GST, even though her turnover is less than that required before registration is compulsory. In this case, the taxi licensee is making supplies for a consideration which in- cludes GST, as evidenced by the schedule of fares published by the company and displayed in the vehicle. Section 27(1) states: ... the Commissioner may from time to time, from returns furnished under this Act and from any other information in the Commissioner’s possession, make assessments of the amount that, in the Commissioner’s judgment, is the tax payable pursuant to the Act by - (a) Any person required to furnish any return under this Act; or (b) Any person, not being a registered person, who supplies goods and services and represents that tax is charged on that supply... By displaying a schedule of fares and levying a charge that includes GST, the licensee is indicating to passengers that the fares she charges include the tax. The licensee is liable to register for GST even though her turnover may not exceed $30,000. If she does not voluntarily register for the tax, under section 27(1)(b) the Commissioner has the authority to deem her to be registered, and to assess her for the GST she has charged. Section 51(2) allows a person 21 days from becoming liable to register to apply to be registered. In this case, the licensee became liable from the time she started her business and began charging GST inclusive fares. If necessary, under section 51(4)(b), the Commissioner may determine the date from which registration will take effect, and deem the licensee to be registered from that date. Child Support Act 1991 Reduction in liable parent’s income Section 40 - Election where taxable income for Child Support purposes is estimated to have fallen at least 15 percent: A liable parent has had his Child Support liability assessed on his income from two years ago. At that time he worked at a second, part-time job. He no longer works at the second job and his current income is considerably less than what it was two years ago. He has asked if he can have his Child Support payments reduced. Under section 40, when a liable parent’s income has fallen by at least 15% from the original amount of income used in the current Child Support formula assess- ment, the parent may elect to have the Child Support income based on the estimated income of the current year. When making an election, the liable parent must provide a written notice of the estimation on the appropriate form (CS 107). This election must be given to the Commissioner before or during the Child Support year; and specify the person’s estimate of his or her taxable income for the income year corresponding to the Child Support year. It must also include other information required on the form. However, an estimation election cannot be made in any of these circumstances: • If an estimation election has already been made within the previous three months, and the new estimation differs by $500 or less from the original. • If an income amount order is in force in relation to the person and to any months in the Child Support year in which the application is to apply. • A person is subject to a variation in his or her Child Support income amount made by either the Commissioner following an Administrative Review, or the Court. from page 27 continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) When a liable parent makes an estimate of current income, that estimate will be compared to his or her actual income at the end of the financial year to deter- mine the correct amount of Child Support payable. If the liable parent has un- derestimated the income, penalties may be incurred. In this case the liable parent’s income had dropped by more than 15% from the original amount used in his Child Support assessment; it was his first estimation so the $500 exclusion clause did not apply, and he was not subject to any order of the Court. Therefore, the liable parent was able to make an election based on his estimated income, resulting in his Child Support liability being reduced. Tax Administration Act 1994 This is the third in a series of questions and answers on the binding rulings process. It includes questions raised at the 1995 Tax Conference of the New Zealand Society of Accountants and other questions and issues referred to us. The earlier series are contained in TIBs Volume 7, Nos. 6 and 7 of December 1995 and January 1996. We will publish further items as they come to hand. The first two items deal with the Commissioner’s ability to give private or prod- uct rulings when questions of fact are involved. The third and fourth questions have a similar theme in that they both provide guidance on the parameters of the Commissioner’s ability to rule on questions of tax status. Share sales - Commissioner cannot rule on a question of fact Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: Three years ago a taxpayer purchased a parcel of shares as a long-term investment. An opportunity has now arisen for him to purchase some land at a popular holiday location at a very reasonable price. To finance this purchase he will need to sell the shares. He has asked for a ruling that any profits he makes on the sale will not be assessable income under the second limb of section BB 4 (c) of the Income Tax Act 1994. This provision deems assessable income to include all profits and gains derived from the sale of any personal property (excluding land) if the property was purchased with the purpose or intention of selling it. Can the Commissioner rule in this situation? Under section 91E(1), the Commissioner is required to rule, on application, on how any taxation law applies to a particular person and to a particular arrange- ment. However, under section 91E(4)(a) he cannot rule if it would require him to determine questions of fact (unless, in line with section 91E(4A), the ruling applies to section FB 2 or GD 13 of the Income Tax Act 1994 which deal with transfer pricing). The Commissioner will not give a ruling in this case. The taxpayer has stated that he purchased the shares for long-term investment - not for the purpose or intention of selling them. Cases such as National Distribu- tors Ltd v CIR (1989) 11 NZTC 6346 make it clear that the test under the Act is one of dominant purpose, and that this is a subjective test of the state of mind of the purchaser. This will always be a question of fact and, therefore, is not a matter that the Commissioner can rule on under section 91E(4)(a). Nor would the Commissioner be willing to give a ruling on assessability that was based upon the factual assumption that the taxpayer’s dominant purpose at the time of acquisition was one of resale. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Subdivided land - ruling not on a question of fact Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: Nine years ago a taxpayer purchased land which she has since subdivided. The subdivision involved cross-lease or unit title, preparation of plans, surveying to confirm boundaries and building lines, and legal costs. The taxpayer proposes to sell this land, and wants a ruling giving confirmation that any profit she makes from the sale will not be assessable income under section CD 1 (2)(f) of the Income Tax Act 1994. The Commissioner can rule on this matter. Section CD 1 (2)(f) taxes profits from developments or subdivisions (not being work of a minor nature) when the undertaking or scheme was commenced within 10 years of acquisition. In this instance we would look at relevant case law and other authorities to determine what constitutes “work of a minor na- ture” and then apply these to the subdivision. In doing so, we are applying the law to the facts and ruling accordingly. We are, therefore, not ruling on a ques- tion of fact. Ruling cannot determine whether a company is a NZ resident Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: The Chief Financial Officer of a United States company that has some New Zealand man- agement has asked for a private ruling on: (a) Whether the company has its centre of management in New Zealand and is, therefore, resident under domestic law. (b)The residence of the company under the United States/New Zealand Double Tax Agreement. Can a private ruling be obtained on these questions? The Commissioner can only make a ruling on how a taxation law applies to a particular “arrangement”. “Arrangement”, as defined in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994, means: any contract, agreement, plan, or understanding (whether enforceable or unenforceable), includ- ing all steps and transactions by which it is carried into effect. When “tax status” is the issue, there is not generally an arrangement, and ac- cordingly, Inland Revenue would not rule on an applicant’s tax status as such. If the “arrangement” was the establishment of the company we could rule on the company’s tax residence, but this would generally only be possible in relation to a specific point in time, i.e., the time of the company’s establishment. The com- pany’s subsequent tax residence would not derive from the “arrangement”, i.e., the establishment of the company. In other cases the applicant could choose to obtain the Commissioner’s view on an “arrangement” that raises the status issue (e.g., the derivation of foreign income). However, the private ruling would only be binding for that transaction. In the above example at (a) the Commissioner would not rule as no apparent “arrangement” exists. The Commissioner would also not rule on (b), both for the reason given in (a) and, because, under section 91 E(4)(d)(ii), the question in- volves an issue dealt with under a double taxation agreement procedure. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Starting a trust, partnership or company does constitute an “arrangement” Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: Three doctors in partnership together are contemplating dissolving the partnership and form- ing a company as their business vehicle. They have applied for a binding ruling on the tax consequences of setting up the company. As the Commissioner can only rule on how any taxation law applies to a particular “arrangement”, the question arises as to whether the establishment of a legal entity constitutes an “arrangement”. Section 91E(1) requires the Commissioner to rule, on application, on how any taxation law applies to a particular “arrangement” (see definition in the previous item). Setting up a company constitutes an “arrangement” as there will obviously be a plan or agreement in existence to establish the entity. Therefore, the Commis- sioner can rule on how the taxation law applies to this arrangement. If the taxpay- ers want a ruling on the deductibility of set-up costs or on whether the taxation avoidance provisions of section BB 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 apply, the Commissioner will rule on those matters as they involve the application of taxation law to that arrangement, i.e., the formation of a company. The tax residence of the company could also be ruled on, but only in relation to a specific point in time, i.e., the time of the company’s establishment. The company’s subsequent tax residence would not derive from the “arrangement”, i.e., the establishment of the company. However, other issues in relation to the company such as assessability of future income, company grouping etc., would need to be the subject of separate appli- cations if binding rulings were required on these matters. Private ruling can be made when arrangement is one of several options Section 91E - Commissioner to make private rulings on request: A consortium wishes to apply for a private binding ruling on a tax aspect of a tourist develop- ment project. The project is one of three options on which feasibility studies are being carried out. There are only enough funds for one of the options to be developed. The consortium has asked whether it can obtain a binding ruling. The Commissioner would need to be satisfied that the option being considered is seriously contemplated in terms of section 91E(4)(b). Assuming that the feasibil- ity study being carried out on the option is a substantial exercise, i.e., involving significant time, effort, and expenditure, the Commissioner will accept that this option is being seriously contemplated. If we are to be asked about more than one option, separate applications would be required for each. Notification and publication of product rulings Section 91FH - content and notification of a product ruling: An insurance company applied to Inland Revenue for a product ruling on a loss of earnings insurance policy it was planning to market to the general public. At the time of its application the company asked Inland Revenue to refrain from publishing the ruling. What is the position in this case? 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Under section 91FH(2), the Commissioner must advise the making of a product ruling by notice in the Gazette. The notice will appear in a Gazette that follows the issuing of the ruling. Section 91FH(3) specifies that the notice must indicate the subject of the product ruling and where a copy of the ruling may be ob- tained. Inland Revenue is, therefore, required to advise the making of a product ruling and to provide a copy to anyone who may want one. However, there may be commercial reasons for a taxpayer not wanting a prod- uct ruling to be published within a certain period of time or even not published at all. Inland Revenue will not publish a product ruling in the Tax Information Bulletin without the permission of the applicant. All product rulings issued will now contain a request that the applicant advises Inland Revenue whether or not the applicant consents to the ruling being published in the Tax Information Bulletin and if so, when. If the applicant does not wish the ruling to be pub- lished, Inland Revenue will not identify the applicant in the Gazette notice. Change of address to which applications for binding rulings are to be sent Sections 91EC and 91FC - applying for binding rulings: Following the reorgani- sation of Inland Revenue, the former Rulings Directorate has now become part of the Adjudication and Rulings business group. Consequently, applications for binding rulings which were previously sent to the Director, Rulings Directorate, should now be sent to: The Assistant General Manager Adjudication and Rulings Inland Revenue National Office PO Box 2198 Wellington Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995 Binding ruling fees - zero-rating for GST A non-resident has forwarded an application for a private binding ruling to Inland Revenue. The applicant’s agent has asked if Inland Revenue can zero-rate the fees payable, under section 11 of the GST Act 1985, thereby reducing them by 1/9th. The Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995 prescribes the fees charged for binding rulings. Regulation 3 states: (1) The fees payable in respect of an application for a private ruling or a product ruling are as follows: (a) An application fee of $210, which must accompany the application: (b) A further fee calculated at $105 per hour (or part hour), beyond the first 2 hours, spent in consideration of the application... Regulation 7 states: The fees prescribed by these regulations are inclusive of any goods and service tax payable under the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. The supply is correctly zero-rated under section 11 of the GST Act 1985, but the terms of Regulation 7 do not operate so as to reduce the level of fees in zero- rated cases. In such cases, the statutory fees of $210 and $105 per hour are inclu- sive of zero per cent GST. Non-residents are therefore liable for the fees as prescribed in Regulation 3, i.e., $210 application fee and $105 per hour beyond the first two hours. 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. Whether section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a) income tax exemptions apply to non-natural persons Public ruling - BR Pub 96/8 This is a public ruling made under section 91D of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangements to which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the sale or other disposition of land by non-natural persons. The period for which this ruling applies This ruling applies to the sale or other disposition of land occurring during the period 1 June 1996 to 31 May 1999. The ruling The words “the taxpayer’s spouse” in section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a) do not restrict the meaning of “taxpayer” to natural persons. “Tax- payer” in section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a) includes non-natural persons such as companies and trusts. This ruling is signed by me on the 14th day of May 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Analysis of public ruling BR Pub 96/8 This analysis of the ruling does not form part of the ruling. All legislative references are to Income Tax Act 1994 unless otherwise indicated. Background Profits or gains assessable to taxpayers under section CD 1 (2) are subject to a number of exemptions. This ruling considers whether the taxpayer must be a natural person to come within the exemptions contained in section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a). continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) tural business carried on by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them; and... Application of legislation The ordinary meaning of the words “by the taxpayer, or the taxpayer’s spouse, or both of them” in section CD 1 (4)(a)(i) and section CD 1 (7)(a) does not require the taxpayer to be a natural person. On a literal inter- pretation, by considering each alternative in section CD 1 (4)(a) separately, a non-natural taxpayer, e.g. a company, could clearly come within the words: “The land was acquired by the taxpayer, and used ...By the taxpayer...principally for the purposes of a farming or agricultural business carried on by the taxpayer. However, the reference to the “taxpayer’s spouse” could instead be interpreted as colouring the word “taxpayer”, and limiting its meaning to natural persons. It is the Commissioner’s view that the words are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that “taxpayer” is not restricted to natural persons. This interpretation is supported by the legislative history of the exemptions. Prior to 1983, the exemptions only referred to “tax- payer”, and it was clear that a company or other non- natural persons could come within the exemptions. In 1983, the exemptions were amended to include taxpay- ers’ spouses. The intention at that stage was to extend the exemptions, rather than to narrow them to natural persons. Bank of New Zealand’s “Cash Draw Saver” account Product ruling - BR Prd 96/11 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of section BB 4 and the definitions of “interest” and “money lent” in section OB 1. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The arrangement is as described in the Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) promotional booklet titled “Day-to-day & Savings Accounts”. The booklet details all the terms and conditions applicable to the particular savings account to which this ruling applies. The BNZ encourages depositors to save in an account referred to as “Cash Draw Saver” in the promotional booklet. This Cash Draw Saver ac- count has the following characteristics. Every month a prize pool of $350,000 is to be won by Cash Draw Saver account holders only. There will be one prize of $100,000, five of $10,000, 20 of $5,000, and 100 of $1,000. A depositor could win multiple prizes: winning the $100,000 will not prevent the depositor winning one or more of the $10,000, $5,000, or $1,000 prizes in any one month. Every $100 saved gives one chance in each of the prize draws each month. The BNZ reserves the right to vary or amend the amount of cash prizes or suspend or terminate the monthly cash draw at any time.

Interest is calculated daily on a depositor’s entire balance and credited monthly to his or her account. Depositors have access to their Cash Draw Saver accounts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through money machines, EFTPOS, and 24-Hour Telephone Banking. They can make deposits and withdrawals at the Bank. All deposits are free of activity fees, but withdrawals, after the first two in any one month, are charged for. Assumptions The ruling is based on the facts as set out in the letter dated 11 March 1996 that accompanied the application dated 15 March 1996, and the information con- tained in the promotional booklet describing the above arrangement. In particu- lar, it is assumed that: • The depositor is not in the business of entering prize competitions. • The value of the right to enter the prize competition is nominal, based on the number of entries. From the information provided, it is estimated that a depositor has a one in 400,000 chance of winning a prize. The value of the right to enter the prize competition will be considered to be nominal if the chance of winning does not decrease substantially from this approximate level. The ruling • The prizes received by depositors will not be “interest” as defined in section OB 1. • The prizes received by depositors will not be assessable income for the pur- poses of section BB 4. The period for which the ruling applies This ruling applies from the income year commencing 1 April 1996 to 31 March 1999.

Signed Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Policy statements This section of the TIB contains policy statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. Generally, these statements cover matters on which Inland Revenue wishes to state a policy, but which are not suitable topics for public binding rulings. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following policy statements. However, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of assessment we consider that the earlier advice does not follow the law. Homestays - GST treatment Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s policy on when GST registered homestay operators can claim input tax deductions. It also discusses how section 21 adjustments apply and a recent TRA decision concerning GST and a farmstay: Case S56 (1996) 17 NZTC 7,361. (Reported as TRA case 92/176 on page 40 of TIB Volume Seven, No.8.) The most significant input tax deductions claimed by homestay operators are for the initial purchase price or construction costs of the home, and/or renovation or extension costs to an existing home. In order to get a full input tax deduction for these expenses a GST registered operator must: • be carrying on a taxable activity; and • demonstrate that the relevant goods or services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. These requirements create a “two stage” test. Whether a person is carrying on a taxable activity of homestay operation will be a question of fact and degree in each case. It will involve an examination of all the circumstances, which may involve the consideration of the steps taken to start the operation, the type and location of the home, the local tourism market, and the anticipated or actual level of occupation. To establish whether the principal purpose test is satisfied, the Commissioner generally applies a formula relating to the floor area of the home to assess to what degree it is used, or to be used, in making taxable supplies. The formula includes a 50% estimated use of common areas for homestay purposes. Section 21 adjustments apply to goods and services, including the home, applied for both homestay and private purposes. When an input tax deduction on the purchase price or construction costs of a home is available, GST will be payable on the subsequent sale or other supply of the home, or the deemed supply of the home on cessation of the homestay operation. When a registered person has claimed an input tax deduction for an extension to an existing dwelling, and the extension is principally for homestay purposes, GST will be payable on the subse- quent supply of the home to the extent that the propor- tion claimed bears to the whole home. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Background Providing short term holiday accommodation in a private home for a charge is becoming increasingly popular. This is commonly called “homestay” or “farmstay” accommodation. Typically, it involves providing accommodation to paying guests in a person’s own home by making available a bedroom or bedrooms, and possibly other rooms, exclusively for guests, and sharing other parts of the home with guests. It may also involve preparing meals for guests. Homestay operators often voluntarily register for GST. A number of operators have sought input tax deductions on the cost of acquiring or building their home. Others have sought input tax deductions on the cost of renovat- ing or extending their home. Input tax deductions are only available for goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. There has been some confusion as to how to satisfy the principal purpose test in the context of homestays. Questions have also been raised on how sections 21(1) and 21(5) apply to supplies of goods and services that are subsequently applied for both taxable and private purposes. Legislation Section 8 states that GST is chargeable on the supply (not being an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person, by reference to the value of that supply. Section 6(1)(a) defines the term “taxable activity” as being: Any activity which is carried on continuously or regularly by any person, whether or not for a pecuniary profit, and involves or is intended to involve, in whole or in part, the supply of goods and services to any other person for a consideration; and continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Stage One: carrying on a taxable activity Registration To claim input tax deductions a person must be GST registered. The Act contemplates compulsory and voluntary registration. Under section 51(3), a person applying for voluntary registration must satisfy the Commissioner that a taxable activity is being carried on or that the person intends to carry on a taxable activity from a specified date. For many homestay operations the total value of sup- plies will not exceed $30,000 in any 12-month period, so operators will seek voluntary registration. The character of homestay operations is such that in some cases persons may seek to register when the nature or extent of their operation does not amount to a taxable activity. This may be because insufficient steps have been taken to start the activity, or because the level of anticipated occupation by guests is so low or infrequent that it takes the activity outside the definition of taxable activity. In either case, no input tax deductions are available because the person is not carrying on a taxable activity, and should not be registered. Taxable activity Under section 6(1), the principal characteristics of a taxable activity are: • There must be some form of activity. • The activity is carried on continuously or regularly. • The activity involves (or is intended to involve) the supply, for consideration, of goods and services to another person. • The activity need not be carried on for profit. The question of whether an activity is carried on continuously or regularly for the purposes of the Act is relevant to homestays. The meaning of these words has been considered by the Courts. Newman v CIR (1995) 17 NZTC 12,097 is the leading case in this area. The Court of Appeal delivered sepa- rate judgments from which the following general comments are relevant here: • The application of the taxable activity test to particu- lar circumstances will necessarily involve questions of fact and degree. • “Carrying on” means “the habitual pursuit of a course of conduct” and implies “a repetition of acts”. • The legislation looks to a course of conduct that can fairly be described as being carried on continuously or regularly. It is not a matter of importing any overlay of commercial dealing. • It is the activity and not the making of supplies that must be continuous or regular. • The definition is construed as a whole, bearing in mind section 6(2) (commencement and termination), and the scheme of the Act. includes any such activity carried on in the form of a business, trade, manufacture, profession, vocation, association, or club. Section 6(2) deems anything done in connection with the start or finish of a taxable activity to be carried out in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity. Under the Act, registered persons must account for GST (output tax) on the supplies made in each taxable period. Section 20 permits the deduction of input tax from the amount of output tax attributable to a given taxable period. Section 2 defines input tax: “Input tax”, in relation to a registered person, means- (a) Tax charged under section 8(1) of this Act on the supply of goods and services made to that person: ... (c) Any amount equal to the tax fraction (being the tax fraction applicable at the time of supply within the meaning of section 9 or any other provision of this Act) of the consideration in money for the supply, being a supply by way of sale that is not a taxable supply, to a registered person of any secondhand goods ... being in any case goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies:... Section 21(1) requires output tax adjustments to be made when goods and services acquired for the princi- pal purpose of making taxable supplies are subsequently applied for a private or exempt purpose. Section 21(5) permits input tax adjustments to be made when goods and services acquired or produced after 1 October 1986, other than for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, are subsequently applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. Under both sections there is a deemed supply to the extent of that subsequent applica- tion. The value of the deemed supply is essentially the lesser of these two amounts: • the cost of those goods and services • the open market value of that supply. To avoid doubt, section 5(16) provides that any subse- quent supply of a dwelling for which an input tax deduction has been claimed is a taxable supply. Section 5(18) states: Where a registered person has claimed a deduction in accordance with section 20(3) of this Act in respect of a proportion of a dwelling, the supply of that dwelling shall be a taxable supply only to the extent that the proportion claimed bears to the whole dwelling. Policy - input tax deductions To claim an input tax deduction for goods and services relating to a homestay, the GST registered operator must fulfil both requirements of a “two stage” test. He or she must satisfy the Commissioner that: • a taxable activity is being carried on; and • the goods and services have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) The High Court also considered the meaning of “con- tinuously or regularly” in Allen Yachts Charters Limited v CIR (1994) 16 NZTC 11,270. Justice Tompkins said at page 11,274: \[The\] activity must be carried on “continuously or regularly”. This indicates that the activity must either be carried on all the time, i.e., continuously, or it must be carried on at reasonably short intervals, i.e., regularly. An activity that is intermittent or occasional does not qualify. The Court found that the yacht chartering activity in question was a taxable activity. Although it had not been carried on continuously, as there had been only 12 charters over a two-year period, it had been carried on regularly. This was the result given the number of occasions when there was a charter, and also the activities relating to the charter operation. For example, weekly marketing, availability of the boat, signs adver- tising its availability, and the continuation of these activities up until the sale of the boat. In an earlier TRA decision Case P73 (1992) 14 NZTC 4,489, also dealing with a yacht chartering business, Barber J found that no taxable activity had been carried on. The principal use of the yacht in question was racing and not chartering. Barber J found that the yacht company had intended to commence a chartering operation. However, that operation either never com- menced, or did not commence to the necessary degree to be carried on “continuously or regularly”. The following parts of the decision are relevant here: I am in no doubt that, at material times, ...the objector was not carrying on a taxable activity. The objector intended to take all steps necessary to establish business as a charterer, but did not achieve that enterprise. Its activities were preparatory of that. ... In fact, the objector did not get beyond development work for a business. As it dealt with survey aspects and promoted the availability of chartering, it became apparent that there was no market for the objector’s enterprise. \[at page 4,493\] ... I appreciate that sec 6(2) deems the inclusion of commence- ment (and termination) activity into the course of that activity. However, here there was never the establishment of any taxable activity. Commencement work can only be added to such an activity. By itself, it cannot amount to a taxable activity. \[at page 4,494\] ... There were budgets and feasibility studies. ... The objector incurred expenses in altering the vessel for passenger carrying purposes. ... I also accept that chartering is a seasonal activity and that a boat can be taken out of the water for quite long periods for good reasons. I accept the intentions of the objector to commence chartering from the very outset of GST registration. ... The chartering activity was never much more than a proposal and, certainly, was never continuous or regular as required by sec 6(1)(a). \[at page 4,495\] Case S56, a recent TRA decision, considers the GST treatment of farmstays. In that case the taxpayer sought input tax deductions for supplies made to him on the construction of a new farmhouse. The taxpayer main- tained that the principal purpose in constructing the house was the provision of farmstay accommodation. At the same time as constructing the farmhouse the taxpayer was also developing a farming enterprise to complement, and form part of, the farmstay operation. To date the taxpayer had not received any farmstay guests. On the particular facts, the Court held that the taxpayer was carrying on the activity of farming; the construction activity forming part of the taxpayer’s overall farming activity. This was despite the consider- able delay in accepting guests. The Commissioner is not appealing Case S56. The result in this case can be confined to its facts and contrasts with the result in Case P73. Application to homestays Determining whether a taxable activity is being carried on, including whether it is being carried on continu- ously or regularly, will always be a question of fact and degree. It will involve an examination of all the circum- stances of the particular case. Some factors that may be relevant in the homestay context are: • The steps the operator has taken to commence operating as a homestay. For example, undertaking feasibility studies, preparing business plans, advertis- ing (nature, and extent), approaching local authorities for necessary consent. • The type, size, design and layout of the home. • The location of the home. • The extent and nature of any modifications to the home. • The nature of the local tourist industry. • The time dedicated, or able to be dedicated, by the operator to the homestay operation. • The availability of accommodation over a sustained period. • The steps the operator has taken which demonstrate a continuing commitment to supply homestay accom- modation. For example, advertising and ongoing marketing activities. • The level of occupation since the date of registration, including future bookings. The examples in this statement show the consideration the Commissioner gives to these factors in determining whether or not there is a taxable activity. The examples are illustrative only, as each case must be considered on its own facts. Deregistration Section 52(5) allows the Commissioner to cancel a person’s registration when he considers that person is not carrying on a taxable activity. Under section 52(5A), when a person has never carried on a taxable activity deregistration is as at the date of registration. The combined effect of sections 52(5), 52(5A), 5(3), and 10(8) is to claw back some or all of the original input tax. The Commissioner will invoke these provisions when he considers a purported homestay operator is not carrying on a taxable activity. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) • In ascertaining what is the principal use of real property it is relevant to consider an area breakdown of the property - identifying the private, taxable, and common purpose areas. Application to homestays When the homestay operator is an individual, there will usually be only two possible purposes for acquiring goods and services: for private use and for making taxable supplies. When the homestay operator is a company or partnership there will usually be only two possible purposes for acquiring goods and services: for exempt use and for making taxable supplies. In both situations, a full input tax deduction is only available when the principal purpose in acquiring goods and services is the making of taxable supplies in the course of carrying on the homestay operation. The most significant potential homestay input tax deductions are for the initial purchase price or construc- tion costs of the home, and/or renovation or extension costs to an existing home. In claiming these input tax deductions, operators must establish that their principal purpose is the taxable purpose of carrying on the homestay operation. However, given that these claims relate to the operator’s private home, the contrary position is that the principal purpose may be a private or exempt purpose. To determine the principal purpose involves considering both the subjective facts, i.e., the operator’s stated purpose, and the objective facts, i.e., the actual, or reasonably anticipated, use of the prop- erty. An objective analysis of the use, or intended use, involves looking at an area breakdown of the property, or the relevant part of the property: Case S56. GST registered homestay operators will need to provide Inland Revenue with accurate and credible information as to the use, or intended use, of the property. This will usually involve providing a detailed plan of the prop- erty. Calculation of the percentage of taxable use A homestay property splits into three types of areas, i.e., exclusively private (or exempt), exclusively homestay, and common areas. The calculation of the percentage of taxable use of the property does not include the exclusively private (or exempt) areas. It includes 100% of the exclusively homestay areas. Exclusively homestay areas are those areas of the home set aside for the exclusive use of guests. Such areas are not used by the registered person, his or her family, or non-paying guests at times when there are no paying guests. Exclusively homestay areas may include bedrooms, ensuite bathrooms, and lounges, when a home includes more than one living room. Common areas are those areas of the home used by guests and the registered person, his or her family, and non-paying guests. These include areas used by guests, but also used by the registered person, his or her family, or non-paying guests at times when guests are not Stage Two: principal purpose If a registered person can establish that he or she is carrying on a taxable activity, that person satisfies stage one of the two stage test. In order to claim a particular input tax deduction, the person must also satisfy stage two of the test. Under the definition of input tax, an input tax deduction is only available when the goods or services concerned are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. The Courts have considered the principal purpose test. “Purpose” means the object or the end that the taxpayer has in mind or view. It is not synonymous with the taxpayer’s motive or intention: Case M53 (1990) 12 NZTC 2,312 and CIR v BNZ Investment Advisory Services Ltd (1994) 16 NZTC 11,111. “Principal” means the “main or primary or fundamental” purpose. It does not necessarily mean “more than 50%”: BNZ Investment. However, when there are only two possible purposes i.e., taxable (homestay) and non-taxable (private or exempt), the principal purpose must be more than 50%. When the principal purpose is making taxable supplies, input tax is claimable in full, even if there is a partial, less than 50%, use of the goods or services in the non- taxable (private or exempt) activity: Coveney v CIR (1995) 16 NZTC 12,193. The principal purpose test applies at the time of acquisi- tion of the relevant goods or services: Case M53 at page 2,316. A number of cases address the question of whether the principal purpose test is a subjective or objective one, or a test involving both a subjective and an objective analysis. The Commissioner considers that it is a mixed test, i.e., it is a subjective test to the extent that it is the taxpayer’s purpose that is under examination. However, the objectively ascertainable actions of the taxpayer and other facts surrounding the claim are relevant to see if the stated purpose bears this out in fact. TRA decisions Case S16 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,123 and Case S56, confirm this approach to the principal purpose test. In these decisions Barber J made the following observations about the principal purpose test: • In ascertaining the taxpayer’s principal purpose, the Court must make an overall assessment of what the taxpayer says was the intention at the relevant time, the evidence of the witnesses, and the so-called objective facts, particularly those relating to the use of the goods by the taxpayer. • It is useful, and possibly determinative, to consider the taxpayer’s use of the property in order to ascertain the principal purpose for which the taxpayer acquired the supply. “Purpose” and “use” are not the same concepts, but an objective consideration of use will help ascertain whether a good was acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) staying. The Commissioner acknowledges that a percentage of homestay use needs to be attributed to the common areas. In Case S56 Barber J attributed 50% homestay activity to the common areas. This is on the basis that these areas are available for homestay use in the future. Generally, the Commissioner will accept 50%. However, in some situations this figure may not be an appropriate reflection of the principal purpose of the common areas. For example, if homestay accommoda- tion is only available for part of the year, or on a restricted basis. As noted, the principal purpose test is both an objective and subjective one. In terms of the subjective component of the test, Case S56 places considerable emphasis on the credibility of the taxpayer. This illustrates the fact that even in cases where on a floor area breakdown of the property more than 50% is attributable to the homestay purpose, Inland Revenue will need to be satisfied that the taxpayer’s stated intentions support the conclusion that the principal purpose in acquiring, constructing, or modifying the home is one of homestay operation. This will involve an examination of all the circumstances of the particular case. Conversely, in some cases where on a floor area break- down of the property marginally less than 50% is attributable to the homestay purpose, it may still be possible to show that the principal purpose in acquiring, constructing, or modifying the home is the making of taxable supplies. For example, when the homestay operation forms part of a wider enterprise. This will involve an examination of all the circumstances of the particular case. Formula The following formula will generally be applied by Inland Revenue to help determine whether the principal purpose in acquiring goods and services for homestays is the making of taxable supplies. When the percentage of taxable use is 50% or less the principal purpose is generally private (or exempt) and no input tax deduc- tion is available. When the percentage of taxable use is more than 50% the principal purpose is generally the making of taxable supplies and a full input tax deduc- tion is available. The formula assumes 50% homestay use of common areas. As discussed above, in certain cases Inland Revenue may apply a different percentage to the common areas. Percentage of taxable use=a + (b x 50%) c In this formula: a is the area of the home used exclusively for homestay purposes b is the area of the home used for both homestay and private (or exempt) purposes c is the total area of the home The formula will generally also be applied when the relevant input tax deduction only relates to part of the home. This will often be the case for renovation and extension expenditure. When such expenditure is not exclusively for homestay purposes, the formula applies to determine whether the principal purpose is taxable or private (or exempt). For example, when an operator recarpets part of the house, or makes additions to the house, being in part for exclusive homestay use and in part for common use. In such cases the formula only applies to the area of the home which is subject to the renovation or the extension. Example 4 illustrates how the formula applies in these circumstances. Curtilage When making the percentage of taxable use calculation, the area surrounding the home (the curtilage) is gener- ally not taken into account under the formula. However, any input tax deduction which is available is calculated on the full purchase price and not just that part of the purchase price which relates to the value of the dwell- ing. The Commissioner acknowledges that in certain cases the actual, or intended, use of the curtilage may affect the calculation. For example, when significant areas of the curtilage are for the exclusive use of guests (e.g. a swimming pool or tennis court). In such cases, the Commissioner may accept evidence to substantiate a different overall calculation of the actual, or intended, use of the property. Subsequent supply of home When an input tax deduction on the purchase price or construction costs of a home is available, GST will be payable on the subsequent sale or other supply of the home: section 5(16). This is regardless of the partial application of the home for private or exempt purposes. TIB Volume 6, No. 11 (April 1995) at page 1 sets out the Commissioner’s policy on the treatment of supplies of goods after a change in use, including goods applied partially for private or exempt purposes. Section 5(18) means that when a dwelling for which an input tax deduction has been claimed for extension expenditure is subsequently supplied, output tax will be payable to the extent that the consideration relates to that proportion of the dwelling. Under section 5(3) GST may also be payable when a homestay operator ceases to be a registered person. GST will be payable when, at the time of cessation, the home forms part of the assets of the taxable activity. The Commissioner considers that homestay properties for which an input tax deduction has been obtained (on acquisition or construction) form part of the assets of the homestay operation. Homestay properties for which an input tax deduction has never been obtained, and which are not used for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies at the time of cessation, do not form part of the assets of the homestay operation. continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Examples Example 1 An individual wants to go into the homestay business. She has heard that it is a growth industry and a way of meeting interesting people. Her spouse, who is in full-time employment, agrees. The couple live in a small farming town situated just off a main highway. It is a pleasant enough place, but does not have any notable attractions. The couple look into the possibility of selling their existing home and buying another further out of town. They register for GST stating their taxable activity to be “homestay operators”. They sell their present home and buy a three bedroom home about 10 kilometres from town. They claim an input tax deduction on the purchase price of the house. As soon as they move in, they advertise the homestay in the local paper and put up a homestay sign outside the front gate. They write away to a home hospitality organisation to find out more about listing their home in the organisation’s publication. Inland Revenue queries the input tax deduction claim. Enquiries reveal that: • The town is too remote to attract tourists on a regular basis. • The taxpayers have not undertaken research into the local market, nor taken any significant steps to ascertain the viability of the activity. • The home is not of a type that is likely to attract guests, and no steps have been taken to modify it for homestay purposes: • At the time the claim is queried (12 months after registration) only four paying guests (two of whom were relatives of town residents) have stayed. In the absence of other evidence being provided, this claim would probably be disallowed on the basis that the taxpayers are not carrying on a taxable activity. Example 2 An individual works in the city, but dreams of moving to the country and changing her lifestyle. She likes the idea of working part-time and running a homestay in a rural area. She investigates the tourist market in various locations, before deciding to move to a coastal area where the tourism industry is thriving, particularly during the summer months. A four bedroom house seems ideal for her purposes, so she makes an offer to buy it. The house is near a picturesque beach and a small town, which has several restaurants, a theatre, and a number of arts and crafts shops. There are several other homestays in the vicinity. She contacts both the local tourist Section 21 adjustments Section 21 adjustments are necessary when a registered person applies goods and services for both taxable and non-taxable purposes. •Section 21(1) applies when a full input tax deduction has been claimed for goods or services that are subsequently applied for non-taxable purposes. In such cases, output tax is payable to the extent of that application. •Section 21(5) applies when no GST input tax deduc- tion has been claimed (generally because the principal purpose test is not satisfied) for goods or services that are subsequently applied for the purpose of making taxable supplies. In such cases, input tax is available to the extent of that application. Section 21(5) only applies to goods and services acquired or produced after 1 October 1986. The value of any adjustment under section 21(1) or 21(5) is the lesser of the cost price or the open market value of the deemed supply of the relevant goods or services. When the application of the goods or services for a non-taxable purpose (section 21(1)) or for a taxable purpose (section 21(5)) is on an ongoing basis, an adjustment must be made in each taxable period. In both cases, a one-off adjustment is available for a capital asset costing less than $10,000, inclusive of GST. When the goods or services are of a revenue or expense nature and are “consumed” within a taxable period, a single adjustment is made in that period. For GST purposes, when a company or partnership owns the homestay property there will be an exempt supply of those premises to the individual occupants. In such a case, the first proviso to section 21(1) may apply to some goods and services acquired by company or partnership to run homestays. The proviso limits the circumstances for making ongoing adjustments for exempt supplies. Part Five of Inland Revenue’s GST Guide (GST 600) provides practical information on how to make section 21 adjustments. This booklet is available at any Inland Revenue office. Different interpretation In Case S56 Barber J discusses section 21 adjustments in the context of homestays. He considers that section 21 gives rise to one-off adjustments (not just for assets costing less than $10,000), rather than period-by-period adjustments. The Commissioner does not necessarily agree with these obiter statements. In the Commissioner’s view Barber J’s interpretation tends to ignore the words “subse- quently applied”, appearing in sections 21(1) and 21(5), and the fact that one-off adjustments are expressly dealt with in the provisos to those sections as applying only to assets costing less than $10,000. The Commissioner considers that the better interpretation of section 21 is that which is consistent with existing policy. Example 2 illustrates the application of this policy to homestays. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) office and a national home hospitality organisation to find out about listing her homestay. The taxpayer registers for GST as a homestay operator, and has two-monthly taxable periods. She purchases the house and land for $150,000. The value of the land is $50,000, the value of the house is $100,000. The taxpayer intends to use two of the bedrooms exclusively for homestay purposes. A builder is hired to put in ensuite bathrooms for these rooms, which the taxpayer redecorates. She advertises in the local newspaper and places a regular monthly advertisement in a national newspaper. A thousand advertising brochures are printed, and a homestay sign is placed outside the house. The taxpayer registers with the local tourist office and a national home hospitality organisation, and sends brochures to them. She contacts Inland Revenue to establish whether an input tax deduction can be claimed on the purchase price of the house, and on the cost of the renovations and advertising. She also wants to know how to make section 21 adjustments on the purchase price of the house. Inland Revenue staff are satisfied that the taxpayer is carrying on a taxable activity. They advise her as to how the principal purpose test applies. She supplies Inland Revenue with a floor plan of the house (at the time it was acquired) showing the areas that are exclusively private, exclusively homestay, and common to both purposes. Only two bedrooms are exclusively for homestay purposes. The common areas are the lounge, dining room, hallway, kitchen, and laundry. The exclusively private areas are the taxpayer’s bedroom, the spare bedroom, the bathroom, and a small sewing room. Attributing 50% taxable purpose to the common areas results in 40% homestay application and 60% private application. The principal purpose test is not satisfied. No input tax deduction is available for the purchase price of the house and land. A full input tax deduction is available for the building and redecorating expenses, and for the costs of advertising, as these goods and services relate exclusively to the homestay operation. Section 21 adjustments On the basis of 40% homestay application, period by period section 21(5) adjustments for the supply of the house are available. The consideration for the deemed taxable supply is an amount equal to the tax fraction of that part of the lesser of: • the cost of the house, to the extent that it is applied for homestay purposes; and • the open market value of the supply of the house, to the extent that it is applied for homestay purposes. Cost Cost is not the cost of acquiring the home. Cost is related to making the supply of part of the home. In this case the principal cost is depreciation of the capital value of the home. There are no interest charges. Depreciation - straight-line basis at 3% (the house has a timber frame) $100,000 x 3% x 40% = $200 6 Annual maintenance expenses, rates and insurance are also expenses relating to the supply of the home. These are estimated to be $1,500. $1,500 x 40% = $100 6 The total cost of the house, to the extent that it is applied for homestay purposes, during the two- month period is $300. Open market value The open market value of the supply of the home to the extent that it is applied for homestay purposes is: (the number of nights homestay accommodation is available during the two-month period) x (the total tariff per night). In most cases cost will be the lesser amount. Assuming cost is the lesser amount in this case, the adjustment available for each taxable period on the basis of 40% taxable application of the house is a deduction of: $300 =$22.22 9 In the future, a different percentage (more than 50%) based on actual occupation levels may be used to calculate the use of the common areas. Inland Revenue staff advise the taxpayer to maintain records to substantiate the level of occupation over the next 12 months. Example 3 A married couple operate a motel in a town with a good tourist trade. A large private residence on the outskirts of town is for sale. The couple think it will make an ideal private hotel. They are considering selling the motel and buying the house. They ask Inland Revenue whether they may claim a full input tax deduction on the purchase price of the house. The house has six bedrooms, four of which the taxpayers intend to make available exclusively for guests. There is a formal dining room and lounge, a library, billiards room and large kitchen. These will be available for use by guests and by the family. The house is surrounded by two hectares of land includ- ing a swimming pool and tennis court. These continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) The taxpayers contact Inland Revenue to establish whether the partnership may claim an input tax deduction for the $40,000 cost of the extension to the house. They also want to know how to treat the costs involved in offering meals to guests. The cost of the extension needs to be apportioned over the floor area of that part of the house. Modify- ing the formula set out above to apply to extensions, item “a” is the area of the two bedrooms and ensuites, item “b” is the area of the extension to the lounge, and item “c” is the total area of the exten- sion. Attributing 50% homestay use to the common areas results in 85% homestay application and 15% exempt (i.e., provision of residential accommoda- tion by the partnership to the couple) application. The principal purpose test is satisfied, and a full input tax deduction is available for the costs of the extension. In this case no section 21(1) adjustments for the exempt application of the extension are necessary at this time. This is because the proviso to section 21(1) applies. The value of all exempt supplies to be made in the following 12 months is reasonably estimated to not exceed the lesser of $48,000 and 5% of the total consideration for all taxable and exempt supplies to be made by the partnership in that period. The couple are also advised to keep records of the food and other items they purchase exclusively for homestay consumption or use. They are able to claim a full input tax deduction for this expenditure. They must make section 21 adjustments for items that are consumed by the family and guests based on the percentage of taxable versus private use. GST incurred in determining tax liability Summary This item sets out the Commissioner’s interpretation of section 20A of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985. Section 20A allows GST registered persons to claim input tax deductions for goods and services acquired in connection with the calculation or determination of their GST or income tax liabilities. It also allows input tax deductions for goods and services acquired in connection with the making of GST and income tax related objections or appeals. It achieves this by deem- ing these goods and services to be acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Section 20A(4) requires GST registered persons who receive any reimbursement, award of the Court, or similar payment for the cost of goods and services falling within section 20A to pay output tax on that payment. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise stated. Background Section 20A was inserted into the Act by the Goods and Services Tax Amendment Act 1988, effective from 24 March 1988. It mirrors the language of section DJ 5 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 165, Income Tax Act 1976). Section DJ 5 deems certain expenses associ- ated with determining taxation liabilities to be deduct- ible for income tax purposes. Legislation Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. Section 20(3) permits the deduction of input tax from output tax. Section 2(1) defines “input tax” as: “Input tax”, in relation to a registered person, means- (a) Tax charged under section 8(1) of this Act on the supply of goods and services made to that person:... facilities will be available to guests and the family. The husband is an excellent chef and intends to offer evening meals to guests to be served in the formal dining room. The taxpayers supply Inland Revenue with a floor plan of the house showing which areas are exclu- sively private, exclusively homestay, and common to both purposes. Attributing 50% to the common areas results in 55% homestay application and 45% private applica- tion. The principal purpose test is satisfied. A full input tax deduction is available on the purchase price of the house. Period by period section 21(1) adjustments must be made to reflect the private use of the home. Example 4 A husband and wife farm in partnership in an area with a steady local and foreign tourist trade. The partnership is registered for GST. The couple see how successful local homestay operations are and decide to offer farmstays. Their home is a small, two bedroom colonial cottage. The couple decide to modernise the house by adding a further three bedrooms, two with ensuite bathrooms, and extend- ing the lounge. The two bedrooms and ensuites are exclusively for farmstay purposes. The lounge will be for private and farmstay purposes. The couple consult local homestay operators and take steps to assess the viability of the venture and to advertise the farmstay. They start receiving farmstay guests. Due to demand, they begin to offer evening meals. from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) being in any case goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies:... Section 20A deals with GST incurred in relation to the determination of a registered person’s tax liability. It expressly entitles registered persons to claim input tax deductions for goods and services acquired in connec- tion with the calculation, determination, assessment of, and objection in relation to, their assessable income or GST liabilities. Section 20A(2) states: Subject to this section, any goods and services acquired by the registered person in connection with- (a) The calculation or determination of the assessable income of the registered person for any income year: (b) The calculation or determination of the goods and services tax payable by the registered person for any taxable period: (c) The preparation, institution, or presentation of an objec- tion to or an appeal against or in consequence of any determination or assessment made, in respect of the registered person, by the Commissioner under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985: (d) Any contribution by the registered person towards the expenditure incurred by any other taxpayer or registered person, as the case may be, where- (i) That expenditure is allowable under this section in the calculation or determination of the assessable income of, or any goods and services tax payable by, the first- mentioned registered person; and (ii)The first-mentioned registered person has objected to or appealed against an assessment or determination made, in relation to the matter by, the Commissioner under the provisions of the Income Tax Act 1976 or the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985,- shall be deemed to be goods and services acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies; and the Commissioner shall allow that person to make a deduction under section 20(3) of this Act of the tax charged thereon. For the purposes of section 20A, “assessable income”, “income year” and “taxpayer” have the same meaning as in section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976). “Goods and services tax payable” has a special meaning for the purposes of the provision. The definition in section 20A(1) limits its meaning to amounts calculated under sections 19, 19A, 19B, 19C, and section 20. It also includes any amount referred to in section 17(2) or section 27(6) and amounts refundable under section 19C or section 20. Section 20A(3) limits the scope of the available input tax deductions under section 20A(2). Deductions are not available for goods and services acquired in connection with any matter or assessment arising from an income tax or GST return that the Commissioner considers fraudulent or wilfully misleading. Section 20A(3) also excludes deductions for goods and services acquired in connection with: • any offence under any Inland Revenue Act. • any assessment of penal tax (provided that it is not subsequently cancelled). • any objection or appeal the Commissioner considers to be inconsequential or frivolous. Section 20A(4) states: Any amount received by the registered person at any time, whether by way of reimbursement, award of the Court, recovery, or otherwise howsoever in respect of goods and services deemed under this section to be acquired by the registered person for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, shall be deemed to be supplied by that registered person in the course of a taxable activity in the taxable period in which it is received. Application of legislation Section 20A(2) Section 20A(2) deems goods and services acquired in connection with determining taxation liabilities to be goods and services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Subject to the express exclu- sions in section 20A(3), it applies to goods and services acquired in connection with: • Calculating or determining the registered person’s assessable income or GST payable. For example, legal and accounting fees relating to the preparation of the registered person’s accounts for taxation purposes and income tax and GST returns. Also, any costs involved in dealing with Inland Revenue enquiries in relation to those returns. It also extends to the cost of purchas- ing taxation publications to assist in calculating and determining taxation liabilities. • Preparing, instituting, or presenting an objection or appeal by the registered person regarding an income tax or GST determination or assessment. For exam- ple, professional fees relating to the objection or appeal process, witness fees, and court costs. • Any contribution by the registered person towards the expenses of another person when, if the registered person had incurred those expenses, they would give rise to an input tax deduction under section 20A(2)(a), (b), or (c). This is provided they relate to a matter which is also the subject of an objection or appeal by the registered person. Section 20A(2) only applies to goods and services closely associated with the circumstances set out in paragraphs (a) to (d) of the provision. Judicial consid- eration of section 20A(2) and section DJ 5 (1), the analogous provision for income tax purposes, confirms this approach. Refer to: Case Q43 (1993) 15 NZTC 5,208; Case E84 (1982) 5 NZTC 59,441; Yurjevich v CIR (1991) 13 NZTC 8,185; Case J8 (1987) 9 NZTC 1,048. The cases illustrate the scope of sections DJ 5 (1)(a) and (b), particularly the meaning of the words “calculation or determination”. Sections 20A(2)(a) and (b) also contain these words. Judge Bathgate considered the continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) tor claiming an input tax deduction. That provision prevents input tax deductions for any goods and services acquired in connection with a fraudulent return, or an offence under any Inland Revenue Act. Section 2 definition of “input tax’ Case Q43 illustrates that even when goods or services do not come within section 20A(2), an input tax deduc- tion may still be available under the general definition of “input tax” in section 2. This will be the case when the goods or services have been acquired for the princi- pal purpose of making taxable supplies. Goods or services are acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies when there is a sufficient nexus between the incurring of the expenditure and the course or furtherance of the company’s taxable activity: Case Q43 at page 5,214. The taxable activity must involve the making of taxable supplies or the prospect of making future taxable supplies. The goods and services must relate closely to that activity and the making of taxable supplies. Some professional taxation advice services may not come within section 20A(2). Whether input tax deduc- tions for professional taxation advice fees are available under the general definition of “input tax” will depend on the facts of each case. To obtain a deduction the advice must either directly relate to the making of a taxable supply or taxable supplies or there must be a close nexus between the advice and the carrying on of the registered person’s taxable activity. If the principal purpose in acquiring the advice is the making of exempt, or private or other non-taxable supplies, no input tax deduction is available. In cases where the purpose in acquiring the advice is the making of taxable and non-taxable supplies section 21 will apply. Section 20A(4) Under section 20A(4), when a registered person receives any payment to reimburse the cost of any goods and services falling within section 20A(2), he or she must return output tax on that payment. The payment may be by way of reimbursement, award of the Court, recovery, or some other kind of payment in respect of such goods and services. This includes out-of- court settlements with Inland Revenue when the Com- missioner agrees to contribute towards the registered person’s costs in objecting to, or appealing against, a determination or assessment. The time of supply for the purposes of accounting for output tax on such a payment is the time of receipt. Example An operating company for a forestry consulting business is GST registered and files two-monthly GST returns. It employs a firm of accountants. The role of the accountancy firm is threefold: to assist the company in filing its returns (income tax interpretation of these words in Case E84 at page 59,444. To summarise that interpretation, as it applies to section 20A(2): • “Calculation” refers to the action by which the registered person, his or her accountant or agent, reaches his or her determination of the registered person’s assessable income for a particular year or the GST payable for any taxable period. It does not include the preparation for that purpose, in the way of gathering information together, or any preliminary steps to that calculation. It refers to working out, from figures and information on hand, the determination of assessable income or GST liabilities. • “Determination” is the end result of the calculation by or for the registered person. It is the process that gives the final figure. The cases also show that the goods and services must be acquired in close connection with the circumstances listed in section 20A. In Yurjevich v CIR the High Court considered whether there was a link or connection sufficiently close and relevant to the preparation, institution, or presentation of the objection that it could reasonably be said that the expenditure was incurred in connection with it. The Court found on the facts that the expense of travelling out of town to discuss an objection to a tax assessment with the taxpayer’s relatives was too remote and not sufficiently relevant to the purpose of preparing an objection. However, the Court noted that section DJ 5 may extend to travel expenditure in different circumstances. Section 20A(3) Under section 20A(3), section 20A does not apply to any goods and services acquired in connection with: • any matter or assessment arising from an income tax or GST return that, in the opinion of the Commis- sioner, is fraudulent or wilfully misleading. • any Inland Revenue Act (as scheduled in the Tax Administration Act 1994) offence. • any assessment of income tax or GST penal tax. • any inconsequential or frivolous objection or appeal. Case Q43 considers section 20A(2) and section 20A(3). The issue was whether certain barrister’s fees for representing the objector in criminal proceedings were for services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. Alternatively, whether the fees were for services within the terms of section 20A(2)(c), i.e., the preparation, institution, or presentation of an objection to a GST assessment. On the first issue, Judge Barber found that the objector was not trading at the time the fees were incurred, and was not likely to trade in the future. Accordingly, the fees were not for services acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. As to the application of section 20A, Judge Barber found that section 20A(3) applied to prevent the objec- from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) and GST), to provide ongoing taxation and account- ing advice in relation to the business, and to prepare end-of-year accounts for taxation and company law purposes. In addition, the firm recently assisted the company in its dealings with Inland Revenue. This related to the company’s objection to its 1994 income tax assessment. The matter went to the High Court and the company won the case. The Court awarded the company $1,000 as a reasonable contribution towards its costs in objecting to the assessment. The accountancy firm bills the company six- monthly. The latest bill itemises the different services performed and the cost of each service. It includes the cost of assisting in the presentation of the objection. Input tax deductions The preparation of the returns and the end-of-year accounts are services within sections 20A(2)(a) and (b). The service of assisting with the objection comes within section 20A(2)(c). An input tax deduction is available for the other services to the extent that they have been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. There must either be a direct nexus between the advice given and the making of a taxable supply or taxable supplies, or there must be a close nexus between the advice and the carrying on of the registered per- son’s taxable activity. To the extent that the advice relates to the making of exempt or other non- taxable supplies, no deduction will be available. Under section 20A(4) the company must account for $111.11 output tax on the Court award. It must return this amount in its GST return for the taxable period in which it receives payment. Binding ruling fee In addition, the company asks its accountants to apply for a binding ruling on its behalf. The ruling is to ascertain the income tax and stamp duty treatment of the proposed sale of one of its business premises. The binding ruling fee is $2,940 inclusive of GST. Section 20A(2) does not apply, i.e., the acquisition of the binding ruling is not in connection with the calculation or determination of the assessable income of the company. In this case, there is no direct link between calculating or determining the company’s assessable income and the binding ruling. Obtaining the ruling is only preparatory to the calculation of the company’s income tax position: Case E84. This is particularly so where the ruling relates to a proposed, rather than a completed, transaction. In addition, the ruling deals with stamp duty liability, which is not included within section 20A(2). However, the company may claim an input tax deduction for the cost of the ruling because the ruling has been acquired for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies. It has been acquired for the principal purpose of making a possible future taxable supply of the business premises. The binding ruling has not been acquired for the purpose of making exempt supplies. Balance date change - transitional returns Summary This item outlines how the Commissioner applies the legislation concerning the transitional income tax returns required following the Commissioner’s approval of a change of balance date. It also states the Commis- sioner’s policy on the application date for a change of balance date. The Commissioner’s policy on the actual granting of non-standard balance dates remains that stated in Appendix B of TIB Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994). Transitional returns Sections 38 and 39 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 set out the treatment for transitional returns. When the new balance date is an earlier date in the calendar year than the original balance date, the taxpayer must file a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the next succeed- ing year. When the new balance date is a later date in the calendar year than the original balance date, the taxpayer must file a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the same calendar year. Under section 39, during the transitional period all income derived by the tax- payer during that period must be added to any other income derived for the same year for the purposes of assessment. Application dates for new balance dates The Commissioner’s policy is not to allow a taxpayer to carry back a known income or loss into a prior income year. This would occur when the taxpayer applies for a new balance date after the anniversary of the old balance date, and requests the new balance date to be effective from the previous income year. Furthermore, the Commissioner will not agree to a change to a balance date which is earlier than the date of the application. Assuming the taxpayer satisfies the Com- missioner’s requirements for a change of balance date, the Commissioner will permit the change in balance date to take effect in the income year of the request, if it is possible to file tax returns for all the income years. This depends on the dates involved in the change of balance date. If there would otherwise be a missing return, the change will take effect in the income year following the request. All legislative references in this item are to the Tax Administration Act 1994 unless otherwise stated. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) This return is for the income derived during the transi- tional period which begins on the day after the original balance date and ends on the new balance date. Section 39 states: (1) If in any case the new return date is an earlier date than the original return date, the taxpayer shall furnish a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the next succeeding year, and if the new return date is a later date than the original return date, the taxpayer shall furnish a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the same year. For the purposes of this subsection, one date shall be earlier than another if it is earlier in the calendar year notwithstanding that it may not be earlier in the financial year. (2) All returns of income made in accordance with subsection (1) shall be deemed to be returns of income derived during the year ending with the 31 March nearest to the new return date, and the income derived by the taxpayer during that period shall, for the purposes of assessment, be added to any other income derived for the same year, and the taxpayer shall be assessed and liable for income tax accordingly. ... (5) In this section- “New return date” means, in the case of a taxpayer who has changed the taxpayer’s return date, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the date to which the change was made or, if the taxpayer has made more than one change, means the date to which the last change was made: “Original return date” means, in the case of a taxpayer who has changed the taxpayer’s return date, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, the return date immediately prior to the new return date: “Return date” means the last day of the period for which a return of income is required to be made. Transitional tax returns when balance date changes Under section 39(1), when the new return date is an earlier date in the calendar year than the original return date, the taxpayer must file a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the next succeeding year. Example 1 A 31 March balance date is to change to a 31 Janu- ary balance date. The return for the 1995-96 income year will cover the period from 1 April 1995 to 31 January 1996. The return for the 1996-97 income year will be from 1 February 1996 to 31 January 1997. When the new return date is a later date in the calendar year than the original return date, the taxpayer must file a return for the period from the original return date up to and including the new return date in the same calendar year. Background When the Commissioner approves a non-standard balance date for a taxpayer who previously had either a standard 31 March balance date or another non- standard balance date, a return for a period of other than 12 months will result. Some confusion has arisen over how to work out these periods and when the change of balance date takes effect. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 IB 416(6) KB 216(5) OB 1 definition of “year”2 Tax AdministrationIncome Tax Act 1976 Act 1994 339 3815 3916 119(2)379(2) Section 33 requires taxpayers to file tax returns for every year. Section OB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 defines a “year” as starting on 1 April and ending on 31 March. (This definition from the Income Tax Act applies to the Tax Administration Act because of the effect of section 3(2) of the Tax Administration Act.) When taxpayers balance their accounts to a date other than 31 March, section 38 allows them to file returns to that non-standard balance date. The election to have a non-standard balance date requires the Commissioner’s consent. When a taxpayer has a non-standard balance date, section 38 deems the taxpayer to derive the income during the year ending on 31 March nearest to that balance date. Section 38 deems 30 September in any year to be nearer to the last preceding 31 March than to the next succeeding 31 March. Section 38 states: (1) Instead of furnishing a return in accordance with section 33 for any year ending with 31 March, any taxpayer may, with the consent of the Commissioner, elect to furnish a return for the year ending with the date of the annual balance of the person’s accounts, and in any such case the income derived during that year shall for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 be deemed to have been derived during the year ending with the 31 March nearest to that date. (2) For the purposes of this section and section 39, 30 September in any year shall be deemed to be nearer to the last preceding 31 March than to the next succeeding 31 March. ... Under section 39(1), when there is a change of balance date the taxpayer must file a transitional tax return. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Example 2 A 31 March balance date is to change to a 31 De- cember balance date. Assuming that the change is to take place in the 1995-96 income year, the transitional return will cover the period 1 April 1995 until 31 December 1995. The return for the 1996-97 income year will be from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 1996. Section 39(2) deems all tax returns made in accordance with sections 38 and 39 to be returns of income derived during the year ending on the 31 March which is nearest to the new return date. It also provides that, for assessment purposes, the income derived by the tax- payer during that period must be added to any other income derived for the same year and be included in the tax return for that year. This is to avoid a situation where there are two tax returns for one year or no return for a particular year. Example 3 A taxpayer changes from a standard balance date to a 31 July balance date in the 1996 year: 1/4/95 - 31/3/96: Standard 1995-96 income year 1/4/96 - 31/7/96: Four-month period within the 1995-96 income year 1/8/96 - 31/7/97: 1996-97 income year. If the income derived during the period 1 April 1996 - 31 July 1996 was not added to the income derived in the period 1 April 1995 - 31 March 1996, there would be two returns for the 1995-96 income year. There is therefore a return for the 16-month period from 1 April 1995 to 31 July 1996. Returns for less than 6 months or more than 18 months Most returns will be for a period of more than 6 months and less than 18 months. However, in a few special circumstances returns are required for a period of less than 6 months or more than 18 months. Returns for a period longer than 18 months only occur when there is a change from an early balance date to a late balance date. Returns for a period shorter than 6 months only occur when there is a change from a late balance date to an early balance date. Note that changes from or to the standard balance date do not produce returns for less than 6 months or more than 18 months. Example 4 In 1995 a taxpayer changes from a balance date of 30 September to a balance date of 30 November for the 1995 income year: 1/10/94 - 30/9/951994-95 income year 1/10/95 - 30/11/95Two-month period within the 1995-96 income year 1/12/95 - 30/11/961996-97 income year. In this case it is not possible to include the income derived during the two-month period in the 1995-96 income year with other income derived in the same income year, because there is no other income derived during the 1995-96 income year. The taxpayer must file a two-month return. Example 5 In 1995 a taxpayer changes from a 30 November balance date to a balance date of 31 July for the 1996-97 income year: 1/12/94 - 30/11/951995-96 income year 1/12/95 - 31/7/96Eight-month period within the 1995-96 income year 1/8/96 - 31/7/971996-97 income year. The legislation requires the taxpayer to add the income derived during the transitional period to other income derived in the same income year. Therefore, the taxpayer must add the income derived in the eight-month period from 1 December 1995 to 31 July 1996 to the income derived in the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 giving a return for a 20-month period. Adjustments when return is for a period of more or less than a year Some adjustments may be necessary when the return is for other than a 12-month period. Under section KB 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994, when there is a change of balance date and the taxpayer is assessed for income tax for a period of less than a year, any rebates allowable under sections KC 1 to KC 4 are proportionately reduced. Similarly, when the taxpayer is assessed for a period of more than a year, the total of such rebates is proportionately increased. Similar provisions relate to tax rates (in section IB 4 ) and provisional tax (in section 119(2) of the Tax Administration Act.). Balance date change - effective date The Commissioner’s policy is not to allow a taxpayer to carry back a known income or loss into a prior income year. This would occur when the taxpayer applies for a new balance date after the anniversary of the old balance date, and requests the new balance date to be effective from the previous income year. For the same reason, the Commissioner will not permit a change to a balance date which has already passed before the date of application. The Commissioner’s policy on the granting of non-standard balance dates remains that stated in Appendix B of TIB Volume Five, No.11 (April 1994). Subject to these requirements, the Commissioner will permit a change in balance date to take effect in the income year of the request, if this would mean that it is possible to file returns for all the income years. If there would otherwise be a missing return, the change will take effect in the income year following the request. continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Example 7 GG Ltd has a 31 March balance date. The company has changed from being an organic strawberry grower to running a childcare centre. It would like to adopt the industry standard date for childcare centres of 31 December. On 20 March 1995 it applied to change its balance date. The new date of 31 December is after 30 September in the current accounting year which is the period from 1 April 1994 to 31 March 1995. The answer to the first question is “yes”. The answer to the second question (Is the application date of 20 March 1995 after the new date of 31 December in the current accounting year period from 1 April 1994 to 30 March 1995?) is also “yes”. The change of balance date will have to take effect in the income year which immediately succeeds the income year in which the application was made. If the company was permitted to extend its year which began 1 April 1994 to 31 December 1995, there would be no return for the 1994-95 income year. The correct treatment is to file tax returns as follows: 1/4/94 - 31/3/951994-95 income year 1/4/95 - 31/12/95Nine-month period within the 1995-96 income year 1/1/96 - 31/12/961996 -97 income year. If the Commissioner had permitted the company to extend its return for the period 1 April 1994 to 31 December 1995, this would have given a return for the 1995-96 income year, but there would have been no return for the 1994-95 income year. Example 8 The facts are as in Example 7, except that the company makes the request on 20 April 1995. The 1994-95 income year ended on 31 March 1995, so the request made on 20 April 1995 is made during the 1995-96 income year. The new balance date of 31 December falls after 30 September in the current accounting year which is the period from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1996. Therefore, the answer to the first question is “yes”. The application date of 20 April 1995 does not fall after the new balance date in the current accounting year period from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1996, so the answer to the second question is “no”. Therefore, it is possible to make the change in the income year in which the application is made. The company may file a return for the period 1 April 1995 to 31 December 1995 which is the return for the 1995-96 income year. There is no missing return. 1/4/94 - 31/3/951994-95 income year 1/4/95 - 31/12/951995-96 income year After this, returns are filed to 31 December in the normal way. Therefore, the taxpayer must: • file the tax returns in the normal way for any old balance dates that have passed; and • file the tax return for the following year to the new balance date, provided the new date is not before the date of application. Applying the legislation and the Commissioner’s policy, if a taxpayer requests a new balance date and the Commissioner consents to the request, the taxpayer will be permitted to change to the new balance date in the current year, unless the answer to both of the following questions is “yes”: • Does the new date fall after 30 September in the current accounting year? (The current accounting year is the period from the beginning of the current accounting year until the end of the current account- ing year, assuming that there was no change of balance date.) • Is the application date after the proposed new date in the current accounting year? If the answer to both of these questions is “yes”, the taxpayer will have to change to the new balance date in the income year which immediately follows the income year in which he or she made the application. There is a flowchart showing this procedure at the end of this item. In the examples shown below when the taxpayers have existing 31 March balance dates, the current accounting year corresponds to the income year as both run from 1 April to 31 March of the succeeding calendar year. Example 6 HB Co Ltd, which breeds horses, has decided that it would like to change from a 31 March balance date to the industry standard balance date for horse breeders of 31 July. It makes its request on 20 March 1996 which is in the 1995-96 income year. The Commissioner grants the request. The current accounting year is from 1 April 1995 to 31 March 1996. As the new date of 31 July is not after the date of 30 September in the current accounting year, the company may change to the new balance date in the 1995-96 income year in which the application is made. For the 1995-96 income year, HB Co Ltd files a return from 1 April 1995 to 31 July 1996. In this case there was no need to consider the second question as to whether the application was after the new date in the current accounting year, because we had already answered “no” to the first question. It is only if the answer to both questions is “yes” that the change will have to take place in the next income year. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Approval for a subsequent income year No difficulty exists if the taxpayer requests a change in balance date for a subsequent year when the person would otherwise be entitled to change in the current year. However, in most cases taxpayers wish to make the change as soon as they can. The flowchart shows the year in which a change will take effect. Assume that the taxpayer requests a change of balance date and the Commissioner agrees to the request. Also assume that: • The “current accounting year” is the period from the beginning of the current year to what would be the end of the current year if there were no balance date change. • The “new date” is the day and month of the new balance date. Note that this does not include the year. • The “application date” is the date on which the applicant sent in the application to the Commissioner for the change of balance date. FBT and work related vehicles - Court decision in Rag Doll Fashions case The High Court judgment in Rag Doll Fashions (NZ) Ltd v CIR rejected the Commissioner’s appeal against a TRA decision which included a finding that a hatch- back car; with rear seat folded down and covered by a plywood “floor” which extended to the rear of the vehicle, had been sufficiently altered to satisfy the design element of the work related vehicle test (section OB 1 Income Tax Act 1994). The Commissioner originally appealed this judgment but subsequently withdrew the appeal for reasons peculiar to this case. The withdrawal of the appeal is not to be taken as an acceptance by Inland Revenue that design alterations of such (temporary) nature generally are sufficient to satisfy the work related vehicle test. Conclusion Inland Revenue’s policy regarding work related vehicles remains unchanged. Our view is that alterations to the design of a motorcar must be permanent in nature in order to satisfy the work related vehicle test. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Marquees - draft depreciation determination Currently, the three following general depreciation asset classes may initially appear to apply to marquees: • Leisure: “Marquees” 12.5 years, 15% DV, 10% SL. • Leisure: “Tents” 5 years, 33% DV, 24% SL. • Hire Equipment: “Party hire equipment” 4 years, 40% DV, 30% SL. The Commissioner considers that the asset class and rate which currently applies for all marquees, including marquees which are hired out, is “Marquees” under the “Leisure” industry category. The asset class “Tents” under the “Leisure” industry category, and the asset class “Party hire equipment” under the “Hire Equip- ment” asset category do not apply to marquees. The “marquee” asset class is identified as the applicable asset class by applying the instructions for “Finding the right rate” on page 24 of the Depreciation Guide (IR 260) April 1994. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination which will: • Delete the existing asset class “Marquees” and general depreciation rate of 15% DV and 10% SL from the “Leisure” industry category. • Insert a new asset class “Marquees (Canvas, including frames & poles)” with a general depreciation rate of 22% DV and 15.5% SL into the “Leisure” industry category and the “Hire Equipment” asset category. • Insert a new asset class “Marquees (PVC, including frames & poles)” with a general depreciation rate of 26% DV and 18% SL into the “Leisure” industry category and the “Hire Equipment” asset category. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives set out in the draft determination below and residual values of 13.5% of cost. Exposure draft - General Depreciation Determination DEPX This determination may be cited as “Determination DEPX: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number X”. 1.

Lawnmowers - depreciation Previously there were three general depreciation rates for various types of mowers as follows: • Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture: “Mowers (gang and PTO type)” 12.5 years, 15% DV, 10% SL. • Contractors, Builders and Quarrying: “Mowers (domestic type)” 5 years, 33% DV, 24% SL. • Residential Rental Property Chattels: “Lawn mowers” 4 years, 40% DV, 30% SL. The Commissioner has issued a general depreciation determination which sets two new depreciation rates and deletes one depreciation rate. The determination sets a new depreciation rate of 63.5% diminishing value (DV) for domestic type lawnmowers used by lawnmowing contractors. In addition, it sets a depreciation rate of 33% DV for non-domestic type lawnmowers used by lawnmowing contractors. These two new depreciation rates have both been added to the Agriculture, Horticulture & Aquaculture industry category and the Contractors, Builders and Quarrying industry category. The determination deletes the depreciation rate of 33% DV for domestic type mowers. The determination is reproduced below. The new depreciation rate for “Lawnmowers (domestic type in use by lawnmowing contractors)” of 63.5% DV is based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of two years and a residual value of 13.5% of cost. Two years reflects the EUL for a domestic type of lawnmower used com- mercially by a lawnmowing contractor. The depreciation rate for gang and PTO (power take off) type mowers and the depreciation rate for lawnmowers used at residential rental properties, of 15% DV and 40% DV respectively, remains unchanged.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Chemists - prescription amounts due from the Department of Health The amount chemists will be asked to bring into account for income tax purposes for prescriptions outstanding from the Health Benefits Centre for the year starting 1 April 1995, or equivalent balance date, is unchanged from the 1994 year at $20.79. Chemists have the choice of using this figure or using the actual value of pre- scriptions owing at 31 March, or equivalent balance date. 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Valuation of low-priced land Section CD 1 (9) (section 67(4)(f), Income Tax Act 1976) - Profits for gains from land transactions: A tax practitioner’s client is involved in a land sale under section CD 1 (2)(g). The taxpayer acquired the land in 1955 at a very low price. The practitioner has noted that it would be unfair if the profit on the sale of the land was calculated using that 1955 cost price, as the development work did not start until 1992. She has asked what land value she should use to produce a realistic tax profit. Section CD 1 (9) states: For the purposes of paragraph (g) of subsection (2) the Commissioner may ascertain the value of any land at the date of the commencement of any undertaking or scheme referred to in that paragraph in such manner as the Commissioner thinks fit. Under section CD 1 (2)(g): All profits or gains, not being profits or gains which are included in the assessable income under any of paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f), derived from the sale or other disposition of any land to the extent that those profits or gains are derived from the carrying on or the carrying out of any undertaking or scheme, whether or not an adventure in the nature of trade or business, involving the development or division into lots of that land, and the Commissioner is satisfied that that development or division work (being work involving significant expenditure on earthworks, contouring, levelling, drainage, roading, kerbing, or channelling or on any other work, service, or amenity customarily undertaken or provided in major projects involving the development of land for industrial, commercial, or residential purposes) has been carried on or carried out by or on behalf of the taxpayer on or in relation to that land. This means that when income is assessable income under section CD 1 (2)(g), the Commissioner may value the land at the start of the undertaking or scheme. Inland Revenue will normally accept a valuation of the land by a registered valuer or other suitably qualified person, as at the date of starting the undertak- ing or scheme (in this case 1992). Under section CD 1 (8), the Commissioner may, when he considers it necessary for the purposes of section CD 1 (2)(a) to (f): • Determine the cost price of the land in any manner he thinks fit. • When land is acquired with any other real or personal property, apportion the cost price of that land and the other real or personal property as he thinks fit. Expenses incurred in establishing access track to farm property - deductibility Section DO 4 (section 127, Income Tax Act 1976) - Expenditure on land im- provements used for farming or agriculture: The entrance to a farm has been relocated, and the owner is constructing a new access track. He has asked about the deductibility of the costs incurred in putting in the access track. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Under section DO 4 (1) a taxpayer is entitled to claim a deduction, except in the year the taxpayer sells or otherwise disposes of the land, for expenditure of any of the kinds specified in Part A of Schedule 7. The amount of the deduction is limited by section DO 4 (3), and depends on when the expenditure is incurred. Under clause 6 of Part A of Schedule 7, the taxpayer is entitled to claim 5 percent of the diminished value of the expenditure incurred in the construction of access roads or tracks to or on the land. If the expenditure is incurred before the end of the 1995 income year, the taxpayer is entitled to a deduction each year, until the property is sold, of 125 percent of the rate specified in Part A of Schedule 7, i.e., 6.25 percent. If the expenditure is incurred in the taxpayer’s 1995-96 income year or in any subsequent year, he is entitled to a deduction each year, until the property is sold, of 120 percent of the rate specified in Part A of Schedule 7, i.e., 6 percent. Sale price of depreciable property when disposed of Section EG 19 (10)(b) (section 117(11)(d), Income Tax Act 1976) - Gain or loss from disposition of depreciable property: A taxpayer is selling off a number of her business assets on which she has been claiming depreciation. Under the terms of a sale contract drawn up by her agent, the assets will realise $140,000 in total, less legal fees of $1,500 and the agent’s commission of $3,500. The taxpayer has asked if she should deduct the fees and commission from the sale price of the individual assets. Section EG 19 applies to the disposal of depreciable property, except for the following types of property: • schedule depreciable property, (i.e., a petroleum drilling rig, a support vessel for an offshore petroleum drilling rig or production platform) • property accounted for using the pool method under section EG 11 (section 108J, Income Tax Act 1976) • intangible property, other than software, which is “excluded depreciable property” as defined in section OB 1 (section 107A, Income Tax Act 1976) • any land improvement which is excluded depreciable property of a type for which no depreciation allowance was allowed under section 108 as it applied before the 1993-94 income year. To establish whether there has been a gain or a loss from the disposal of deprec- iable property, a taxpayer must calculate the amount of the consideration de- rived from the disposal. This is then compared to the “adjusted tax value” (as defined in section OB 1 (sections 107A and 117(11)(b), Income Tax Act 1976) of the property at the date of disposition. The result will be one of the following: • assessable income, up to a maximum of the depreciation actually claimed - if the sale price was more than the adjusted tax value. • a deduction from assessable income (except when the property is a building) - if the sale price was less than the adjusted tax value. Under section EG 19 (10)(b): The consideration derived from any disposition of property shall be treated as the amount so derived less any amount payable by the taxpayer in disposing of the property (not being an amount otherwise deductible under this Act). The legal fees and agent’s commission fall into the category of “not being an amount otherwise deductible under this Act” because of section BB 8 (a) (section continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) 106(1)(a), Income Tax Act 1976), which denies a deduction for capital items “except as expressly provided in this Act”. The taxpayer should calculate the consideration of an individual asset by de- ducting from the sale price a sum that is: Individual sale price xAmount payable when disposing of the property Aggregate sale price Example If this taxpayer sold one asset for $23,500, the consideration derived from the disposal under section EG 19 (10)(b) would be: $23,500- ( $23,500 x $5,000 ) $140,000 =$23,500 - 839.29 =$22,660.71. Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 Journalists - income tax treatment Clause 1 of Part B of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979: A taxpayer is a professional freelance writer who produces articles for magazines, brochures, and a weekly newspaper. She has asked for clarification of the income tax treatment of journalists. Journalists who write for one paper or magazine are usually employees of that newspaper or magazine. However, in this case the taxpayer is a freelance writer producing articles for several publications. Freelance journalists are covered by the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. Under clause 1 of Part B of the Schedule to the Income Tax (Withholding Pay- ments) Regulations 1979, withholding tax at 25 cents in the dollar is deducted from: Fees or other remuneration for or in relation to contributions (including photographs, illustra- tions, and cartoons) by freelance journalists, writers, artists, or other regular or casual contribu- tors - (a) To newspapers, magazines, journals, pamphlets, circulars, handbills, or other like publica- tions: (b) For radio, television, theatrical, or stage productions or presentations, or other like produc- tions or presentations. Under section BB 7 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 104, Income Tax Act 1976), a deduction is allowed for any expenditure or loss incurred in gaining or producing the assessable income of the journalist. However, regulation 7 of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 allows the Commissioner to make a determination of the amount of expenditure or loss incurred in the production of a withholding payment. Examples of the types of expenditure that can be claimed, are the costs of: • any work related travel • work related accommodation • discs, depreciation, and other costs if a computer is owned and used. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) In this case, the taxpayer will have withholding tax of 25 cents in the dollar deducted from her payments for articles and contributions, and will be able to claim a deduction for expenses she incurs in producing them. The author must include the gross income from the IR 13 Withholding Payment Deduction Certificate in box 12 of her IR 3 tax return. Any expenses incurred should be shown in box 25 of the return. A credit will be allowed for the amount of withholding tax that has been deducted. The author will also be liable for both provisional tax (depending on the amount of residual tax that is payable) and earner and employer ACC premiums on this income. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on FBT for employer’s contribution to “medicare” insurance Section 21(3) - Fringe benefit: A company’s accountant has advised that the company pays fringe benefit tax (FBT) on its contribution to “medicare” pay- ments for its employees. She has asked if the company must account for GST on the FBT value of the supply of the medicare, or whether the supply is exempt. Generally, under section 21(3), when a registered person provides or grants a fringe benefit to another person, and that other person is employed under a contract of service by the registered person, the fringe benefit is deemed to be a supply of goods and services made by the registered person in the course of that registered person’s taxable activity. However, section 21(3A)(a) provides that section 21(3) shall not apply to benefits that relate to goods or services that are exempt from GST under section 14. Section 14 deems that certain supplies are “exempt supplies” for GST purposes. Section 14(a) specifically exempts the supply of financial services. “Financial services” is defined in section 3(1) and includes at paragraph (i): The provision, or transfer of ownership, of a life insurance contract or the provision of re-insur- ance in respect of any such contract. Medical insurance is not included in the definition, and is therefore liable for GST. That means the fringe benefit provided in this case is not an exempt sup- ply, so GST must be calculated on the taxable value of the fringe benefit as shown on each quarterly FBT return. The Commissioner’s policy for valuing the benefit provided in this situation is the GST exclusive cost of the premiums paid by the employer. Whether or not the employer is registered for GST is irrelevant. This is because the benefit provided is the payment of the medicare premium. The word “premium” con- notes the GST exclusive amount. Student Loan Scheme Act 1992 Student loan deductions not made by employer Section 44 - Application of penalty clause in loan contract: A taxpayer took out a Student Loan to help pay her way through university. As she was in employ- ment, she completed an IR 12 with the correct tax deduction code of G ED and handed it to her employer so that deductions could be made from her wages for offsetting against her Student Loan. The employer failed to make the deduc- tions, which meant that no payments were offset against her loan. Interest has been charged on her loan account, and the taxpayer now wishes to know if the continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) interest can be remitted, on the grounds that it was through no fault of her own that the deductions were not made by the employer. Matters such as eligibility for loans under the scheme, credit limits, draw-down limits, or the general imposition of interest on loan balances are matters covered by the loan contract signed by a student borrower. By law, the Commissioner has no discretion to remit interest imposed, nor can he re-calculate interest on a Student Loan account if no payment has been received by Inland Revenue. On the assumption that the taxpayer’s earnings are over the repayment thresh- old of $13,884 for the year ending 31 March 1996, when Inland Revenue receives the taxpayer’s tax return we will make an assessment which will show the amount required to be repaid by 7 February 1997. In other words, although the employer failed to deduct the Student Loan repayment from the taxpayer’s wages, the taxpayer has until the following 7 February to make payment. If no repayments have been received by 7 February, a penalty of 2% per month will be charged on the total amount overdue until payment is made. The onus is on the taxpayer to ensure that the correct amount of tax is deducted from her wages. She now has the option of sending a payment direct to Inland Revenue, which will be credited for interest purposes at the date received. In this case, the employer did not in fact deduct any Student Loan repayment, so no credit can be given to the employee’s Student Loan account. Further, for failing to deduct the repayment deductions as requested by the employee (in using the G ED tax deduction code), the employer risks prosecution under section 77(1)(a). When an employer deducts Student Loan repayments from an employee’s wages and fails to pay them to Inland Revenue, the situation is treated differ- ently. Generally, the employee is given a credit for the amount as if it had been paid to Inland Revenue on time. The employer is liable to prosecution by Inland Revenue for failure to account for moneys held in trust. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We have given each case a rating as a reader guide to its potential importance. •••••Important decision ••••Interesting issues considered •••Application of existing law ••Routine •Limited interest We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Unexplained deposits - whether assessable as dividend income Rating:• Case:J P R Alexander V CIR Auckland M 696/92 Keywords:burden of proof, evidence Summary:In an oral judgment delivered by Justice Tompkins it was held that the onus of proof rests with Mr Alexander to show that any particular item has been wrongly included as income and that all the relevant assets and deposits were made in respect of the company. The assessments were amended to the extent of whether they were confirmed or not. Facts:The objector was the governing director of a private company. As a consequence of matrimonial property claims against him the company passed a minute authorising him to protect the company's assets from legal challenge. The com- pany provided a declaration of trust authorising him to move assets to various nominees. Due to several location moves the minute and the declaration of trust were lost, as were other company records. The company operated a service station and garage, but later sold these and became involved in scenic and charter flights. Decision:Justice Tompkins commented that if Mr Alexander received and retained money from the company, whether as trustee or otherwise, it would be treated as tax- able dividends. If he could prove he was holding the money in trust or if the money went back in some form to the company, then the assessments would have been incorrect. Justice Tompkins rejected Mr Alexander’s explanation that the accounts were wrong in respect of two aircraft that he claimed he purchased for the company. No evidence was called to confirm the purchases and the aircraft did not appear in the accounts as an asset. It was held that it was more likely that the aircraft were Mr Alexander's even if they were used by the company. continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) A number of deposits in Mr Alexander’s personal accounts which were assessed as dividend income to Mr Alexander were confirmed in the absence of any proper explanation or evidence that the amounts were repatriated to the com- pany. These deposits included interest payments, debts owing to the company, unexplained deposits, rental payments and interest on hire purchase. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. Out of Court settlement for damage to property - whether GST input tax deduction allowable Rating:• Case:TRA No 93/238 Keywords:taxable supply, input credit, settlement Summary:The objectors paid an amount to a partnership in full settlement of a damages claim for damage caused by the negligent escape of a fire. The Taxation Review Authority found that there was no supply of any good or service from the part- nership to the objectors. The objectors’ claim for a GST input tax was therefore disallowed. Facts:The objectors are farmers registered for GST. In 1990 they lit a fire on their farm in order to burn off stubble which remains after harvesting. The fire spread to the adjoining farm and caused damage to farm machinery that was owned by a partnership in the business of agricultural contracting. The partnership was undertaking contract work at the time for the neighbouring farm owner. The partnership issued proceedings for damages against the objector. However, after negotiations between the parties the dispute was settled by the objectors making a payment to the partnership. The High Court was advised that the dispute was settled and the claim was struck out. The objectors claimed a GST input credit on the payment. The Commissioner contended that there was no taxable supply made by the partners to the objec- tors so that there could be no input tax credit available. The partners, by not proceeding with their claim against the objectors, did not forego legal rights. Their legal right was to obtain financial compensation for damage, not the issu- ing of proceedings and obtaining a judgment which are simply steps in the legal mechanism. Decision:Judge Barber held that no input credit was available to the objectors on the sum paid to settle a claim against them for damages caused by the negligent escape of their fire. Judge Barber rejected the objectors’ submission that the surrendering of a right to establish liability and secure a Court judgment against the objectors is the provision of a service. Judge Barber stated that all that physically passed between the objectors and the partners was the cheque, and in the abstract was the surrendering by the part- ners of their right to proceed with the claim. Judge Barber accepted the Commis- sioner's submission that the partnership has not foregone a legal right but achieved enforcement of its legal right to damages. There was no supply in return for the payment. Comment:We do not know whether the taxpayer will be appealing this decision. from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Average market values of specified livestock - 1996 Under section EL 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (the Act), the Governor-General has announced, by Order in Council, the national average market values of specified livestock for the 1995-96 income year. The values listed below apply to animals valued under the herd scheme. High-priced livestock The trigger price for high-priced livestock purchased in the 1995/96 income year is the greater of these two amounts: • $500 • Five times the greater of these two amounts: (a) the national average market values listed below; or (b) the national average market values declared for the 1994/95 income year. The trigger price for animals purchased during the 1995-96 income year is shown in the right hand column below. High-priced livestock cannot be valued under the herd scheme but must be capitalised and written off at an assigned percentage. The assigned percentages for the 1995-96 income year remain the same as the 1994-95 income year. They are shown in the table at the end of this item.

The rates for the 1995/96 income year are unchanged from last year. They are shown in the following table. LivestockStraight-Equivalent categoryline ratediminishing rate Sheep25%33% Cattle20%26% Stags20%26% Other deer15%22% Goats20%26% Pigs33%40% A taxpayer who wishes to apply the diminishing value rate to an animal must clearly use the diminishing value rate in the financial statements that support the tax return. Once a taxpayer makes this election it is irrevo- cable. If there is no such clear use of the diminishing value rate, the straight-line rate will apply. from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Inland Revenue to increase action on property speculation At Inland Revenue we are increasing our enforcement activity in the area of property speculation. A lot of people in the property market are only wanting to purchase residential housing for their own use. There are generally no tax consequences of this. However, some people are speculating in the market with a view to making a quick profit. Anyone speculating in the property market must consider their tax liability. Generally, anyone who acquires land with the purpose or intention of selling it will be liable for tax on the profits. The law is this area is very complex, and Inland Rev- enue’s initial research has highlighted the need for further education about when property sales are taxable. We will publish more information on this subject in the TIB and our other leaflets in the near future. In the meantime, we remind taxpayers that property transactions are easily identifiable, and we will be increasing our audit focus over the coming months. Anyone who has engaged in property speculation over the last 12 months should include the profits in their 1996 tax return, which is due on 7 July. We are not wishing to alarm any taxpayers unduly. To reiterate, buying residential property for personal use generally has no tax consequences. If you have any questions on this subject, please contact a tax advisor or your local Inland Revenue office. - From a press release issued by the Commissioner, 27/5/96 New Inland Revenue office in Panmure A new Inland Revenue Customer Service Centre has opened in Panmure, Auckland. It is located at: Esterman Building 18 Pilkington Road Panmure This new centre is part of Inland Revenue’s commitment to provide better services to our customers. It will make IRD services more readily available in east Auckland. The new centre is open from 9 am to 4.30 pm Monday to Friday. Fringe benefit tax - prescribed interest rate increased to 10.6% The prescribed interest rate used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low interest employment-related loans has been increased to 10.6% for the quarter beginning on 1 July 1996. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until it is further adjusted. The prescribed rate is up from 10.4% for the quarter that began on 1 April 1996. This increase reflects the recent rise in market rates. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Consolidated group election - correction to form IR 4EF Section FD 4 (section 191F, Income Tax Act 1976) - Date of formation of con- solidated group: A tax practitioner has read the notes that Inland Revenue provides for completing the IR 4EF form to elect to form a consolidated group of companies. On three occasions, Note 2 mentions 63 days as the time within which Inland Revenue must receive notification of an election. She has asked if the form should instead refer to “63 working days”. Note 2 on form IR 4EF concerns the application date following an election to form a consolidated group. It covers the following three situations: • General circumstances - section FD 4 (3) • When the companies are newly-incorporated during the same income year - section FD 4 (4) • When the companies elect to form a consolidated group during the income year of election - section FD 4 (5). In all three situations, at sub-paragraph (b)(i), the sections use the following words: Is received by the Commissioner within 63 working days after the ... Under section FD 4 (6), the Commissioner may extend the 63 working day period when the relevant company or companies satisfy him that: ...in all circumstances the notice of election could not reasonably be expected to be, or to have been, furnished within that period. “Working day” is defined in section OB 1 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976) as meaning any day of the week other than: (a) Saturday, Sunday, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, Labour Day, the Sovereign’s birthday, and Waitangi Day; and (b) A day in the period commencing on 25 December in any year and ending on 15 January (both dates inclusive) in the following year. The form should state “63 working days” and not “63 days”. It will be corrected at the time of its next reprint. Loss on investment - deductibility Section HE 1 (section 211, Income Tax Act 1976) - Unit trusts: A taxpayer and his wife invested a substantial sum as a retirement fund in a unit trust. Six months later they discovered that they had earned no income from the fund, and in fact were faced with a capital loss of $6,000. This led them to transfer their investment to another unit trust with the same company, that offered protection 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) against loss of capital. Now, they wish to sever connections with the company and invest the funds in a trading bank, but have been told that they will incur a $2,000 penalty deduction for premature withdrawal that will further reduce their capital. They have asked if each may claim a tax deduction on $4,000, i.e., 50% of the $8,000 total loss, in their next personal tax returns. Under section HE 1, for the purposes of the Act: • A unit trust is deemed to be a company. • Unit holders’ investments in the unit trust are deemed to be shares in the company. • The unit holders are deemed to be shareholders in the company. • Distributions are dividends, as the section CF 2 meaning of the term “divi- dends” includes within the definition at section CF 2 (1)(i) (section 4(1)(j), Income Tax Act 1976): All income of a unit trust distributed to a unit holder, and all other payments to and transac- tions with a unit holder in relation to the unit holder’s interest in the unit trust that would, if made to or with a shareholder in relation to shares in a company, be dividends under this Act. In this case, the taxpayers are considered to be shareholders who have incurred a loss from their shareholding. On page 32 of TIB Volume Four, No.5 (December 1992), an article covered the effects of two Court of Appeal decisions delivered on 19 November 1992 which clarified when taxpayers may deduct share losses. Briefly, the effect of the decisions in CIR v Inglis (1992) 14 NZTC 9,180 and CIR v Stockwell (1992) 14 NZTC 9,190 is that if taxpayers buy shares and would have been liable for tax on any profits or gains from selling the shares, any losses incurred on that sale are deductible. This principle applies only to people who trade in shares as a business, or who buy shares for the purpose of reselling them. It does not apply to people who typically invest spare money from time to time, hoping for dividends and some capital growth. The intentions of the taxpayers in this particular situation indicate that the two Court of Appeal decisions do not apply to them. Any losses arising from their investment in the unit trusts are not deductible. LAQC shareholder’s liability for tax deductions owing Section HG 8 (section 393H, Income Tax Act 1976) - Liability of electing share- holder for income tax of company: A shareholder of a loss attributing qualify- ing company (LAQC) has advised that the company has gone into liquidation. The LAQC has income tax and PAYE tax deduction obligations which it will be unable to meet. The shareholder has asked if she has any personal liability for the unpaid tax deductions. Under section HG 4 (1) (section 393D(1), Income Tax Act 1976): A company may only be a qualifying company where each shareholder in that company who is sui juris has by notice in writing to the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner may allow- ... (b) Elected to be personally liable in respect of each income year during which the election is at any time in effect for such percentage of- (i) Any income tax assessed as being payable in respect of that income year by that company under section BB 1;... continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Under section HG 14 (a) (section 393N(a), Income Tax Act 1976), to be an LAQC a company must be a qualifying company throughout the income year, so any liability under section HG 4 (1) applies to LAQC shareholders. Section BB 1 (2) states: Subject to this Act, income tax shall be payable by every person on all income derived by that person during the year for which the tax is payable. Under section HG 8 (1): Where any person elects in accordance with any of subsections (1), (2), and (3) of section HG 4 to be liable for a percentage of any income tax payable by a company then, while the Commissioner shall assess the company in the first instance,- (a) The Commissioner may assess that person, and...the person shall be assessable and liable as agent...for the company... Therefore, under section HG 8 the LAQC shareholder may be liable for income tax on income derived by the company. Her liability extends to the percentage of her effective interest in the company for the relevant income year. Under section HG 8 (2), the Commissioner can reduce her liability if she can satisfy him that a smaller percentage should apply. Under section NC 20 (1), the Income Tax Act and the Tax Administration Act apply to any employer, employee, or other person who is liable to account for or pay to the Commissioner under the PAYE rules as if the amount were income tax. As detailed above in section HG 4 (1)(b)(i), a shareholder elects to be liable for income tax assessed to a qualifying company under section BB 1 (section 38, Income Tax Act 1976), that is, on income derived by the company. The income on which the employees pay their income tax (by way of tax deduc- tions) is derived by them, rather than by the company. The qualifying company rules do not provide any personal exposure to the shareholder for unpaid PAYE etc. LAQC loss - when to claim Section HG 16 (2) (section 393P(2), Income Tax Act 1976) - Non-standard bal- ance dates: A taxpayer has an interest in a loss attributing qualifying company (LAQC) that has a 30 June balance date. However, the taxpayer must file his IR 3 tax return by 7 July. He has been advised by the company that his share of the loss will not have been calculated by that date. He has asked Inland Revenue when he should claim the loss. In a non-LAQC company, losses must be retained by the company and offset against income earned in later years. Losses cannot be used by the shareholders. An LAQC is a closely held company that is able to pass losses on to its share- holders. Shareholders are entitled to a share of the loss equal to their effective interest in the company. Normally, the shareholders are deemed to have incurred their share of the LAQC’s loss in the same income year as the loss is incurred by the company. The shareholders claim their share of the loss in their individual tax returns for that income year. Example 1 An LAQC and a shareholder both have a 31 March balance date. The share- holder has a 50% interest in the company which, in the 1995 income year, incurred a $10,000 loss. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) The shareholder is entitled to a share of the loss equal to her interest in the company. Therefore, she is entitled to a loss of $5,000. The shareholder will claim that loss in her 1995 IR 3 tax return, due to be filed by 7 July 1995. However, the taxpayer in this case has a 31 March balance date, whilst the LAQC has a 30 June balance date. The company has advised that it is unable to provide him with details of his share of its 1995 loss by 7 July when he is re- quired to file his tax return. This taxpayer has two options available to him. The first is to apply for an extension of time in which to file his tax return. Sec- tion 37(5) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 17(4), Income Tax Act 1976) allows the Commissioner to extend the time in which to file a tax return. Requests for an extension of time must be made in writing. The latest that the Commissioner can allow for an extension is 31 March of the year following the taxpayer’s balance date. Clients of tax practitioners usually receive an automatic extension of time. The second option is to return the loss in the following year’s tax return. This is allowed under section HG 16 (2) which states: Where, in respect of any company, any shareholder in that company, and any income year,- (a) Either the company, the shareholder, or both have a non-standard balance date for that income year; and (b) The company has a later balance date for the income year than the shareholder; and (c) By reason of the difference in balance dates it is not practicable for the shareholder to ascer- tain, within the time allowed in accordance with section 37 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 for the furnishing of the shareholder’s return of income for that income year, the amount of loss of the company attributable to the shareholder under this section in respect of that income year; and (d) The shareholder elects that this subsection shall apply by applying accordingly the provisions of this Act,- the amount of any loss of the company so attributable to the shareholder in respect of that income year shall, notwithstanding section 38 of the Tax Administration Act 1994, be treated for the purposes of this Act as if it were incurred by the shareholder on the first day of the immediately succeeding income year of the shareholder. This means that the shareholder can choose to return his share of the company’s 1995 LAQC loss in his 1996 tax return. No formal application or approval of the Commissioner is required. Example 2 A shareholder with a 31 March balance date is entitled to a share of the 1995 income year loss incurred by an LAQC which has a 30 June balance date. The shareholder prepares his own tax return and does not wish to apply for an extension of time. His tax return is due to be filed by 7 July 1995. The shareholder has been advised by the directors of the company that the company accounts will not be completed until mid-August: far too late for the shareholder to include his share of the loss in his 1995 tax return. The share- holder decides that, in accordance with section HG 16 (2), he will include the loss in his 1996 tax return, which is due to be filed by 7 July 1996. No formal application is required by the shareholder. Dividend imputation credit subject to surcharge Section JB 3 (section 336D, Income Tax Act 1976) - Determination of other income: A New Zealand superannuitant has received a cash dividend from two of her shareholdings. One of the paying companies has attached imputation continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) credits to its dividends, the other has not. The superannuitant has asked why she has to pay New Zealand superannuitant surcharge on the imputation cred- its. New Zealand superannuitant surcharge is calculated on the basis of a superan- nuitant’s other income that exceeds a certain exemption. “Other income” for surcharge purposes is defined in section JB 3. It is generally the superannuitant’s taxable income, together with one-half of any New Zealand pension or annuity that has been received from a registered scheme (e.g., Government Superannua- tion). Under section CF 6 (1) (section 4B(1), Income Tax Act 1976), the amount of income derived by a person who receives a dividend is the amount of the divi- dend including any imputation credits and/or withholding tax deductions. Therefore, as both the dividend received and the imputation credit attached are included in the shareholder’s taxable income, for surcharge purposes the other income will also increase, resulting in more surcharge being payable. However, the shareholder is allowed a credit against his or her income tax liability for the amount of the attached imputation credit. This is similar to PAYE, in that both the income received and the PAYE deducted are assessable as gross income, with the PAYE being allowed as a tax credit against the tax liability. Even though more surcharge is payable, a superannuitant will in fact be better off under the imputation regime. For example, before the imputation regime, a superannuant’s dividend would have been treated as follows: Company profit$149.00 less company tax at 33% $ 49.00$100.00 Cash dividend$100.00 less individual tax at 33%$ 33.00 less surcharge at 25% $ 25.00 Net tax liability$ 58.00 Cash dividend to superannuitant$100.00 less net tax liability $ 58.00 Net dividend $ 42.00 Under the imputation regime, that same profit is taxed as follows: Company profit$149.00 less company tax at 33% $ 49.00$100.00 Cash dividend$100.00 plus imputation credit$ 49.00 Gross dividend$149.00 less individual tax at 33%$ 49.00 less surcharge at 25% $ 37.25 $ 86.25 less imputation credit $ 49.00 Net tax liability $ 37.25 Cash dividend$100.00 less net tax liability $ 37.25 Net dividend $ 62.25 We told the superannuitant that the gross dividend is taxable, and must be included when calculating any surcharge that may be payable. from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 United States sportsperson’s income earned in New Zealand Clause 4(b) of Part B of the Schedule to the Regulations - Specified payments to non-resident entertainers: A New Zealand sports club is giving a four-month trial to an American player who is a United States resident. A representative of the club has asked if payments made to the player are subject to New Zealand income tax. Under section BB 3 (b) of the Income Tax Act 1994, all income derived from New Zealand is assessable for income tax, regardless of whether the person deriving the income is a New Zealand resident. Under clause 4(b) of Part B of the Sched- ule to the Regulations, specified payments to non-resident entertainers are subject to a tax deduction of 20 cents in the $1. Briefly, a “specified payment” is defined in regulation 2(1) as a payment of any kind made to a non-resident entertainer for services rendered in connection with a “specified activity”. “Specified activity” includes any activity or performance by a non-resident entertainer in connection with any sporting event. A “non- resident entertainer”, also defined in regulation 2(1), is a person who is not deemed to be resident under the Income Tax Act 1994 and who, while visiting New Zealand, performs or participates in a specified activity. Under regulation 4(2)(a), the American player will not be subject to the with- holding payment rules if he is paid a salary, wage, or extra emolument: in that event the PAYE rules will apply. In any event, the Regulations and the Income Tax Act 1994 may be modified by any applicable double taxation agreement (DTA). Whilst all New Zealand’s DTAs give New Zealand the right to tax income derived by non-resident enter- tainers in New Zealand, specific conditions apply to the DTA with the United States. Under Article 17 of the New Zealand/United States DTA, New Zealand is precluded from taxing an artiste or athlete whose gross receipts derived from personal activities do not exceed US$10,000 in an income year. It is often difficult to determine at the start of a visit if the US$10,000 threshold will be exceeded. Approval may be obtained from the Non-resident Entertainers Unit at Inland Revenue’s Auckland Office for withholding tax or PAYE not to be deducted, provided all of these conditions are met: • It can be conclusively determined that the person’s gross income, including expenses reimbursed or borne, will not exceed the threshold in an income year. • An undertaking is given that the person will not earn further income from New Zealand during the remainder of the income year. • The required documentation is received at the Auckland Office before the due date for remitting the appropriate income tax deductions. When the above determination cannot be made and/or the undertaking given, Inland Revenue will not give approval for the appropriate deductions not to be made. Withholding tax or PAYE deductions must be made. If it is found at a later date that the sportsperson’s gross income has not exceeded US$10,000, a full refund of income tax deducted will be made upon the filing of a New Zea- land income tax return. 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 Organisation with income tax exemption - GST registration Section 51(1) - Liability to register: A newly formed trust has recently received income tax exemption status from Inland Revenue under section CB 4 (1)(c) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 61(25), Income Tax Act 1976). Its activities include raising funds in New Zealand and overseas to allow it to provide health services in developing countries. The trust’s main sources of income are from donations and grants from government agencies. Its Funds Manager has asked for details of calculating the total value of supplies, in order to establish whether the liability to register threshold figure of $30,000 has been exceeded. The organisation must register for GST if its turnover is expected to exceed $30,000 in any twelve-month period. That turnover will not include donations received in the form of “unconditional gifts”, because unconditional gifts made to non-profit bodies are not consideration for the supply of goods or services. “Unconditional gift” is defined in section 2(1) as: a payment voluntarily made to any non-profit body for the carrying on or carrying out of the purposes of that non-profit body and in respect of which no identifiable direct valuable benefit arises or may arise in the form of a supply of goods or services to the person making that pay- ment, or any other person where that person and that other person are associated persons; but does not include any payment made by the Crown or a public authority. This definition expressly excludes payments made by the Crown or a public authority, so the grants received from the government agencies cannot be re- garded as a donation. In fact, under section 5(6D), any payment in the nature of a grant or subsidy made on behalf of the Crown or by any public authority is deemed to be consideration for a supply of goods or services. We advised the Funds Manager that, in calculating the turnover of the trust, she should include the value of any grants received from the government agencies. If the trust charges for the services provided overseas, whether nominally or otherwise, these charges should also be included in the turnover figure, even though they would be zero-rated. Turnover would not include the donations the trust receives, nor any exempt supplies, such as any interest the trust is paid. If the value of the trust’s turnover exceeds, or is expected to exceed, $30,000 in any twelve-month period, the trust must register for GST. Tax Administration Act 1994 New Tax Act does not erase convictions under previous Act Section 227 - Transitional provisions and savings: A taxpayer was convicted of a first offence under the Income Tax Act 1976 and incurred a substantial fine. She has asked whether, if she commits a similar offence under the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994, the earlier offence will be taken into account, or whether her record is effectively wiped clean following the passing of the 1994 Act. Sections 186 to 214 contain details of offences against the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Income Tax Act 1994, and section 115 of the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992. Sections 221 to 223 contain the penalties for these offences. In many instances the maximum penalty that may be im- posed is increased when a person is convicted of the offence on a second or subsequent occasion. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Under section 227(1), the continuity of the operation of the law relating to taxes imposed under the legislation repealed by section YB 3 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (as detailed in Schedule 21 of that Act) is not affected by the coming into force of the following Acts: • The Tax Administration Act 1994 • The Income Tax Act 1994 • The Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. Section 227(6) of the Tax Administration Act 1994 states: For the purpose of determining the punishment which may be imposed on a person in respect of the commission of an offence under a provision of this Act, an offence committed by that person under a corresponding repealed enactment is deemed to have been committed under that provi- sion. Although the Income Tax Act 1976 is included as a repealed enactment in Sched- ule 21, section 227(6) treats an offence committed under a section of the Income Tax Act 1976 as an offence committed under the Tax Administration Act 1994. We therefore told the taxpayer that the first offence she committed under the Income Tax Act 1976 would be taken into account when considering the level of punishment applicable to any subsequent similar offence committed under the Tax Administration Act 1994. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Accrual rules - statutory interpretation of section 64BA(1)(c)(i) of the Income Tax Act 1976 Case:Lyttelton Port Company Limited v CIR, HC Christchurch AP130/94 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - ss 64B(1)(c)(i) & (ii), 104 , 106(1)(l) & 108 Keywords:Accruals rules, deductibility of redundancy payments and demolition expenses Summary:The High Court found that the objector was not entitled to a deduction for a “deemed” interest component or losses associated with the disposal of certain buildings. However, the objector was entitled to deduct costs associated with the disposal of those buildings and also the costs of repaying a loan to cover redun- dancy payments. Facts:On 1 October 1988 the Port Company, a statutorily established body, took pos- session of assets previously owned by the Lyttelton Harbour Board and began operating the port. However, the Minister’s approval for the transfer had not been received at this stage and actual transfer of the assets occurred at a later date. The Minister retrospectively deemed the transfer to have occurred on 1 October 1988. The objector claimed a deduction for the alleged “deemed” interest component with respect to the deferred property settlement. The Com- missioner disallowed this claim. The Port Company set up a trust which borrowed money to pay redundancy to waterside workers. These borrowings were to be met by a levy charged to all port users. On 1 October 1990 the Port Company repaid $845,000 on the loan and the levy ceased. The Port Company treated this payment as a revenue payment, and claimed a deduction. The Commissioner rejected this claim. The Port Company also demolished buildings it owned, as it had no real use for them. It claimed the losses on demolishing and disposing of the building, and the demolition costs, as a deduction. The Commissioner disallowed these claims. Decision:Justice Hansen held that there was no “deferred settlement”. It was always intended that consideration would pass and possession be given on 1 October 1988; this had simply been delayed. Justice Hansen held that section 64BA(1)(c)(i) requires a subjective consideration of what is the lowest price the parties would have agreed to for the transfer of property on 1 October 1988. The fact that the parties had not specifically turned their minds to a deferral or settle- ment, or what the lowest price may have been for the purposes of the Income Tax Act did not matter. As section 64BA(1)(c)(i) applied there was no interest expense to spread under section 64F. Therefore the Commissioner was correct in disallowing the interest on the deferred property settlement. Justice Hansen found that section 64BA(1)(c)(ii) did not apply to the present fact situation. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Justice Hansen found that essentially the repayment of the $845,000 was an election by the Port Company to make a lump sum repayment of money bor- rowed for redundancy, as opposed to allowing it to be paid off by port levies. Justice Hansen found that there was no enduring benefit and therefore the payment was not of a capital nature. The fact that the payment improved the Company’s competitive advantage by eliminating the levy was incidental and did not change the essential character of the payment. Finally, Justice Hansen found that the word “disposal” in the proviso to section 106(1)(l) did not cover the act of demolishing a building. Therefore the proviso did not apply and the Commissioner was correct in disallowing the deduction for the losses on demolition of the buildings. Justice Hansen distinguished Mt Isa Mines Limited v SCT (1992) ACT 4755 and found that the Objector’s primary motivation in demolishing the buildings was that it would be dangerous to leave them sitting empty to deteriorate. The creation of a better asset, a greater area of uncluttered wharfage, was purely incidental. Thus the costs of demolition were a revenue item and were deductible. GST - subdivision of objectors’ home property Case:TRA No 94/8 and 93/147 Keywords:Subdivision of home property, taxable activity Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - sections 6, 8(1) and 51 Summary:The TRA found that the subdivision of the taxpayer’s home property amounted to a taxable activity. Facts:The objectors, a married couple, purchased a block of land in 1972 and con- structed a weekend cottage on Lot 3 in 1974. In 1985 they built a retirement home on Lot 4, selling Lot 3 to finance it. In 1987 they considered the property was no longer suitable for them because of the wife’s ill health. After an unsuc- cessful attempt to sell it in one piece they subdivided Lot 4 into five lots, of which four were vacant. The remainder contained the objectors’ dwelling. Subdi- vision work included preparing a scheme plan for subdivision, power supply installation, engineering work, legal work, road work, phone cable installation and substantial development work in relation to council requirements. The objectors ultimately sold the four lots and Inland Revenue made a determi- nation under section 51 of the GST Act that the objectors were required to regis- ter for GST. The gross proceeds of five sales were $813,000.00, before deducting subdivision expenditure of $63,353.57 and further sale expenses. Decision:The TRA considered there was extensive subdivisional and marketing activity. The nature of the subdivisional work did not differ markedly from that in the Newman case \[1995\] 17 NZTC 12,097 (CA), except for the addition of roading work and the increased number of sections. An application of the fact and de- gree test indicated that this was not a one off severance of a modest piece of land from a home property but a detailed subdivision resulting in one large section becoming five. When the activity was viewed as a whole, and assessing the circumstances of the particular case as a question of fact and degree, the TRA considered the subdivision was carried on continuously or regularly and amounted to a taxable activity. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) NZ Bill of Rights Act does not prevent charging of penal tax after a prosecution Case:TRA No. 93/224, 93/221, 93/223 Act:New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 - section 26(2) Income Tax Act 1976 - section 426 Keywords:New Zealand Bill of Rights, penal tax Summary:The TRA found that the taxpayer was not being punished twice for the same offence and could not rely on section 26(2) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act. Facts:Three cases were heard together. Each involved a claim by the objectors that, because he or she had already been convicted and fined in the District Court for filing false income tax and GST returns, the Commissioner could not subse- quently impose penal tax. They relied on section 26(2) of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act, which provides that no one who has been convicted of an offence shall be punished for it again. Decision:Judge Barber found in favour of the Commissioner. His reasoning was that penal tax is imposed for tax evasion. That is a separate and distinct offence from that of filing false returns, for which the objectors were convicted and fined. Accordingly, the objectors’ liability to be chargeable with penal tax is not af- fected by the Bill of Rights. In any event, section 426 of the Income Tax Act 1976 provides that assessment or recovery of penal tax is not barred by the taxpayer having been convicted under tax legislation of the same or any other offence. The provisions of the Bill of Rights do not affect this meaning. Management fees - deductibility Case:Lockwood Buildings Limited v CIR, HC Auckland M455/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 104, 106(1)(a) Keywords:Management fees, deductibility, capital or revenue expenditure Summary:Inland Revenue claimed that a portion of management fees paid by Lockwood Buildings Ltd (Lockwood) to its parent company were not deductible as they were capital in nature. The High Court rejected this claim. Facts:Lockwood employed its parent company, La Grouw Corporation Ltd (La Grouw), to take care of its management and strategic planning matters, and paid a fee to La Grouw for those management services. In this capacity, Lockwood paid La Grouw to investigate the possible acquisition of timber mills and State forests. La Grouw in turn employed a consultant to undertake this assignment. These investigations were undertaken to ensure that Lockwood would receive a steady supply of timber for its day to day business. Lockwood subsequently purchased a timber mill. La Grouw calculated the amount of fees payable to each of its subsidiaries on the basis of profits made by each subsidiary, rather than calculating the fee in rela- tion to services actually performed for that subsidiary. Inland Revenue claimed that Lockwood’s payment to La Grouw for investigation of the forestry industry was not deductible to Lockwood because it represented capital expenditure. Decision:The High Court found as a matter of fact that Lockwood did engage La Grouw to provide management services which Lockwood was unable to provide for itself. It was immaterial to Lockwood how the fee was made up and it was also 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) immaterial that the services were provided by Lockwood’s parent company. It is commonplace in business conglomerates for members of the same group to trade with one another and if the fee had been paid to a company outside the group the case would probably have never arisen. The fees were not capital in nature and were deductible. Property holding company - whether engaged in specified activity Case:TRA 94/43 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 188A(1) Keywords:Specified activity Summary:A property holding company was held to be engaged in a specified activity. Facts:The objector is an electrical engineering company which is part of a group of companies. In the years ended 31 March 1988 and 31 March 1989 it offset part of its assessable income against losses incurred by an associated property holding company, “S Limited.” The Commissioner reassessed the returns for these two financial years and restricted the loss offsets under section 188A(7) of the Income Tax Act 1976 on the grounds that “S Limited” was engaged in a “specified activity” as defined in section 188A(1). An objection by the taxpayer was disal- lowed and a case was stated to the Authority. Decision:The issue in this case was whether the property company was engaged in a “specified activity” as defined in s 188A(1) of the Income Tax Act 1976. The TRA stated that the words are to be given their ordinary meaning. The words “with a view” in the sentence “acquiring or holding of any land with a view to the derivation from the whole or a part thereof of any rents...” had their ordinary and natural meaning of “intention” or “purpose”. It was held that the property company was engaged in a “specified activity” because it always intended to charge rent to the objector. Although the property company had other “views” in mind other than charging rents, when it acquired the property it was still engaged in a “specified activity”. Thus the Commissioner was correct in limiting the loss offsets of the objector from the property company under s 188A(7) of the Income Tax Act 1976. 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Seven, No.14 (June 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) GST and finance leases - classification, method of accounting and treatment of residual value clause Summary This item considers the following issues: • classifying a finance lease as an “agreement to hire”, “hire purchase agreement” or otherwise • classifying a finance lease as a “credit contract” • the methods available for accounting for GST over the term of a finance lease which is an agreement to hire, and a credit contract • the GST treatment of a finance lease containing a “residual value” clause. Classification For GST purposes it is necessary to classify correctly agreements involving the hire, lease, or bailment of goods. The classification of an agreement as a “hire purchase agreement”, an “agreement to hire” or as being outside those definitions, affects the GST treat- ment of the agreement. The term “finance lease” is not a legal term. Agreements described as “finance leases” may come within any one of these classes of agreement. A finance lease may also be a credit contract. This means special rules apply for determining the value of the supply made under the lease. Classifying a particular agreement requires a careful analysis of the written documentation and, in some cases, the factual context (including such things as other written and verbal arrangements between the parties which affect the terms of the written documentation). However, this does not involve substituting the legal arrangements for an assessment of the overall economic consequences of the transaction. The same GST classifi- cation of a finance lease applies to both parties to the agreement. Many finance leases are specified leases for income tax purposes. There is no equivalent express treatment of finance leases for GST purposes. Method of accounting Lessors may account for GST over the term of a finance lease that is an agreement to hire on an actuarial basis, a “Rule of 78” basis (in certain situations), or a straight- line basis. To reduce compliance costs, lessors may adopt a straight-line basis in order to spread GST evenly over the term of the lease. Lessors must return output tax on the basis set out in the tax invoice. GST regis- tered lessees, who acquire leased goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies, must, if claiming an input tax deduction, do so on the same basis adopted by the lessor, being as set out in the tax invoice. Residual value clause Some finance leases contain residual value clauses and are also agreements to hire. In these cases the residual value is treated as including GST. The GST payable over the term of the lease spreads over the lease rentals and any payment made under the residual value clause. When a finance lease is also a credit contract, the GST payable on the lease will be 1/9th of the GST inclusive cash price. That amount spreads over the lease rentals and any payment under the residual value clause. Payments made at the termination of a finance lease under a residual value clause may require the issuing of a credit note under section 25. This policy applies prospectively from 1 September 1996. All legislative references in this item are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, unless otherwise stated. Background The term “finance lease” is not a legal term. It is a commercial term describing a lease of an asset (the “goods”) for a fixed term when the lease rentals, and any other payments by the lessee to the lessor under the lease (such as a deposit or residual value payment), relate to the value of the leased goods and not the value of their use. Under a finance lease, the total amount payable ensures that the lessor recovers the capital cost of the leased goods and makes a commercial return on that capital. Finance leases are usually also credit contracts (as defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981 - “the CCA”), because the total amount payable under the lease exceeds the “cash price” of the leased goods. Some finance leases contain residual value clauses. Residual value clauses effectively require the lessee to “guarantee” to the lessor that the leased goods will have a certain value at the end of the lease. Residual value clauses usually oblige the lessor to sell the leased goods upon their return. When the sale proceeds are less than the residual value, the lessee pays the shortfall to the lessor. Depending on the terms of the lease, when the sale proceeds exceed the residual value, the lessor may have to pay the excess to the lessee. In the event that the lessee does not return the leased goods, finance leases usually provide that the lessee must pay the full residual value. Common examples of goods leased under finance leases are motor vehicles and office equipment. The terms and conditions of a finance lease will vary from lease to lease. The terms and conditions of particular finance leases may be varied by the parties. Legislation Section 8(1) imposes GST on the supply (other than an exempt supply) in New Zealand of goods and services by a registered person in the course or furtherance of a taxable activity carried on by that person. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) the purposes of this Act as a single agreement made at the time when the last of those agreements was made. Section 10 determines the value of any supply. Section 10(2) states the general rule - that the value of a supply is the GST exclusive consideration paid for it. Section 10(5) provides an exception to the general rule for supplies made under any credit contract. It states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (2) of this section, where any supply of goods and services is made pursuant to any credit contract (as defined in the Credit Contracts Act 1981), the consideration in money for the supply shall be deemed to be the cash price (as defined in the Credit Con- tracts Act 1981) in relation to that supply. Section 3 of the CCA defines “credit contract”. Sections 3(a) and 3(b) provide a general definition covering all contracts that include credit and finance charge compo- nents. Section 3(e) expressly includes within the definition of a credit contract: A contract under which a person bails or agrees to bail goods (whether or not with an option to purchase) in consideration of a promise by another person to pay, or to procure the payment of, in the future and in respect of the bailment or option, a sum or sums of money exceeding in aggregate the cash price of the goods; Section 2 of the CCA defines “cash price” as: ...in relation to property sold or bailed or services provided under a contract, means- (a) The lowest price at which a person could have purchased that property or those services from the vendor, bailor, or provider thereof on the basis of payment in full at the time the contract was made; or (b) If there is no such price, the fair market value of that property or those services at the time the contract was made: Section 10(5) of the GST Act, together with sections 2 and 3 of the CCA, exclude from GST the interest and finance charges element of consideration paid for a supply made under a credit contract. GST is only payable on that part of the consideration equivalent to the “cash price”. Under section 3(1)(f) providing credit under a credit contract is a financial service. Section 14(a) exempts from GST the supply of any financial services. Section 24(3) sets out the particulars to include within a tax invoice. Section 24(3)(g) requires that a tax invoice includes either: (i) The total amount of the tax charged, the consideration, excluding tax, and the consideration, inclusive of tax for the supply; or (ii)Where the amount of tax charged is the tax fraction of the consideration, the consideration for the supply and a statement that it includes a charge in respect of the tax. Section 25 sets out the circumstances when credit notes and debit notes must be issued. Under section 25(1)(b), a credit or debit note is necessary when the previously agreed consideration for a supply has been altered, and the supplier has provided a tax invoice for that supply that, due to that alteration, now shows an incorrect amount of tax. Section 9 determines the time at which any supply takes place. Section 9(1) states the general rule - it deems a supply to take place at the earlier of the time the supplier issues an invoice or receives a payment for that supply. The remaining subsections of section 9 provide exceptions to this general rule. Section 9(3) states: Notwithstanding anything in subsection (1) or subsection (2) of this section,- (a) Where goods are supplied under an agreement to hire...they shall be deemed to be successively supplied for successive parts of the period of the agreement ... , and each of the successive supplies shall be deemed to take place when a payment becomes due or is received, whichever is the earlier: ... (b) Where goods and services are supplied under a hire purchase agreement (as defined in the Hire Purchase Act 1971), that supply shall be deemed to take place at the time the agreement is entered into: (c) For the purposes of this subsection, the term “agreement to hire” means an agreement for the bailment of goods for hire and includes a lease of goods and a rental agreement; but does not include- (i) An agreement under which the property in the goods passes to the bailee or which expressly contemplates that the property in the goods will pass to the bailee; or (ii) A hire purchase agreement (as defined in the Hire Purchase Act 1971). Section 2(1) defines “hire”, in relation to goods, as including a letting on any terms, including a lease. Section 2 of the Hire Purchase Act 1971 (“the HPA”) defines a hire purchase agreement in the following terms: ...an agreement whereby goods are let or hired with an option to purchase and an agreement for the purchase of goods by instalment payments (whether the agreement describes the payments as rent or hire or otherwise) under which the person who agrees to purchase the goods is given possession of them before the total amount payable has been paid; but does not include any agreement - (a) ...under which the property in the goods comprised in the agreement passes absolutely, to the person who agrees to purchase them, at the time of the agreement or upon or at any time before delivery of the goods; or (b) Made otherwise than at retail: ... (2) For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the circumstances in which a hire purchase agreement may be made at retail, it is hereby declared that for the purposes of this Act a hire purchase agreement shall be deemed to be made at retail if - (a) The transaction leading to the agreement was arranged by a dealer or on his behalf; and (b) The agreement would have been made at retail if the dealer had been the vendor. (3) Where, by virtue of two or more agreements, none of which by itself constitutes a hire purchase agreement, there is a transaction which is in substance or effect a hire purchase agreement, the agreements shall be treated for from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) Policy Classification Inland Revenue understands that taxpayers and their advisers have been experiencing problems in applying the GST legislation to finance leases. These difficulties are largely ones of classification. The parties to a hire, lease, or bailment agreement may classify the agreement differently for GST purposes. For GST registered lessors and lessees, this will result in a “mis-matching” of the return of output tax and the claiming of input tax deductions. For GST purposes an agreement has only one legal classification that determines its treatment under the Act for both parties to that agreement. Every finance lease arrangement will need to be consid- ered in the light of its own individual terms. For this reason the following views are necessarily general in nature. Time of supply To apply the time of supply rules under section 9 it is necessary to correctly classify agreements involving the hire, lease, or bailment of goods. These agreements will be one of the following: • an agreement to hire - in which case, section 9(3)(a) deems goods supplied under the agreement to be successively supplied. It deems each successive supply to take place at the earlier of when a payment be- comes due or is received. • a hire purchase agreement - in which case, section 9(3)(b) deems the time of supply to take place at the time the agreement is entered into. • neither a hire purchase agreement, nor an agreement to hire. In this case (subject to the application of any other “special” time of supply rule) section 9(1) deems the time of supply to take place at the earlier of the time the supplier issues an invoice or receives a payment for that supply. The classification of a lease agreement essentially depends on whether, and under what circumstances and at what time, ownership of the leased goods passes from the lessor to the lessee. Generally, finance leases are “agreements to hire”, as defined in section 9(3)(c). This is because property in the leased goods does not pass to the lessee and the lease agreement does not contemplate that property will pass to the lessee, absolutely or under any option to purchase. Many finance leases provide an express statement that property in the leased goods remains with the lessor, and that the lessee has no option to acquire property in the leased goods. An exception will be when the parties transact “at retail” and the lessor gives the lessee an option to purchase. Such a lease amounts to a hire purchase agreement, and section 9(3)(b) applies. An agreement is entered into “at retail” if it is made otherwise than at wholesale (essentially sales to persons who buy to sell again) or privately: Provident Life Assurance Co Ltd v Official Assignee \[1963\] NZLR 961, 965 (CA). A GST registered person entering into a leasing arrangement will do so “at retail” if the leased goods are for use in the registered person’s taxable activity, provided that the registered person is not leasing the goods for the purpose of resale or long-term hire: National Westminster Finance New Zealand Ltd v South Pacific Rent-a-Car Ltd \[1985\] 1 NZLR 646, 650 (HC); 655, 656 (CA). “At retail” is expressly defined as including any situation when a dealer assigns its interest in a leased asset to a finance company which then contracts directly with the purchaser: section 2(2) of the HPA. Section 9(3)(c)(i) - non-retail finance leases A finance lease that includes an option to purchase, entered into otherwise than at retail, is also an agree- ment to hire by virtue of section 9(3)(c)(i). Such finance leases do not expressly contemplate that the property in the leased goods will pass to the lessee. They only contemplate that property may pass under the option. Although the interpretation of section 9(3)(c)(i) is not free from doubt, the better view is that the words “expressly contemplate” must be read in the light of the words “will pass”. The requirement that property will pass necessitates a contractual obligation that property will definitely pass. This is consistent with case law that interprets “will” as requiring a certainty, rather than a contingency see: Rayfield v Hands \[1958\] 2 All ER 194; 196 and Lord Inglewood v IRC \[1983\] 1 WLR 366; 371. The contrary interpretation is that “will” must be read in the light of the words “expressly contemplate”. On this basis “will” has its meaning of having the ability or capacity for property to pass. This interpretation would exclude non-retail agreements with options to purchase from the definition of an agreement to hire; an option being an express contemplation of the possibility of property passing. However, the better view is that section 9(3)(c)(i) only applies to finance leases under which property will definitely pass. Residual value finance leases At the end of the term of a finance lease the lessee may retain possession of the leased goods. When this occurs finance leases may provide that the lessee must pay the residual value to the lessor. In such circumstances, the parties then usually agree that ownership of the leased goods will pass to the lessee for a further nominal consideration, or for no consideration. In legal terms this sale is a separate contract from the finance lease. GST must be returned on the value of the consideration for the sale, if any. Provided that the parties to a finance lease do not agree before the termination of the lease that the lessee will retain possession of the leased goods at the end of the lease and that property in the leased goods will pass to the lessee, or that a lessee has an option to purchase (if the finance lease is made at retail), the finance lease is still an agreement to hire. Such a finance lease is not a hire purchase agreement because it does not include an option to purchase: section 9(3)(c)(ii). Nor is there any express contemplation that property will pass: section continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) than other prospective purchasers, by virtue of the residual value aspects of the lease, did not give him a right to become the purchaser under its terms. Value of supply - credit contracts Generally, finance leases will be credit contracts. This is because the amount payable under the lease will exceed the cash price of the leased goods. When this is the case GST is only chargeable on the cash price component of the total consideration payable over the term of the lease. The CCA aims to protect consumers by making certain disclosure requirements mandatory. It requires a credit contract to specify the cash price and the finance and interest charges. The cash price is the lowest price, as at the time the lease is entered into, that a person could have purchased the leased goods from the lessor for full payment. In most cases it will be apparent from the face of the finance lease what is the cash price. The GST payable on the lease will be 1/9th of this amount. When there is doubt that this is the true cash price, reference should be made to the lowest price at which a person could have purchased the leased goods outright from the lessor at the time the lease was entered into. When there is no ascertainable price, the fair market value of the leased goods at the time the lease was entered into determines the cash price: paragraph (b) of the definition of “cash price” in the CCA. Specified leases Many finance leases are also specified leases for income tax purposes. Broadly, the specified lease rules reflect the economic effect of finance leases and deem the leased goods to have been sold by the lessor to the lessee. However, there is no equivalent express treat- ment of finance leases in terms of economic, rather than legal, effect in the GST Act. Summary The following table is a summary of the “time of supply” classification rules for hire, lease, or bailment agreements. It is a general guide only, as every agree- ment between a lessor and lessee will need to be closely considered in the light of its own individual terms: Terms of the agreementMade “at retail”Not “at retail” between the parties No option to purchase exercisable by theAgreement to hireAgreement to hire lessee nor any agreement that property(s 9(3)(a))(s 9(3)(a)) will pass at the end of the lease. Includes an option to purchaseHire purchase agreementAgreement to hire exercisable by the lessee.(s 9(3)(b))(s 9(3)(a)) Includes an agreement that propertyHire purchase agreementNot hire purchase agreement will pass at the end of the lease.(s 9(3)(b)); or not hire purchaseor agreement to hire: agreement or agreement to hire:ordinary time of supply rules ordinary time of supply rulesapply (s 9(1)) apply (s 9(1)) 9(3)(c)(i). Only when there is evidence that the parties agreed before the end of the lease term that property will pass in this manner, or the lessor has granted an option to purchase to the lessee (for retail finance leases), so as to make the lease a hire purchase agree- ment, will the finance lease be no longer classified as an agreement to hire. This approach is consistent with the characterisation of an agreement by reference to the true legal nature of the arrangement, rather than the broad substance or the overall economic consequences: Re Securitibank Ltd (No 2) \[1978\] 2 NZLR 136, 145 and 167 (CA); Marac Life Assurance Ltd v CIR (1986) 8 NZTC 5,086, 5,097. Further support for this conclusion is found in Credit Services Investments Limited v Quartel \[1970\] NZLR 933, 944 (CA). The issue there was whether a vehicle finance lease came within the definition of a “hire purchase agreement” for the purposes of the Hire Purchase and Credit Sales Stabilisation Regulations 1957. The definition was much wider than the present HPA definition, being: an agreement for the bailment of goods under which the bailee may buy the goods or under which the property in the goods will or may pass to the bailee, whether on the performance of any act by the parties to the agreement or any of them or in any other circumstances; and includes any agreement for the bailment of goods, with or without expressly giving to the bailee an option to buy the goods... The lease in question included a guaranteed residual value clause whereby on termination of the lease the lessor was required to sell the vehicle. The lessee had to meet any shortfall between the sale proceeds and the residual value. In the event that the sale proceeds exceeded the residual value, the lessee was entitled to the excess. Nothing in the lease indicated that the lessee could buy the vehicle, or that property in the vehicle would or might pass to him. The Court held that the lease was not a hire purchase agreement. It did not give the lessee any contractual right to purchase the leased vehicle. The mere fact that the lessee had been placed in a more favourable position from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) Method of accounting for GST Generally, finance leases will be “agreements to hire” and “credit contracts” for the purposes of the Act. Section 9(3)(a) deems goods supplied under an agreement to hire to be successively supplied, and each successive supply to take place at the earlier of when a payment becomes due or is received. When a finance lease is also a credit contract, section 10(5) deems GST to be payable only on that part of the consideration that is equivalent to the cash price. GST only applies to the non-interest and finance charge elements of the consideration, i.e. the principal component. The combined effect is that the GST payable under a finance lease that is an agreement to hire and a credit contract is 1/9th of the cash price of the leased goods, spread over the payments to be made over the term of the lease. The payments over the term of a finance lease will be either payments of principal, or payments of both principal and interest and/or other finance charges. Generally, finance leases provide for periodic rental payments payable over the term of the lease. Most finance leases also contain residual value clauses. (This item sets out below the GST treatment of payments under residual value clauses.) The amount of principal and interest and/or other finance charges comprised in each payment under a finance lease is usually determined actuarially. In some cases the Commissioner accepts the “Rule of 78” as an alternative to the actuarial method. In either case the amounts of principal and interest and/or other finance charges will be different for each payment. GST is only payable on the principal component of each payment. Therefore, for each payment a different amount of GST must be returned as output tax by the lessor, and is available to be claimed as an input tax deduction by the lessee. The following example illustrates the actuarial method: Example A finance company leases a photocopier to a company for use in its office. The term of the lease is three years. The cash price of the photocopier is $3,375, inclusive of GST of $375. The finance charges amount to $1,000. Lease payments are due quarterly. The finance company chooses an actuarial method for accounting for GST over the lease term. The payments schedule looks like this: Due dateRentalPrincipalInterestGSTTotal due 1/3/95333.33180.73 152.6022.59 355.92 1/6/95333.33191.08 142.2523.88 357.21 1/9/95333.33202.01 131.3225.25 358.58 ......... ...... ... 1/12/97 333.37 315.33 18.04 39.42 372.79 4,000.003,000.001,000.00375.004,375.00 The fact that the amount of GST varies from payment to payment may cause administrative difficulties for parties to finance leases. For example, it may be difficult to set up direct debit payment facilities. The use of an actuarial basis (or the “Rule of 78” method) may also result in lessees incorrectly claiming input tax deductions on the basis of 1/9th of each payment, rather than 1/9th of the principal component of each payment. To avoid these problems the Commissioner will in practice accept a straight-line method as an alternative to adopting an actuarial method (or the “Rule of 78” method) for returning GST. Under the straight-line method the GST payable under a finance lease spreads evenly over the rental payments. The same amount of GST must be returned, and is available to be claimed as an input tax deduction, on each rental payment. Adopting a straight-line method of account- ing, and using the same example as above, the payments schedule looks like this: Due DateRentalPrincipalInterestGSTTotal Due 1/3/95333.33180.73 152.6031.25 364.58 1/6/95333.33191.08 142.2531.25 364.58 1/9/95333.33202.01 131.3231.25 364.58 .................. 1/12/97 333.37 315.33 18.04 31.25 364.62 4,000.003,000.001,000.00375.004,375.00 Tax invoice For a finance lease that is an agreement to hire and a credit contract, GST is accounted for over the term of the lease on an actuarial basis, “Rule of 78” basis (in certain situations), or a straight-line basis. Under section 24(3)(g), the tax invoice or tax invoices for a finance lease must indicate what part of each payment made under the lease is attributable to GST. Lessors must return GST on the basis set out in the tax invoice. If GST registered lessees who acquire leased goods for the principal purpose of making taxable supplies are claiming an input tax deduction, they must do so on the basis set out in the tax invoice. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) If the leased goods are returned and sold (or valued), certain adjustments to the consideration paid by the lessee are usually required under the residual value clause of the finance lease. For GST purposes these adjustments may require the lessor to issue a credit note to reflect the fact that the consideration for the supply of the leased goods has been altered under section 25(1)(b) (see the example below). This treatment applies to all payments made under residual value clauses, regardless of whether a finance lease terminates at the end of its term, or earlier by agreement between the parties or due to the lessee’s default. Submission received We received a submission to the effect that, based on section 10(5), it is arguable that GST should be returned on the full “cash price” of the leased asset, regardless of whether or not any adjustments are made under the residual value clause. However, this approach does not take into account the subsequent alteration to the consideration for the supply of the leased goods under the finance lease through the operation of the residual value clause. The Commissioner considers that the better view is the one that takes into account such adjustments. This policy regarding the GST treatment of termination payments under residual value finance leases applies prospectively from 1 September 1996. Example An individual leases a motor vehicle from a GST registered motor vehicle finance company (“the lessor”). The lease is in the name of the individual’s company (“the lessee”), which is also GST regis- tered. The individual intends to use the car princi- pally for business purposes in his role as company director. The cash price of the vehicle is $45,000, including GST of $5,000. The lease is for a three-year term, with 36 equal monthly rental payments to be made. The finance charges over the term of the lease total $15,000. The lease provides that: • The vehicle remains the property of the lessor. • Upon termination of the lease the lessee must return the vehicle and pay the residual value of $18,000 (including GST of $2,000) less the net sale proceeds of the vehicle. If the vehicle sells for more than the residual value, the lessor must pay the excess to the lessee. • If the lessee does not return the vehicle to the lessor, the lessee must pay the full residual value. The lessor issues a tax invoice for the lease indicat- ing that GST is to be returned over the term of the lease on a straight-line basis. The table on page 7 summarises the financial terms of the lease. Note that nothing in this policy affects the position for lessors and lessees under sections FC 7 and FC 8 of the Income Tax Act 1994, which deal with the calculation of income and deductions under specified leases for income tax purposes. Hire purchase agreements Section 9(3)(b) deems the time of supply for goods and services supplied under a hire purchase agreement to take place at the time the agreement is entered into. Accordingly, all the GST charged on such a supply is attributable to the taxable period in which the time of supply occurs and no issues arise as to the correct accounting treatment for returning GST over the period of the hire purchase agreement. Agreements which are not agreements to hire or hire purchase agreements For hire, lease, or bailment agreements that are not agreements to hire or hire purchase agreements (subject to the application of any other “special” time of supply rule) the general time of supply rule applies. Under that rule the time of supply takes place at the earlier of the time the supplier issues an invoice or receives a pay- ment for that supply. As for hire purchase agreements, all the GST charged on such a supply is attributable to the taxable period in which the time of supply occurs and no issues arise as to the correct accounting treat- ment for returning GST over the period of the agree- ment. Residual value finance leases - GST treatment Generally, finance leases contain residual value clauses. Residual value clauses require the lessee to “guarantee” to the lessor that the leased goods will have a certain value at the end of the lease. The lessee fulfils the guarantee by returning the leased goods to the lessor. When the lessee returns the leased goods to the lessor, the terms of the lease usually require the lessor to realise the asset at market price. If the lessor is unable to do this, the lease often permits the lessor to retain the asset and value it. In either event, the lessee must make up any shortfall between the net sale proceeds (or valuation) and the residual value. In some cases, if the net sale proceeds (or the valuation) exceed the residual value, the lease requires the lessor to pay the excess to the lessee. Termination payments under residual value finance leases - GST treatment The residual value payments made on termination of a finance lease affect the total amount of GST payable under the finance lease. If the lessee retains the leased goods and pays the residual value (including GST), the full amount of GST payable on the finance lease (as determined by reference to the “cash price” at the start of the lease) is returned. However, this is not the position when the lessee returns the leased goods. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) The lease is an agreement to hire and a credit contract. It is not a hire purchase agreement because although it is made at retail, it does not include an option to purchase. It is a credit contract because the consideration payable over the term of the lease exceeds in aggregate the cash price, i.e. $45,000. GST treatment The following events give rise to the following GST treatments: (i) The lessee leases the vehicle for the full three- year term and returns the vehicle to the lessor at the end of the lease. The lessor sells the vehicle at auction for $15,000 (including GST). After deducting the auction expenses (excluding GST) the net sale proceeds are $14,000. The terms of the lease require the lessee to pay to the lessor the shortfall between the residual value and the net sale proceeds, i.e. $4,000. The GST treatment is: • The lessor issues a credit note to the lessee indicating that the correct amount of GST still to pay on the lease is $444.45 (1/9th of $4,000), not $2,000. • The lessee pays a further $4,000 to the lessor. • The lessee claims a $444.45 input tax deduction. • The lessor returns $444.45 output tax on the lease. • The lessor issues a tax invoice on the sale of the vehicle. • The lessor returns $1,666.67 output tax on the sale of the vehicle (1/9th of $15,000). Therefore, the lessee has an input tax deduction of $444.45. The lessor pays output tax of $2,111.12. The overall result is a further $1,666.67 output tax (1/9th of sale proceeds). (ii) The lessee leases the vehicle for the full three- year term and returns it to the lessor at the end of the lease. The lessor sells the vehicle through a private sale for $20,000 (including GST). After deducting the sale expenses (excluding GST) the net sale proceeds are $19,500. There is no shortfall between the residual value and the net sale proceeds, so the lessee is not required to pay anything further to the lessor. The terms of the lease require the lessor to pay to the lessee the difference between the net sale proceeds and the residual value. The GST treatment is: • The lessee pays nothing further to the lessor. • The lessor issues a tax invoice on the sale of the vehicle. • The lessor returns $2,222.22 output tax on the sale of the vehicle (1/9th of $20,000). • The lessor pays $1,500 to the lessee (the excess of the net sale proceeds over the residual value). This reflects a reduction to the consideration agreed for the lease. • The lessor issues a credit note indicating that the correct amount of GST to pay on the lease was $4,833.33 ($5,000 less 1/9th of $1,500). • The lessee returns output tax of $166.67. • The lessor claims an input tax deduction of $166.67. Therefore the lessee returns $166.67 output tax. The lessor pays output tax of $2,222.22 and claims an input tax deduction of $166.67. The overall result is a further $2,222.22 output tax, i.e. 1/9th of the proceeds of sale. Cash price (including GST):$45,000.00 Finance charges (exempt from GST):$15,000.00 Residual value (including GST):$18,000.00 GST payable on the lease:$5,000.00 i.e. 1/9th of the GST inclusive cash price GST payable on payment of the full residual value:$2,000.00 i.e. 1/9th of the full GST inclusive residual value GST payable over the term of the lease:$3,000.00 i.e. the difference between the two sums Total monthly rental payments (including GST):$42,000.00 i.e. the GST inclusive cash price and the finance charges less the residual value (including GST) Total monthly rental payments (excluding GST):$39,000.00 i.e. the GST exclusive cash price and the finance charges less the residual value (excluding GST) Monthly rental payment (excluding GST):$1,083.33 i.e. 1/36th of total monthly rental payments (excluding GST) GST payable on each monthly rental payment:$83.33 i.e. 1/36th of $3,000 being the GST payable over the term of the lease Monthly rental payment (including GST):$1,166.66 continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) • The lessor returns $2,000 output tax on the lease. Therefore, the lessee claims a further $2,000 input tax. The lessor pays a further $2,000 output tax. Upon termination of the lease, the lessee negoti- ates with the lessor to buy the vehicle. The lessor agrees to transfer title to the vehicle for a further $100 (including GST of $11.11) administration charge. Accordingly: • The lessor returns $11.11 output tax on the sale. • The lessee claims an input tax deduction of $11.11. Undersea maintenance equipment - draft depreciation determination The Commissioner proposes to issue a general depreciation determination which will insert a new industry category called “Undersea maintenance (when equipment used under salt water or on a maintenance barge on salt water)” into DEP1. The draft determination proposes to set 25 new asset classes, including a default asset class. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the estimated useful lives set out below and residual values of 13.5% of cost. Exposure draft - General Depreciation Determination DEPX This determination may be cited as “Determination DEPX: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number X”. 1. Application This determination applies to taxpayers who own the asset classes listed below. This determination applies to “depreciable property” other than “excluded depreciable property” for the 1996-97 and subsequent income years. 2. Determination Pursuant to section EG 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 I hereby amend Determination DEP1: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number 1 (as previously amended) by: •Inserting the industry category “Undersea maintenance (when equipment used under salt water or on a mainte- nance barge on salt water)” and the general asset classes, estimated useful lives, and diminishing value and straight-line depreciation rates listed below: Provisional tax use of money interest rates decreased The provisional tax use of money interest rates have been decreased. The Income Tax (Provisional Tax Interest Rates) Regulations 1995 decreased the provisional tax use of money interest on underpayments to 13.8 percent and the rate on overpayments to 8.2 percent. These new rates reflect the decrease in domestic interest rates. The interest rates will now be calculated from an absolute date. The new rates apply from 12 July 1996. They apply to all interest liabilities existing on or after that date regardless of which particular income year those liabilities relate to. As with the previous rates the interest received or paid under the new rates will continue to be assessable and deductible. (iii) The lessee leases the vehicle for the full three- year term and decides to keep the vehicle at the end of the lease. The terms of the lease require the lessee to pay to the lessor the full residual value. The GST treatment is: • The lessee pays a further $18,000 to the lessor (by virtue of its obligation to pay the residual value). • The lessee claims an input tax deduction of $2,000 (with reference to the tax invoice issued by the lessor at the time of entering into the lease). from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) Undersea maintenanceEstimatedDV bandedSL equivalent (when equipment used under salt wateruseful lifedep’n ratebanded dep’n rate or on a maintenance barge on salt water)(years)(%)(%) Undersea maintenance equipment (not specified)44030 Chain blocks53324 Diesel pump53324 Dive compressor53324 Dive tanks101812.5 Diving panel53324 Drilling power pack53324 Diving helmet101812.5 Drilling rig53324 Drilling platform1100100 Hammer (pneumatic/ hydraulic)53324 Hydraulic hosesExpense Jetting pump53324 Lay flat hose35040 Lift bags1100100 Mooring weights101812.5 Outboard motors53324 Regulators53324 Ropes1100100 Shackles53324 Tools (loose)1100100 Umbilical1100100 Video camera53324 Wet suit1100100 Winches101812.5 3.

Foreign investment funds - deemed rate of return announced The deemed rate of return for the foreign investment fund (FIF) rules has been set by regulation at 11.86% for the 1995-96 income year. This rate will apply to all types of investments, including interests in superannuation schemes and life insurance policies. The rate is set annually. The FIF rules tax income that foreign entities earn on behalf of New Zealand residents, for cases in which the controlled foreign company rules do not apply.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) American Express Membership Rewards programme Product ruling - BR Prd 96/16 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. Taxation law This ruling applies in respect of sections CI 2 (1) and OB 1 (“arrangement”) of the Income Tax Act 1994. Arrangement to which this ruling applies The arrangement is that American Express corporate cardmembers participate in the American Express Membership Rewards programme. Companies can apply to Amex for the right to enable their employees to apply to be Amex corporate cardmembers. If the company is approved by Amex, the company may approve employees to apply to Amex to be corporate cardholders. As a corporate cardholder, the employee may be enrolled in the Membership Rewards scheme. Under the Membership Rewards scheme, participating cardmembers earn points based on the dollar volume of their card charges. These can be redeemed for goods and services. Other facts of the arrangement are as set out in the application and accompany- ing information dated 1 May 1996. Assumptions This ruling is based on the assumption that the facts are as set out in the applica- tion and accompanying information dated 1 May 1996. The ruling There is no arrangement between Amex and employers of corporate cardholders for Amex to provide or grant benefits through the Membership Rewards pro- gramme to the corporate cardholders. Employers of corporate cardholders are not liable for FBT on any benefits which employees may obtain through the Membership Rewards programme. The period for which the ruling applies This ruling applies for the period 12 February 1996 to 31 March 1999. Signed Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) Questions we’ve been asked This section of the TIB sets out the answers to some day-to-day questions that people have asked. We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 Engaging a limited company as a real estate salesperson Regulation 4 - Payments declared to be withholding payments: A taxpayer asked about the tax treatment of payments real estate licensees make to salesper- sons that are limited liability companies. Inland Revenue understands that the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board’s view is that the Real Estate Agents Act 1976 does not authorise a company to be engaged as a real estate salesperson. We understand that the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board’s view is that real estate licensees can only engage natural persons as salespersons. Under section 42 of the Real Estate Agents Act 1976, it is an offence for a licensee to engage a salesperson who does not hold a current certificate of approval. Under section 45 of that Act, a person can only apply for a certificate of approval if he or she has passed the examination (if any) prescribed by the Rules of the Real Estate Institute. As only natural persons can sit and pass an examination, only natural persons can apply for, and be issued with, a certificate of approval. Further, section 46 of that Act requires the Real Estate Agents Licensing Board to have regard to the character and general knowledge of a person when determin- ing whether to grant that person a certificate of approval. This requirement could not be met in the case of a company. As only a natural person can be issued with and hold a certificate of approval, it follows that only natural persons, and not limited companies, can be engaged as salespersons by licensees. If a licensee engages a company to sell real estate (when the services of selling real estate will be performed by a certified salesperson who is employed by the company), the contract between the licensee and the company is not authorised by the Real Estate Agents Act because the company is not a certified real estate salesperson. However, the income paid by the licensee to the company will still be derived by the company, subject to the possible application of section BB 9 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 99, Income Tax Act 1976). Section BB 9 voids, for tax purposes, arrangements which have tax avoidance as a purpose or effect (if tax avoidance is not merely an incidental purpose or effect of the arrange- ment). The fact that engaging a company to sell real estate is not permissible under the Real Estate Agents Act, is one factor that the Commissioner may take into account in determining whether the purpose of the arrangement is tax avoidance. When a licensee makes payments to a salesperson who is a natural person and who is not an employee of the licensee, the payments are withholding payments under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (payments to salespersons are included as withholding payments in Part A of the Schedule to those Regulations). Section NC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 338, In- come Tax Act 1976) requires the licensee to deduct tax from these payments. Tax should be deducted at the rate of 20 cents per dollar. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) Tax Administration Act 1994 Disbursements for private and product rulings Section 91I(2) - Regulations for payment of fees for private and product rul- ings: A taxpayer who is considering applying for a private ruling has been advised that she will be liable to an application fee of $210 plus a further $105 per hour for the ruling. In addition, she may be charged for any disbursements that the Commissioner incurs in relation to the ruling. She has asked what disbursements the Commissioner will charge applicants. The authority for the Commissioner to charge a fee for a private or a product ruling is contained in section 91I of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The fees are determined by the Tax Administration (Binding Rulings) Regulations 1995. Under regulation 3, the following fees are payable for a private or product ruling: (a) An application fee of $210, which must accompany the application: (b) A further fee calculated at $105 per hour (or part hour), beyond the first 2 hours, spent in consideration of the application by the Commissioner, including any time spent by the Commissioner in consulting with the applicant: (c) Reimbursement fees in respect of - (i) Any fees paid by the Commissioner to any person, if the Commissioner requires external advice in relation to the ruling; or (ii)Any costs and reasonable disbursements incurred by the Commissioner in relation to the ruling. The Commissioner considers that the application fee of $105 per hour includes the recovery of normal overhead expenses, such as telephone calls (including tolls), faxes, photocopying, typing etc, that may be required for a ruling. Other disbursements incurred by the Commissioner for services which he con- siders necessary, such as fees for obtaining external advice, e.g. a legal opinion, will be charged to the applicant. In addition, other costs that the Commissioner may incur that are beyond the normal overheads, or costs for additional services specifically requested by the applicant, will also be charged. Examples of those additional costs are: • airfares, taxi fares, accommodation, or other expenses incurred in attending a meeting requested by the applicant • telephone conference calls, when requested by the applicant • international telephone calls • courier fees, when the applicant has requested special delivery • extraordinary photocopying and printing expenses. The above list is not exhaustive and the expenses will not be recovered in all cases. Whenever possible, we will discuss the likelihood and details of any additional costs with the applicant before these costs are incurred. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Restraint of trade and inducement payments - assessability Case:IG Fraser v CIR, CA 259/95 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 65(2)(a),(b) & (l) Keywords:Assessability of restraint of trade and inducement payments Summary:The Court of Appeal found that the payments for the restraint of trade were of a capital nature and were therefore not assessable income of the objector. The Court of Appeal also found that the inducement payment was properly charac- terised as such and was not assessable income in the hands of the objector. Facts:The objector is a well known television current affairs presenter. In 1987 he entered into an agreement to present a series of commercials. At that time the objector’s employer had a strict rule barring its journalists and presenters from appearing in advertisements. Under the agreement the objector was paid $25,000 in 1985 to induce him to enter into the agreement and further sums in 1986 and 1987 to restrain him from advertising or endorsing any other product. The objector treated all of these sums as capital receipts in his tax returns. The Commissioner amended the returns to include the receipts as assessable income. A case was stated to the High Court where Justice Doogue found in the objector’s favour. The Commis- sioner appealed. Decision:The objector submitted that the Commissioner must accept the payments for what they are stated to be (inducement and restraint of trade payments that are capital in nature) as sham had not been alleged. The Court of Appeal did not accept this submission and held that the true character of a receipt turns on an analysis of the contractual arrangements in their factual setting. The $25,000 was paid to the objector to compensate him for giving up his voca- tion as a television current affairs presenter and not for the future services he would render. It was therefore of a capital nature. For the restraint of trade payments there is no proper distinction from the con- clusion reached in the Henwood case. The payments for the restraint of trade were of a capital nature. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) High Court Sheriff accounting for GST Case:Sheriff of the NZ High Court v CIR, HC M No 1385/95 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 5(2) Keywords:goods sold under a writ of sale Summary:The Court found that as the proceeding was issued against the individual part- ners personally and not the partnership, section 5(2) of the GST Act could not apply and the Sheriff did not have to account to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue for GST. The individual partners were not carrying on a taxable activ- ity. Facts:Acting under certain writs of sale the Sheriff seized a Ferrari and an Audi motor vehicle. The cars were both assets forming part of a partnership which was registered for GST purposes. After seizing the Ferrari the Sheriff found it was subject to three separate security interests. The Sheriff sold both cars. The Com- missioner believed the Sheriff had acted in place of the registered owner of the vehicles and that GST was payable. GST assessments were issued and GST was paid under protest. The Sheriff issued proceedings challenging the Commission- er’s entitlement to the funds. Decision:The Court found that a Sheriff when executing a writ of sale is carrying out a power of his or her own as an officer of the Court. The Sheriff is not acting as an agent of the party who obtained the writ authorising the Sheriff to act. It is implicit from the judgment that when the Sheriff sells assets to satisfy debt, GST will be payable if the debtor carried on a taxable activity. The Court also noted for future guidance that section 42(1) of the GST Act states that tax pay- able is recoverable as a debt owed to the Crown. It does not give any statutory priority for the payment of GST. Consequently, the Commissioner would not be entitled to receive GST in priority to the secured creditors. Property sales - assessability Case:TRA No 93/144 Keywords:Gains from property sales, assessable income Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 65(2)(a), (e) & (l) Summary:The TRA found that the gains from the property sales were not taxable. Facts:The objectors were a husband and wife partnership and their private company. Over a five year period they built up a portfolio of 20 residential properties, which they had used to provide rental accommodation and as part of their retirement scheme. However, due to financial hardship they progressively sold the properties over the following two and a half years. The TRA has already heard a case relating to GST issues arising from these transactions (reported as Case S36 (1995) 17 NZTC 7,237). Counsel for the Com- missioner accepted, from the evidence imported by consent from Case S36, that the Commissioner could not establish sufficient evidence of purchases for resale or any property dealing. Decision:In relation to section 65(2)(a), the TRA found that the properties were sold in order to terminate the property letting business (which was made necessary by unforseen financial commitments). The sales were not part of the letting activity, nor an “ordinary incident” of that activity, but were a “one-off transaction pack- age of a capital nature” to wind down that letting business. The properties were not circulating capital. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.1 (July 1996) In relation to section 65(2)(e), the TRA found that the only scheme or undertak- ing was in relation to the letting business. There was no such scheme involving the resale of realty for profit. In relation to section 65(2)(l), the TRA was of the view that unless profits from land dealing were clearly derived from land as circulating capital (subject to section 67) then the profits would almost certainly be capital rather than rev- enue. Accordingly, the objectors were not assessed on the proceeds from the property sales. Land sold by partners to company - no GST liability Case:TRA No 95/46 Act:Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 - section 57(2)(b) Keywords:Sales to self, farming partnership, assessability for GST output tax Summary:The TRA held that GST was not assessable to the partnership Facts:The objector is a father and son farming partnership that is registered for GST. The partnership used farmland separately owned by each partner. In 1990 a family company purchased each partner’s farmland. The shareholders were both partners and the wife of each partner. The farmland was previously included in the partnership’s accounts and tax returns as part of its fixed assets. There was no lease agreement between the individual partners who owned the land and their partnership. The surplus realised on the sale of the respective farm properties to the company was credited to the account of each individual partner. The Commissioner as- sessed the partnership for GST output tax on the respective sales. Decision:The TRA found that section 57(2)(b) can not be taken to mean that the sale of land made in the course of a partnership’s taxable activity of farming is deemed made by the partnership. The TRA found on the facts that the farmland belonged to the respective part- ners, individually, at all material times. The accounting records were wrong and on the balance of probability there was no compelling evidence that the partners passed ownership to the partnership. The TRA held that the mere inclusion of land in the accounts of a partnership is insufficient to show that the land is partnership property. There needs to be some type of conveyance (or declaration of trust) of ownership. There must be an intention to convey and an act of conveyance. On the evidence he found that this did not exist. The TRA went on to state that the Commissioner should have assessed on the basis of section 51(1) (deemed registration when over the threshold) as there was a leasing or license granted to the partnership, or that the sales were void under section 76 as an arrangement to obtain a GST advantage. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.1 (July 1996) Due dates reminder August 1996 5 Large employers: PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for period ended 31 July 1996 due. 7 Provisional tax and/or Student Loan interim repay- ments: first 1997 instalment due for taxpayers with April balance dates.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Policy statements renamed and restructured The Commissioner of Inland Revenue issues non- binding statements as well as binding public rulings. These non-binding statements, which in the past have been called “policy statements”, have covered the Commissioner’s view of the law and the Commission- er’s administrative practice. Starting with this TIB the Commissioner will no longer issue policy statements. Instead, the following three new types of non-binding statements will be issued when appropriate: •Interpretation statements: These statements will set out the Commissioner’s view of the law in relation to a particular set of circumstances in cases when a binding public ruling cannot be issued or is inappro- priate. The Commissioner’s statement on the issues arising out of the Court of Appeal decision in the Newman case is an example of the type of statement which might, in future, be issued as an interpretation statement, as are situations when a particular type of arrangement cannot be conveniently identified. •Interpretation guidelines: These statements will discuss the Commissioner’s approach to the interpre- tation of a general area of law. A statement on the Commissioner’s approach to sham transactions or the interpretation of the general anti-avoidance provision in the Income Tax Act would be an example of the type of statement that might be issued as an interpre- tation guideline. •Standard practice statements: These statements will describe how the Commissioner will, in practice, exercise a statutory discretion or deal with practical issues arising out of the administration of the Inland Revenue Acts. A statement on how the Commissioner will exercise the discretion to allow taxpayers to adopt non-standard balance dates is an example of a state- ment dealing with the exercise of a statutory discre- tion. The Commissioner’s statement on the rates that will be accepted as “reimbursement” for the use of a motor vehicle is an example of a statement on a practical issue arising out of the administration of the revenue acts, i.e. the cost of running of a particular type of motor vehicle is a question of fact, not of law. In keeping with the new structure of Inland Revenue, interpretation statements and interpretation guidelines will generally be issued by the Rulings Unit of the Adjudication & Rulings Business Group. This is the same area that issues binding public rulings. Standard practice statements, which deal with practical and operational issues, will generally be issued by the Operations Business Group. Tax deductions from real estate salespersons Correction to an earlier item In TIB Volume Three, No. 8 (April 1992) at page 11 we discussed the taxation of real estate salespersons. On page 14 of that item we stated that commission pay- ments to a real estate salesperson are subject to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979, regardless of whether the salesperson is an independent contractor or an employee paid on a commission only basis. This statement is not correct. When a real estate salesperson does not enter into an express agreement with the real estate licensee to the effect that the salesperson is an independent contractor, the salesperson will generally be an employee of the licensee. Any payments to the salesperson-employee, whether of salary, retainer, or commission, are pay- ments under a contract of employment. Payments made in relation to a contract of employment are salary or wages liable to PAYE deductions. Regulation 4(2)(a) of the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 states that payments that are salary or wages are not withholding payments. Therefore, the payments to the salesperson-employee are not withholding payments, even if the salesperson- employee is paid on a commission only basis. When the salesperson enters into an express agreement with the licensee to the effect that the he or she is an independent contractor, the salesperson is engaged by the licensee under a contract for services. Payments covered by the agreement are withholding payments and are subject to the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) ACC employer premium classification bulletins - local government Introduction The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance Corporation (ACC) propose from time to time to issue employer premium classification bulletins to set out their policy for the classification of particular industry groups. ACC recently released the first such bulletin, which deals with Local Government. Details of the policy are reproduced below. Coverage The term local government refers to regional councils and territorial authorities established under the Local Government Act 1974 and the Auckland Regional Services Trust, and includes trading and other entities established by those councils and authorities. There are three general types of structure used by local government : • the contracting out model, under which third-party contractors provide most services to the local author- ity • the local authority trading enterprise (LATE) model, under which the trading activities of the local govern- ment are in separate subsidiaries owned by the local government • The divisional model, under which operational units, although not separated into legal entities, may tender for work against independent contractors. This policy applies to each of these structures. Application This policy first relates to the classification of local government authorities on employee earnings for the year ended 31 March 1995 and subsequent years. Legislation The Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance (Employment Premiums) Regulations 1995 and subsequent years. Policy Activities carried out by local government are to be classified according to the external service performed, if that service is delivered to the community or to some other external “purchaser”. To qualify for multiple classifications, the criteria for separate activities, record keeping, management and operation, must be fulfilled. If this criteria cannot be met, all activities must be classified according to the highest rated classification (generally a construction classification). Services or outputs consumed internally may not be separately classified. The classification unit Local Government Operation (not elsewhere classified) is for community services not covered by any other classification. The rules for multiple classifications must be met for this classifica- tion to be used (unless it is the highest rated classifica- tion in single classification cases). Services in this classification include : • administration of the authority (if not assigned to a single or related group of external services) • animal control (licensing, pound etc.) • environmental, food and water standards control • finance and computer services (if not assigned to a single external service) • health regulation and inspection • land transport planning (if not related to a specific transport service) • elected members (IR 12 payments - note that IR 13 payments should be excluded as recipients pay their own ACC premiums) • rates collection • resource management information, monitoring, and consents • strategic planning (if not related to a specific external service) • town planning and building inspection • vehicle parking regulation and enforcement If a local authority qualifies to use multiple activities it must include administration and support services staff in the classification unit for the activity to which their services contribute. If the services are contributed to more than one activity, then the general rule is that those staff are to be included in the highest rated activity. The exception is that from the 1996 year, if 5% or less of an employee’s earnings are in a high-rated activity, then the whole of those earnings can be classi- fied in the appropriate lower-rated activity. Administration The ACC is currently reviewing the classifications used by local authorities nation wide. It will provide details to Inland Revenue, as agent for the Corporation, to issue amended premium assessments if these are necessary. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) If you have any questions about this policy, please contact: Premium Assessments ACC Head Office P O Box 242 WELLINGTON Phone 0800 222 776 Fax (04) 472 2812 If you have any questions about amended premium assessments, please contact: Corporates Unit Inland Revenue National Office P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON Phone (04) 472 1032 Fax (04) 802 7207 Premium classifications most likely to be used by local government ClassificationClassification unit nameAlternative activity descriptionsunit number Hunting and trappingCulling of wild animals02200 Possum hunting or trapping Rabbit hunting or trapping Forestry03010 Services to forestryFire-fighting (forestry)03030 Forest planting Gravel and sand quarrying14110 Construction material miningAggregate quarrying14190 Road fill quarrying Electricity distributionMeter reading service-electrical36101 Gas supplyMeter reading service-gas36200 LPG distribution (through mains) LPG reforming Water supplyDams or reservoirs operation37010 Meter reading service-water Sewerage and drainage servicesStormwater drainage systems operation37020 Construction (roads & bridges)Asphalt surfacing41210 Road sealing Road maintenance Non-building constructionFlood control systems construction41220 River works construction Sports field construction Petroleum product wholesalingLPG dealing (bulk or containers)45210 Short distance bus transport61220 Parking servicesCar park operation66110 Services to water transportMarina operation66220 Port operatorsWharf facility leasing66230 Wharf provision Services to air transportAirport operation66300 Airport services Residential property operationApartments, flats, or houses, renting or leasing77110 (excluding construction) Business management servicesEfficiency advisory service78550 Tourism development consultancy Pest control servicesWeed control services (industrial or domestic)78650 Local government operationSee explanation in main text81130 (n.e.c.)

Marquees - draft depreciation determination Introduction In TIB Volume Seven, No.13 (May 1996) at page 20 we set out the depreciation rate which currently applies to marquees, and published an exposure draft general depreciation determination which proposed to set two new asset classes and rates based on two types of fabric. We received two submissions on the exposure draft. In response to those submissions we have consulted more widely with taxpayers in the industry. The Commis- sioner now proposes to issue a general determination which sets asset classes and depreciation rates that are different to those originally envisaged. The second draft determination proposes to: • delete the existing asset class “Marquees” and general depreciation rate of 15% diminishing value (“DV”) and 10% straight-line (“SL”) from the “Leisure” industry category • insert a new asset class “Marquees (canvas roofs & walls, ropes/ tie-downs when permanently attached)” with a general depreciation rate of 22% DV and 15.5% SL into the “Leisure” industry category • insert a new asset class “Marquees (roofs & walls of fabrics other than canvas, ropes/ tie-downs when permanently attached)” with a general depreciation rate of 33% DV and 24% SL into the “Leisure” industry category. “Fabrics other than canvas” include PVC, sailcloth, and any other fabrics of which marquees are made. • insert a new asset class “Marquee poles (wood)” with a general depreciation rate of 12% DV and 8% SL into the “Leisure” industry category. • insert a new asset class “Marquee poles & frames (metal)” with a general depreciation rate of 18% DV and 12.5% SL into the “Leisure” industry category • insert a new asset class “Marquee poles & frames (metal with integral winching mechanism)” with a general depreciation rate of 22% DV and 15.5% SL into the “Leisure” industry category. • insert a new asset class “Marquee accessories (other than poles & frames)” with a general depreciation rate of 33% DV and 24% SL into the “Leisure” industry category. This asset class includes ropes and tie- downs which are not permanently attached, pegs, and linings for the inside of a roof. Lighting does not fall under this asset class, but falls under “Lighting and accessories” under the “Audio and Video Recording Studios and Professional Photography” industry category with an estimated useful life (“EUL”) of 5 years, 33% DV and 24% SL. • insert the six new asset classes above into the “Hire Equipment (Where on short term hire of 1 month or less only)” asset category with the same EULs and depreciation rates. The Commissioner proposes to issue the determination to apply for the 1996-97 income year (rather than the 1995-96 income year as proposed in the first draft) because the due date for filing 1995-96 business tax returns has now passed. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the EULs set out in the draft determination below and residual values of 13.5% of cost.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Rifles, shotguns, pistols, firearms, fastening guns (explosive) - draft depreciation determination For depreciation purposes, rifles and pistols are cur- rently listed under the “Leisure” category only, with depreciation rates based on an estimated useful life (EUL) of 10 years. No firearms are listed under the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” category or in any other category. The Commissioner considers that the following asset classes and depreciation rates currently apply: • Rifles used in the agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture industry (including by pest destruction contractors): asset class “Rifles” under the “Leisure” category; EUL of 10 years. • Shotguns used in the agriculture, horticulture and aquaculture industry (including by pest destruction contractors): asset class “Agriculture & horticulture machinery (not specified)” under the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” category; EUL of 15.5 years. The Commissioner proposes to issue a general deprecia- tion determination to make these changes: • Insert four new asset classes for rifles and shotguns into the “Agriculture, Horticulture and Aquaculture” industry category based on amount of use (i.e. number of rounds fired per year). • Delete the asset classes “Pistols” and “Rifles” from the “Leisure” industry category. • Insert an asset class “Firearms” into the “Leisure” industry category. This asset class will cover rifles, pistols, shotguns and any other firearms. • Insert a new asset class “Fastening guns (explosive)” into the “Contractors, Builders and Quarrying” industry category and also into the “Timber and Joinery Industries” industry category. For example, a Ramset gun is a brand of a “Fastening gun (explo- sive)”. The draft determination is reproduced below. The proposed new depreciation rates are based on the EULs set out in the draft determination below, and residual values of 13.5% of cost. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Exposure draft - General Depreciation Determination DEPX This determination may be cited as “Determination DEP\[x\]: Tax Depreciation Rates General Determination Number X”. 1.

Jeff Tyler Assistant General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Tower Retirement Investment Ltd’s “FuturePlan” Product Ruling BR Prd 96/18 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. This Ruling applies in respect of sections JB 2 and JB 3, and in particular, the word “pension” in section JB 3 (1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the encashment of units by members (“withdrawals”) of a superannuation scheme entitled “FuturePlan”. The FuturePlan was established by Tower Corporation by trust deed dated 20 July 1989 (at this time the scheme was known as the Tower Personal Superannuation Plan). The original trust deed has subsequently been amended several times. The original trust deed and its amendments have been consolidated into one single deed dated 30 June 1995. In July 1996, the product specifications were also amended to give members of the scheme the ability to request a withdrawal of a dollar amount as an option instead of a particular number of units. Tower Retirement Investment Ltd acts as the investment manager and adminis- tration manager of the FuturePlan. The FuturePlan is established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to its members. Members of the FuturePlan make contributions to the Plan and these contribu- tions are paid or allocated to various Investment Funds. One of these Funds is called the Capital Protected Fund (i.e. at maturity, the member is guaranteed his or her contributions plus interest less withdrawals and management fees). The remainder of the Funds are unitised with the value of the units capable of varia- tion, depending on market conditions and earnings’ performance. Over the life of the investment, members are entitled to “cash up” units that represent their investment in any of the Investment Funds. The entitlement to encash units has the following characteristics: • Members can nominate a particular number of units to be cashed at any time, or specify a dollar amount of units to be cashed. • The right to encash units is an entitlement held by the members. Members cannot be required to or prevented from exercising this right (although the calculation of the amount payable and the actual payment may be delayed in certain circumstances outlined in the trust deed). Binding rulings This section of the TIB contains binding rulings that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue has issued recently. The Commissioner can issue binding rulings in certain situations. Inland Revenue is bound to follow such a ruling if a taxpayer to whom the ruling applies calculates tax liability based on it. For full details of how binding rulings work, see our information booklet “Binding Rulings” (IR 115G) or the article on page 1 of TIB Volume Six, No.12 (May 1995) or Volume Seven, No.2 (August 1995). You can order these publications free of charge from any Inland Revenue office. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) • Members will notify the Trustee of the Plan in writing of their intention to encash a stated number of units for a stated period. The notification will also specify the frequency of payments. • Members exercising their entitlement to cash up a particular number of units for a stated number of months or years may subsequently alter, revoke, or extend their original election. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumption that the withdrawal procedures proceed as set out in the trust deed and as summarised in the description of the arrange- ment above. This Ruling also assumes that withdrawals made by a member relying on this Ruling are not: • Made at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period at three-monthly intervals. • Amounts withdrawn from funds invested in the Capital Protected Fund. These assumptions mean that members cannot rely on this Ruling where they have made withdrawals at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve- month period at three-monthly intervals, or where they have made withdrawals from funds invested in the Capital Protected Fund. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions set out above, encashment receipts by members of the FuturePlan will not constitute a “pension” for the purposes of section JB 3 (1) and will accordingly not constitute “other income” for the pur- poses of section JB 2 (1). The period for which the Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 31 July 1996 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of July 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Tower Retirement Investment Ltd’s “FreedomPlan” Product Ruling - BR Prd 96/19 This is a product ruling made under section 91F of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Taxation Law All legislative references are to the Income Tax Act 1994. This Ruling applies in respect of sections JB 2 and JB 3, and in particular, the word “pension” in section JB 3 (1). The Arrangement to which this Ruling applies The arrangement is the encashment of units (“withdrawals”) by members of a superannuation scheme entitled “FreedomPlan”. The FreedomPlan was estab- lished by Tower Retirement Investment Limited by trust deed dated 28 February from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) 1994 (at this time the scheme was known as the Tower Superannuation Portfo- lio). The original trust deed was subsequently amended. The original trust deed and the amendment have been consolidated into one single deed. In July 1996, the product specifications were also amended to give members of the scheme the ability to request a withdrawal of a dollar amount as an option instead of a particular number of units. Tower Retirement Investment Ltd acts as the investment manager and adminis- tration manager of the FreedomPlan. The FreedomPlan is established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to its members. Members of the FreedomPlan make contributions to the Plan and these contribu- tions are paid or allocated to various Investment Funds. One of these Funds is called the FDM Capital Protected Fund (i.e. at maturity, the member is guaran- teed his or her contributions plus interest less withdrawals and management fees). The remainder of the Funds are unitised with the value of the units capa- ble of variation, depending on market conditions and earnings’ performance. Over the life of the investment, members are entitled to “cash up” units that represent their investment in any of the Investment Funds. The entitlement to encash units has the following characteristics: • Members can nominate a particular number of units to be cashed at any time, or specify a dollar amount of units to be cashed. • The right to encash units is an entitlement held by the members. Members cannot be required to or prevented from exercising this right (although the calculation of the amount payable and the actual payment may be delayed in certain circumstances outlined in the trust deed). • Members will notify the Trustee of the Plan in writing of their intention to encash a stated number of units for a stated period.

This Ruling also assumes that withdrawals made by a member relying on this Ruling are not: • Made at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve-month period at three-monthly intervals. • Amounts withdrawn from funds invested in the FDM Capital Protected Fund. These assumptions mean that members cannot rely on this Ruling where they have made withdrawals at a frequency greater than four times in any twelve- month period at three-monthly intervals, or where they have made withdrawals from funds invested in the FDM Capital Protected Fund. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions above, encashment receipts by mem- bers of the FreedomPlan will not constitute a “pension” for the purposes of continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) section JB 3 (1) and will accordingly not constitute “other income” for the pur- poses of section JB 2 (1). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 31 July 1996 to 31 March 2000. This Ruling is signed by me on the 31st day of July 1996.

The InvestDirect Plan is established principally for the purpose of providing retirement benefits to its members. Members of the InvestDirect Plan make contributions to the Plan and these contributions are paid or allocated to various Investment Funds. One of these Funds is called the Secure Growth Fund (i.e. at maturity, the member is guaran- teed his or her contributions plus interest less withdrawals and management fees).

Mico has implemented a trade loyalty programme entitled “Mico Air Points” (the “Programme”). Certain customers of Mico have been invited to join the Programme. “Custom- ers” for the purposes of the arrangement will generally be tradespeople, e.g., plumbers, electricians and builders, who treat Mico as their preferred supplier. These persons will in most cases be sole traders. The Programme is subject to the following terms and conditions: • In conjunction with the member, Mico will establish the individual sales figure for the last 12 months. From this figure a base will be agreed for the next 12-month period. • An agreed percentage of actual and referred sales through nominated ac- counts will be transferred into the Mico Programme. Mico will add to this an additional 1% on sales. Where a member’s sales exceeds the base, Mico will pay an additional 1% on the incremental sales. • Each year, in conjunction with the member, Mico will establish a new 12-monthly base. • Each month, Mico will advise all members of their points for the month, along with the year to date position. • Total points listed in the catalogue for air travel/accommodation will be subject to increases/decreases and currency fluctuations at the time of book- ing. In most cases, special conditions and time periods will apply. A booking fee of 5% will be added to the final amount of the travel cost. All travel will be the 1996 to 1999 income years, and notice of its making appeared in the Gazette of 30 November 1995. 4. Product ruling 95/9 is withdrawn on and from 5 September 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Product rulings 96/18, 96/19, and 96/20, which are published in this Bulletin replace respectively the withdrawn product rulings 95/7, 95/8, and 95/9. 4. Product ruling 95/8 is withdrawn on and from 5 September 1996. Martin Smith General Manager (Adjudication & Rulings) Notice of withdrawal of product ruling 1. This is a notice of a withdrawal of a product ruling made under section 91FJ of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 2. Product ruling 95/9 is hereby withdrawn. 3. Product ruling 95/9 originally applied to the calcula- tion of New Zealand superannuitant surcharge for from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) booked through Mico’s nominated Travel Wholesaler and Mico will always quote the points on an individual trip by trip basis. • Individual targets will be kept confidential between Mico and the member at all times. • Mico reserves the right to cancel, adjust or modify the scheme at any time, provided one month’s notification is advised in writing. • Members can purchase product at normal price from any Mico store and the purchase figure (exclusive of GST) of goods acquired through agreed nomi- nated accounts will be used to calculate the points that go into the scheme. Mico will advise members of the total number of points for the month which relate to purchases from any Mico store. An annual $50 (inclusive of GST) membership fee will be payable on joining. Mico reserves the right to mem- bership. • To qualify for points, accounts must be paid by the end of the month follow- ing the month of purchase. • Any tax liability arising from the scheme will be the sole responsibility of the member and Mico make no warranty or representation in relation to such tax liability. The customer is not entitled to redeem the points for cash or any other benefits. In addition, the travel benefits cannot be redeemed for cash or any other ben- efits. Assumptions made by the Commissioner This Ruling is based on the assumptions that: • The points can only be redeemed for the travel benefits in accordance with the Programme; and • The travel benefits cannot be redeemed by the recipient for money or any other benefit; and • The points and the travel benefits cannot be assigned to any other party. How the Taxation Law applies to the Arrangement Subject in all respects to the assumptions set out above, the Taxation Law ap- plies to the Arrangement as follows: • The receipt of points under the Programme by a customer participating in the arrangement will not be income for the purposes of sections BB 1 and BB 4 (a) and BB 4 (d); and • The receipt of the travel benefits by a customer participating in the arrange- ment will not be income for the purposes of sections BB 1 and BB 4 (a) and BB 4 (d). The period for which this Ruling applies This Ruling will apply for the period from 13 August 1996 to 31 March 1999. This Ruling is signed by me on the 13th day of August 1996.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Prizes paid in instalments - correction Section CB 9 (f), (section 61(59), Income Tax Act 1976) - Other exempt income: In the item, “Prizes paid in instalments - assessability to recipient” in TIB Vol- ume Seven, No.12 (April 1996) we stated that a prize option of $18,000 a year for life, paid under an annuity policy from an insurance company, is assessable income. In our answer we should have said that because the annuity payments are payable for the life of the winner, they qualify as annuities paid in respect of a policy of “life insurance” offered or entered into by a life insurer in New Zea- land. Such annuities are exempt income under section CB 9 (f). We apologise for any confusion caused by this error, and thank those corre- spondents who pointed it out to us. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 GST on supplies from unregistered partners to registered partnerships Section 57 - Unincorporated bodies: A partnership is registered for GST. Re- cently it bought land (i.e. there was a sale for consideration) from one of the partners who is not registered for GST. The partnership wants to claim a second- hand goods input tax deduction for the land. Section 57 allows unincorporated bodies (including partnerships, joint ventures, and trusts) to register as single entities. Its effect is that a partnership is a sepa- rate entity from the partners of the partnership for GST purposes. The partnership can claim a secondhand goods input tax deduction for the land under section 20(3) if all the following criteria are met: • The land is acquired by the partnership for the purposes of making taxable supplies. • The partnership pays the partner for the land (an input tax deduction can only be claimed under section 20(3)(a)(ia) to the extent that payment has been made for the supply). • The land becomes partnership property. As the partner and the partnership are associated persons, the consideration for the supply is deemed to be the lesser of the purchase price and the open market value of the land. If the partnership was using the land before the sale, the partner must consider whether she was carrying on the taxable activity of land rental and if she has any liability to register for GST. The partnership must return output tax on any subsequent supply of the land. 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Act 1992 Loss of earnings insurance policy payouts - whether liable to ACC premiums Sections 101,102, and 114 - Premiums payable: A taxpayer has asked whether benefits paid out under loss of earnings insurance policies (policies which pro- vide for benefits calculated with reference to earnings or profits lost by the insured as a result of incapacitation) are liable to ACC earner premiums or employer premiums. ACC employer premiums are payable by an employer on the amount of “earn- ings” paid to an employee under section 101, and are payable by every earner who has “earnings other than as an employee” under section 102. ACC earner premiums are payable by every earner on the “earnings” of that person under section 114. “Earnings” is defined in the Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insur- ance (Earnings Definitions) Regulations 1992 as: earnings as an employee and earnings other than as an employee. Benefits received under loss of earnings insurance policies do not fall within either category because: • “Earnings as an employee” includes all source deduction payments under the Income Tax Act 1994 (other than any withholding payments), and any in- come which is deemed to be derived otherwise than from source deduction payments and which is deemed to be derived by an irregular payment em- ployee under regulation 3 of the Regulations. • “Earnings other than as an employee” includes any assessable income de- rived by a person for the purposes of the Income Tax Act 1994 which is de- pendent on that person’s personal exertions and which would cease as a consequence of that person suffering the incapacity. As neither of these categories includes a benefit paid out under a loss of earnings insurance policy, ACC employer premiums or earner premiums are not payable on the amount of any such benefit. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Supply of services subject to GST Case:TRA No 93/21 Act:Goods and Services 1985 - section 11(2)(e) Keywords:Zero rated services Summary:The TRA found that there was a supply of services (repairs) directly in connec- tion with movable personal property (the repaired vehicles). Thus the objector is unable to rely on the zero rating provisions of section 11(2)(e). Facts:The objector purchased products including motor vehicles from its parent com- pany. Under the sale and purchase agreements the parent company warrants the products to the objector in respect of parts and labour. The objector then sells the vehicles to independent dealers who in turn sell them to the public. Each vehicle is sold with a warranty provided by the objector (which is wider than the warranty provided by the parent company). The objec- tor’s agreement with the dealers is that if the vehicle is repaired under a war- ranty the objector will reimburse the dealer. The objector then registers a claim with its parent company under the warranty, and the parent company generally pays the objector a lesser sum. Decision:The TRA decided that two services were provided - the supply of contract serv- ices by the dealer to the objector (including the repairs to the vehicle) and the supply of repairs by the objector to the parent company (thereby releasing the parent from its contractual repair obligations). Hence the warranty payments were made by the parent to the objector in consideration for the objector repair- ing the defective products. This supply of services is not zero rated. Time limits for appeals Case:TRA No 95/013, TRA No 95/015 Act:Taxation Review Authority Act - section 26 (1)(a) & (2) Keywords:Appeals to the High Court - adherence to time limits Summary:The decision of the TRA confirms that strict time limits under section 26(2) of the Act must be adhered to. Facts:The objector failed to lodge an appeal to the High Court within 30 days of the date of the Authority’s decision, being the statutory time limit. The cause of the delay was due to circumstances beyond the objector’s control. 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Decision:The TRA followed the decision of TLC Services Limited, in which the Court held that the policy aspects concerning strict time limits must be acknowledged and certainty in commercial affairs maintained. Following this decision, the TRA enforced the time limits contained in section 26. The objector’s application was declined despite the fact that the delay was be- yond their control and likely to cause them considerable hardship. Payment for surrendering option to purchase - capital receipt Case:Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited v Commissioner of Inland Revenue Keywords:Option to purchase - payment for surrendering Summary:The Court of Appeal found that the payment made to the Company for surren- dering its option to purchase was to be regarded as capital in nature rather than revenue. Facts:The objector chartered three ships from a carrying company which in turn held the ships by way of a long term charter from a shipping company. The objector had an option to purchase those ships from the shipping company. However, the objector agreed to surrender its option to purchase in return for a payment of $1.5 million; $750,000 from the shipping company (paid over three annual instal- ments) and a further $750,000 from the carrying company (by way of deduction from the charter fees for the ships over the next three years). In calculating a tax loss for the 1975 year, the objector claimed deductions for the unadjusted charter fee to the carrying company (without reference to the $250,000 reduction in that fee) and further calculated the loss without reference to the $250,000 payment from the shipping company. It accounted for the total $1.5 million payment in that year as “non-taxable income”. In the Court of Appeal the Commissioner contended that $1.5 million was a revenue receipt, being a gain made in the ordinary course of carrying on the objector’s business. Decision:The Court held that the reduction in fees paid to the carrying company was to be regarded as a set off of payment of that capital sum against those fees, rather than a discount or reduction in the fees. Therefore the payment was capital in nature. Land subdivision profits - assessability Case:TRA No 94/19, TRA No 94/20 Keywords:Profits from subdivision, assessable income Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 67(4)(e) & (9) Summary:The TRA found that the two subdivisions were not capable of being worked as economic units. Therefore the objectors were liable for income tax on the subdi- vision profits. Facts:The objectors are partners in a farming partnership which subdivided its farm property into nine lots. Immediately before the subdivision the land was used by the objectors for farming. This case concerns the assessability of two of the lots, for income tax. The objectors submitted that these lots were capable of being worked as economic units (in satisfaction of section 67(9)(b) ) by converting them to chicory pasture. This would exempt the profits from assessability under section 67(4)(e) and (f). 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Decision:The Authority followed the Court of Appeal judgment of Bruhns and applied the capability test to the land, when determining the expression ‘economic unit’. Upon application of the test, the Authority decided that the land did not have the present capacity of an economic unit and would not achieve this status without a degree of modification. In addition it decided that the land was not capable of yielding a reasonable standard of living to the owners without them resorting to secondary employment. Further, since the land was not capable of making a due return on the capital invested, section 67(9)(b) had not been satisfied. Finally, the Authority decided that the evidence did not show that the land was sold primarily and principally for the purpose of its use in any farming or agri- cultural business, as required under section 67(9)(c). 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.2 (August 1996) Booklets available from Inland Revenue This list shows all of Inland Revenue’s information booklets as at the date of this Tax Information Bulletin.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Example 1: Simple Notice of Proposed Adjustment Notice of Proposed Adjustment Name:Lottsa Frenz Ltd IRD number:01-234-567 Date issued:24 October 1996 Proposed adjustments Adjustments to be made as follows: Taxable valueTotal GSTAmended GSTof fringeGST value -on sales andtotal GST Returnbenefitsdeemedincome ason sales Periodprovidedsupplyreturnedand income 31.05.95$1,125.00$125.00$ 4,201.33$ 4,326.33 31.07.95$1,125.00$125.00$ 5,263.22$ 5,388.22 30.11.95$1,125.00$125.00$ 2,365.00$ 2,490.00 31.01.96 $1,125.00$125.00$ 6,154.88$ 6,279.88 $4,500.00$500.00$17,984.43$18,484.43 Total GST in Dispute = $500.00 Facts In January 1995 Lottsa Frenz Ltd purchased a Ford Fairlane car, to be used by the principal shareholder, Mr Frenz for business purposes. Mr Frenz also uses the car to tow his privately owned boat to the beach when he goes fishing, and sometimes Mrs Frenz uses it to do the shopping. The car can be used by Mr or Mrs Frenz on any day of the week. Tax laws Section CI (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides: In the FBT rules, “Fringe Benefit”, in relation to any employee and to any quarter .... means any benefit that consists of - (a) The use or enjoyment, in relation to the employee, at any time during the quarter ,... of a motor vehicle owned, leased or rented by the person who makes the vehicle available to the employee: (b) The availability for the private use or enjoyment of the employee at any time during the quarter of a motor vehicle that is so owned, leased or rented.” Section 21 (3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 provides: “....the granting of that Fringe Benefit shall, except to the extent that any amount has been paid by that other person for the receipt or enjoyment of that fringe benefit, be deemed to be a supply of goods and services made by that registered person in the course of a taxable activity carried out by that person.” 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Issues Is the car available for private use at all times, and therefore subject to FBT in full, or only available on those days the company authorises its use and it is used? Is the availability of the car for the above purposes a Fringe Benefit in terms of section CI(1) of the Income Tax Act 1994 and therefore a deemed supply for GST purposes pursuant to section 21(3) of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985? Propositions of law “If a business car is available to an employee at any time during a day, then that employee is deemed to have a fringe benefit, for the full day.” - Case P26 (1992) 14 NZTC, 4196 “The definition of private use or enjoyment (as defined in Section CI (1) of the Income Tax Act 1994) included travel which conferred a benefit of a private or domestic nature on a person. The availability of the vehicles on a daily basis for family matters was clearly for their private use or enjoyment...” - Case R37 (1994) 16 NZTC 6,208 (For the purposes of this example fringe benefit adjustments were included in a separate NOPA.) Example 2: Adjustments arising from an audit From start of audit to NOPA stage In August 1995 Mr S M Iles filed his GST return for the two month return period ended 31 July 1995. This return showed that Mr Iles was to receive a GST refund. Inland Revenue checked the company’s compliance history then selected the return for a routine check by an investigator. During the audit the investigator asked for copies of tax invoices for the major expense items in the return period. The investigator found that the refund was largely due to the purchase of capital equipment, but he also noted that a significant amount of private expenditure had been claimed. Mr Iles’ accountant, Ms Smith), agreed that the private expenditure should be disallowed, and that it would not be included as business expense when preparing the end of year accounts. As a result of this review Inland Revenue decided to conduct an in depth investigation of the taxpayer’s affairs when the income tax return for the 1996 financial year was filed. On 11 October 1996 Inland Revenue sent the follow- ing initial audit letter to the accountant, plus a copy to the taxpayer: 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) 11 October 1996 Bob, Bill & Jo Chartered Accountants Box 010 Neverville 1310 Attn.: Ms Smith Name: S M Iles Panelbeaters IRD number: 02-345-678 Our reference: AXR/BL3/WUZ I have been instructed to conduct an audit of your client’s tax affairs.

Yours faithfully A N Other Investigatorc.c.Mrs M Iles P O Box 11-111 Neverville 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) As a result of the later audit the following issues were highlighted: 1. Three cheques, totalling $12,375 were deposited into Mrs Iles’ personal bank account. The Com- missioner contends that these cheques relate to services provided by Mr Iles in carrying out his panel beating business. 2. Mr Iles uses his motor vehicle for private and business purposes. No apportionment of motor vehicle expenses has been made to account for private usage of the vehicle. No records have been maintained to establish the percentage of business use. 3. $2,500 of the amount claimed for repairs and maintenance was for the laying of a pathway by Pathways Limited at Mr & Mrs Iles’ home. Mr Iles agreed in writing to the third item, in a letter dated 12 December. The matters outlined above were recorded in a written report prepared by the investigator, and approved by his reporting officer. On 20 January the Commis- sioner issued the following NOPA: Notice of Proposed Adjustment Sim Iles Panelbeaters IRD Number: 02-345-678 For the income year ended 31 March 1996 Date of Issue: 20 January 1997 Proposed adjustments Taxable income as per return$125,000.00 Add proposed adjustments: (A) Cheques received from customers not included in income (Excl GST)$11,000.00 (B) Motor vehicle expenses disallowed (Excl GST)$ 1,500.00 (C) Repairs and Maintenance disallowed (Excl GST) $ 2,500.00 $ 15,000.00 Amended taxable income$140,000.00 (D) The Commissioner proposes to assess penal tax of 150% on the total of proposed adjustment A: Tax on total of Proposed Adjustment Ax150%=Penal Tax $3,630.00x150%=$5,445.00 Notes to proposed adjustments: (i) The Commissioner proposes to issue any reassessment stating the original due date as the date for payment of the tax. (ii) Consequential adjustments to the GST returns of Sim Iles Panelbeaters will be addressed in a separate Notice of Proposed Adjustment. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Adjustment A Facts A.1 The following cheques were deposited into Mr Iles’ wife’s private cheque account - DateAmountDrawer 16-6-957,312.50John Smith 22-8-951,687.50F.R. Edwards 12-12-953,375.00J.K. Hart A.2 These cheques were made out for cash and the Commissioner contends that they relate to services provided by Sim Iles Panelbeaters to the payers of the cheques. All of the cheques were paid directly into Mrs Iles’ personal cheque account. The cheques totalled $12,375.00. These cheques were business income derived by Mr Iles trading as Sim Iles Panelbeaters. A.3 As business income these amounts are considered to include GST. The proposed adjustment to Mr Iles income tax return is to increase his taxable income by $11,000.00, being the total of the cheques less the GST component of $1,375.00 Tax laws A.4 The amounts should have been included in the assessable income of Mr Iles in terms of section BB 4(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2)(a) Income Tax Act 1976). Section BB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2) of the 1976 Act) provides: “Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, the assessable income of any person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to include, save so far as express provision is made in this Act to the contrary, - (a) All profits or gains derived from any business...” A.5 Section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75 of the 1976 Act) applies because the money was credited to another person or dealt with on behalf of him. Section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75(1) of the 1976 Act) provides: “For the purposes of this Act every person shall be deemed to have derived income although it has not actually been actually paid to or received by the person, or already become due or receivable, but has been credited in account, or reinvested, or accumulated, or capitalised, or carried to any reserve, sinking, or insurance fund, or otherwise dealt with in the person’s interest or on the person’s behalf.” Legal issues A.6 Whether the amounts in question were business profits of Mr Iles trading as Sim Iles Panelbeaters pursuant to section BB 4(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2)(a) of the 1976 Act). A.7 Whether the amounts paid into Mrs Iles’ bank account were derived by Sim Iles Panelbeaters under section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75(1) of the 1976 Act) and were paid to Mrs Iles on behalf of Sim Iles Panelbeaters. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Propositions of law A.8 The propositions relied on by the Commissioner include: Profits or gains arising from the current operations (day to day) of a business are assessable: \[as in CIR v City Motor Services Ltd \[1969\] NZLR 1010\] Income is derived even though it may not have been actually paid to or received by the taxpayer: \[as in Case N40 (1991) 13 NZTC 3,344\] Section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75(1) of the 1976 Act) is directed to the form in which income is derived. Therefore income is derived by a taxpayer even if it does not reach the taxpayer, provided it is dealt with on the taxpayer’s behalf: \[as in CIR v Farmers Trading Co Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,007\] Adjustment B Facts B.1 Mr Iles owns a motor vehicle and uses it for private and business purposes. During the 1996 income year no apportionment of the deduction for motor vehicle expenses was made to account for the significant private usage of the vehicle. No logbook has ever been used for this vehicle to establish the business use proportion, as required by the legislation. When no logbook is kept the business use proportion is limited to 25 percent of total use of the motor vehicle. Tax laws B.2 Section DH 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (106B of the 1976 Act) prevents a deduction being claimed for motor vehicle expenses “(1)Except as provided in this section, no deduction in relation to expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in respect of or in relation to a motor vehicle used in gaining or producing assessable income of a taxpayer in any year shall be allowed under section BB 7 in calculating that assessable income in that income year;... (3)Where in any income year a motor vehicle is used by a taxpayer partly for business purposes and partly for other purposes, there shall be allowed as a deduction in that income year the proportion of all expenditure incurred by the taxpayer in relation to the motor vehicle that reflects the proportion of business use of the vehicle to its total use in that income year, as that business use proportion is determined in accordance with sections DH 2 to DH 4 of this Act.” B.3 Section DH 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 106E of the 1976 Act) dictates the deductible portion for business use expenditure when no log book is maintained: “Where, in respect of any taxpayer and any period, - (a) The period is not a logbook application period to which the business use proportion of a vehicle established by a logbook maintained under section DH 3 can be applied; and 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) (b) The taxpayer has not maintained for that period the details referred to in section DH 2, - for the purposes of section DH 1 the business use proportion of the motor vehicle for that period shall be limited to the proportion of actual business use or 25 percent of total use of the motor vehicle, whichever is less, during the relevant period.” Legal issues B.4 Whether the motor vehicle was used partly for business purposes and partly for private purposes. B.5 Whether the period is a logbook application period. B.6 Whether the business use proportion of the expenditure can be limited to 25% of the actual motor vehicle expenses. Propositions of law B.7 The propositions relied on by the Commissioner include: A person must maintain sufficient records to enable the Commissioner to readily ascertain that person’s liability to tax: \[as in Case L106 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,593\] If inadequate records are maintained it is appropriate to limit the business use portion to 25%: \[as in Case L106 (1989) 11 NZTC 1,593. Adjustment C Of the amount claimed for repairs and maintenance, $2500.00 was for the laying by Pathways Limited of a pathway at Mr Iles’ home. The Commissioner and Mr Iles agree by letter dated 12 December 1996 that this adjustment should be made. Adjustment D Facts D.1 The following cheques were deposited to Mrs Iles’ private cheque account - DateAmountDrawer 16-6-957,312.50John Smith 22-8-951,687.50F.R. Edwards 12-12-953,375.00J.K. Hart D.2 These cheques were made out for cash and the Commissioner contends that they relate to services provided by Sim Iles Panelbeaters. D.3 Mr Iles knew that these cheques related to services provided by Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Mr Iles personally banked the cheques into Mrs Iles’ personal cheque account. Mr Iles knew that these amounts should have been included in his income tax return. The total amount of the cheques was not included as income Mr Iles’ income tax return. 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) D.4 The Commissioner considers that Mr Iles evaded or attempted to evade the assessment of or payment of tax by not including the amount of these cheques in his income tax return. Tax laws D.5 Section 186 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 (section 420 of the Income Tax Act 1976) provides: “If any taxpayer evades, or attempts to evade, or does any act with intent to evade, or makes default in the performance of any duty imposed upon the taxpayer by this Act or the Income Tax Act 1994, or the regulations made under those Acts, with intent to evade, the assessment or payment of any sum which is or may become chargeable against the taxpayer by way of tax, (which sum is referred to in sections 187 to 191 as the “deficient tax”), the taxpayer shall be chargeable, by way of penalty for that offence, with additional tax (referred to in sections 187 to 193 as “penal tax”) not exceeding an amount equal to treble the amount of the deficient tax.” Legal issues D.6 Whether Mr Iles evaded, attempted to evade or did any act with intent to evade, the assessment and payment of tax on the income comprised in the cheques. D.7 Whether Mr Iles knew that the cheques were income derived by him trading as Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Propositions of law D.8 The propositions relied on by the Commissioner include: “A person who knowingly and consciously omits to return income for taxation purposes, evades income tax.” - Case P29 1992 14 NZTC 4213 The Commissioner’s NOPA was issued on 20 January 1997. Accordingly Mr Iles has two months from that date to respond (i.e., until 20 March 1997). Mr Iles can either do nothing or issue a Notice of Response. If he issues a Notice of Response he could take one of the following four approaches: •accept all of the proposed adjustments •accept some of the proposed adjustments and reject others •reject some of the proposed adjustments and not refer to others; •reject all of the proposed adjustments. These approaches are contained in the scenarios on the following pages. 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Scenario 1: Taxpayer rejects some adjustments, accepts others Notice of Response SM Iles trading as Sim Iles Panelbeaters IRD NO: 02-345-678 Date of Issue: 10 March 1997 Proposed Adjustment A Items in error A.1 Proposed Adjustment A is wrong. The cheques were not for work done by Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Tax laws A.2 Section BB 4(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2)(a) of the 1976 Act) does not apply. A.3 Section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75 of the 1976 Act) does not apply. Facts in error A.4 The cheques were not for services provided by Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Additional facts A.5 The cheques were paid to Mrs Iles as gifts Additional legal issues A.6 There are no additional legal issues. The cheques were not income of Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Propositions of law A.7 Sim Iles Panelbeaters relies on the following propositions of law: Gifts are not assessable income. Money paid to one person is not income of another person. Proposed Adjustment B B.1 Proposed Adjustment B is accepted . 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Proposed Adjustment D Item in error D.1 Proposed Adjustment D is wrong. The cheques are not income of Sim Iles Panelbeaters and so I could not have intended to evade income tax. Tax laws D.2 Section BB 4(a) of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 65(2)(a) of the 1976 Act) does not apply. D.3 Section EB 1 of the Income Tax Act 1994 (section 75 of the 1976 Act) does not apply. Facts in error D.4 The cheques were not for services provided by Sim Iles Panelbeaters. I did not intend to evade tax because the cheques were not for my business. Additional facts D.5 The cheques were paid to Mrs Iles as gifts. Additional legal issue D.6 There are no additional legal issues. The cheques were not income of Sim Iles Panelbeaters. I did not intend to evade tax. D.7 The amount of penal tax charged is too high. Propositions of law D.8 Sim Iles Panelbeaters relies on the following propositions of law: Gifts are not assessable income. If a person doesn’t know that income is theirs that person cannot knowingly evade tax. From the above Notice of Response only Proposed Adjustments A & D are still unresolved. The Commis- sioner cannot issue an assessment because not all the issues have been finalised. However, the Commissioner may advise the taxpayer to make a voluntary payment on account of the tax owing. The file now progresses to the conference stage. Once the Commissioner receives Mr Iles’ Notice of Re- sponse, he will write to Mr Iles and advise whether or not he accepts the Notice of Response. If the Commis- sioner does not accept the Notice of Response he will organise a conference to try to refine and resolve the outstanding issues. 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) 4 April 1997 Bob, Bill & Jo Chartered Accountants Box 010 Neverville 1310 Attn.: Ms Smith Name: S M Iles Panelbeaters IRD number: 02-345-678 Our reference: AXR/BL3/WUZ Dear Madam Thank you for your Notice of Response dated 10 March 1997. You have accepted proposed adjustment B, so this leaves only proposed adjustments A & D unresolved. After reviewing your Notice of Response in relation to those adjustments I advise that the Commissioner still believes that proposed Adjustments A& D are correct. To help resolve this issue I will contact you to arrange a time to discuss these issues further. Yours faithfully AN Other Investigator At the conference stage Mr Iles, Mrs Iles and their accountant attend. The investigator advises them why the cheques are still considered to be income of Sim Iles Panelbeaters and therefore assessable to Mr Iles. Mr and Mrs Iles and their accountant agree to go away and reconsider their position. A further conference is arranged for a date two weeks later. At that second conference Mr Iles agrees that the cheques were income from the services of Sim Iles Panelbeaters. Mr Iles does not agree that penal tax should be charged. To ensure that this issue is final- ised the investigator asks Mr Iles to sign a written acceptance of the proposed adjustment. A written agreement is signed. The sole remaining issue is penal tax. As this issue cannot be agreed upon by further conferences the investigator issues a Disclosure Notice to Mr Iles requiring him to provide a Statement of Position. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Disclosure notice 10 May 1997 To:Mr Simon Iles P O Box 11-111 Neverville IRD No: 02-345-678 Take Notice that the Commissioner of Inland Revenue hereby requires you to provide a Statement of Position on or before 10 July 1997, being two months from the date of issue of this Notice. The Commissioner has no power to accept a Statement of Position filed after that date. However, you may apply to the High Court for additional time to file the Statement of Position, provided such application is made before the expiry date above. In terms of section 89M(3) of the Tax Administration Act 1994, the Commissioner is required to advise you of section 138G, the evidence exclusion rule. The evidence exclusion rule has the effect of preventing any further facts, evidence, issues or propositions of law being argued in a challenge, subject to limited judicial discretion, or unless the Commissioner and the taxpayer agree to add material to the Statement of Position. Accordingly, it is in your best interest to ensure all material that you consider relevant to a challenge is included in the Statement of Position. This request is issued pursuant to section 89M of the Tax Administration Act 1994 and relates to the unresolved issues arising from the Notice of Proposed Adjustment issued on 20 January 1997. If you fail to comply with the terms of this Notice within two months from the date of issue of this Notice you will be deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s position as stated in the Commissioner’s Notice of Proposed Adjustment dated 20 January 1997. DATED at Wellington this 10th day of May 1997. A. N. Other for and on behalf of the Commissioner of Inland Revenue Because the Commissioner initiated the proposed adjustment the Commissioner must attach his State- ment of Position to the Disclosure Notice. Mr Iles’ Statement of Position is received on 30 June 1997. It does not reveal any new facts or evidence so the Commissioner does not need to issue an amended Statement of Position. The investigator considers Mr Iles’ Statement of Position to satisfy himself that the proposed adjust- ment is still correct. If he considers that the proposed adjustment is still correct the file is then ready to be referred to the Adjudication Unit. The investigator collates all the documentation, NOPA, Notice of Response, Written Agreements, Statements of Position, and relevant evidence held. An Adjudication Referral coversheet is completed. 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Referral to Adjudication Cover Sheet Taxpayer:Mr Simon Iles IRD no:02-345-678 Address:P O Box 11-111 Neverville Telephone:(05) 276-4391 Agent:Ms Smith, Bob, Bill & Jo Address:P O Box 010, Neverville Telephone:(05) 294-5312 Inland Revenue Officer:A N Other Office:Wellington Telephone:(04) 2222-000 Attachments Notices(s) of Proposed Adjustment ...............................................................................

Yours faithfully AN Other Investigator Once the file is at Adjudication, the Adjudicator will review the merits of each argument and determine which is the most legally correct based on the facts, evidence, issues and propositions disclosed. The Adjudicator will then send a copy of the decision to both the investigator and the taxpayer. In this example the Adjudicator has found that penal tax should be assessed to Mr Iles. A new assessment will also be issued which will contain all the adjustments referred to in the original NOPA. The new assessment will disallow the deduction for the path, disallow 75% of the motor vehicle expenses claimed, include the cheques banked into Mrs Iles account and include an amount of penal tax. Once the assessment has been issued Mr Iles will have two months to file a case in the TRA or the High Court. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Scenario 2: Taxpayer rejects some adjustments, makes no mention of others The following Notice of Response would have achieved the same end result, except that instead of accepting Proposed Adjustment B in writing, Mr Iles would be deemed to have accepted it by not rejecting it within the response period.

Yours faithfully AN Other Investigator 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Example 3: Multi Period, Multi Revenue Audit Jay & Co were subject to a multi year, multi revenue audit. The audit started in July 1997, with the field work completed in October 1997. The investigator and Jay and Co’s Financial Controller agreed to discuss any proposed adjustments during the field work stage, and if these could not be resolved then a NOPA would be issued as soon as possible afterwards. NOPA 1 was issued on 5 September 1997. The issue concerned the deductibility of lease rental payments. Following issue of NOPA 1, Jay & Co wrote back agreeing to the adjustment. The amounts and years were: 1993$1,000.00 1994$1,200.00 1995$1,500.00 1996$2,000.00 NOPA 2 was issued on 29 September 1997. The issue concerned depreciation which was said to have been over claimed. Following a Notice of Response from Jay & Co and further discussions during the confer- ence stage, Jay & Co accepted that the adjustments were valid. The amounts and years were: 1993$180.00 1994$200.00 1995$220.00 1996$250.00 NOPA 3 was issued on 15 October 1997. There were three issues covered. The first was GST on fringe benefits, the second concerned GST input tax credits not allowable and the third issue concerned hire costs not being deductible for tax purposes. Jay & Co accepted the GST on fringe benefits adjustment by letter, and filed a Notice of Response in relation to the GST input tax credit claims. Jay & Co made no mention of hire costs. The amounts in contention and the years/periods were: GST on fringe benefits 12/95$220.00 6/96$180.00 12/96$120.00 GST input tax credits 12/95$780.00 12/96$440.00 12/96$120.00 Hire costs 1994$375.00 1995$560.00 1996$900.00 NOPA 4 was issued on 5 November 1997. The issues concerned the deductibility of planning fees, and development expenditure on a land subdivision scheme. Jay & Co called the investigator advising that they did not accept either adjustment and would file a Notice of Response in due course. The Notice of Response only referred to development expenditure. It did not mention the matter of planning fees. The amounts in contention and the years were: Planning costs 1993$1,275.00 1994$2,500.00 Development expenditure 1994$1,850.00 1995$11,000.00 NOPA 5 was issued on 27 November 1997. The issue concerned the deductibility of establishment costs for a new, wholly owned operating company that had been established by Jay & Co. Inland Revenue received a Notice of Response from Jay & Co. During the conference stage, Jay & Co agreed to the issue in writing. The tables on page 21 summarise the NOPAs issued and the status of individual issues at the end of the conference stage: 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) IncomeAgreed/deemed Tax issuesNOPA #agreed?1996199519941993 Income tax issues Lease payments1Yes$2,000.00$1,500.00$1,200.00$1,000.00 Depreciation2Yes$250.00$220.00$200.00$180.00 Hire costs3Yes$900.00$560.00$375.00 Planning fees4Yes$1,850.00$1,275.00 Development costs4No$11,000.00$2,500.00 Establishment costs5Yes$2,000.00 Agreed/deemed GST issuesNOPA #agreed?12/966/9612/95 GST on fringe benefits3Yes$120.00$180.00$220.00 GST credits disallowed3No$440.00$780.00 The Commissioner’s Statement of Position was issued in December 1997. It included a full description of the two issues still in contention, being development costs (1994 and 1995 years) and GST input tax credits (12/95 and 12/96 periods). As all other issues were agreed upon, or were deemed accepted, the Commis- sioners Statement of Position will only require a brief note to the effect that the issues have been agreed to or were deemed to be accepted. Also in December 1997, the Commissioner issued income tax assessments for the 1993 and 1996 tax years, as there were no issues still in contention in these years. A GST assessment for the 6/96 period was also issued, as there were also no unresolved issues in this period. 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Example 4: Profit from Sale of Shares Notice of Proposed Adjustment Name:Linen Co Ltd IRD number:03-456-789 Date issued:10 November 1996 Proposed adjustments 1.The Commissioner proposes to increase your assessable income for the year ended 31 March 1994 by the sum of $500,000.00 being the gain on sale of shares. Income as returned$4,500,000.00 Adjustments: gain on sale of shares $ 500,000.00 Income as Adjusted $5,000,000.00 Facts 2.In February 1993 Linen Co Ltd sold its interests in Woolmakers Ltd. This left Linen Co Ltd with surplus cash available to reinvest in a complementary business activity. In March 1993 the Board of Directors of Linen Co Ltd discussed a report obtained from its financial advisers (Money Help Ltd) which indicated that an investment in a silk producing company would be an ideal complementary business. A suitable candidate was suggested. 2.1Veiled Textiles Ltd, formerly Bird & Bird Shelf 29 Ltd, was incorporated on 1 March 1993 with a share capital of $100.00 On 1 April 1993, Linen Co Ltd purchased the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd and increased the share capital by $999,900.00 giving paid up capital of $1,000,000.00. 2.2Also on 1 April 1993, Veiled Textiles Ltd invested $1,000,000.00 in Silk Makers Ltd by way of redeemable preference shares. Silk Makers Ltd invested the funds in Thai Silk Company by way of loan. 2.3On 31 March 1994, Silk Makers Ltd redeemed its shares from Veiled Textiles Ltd. Also on 31 March 1994 Linen Co Ltd sold the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd for $1,500,000.00. The $500,000.00 gain on the sale of the shares is considered to be assessable. 2.4Neither Veiled Textiles Ltd nor Silk Makers Ltd had any assets other than the $1,000,000.00 investment. It has not been explained how the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd were worth $500,000 more than the value of the only asset ($1,000,000.00). 2.5Neither Veiled Textiles Ltd nor Silk Makers Ltd attempted to or was in a position to conduct a silk manufacturing business. The investment by Linen Co Ltd in Veiled Textiles Ltd was not for the purpose of conducting a genuine complementary business but was to enable the short term investment of surplus funds until such time as a suitable alternative presented itself. 2.6Linen Co Ltd acquired the shares for the purpose of reselling or otherwise disposing of them. Linen Co Ltd sold the shares within 12 months of acquiring them. The explanation given by Linen Co Ltd for acquiring the 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) shares is not supported by the events occurring after the shares had been acquired. The purpose of Linen Co Ltd in acquiring the shares was not diversification into a complementary business, the shares were acquired for the purpose of resale or other disposition. Tax laws 3.Section BB 4 of the Income Tax Act 1994 provides: “Without in any way limiting the meaning of the term, the assessable income any person shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to include, save so far as express provision is made in this Act to the contrary, - (c) All profits or gains derived from the sale or other disposition of any personal property or interest in personal property ( not being property or an interest in property which consists of land),... if the property was acquired for the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of it....” Issues 4.The primary issue is: Whether the gain realised on the sale of the shares is assessable to Linen Co Ltd. 4.1Secondary issues include: Whether the shares were acquired with the purpose of resale or other disposition. If there was more than one purpose for acquiring the shares, whether the dominant purpose was resale. Propositions of law 5.The Commissioner relies on the following propositions of law: Circumstances relevant in deciding whether the intention of resale exists include the nature of the asset, the number of similar transactions, the period of ownership and the circumstances of purchase and use. \[as in: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] In the case of shares, the length of time they are held is of particular importance. \[as in: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] The test of purpose is subjective requiring the consideration of the state of mind of the purchaser at the time of acquisition of the property: \[as in: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] If there is more than one purpose, the test is whether the dominant purpose is one of sale or other disposition. \[as in: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] If there is a purpose of resale it is irrelevant if the sale is a means to an end. \[as in: CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] The nature of the asset purchased is an important consideration as is the period for which it is held: \[as in CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] It is incorrect to say that the purchase of any asset as a hedge against the depreciating value of money falls outside section BB 4 (c): \[as in CIR v National Distributors Ltd (1989) 11 NZTC 6,346\] 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Notice of Response Linen Co Ltd IRD No: 03-456-789 Date of Issue: 25 November 1996 Items in error 1. No adjustment should be made to the assessable income amount returned by Linen Co Ltd for the year ended 31 March 1994. The Commissioner is not correct in his proposal to treat the gain on the sale of the shares as assessable income. The gain is a capital gain. Tax laws 2. Section BB 4 does not apply. 2.1 Capital gains are not assessable under the Income Tax Act. Facts in error 3. The shares were not purchased with the intention of resale. Additional facts 4. The shares were acquired to provide Linen Co Ltd with a subsidiary company through which it could explore new business opportunities. This was undertaken on the advice of Mr Smythe of Money Help Ltd. Those new business opportunities did not eventuate so the shares were sold. 4.1 The short term investment of funds by Silk Makers Ltd in the Thai Silk Company was part of the strategy recommended by Mr Smythe. Mr Smythe’s report recommended an indirect investment initially to enable Linen Co Ltd to easily withdraw from the investment if forays into the silk market proved not to be viable. The short term investment does not detract from the intention of Linen Co Ltd to purchase the shares for long term holding to enable exploration of a new business opportunity. 4.2 Using a subsidiary company not otherwise visibly linked to Linen Co Ltd meant that if further investment in the silk business occurred and subsequently did not prosper the goodwill of Linen Co Ltd would not be lost. 4.3 It is not correct to say that Veiled Textiles Ltd nor Silk Makers Ltd had no assets other than the $1,000,000.00 investment. The investment by Silk Makers Ltd in the Thai Company was by way of loan at 17% interest payable at the end of the term. Consequently at the time the shares were sold Silk Makers Ltd had a right to interest on the loan of $170,000.00 at net present value on the date of sale. As 100% owner of Silk Makers Ltd, Veiled Textiles Ltd also had the right to that interest had it wound up Silk Makers Ltd. The balance of the $500,000.00 can be said to be what an arm’s length party would pay for the right to access an established association with an international silk manufacturer. 4.4 The establishment of links with an international silk manufacturer is evidence that Linen Co Ltd acquired the shares in Silk Co Ltd to diversify its business affairs. 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Additional legal issues 5. There are no additional legal issues. The question remains whether the gain on sale of the shares is assessable or not. Propositions of law 6.Linen Co Ltd relies on the following propositions of law: The purpose test is subjective. As a company has no mind of its own, its purpose falls to be determined on the state of mind of the persons exercising the company’s will. It is a question of fact and degree whether the company had a subjective purpose of resale at the time of acquiring the shares. The length of time that the shares were held is not determinative of the purpose for which the shares were acquired. The length of time the shares were held must be considered in the light of the purpose for which they were acquired. Commissioner’s Statement of Position Linen Co Ltd IRD No: 03-456-789 Date of issue: 31 January 1997 Outline of facts 1.Linen Co Ltd is a limited liability company incorporated on 20 April 1967. Its directors and shareholders are Elizabeth Linen and Lance Linen, holding 100,000 shares each. 1.1In November 1992, Linen Co Ltd entered into a sale and purchase agreement for the sale of its interests in Woolmakers Ltd. The sale was finalised on 5 February 1993. After the sale of Woolmakers Ltd, Linen Co Ltd had significant surplus cash available. At the same time as the sale of Woolmakers Ltd, Linen Co Ltd sought advice from Mr Smythe of Money Help Ltd in relation to reinvestment of the surplus funds. A complementary activity was desired and on 28 February 1993 Mr Smythe provided a report to Linen Co Ltd. In that report Mr Smythe recommended that Linen Co Ltd invest in silk manufacturing; a relatively new industry in New Zealand. 1.2The report detailed how the investment could be made and noted that in the interim it may be preferable to invest in an observatory capacity rather than directly in silk manufacturing. The reason for the initial indirect investment was to enable Linen Co Ltd to withdraw from the investment if it was ultimately not suitable or the silk market was not as lucrative as anticipated. 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) 1.3In 10 March 1993 the Board of Directors of Linen Co Ltd discussed a report written by Mr Smythe of Money Help Ltd. The Board resolved to accept the advice in the report and sought urgent legal advice from its solicitors Bird & Bird to assess and implement the advice. 1.4Bird & Bird have a number of shelf companies available for clients to purchase. Bird & Bird Shelf 29 Ltd and Bird & Bird Shelf 30 Ltd were two such companies. Both companies had been incorporated on 1 March 1993 each with a share capital of $100.00 On 1 April 1993 Linen Co Ltd purchased the shares in Bird & Bird Shelf 29 Ltd. On that same date Linen Co Ltd changed the name of Bird & Bird Shelf 29 Ltd to Veiled Textiles Ltd and increased the share capital by $999,900.00 giving paid up capital of $1,000,000.00. 1.5Also on 1 April 1993 Linen Co Ltd purchased Bird & Bird Shelf 30 Ltd and changed its name to Silk Makers Ltd. Silk Makers Ltd immediately resolved to issue 1000 redeemable preference shares at a premium of $999.00 which were subscribed for by Veiled Textiles Ltd. Silk Makers Ltd invested the funds in a Thailand company, Thai Silk Company, which had direct interests in silk manufacturing. 1.6These transactions were all effected and documented as recommended in the Smythe Report. Mr Smythe had connections in Thailand and this was reported to be a common manner of investing in the new silk industry. 1.7 In August 1993 the directors of Linen Co Ltd resolved not to proceed with their silk industry foray but to focus on their Linen business. They knew that there were funds available to expand into a sewing factory if the silk investment was not continued with. In February 1994 Linen Co Ltd contacted Mr Smythe to advise that it would not be making further investment in the silk industry. Mr Smythe advised Linen Co Ltd not to wind up Veiled Textiles Ltd as he had a suitable buyer. 1.8 On 1 March 1994 Silk Makers Ltd wrote to Thai Silk Company reminding Thai Silk Company that the due date for repayment of the loan was imminent. On 3 March 1994 Silk Makers Ltd wrote to Silk Ltd advising that it would be redeeming its shares on 31 March 1994. On 15 March 1994 Linen Co Ltd entered into an agreement for sale and purchase to sell Veiled Textiles Ltd to Money Help 2 Ltd - a subsidiary of Mr Smythe’s company Money Help Ltd. 1.9On 31 March 1994 Thai Silk Company repaid its loan to Silk Makers Ltd and Silk Makers Ltd redeemed its shares from Veiled Textiles Ltd. Also on 31 March 1994 Linen Co Ltd sold the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd for $1,500,000.00. The $500,000.00 gain on the sale of the shares is considered to be assessable. 1.10 Neither Silk Co Ltd nor Silk Makers Ltd held any assets other than the $1,000,000.00 investment. The investment by Silk Makers Ltd in the Thai Company was by way of loan at 17% interest payable at the end of the term. At the time the shares were sold Silk Makers Ltd had a right to interest on the loan of $170,000 at net present value on the date of sale. As 100% owner of Silk Makers Ltd, Silk Co Ltd also had the right to that interest had it wound up Silk Makers Ltd. The balance of the $500,000.00 is said to be what an arm’s length party would pay for the right to access an established association with an international silk manufacturer. 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) 1.11 The extent of the association with an international silk manufacturer is minimal. Veiled Textiles Ltd via its subsidiary had lent $1,000,000.00 to a Thai company. No further feasibility studies were completed. No liaisons between Linen Co Ltd, Veiled Textiles Ltd or Silk Makers Ltd and the Thai company had occurred. Silk and Silk Makers Ltd had no separate staff of their own. No Linen Co employees had visited Thailand to learn about the silk industry. At no stage during the 12 month period did Linen Co Ltd or its subsidiaries contact personnel agencies or international silk experts with a view to employing them to run or establish a silk business. 1.12 From the date of its first investment in a silk company, Linen Co Ltd made no further moves to support its claim that it was intending to diversify into the silk business. At best Linen Co bought the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd for short term purposes, knowing that it was only committed to the investment for the 12 month duration of the Silk Makers loan or such shorter duration if it could on-sell the loan. 1.13 Neither Silk Co Ltd nor Silk Makers attempted to or was in a position to conduct a silk manufacturing business. The investment by Linen Co Ltd in Silk Co Ltd was not for the purpose of conducting a genuine complementary business but was to enable the short term investment of surplus funds until such time as a suitable alternative presented itself. Such an alternative may have ultimately been in the silk industry, but in reality was not. Linen Co Ltd invested the funds in an activity which could have become permanent but which was not at the time the shares in Veiled Textiles Ltd were acquired. 1.14 Once the funds from Veiled Textiles Ltd were obtained they were applied toward the acquisition of a sewing factory - Merry Machinists. Plans for this acquisition had begun during the 12 month duration of the Veiled Textiles Ltd holding. 1.15 Linen Co Ltd acquired the shares for the purpose of reselling or otherwise disposing of them. Linen Co Ltd sold the shares within 12 months of acquiring them. The explanation given by Linen Co for acquiring the shares is not supported by the events occurring after the shares had been acquired. The purpose of Linen Co Ltd in acquiring the shares was not diversification into a complementary business. The shares were acquired to enable short term placement of surplus funds in a liquid investment to ensure their availability for long term placement once a suitable investment had been determined. The shares were therefore acquired for the purpose of resale or other disposition.

Oral evidence of Elizabeth Carter Oral evidence of Bill Carter Oral evidence of Sam Bird, Bird & Bird Oral evidence of Mr Sim - Thai Silk Company Outline of issues 4.1The primary issue is: Whether the gain realised on the sale of the shares is assessable to Linen Co Ltd. 4.2Secondary issues include: Whether the shares were acquired with the purpose of resale or other disposition. If there was more than one purpose for acquiring the shares, whether the dominant purpose was resale. Propositions of law 5.The Commissioner relies on the following propositions of law: Although the test of purpose is subjective, where the taxpayer is a company it is the subjective purpose in the minds of those in control of the company which is determinative. When subjective purposes are in issue the statements of the taxpayer, or someone who can speak for the taxpayer, are important evidence. These statements must be assessed and tested in the totality of circumstances which will include the nature of the asset, the vocation of the taxpayer, the circumstances of the purchase, the number of similar transactions, the length of time the property was held and the circumstances of the use and disposal of the asset. Actions may speak louder than words and the totality of the circumstances may negate the asserted purpose of the purchase. The length of time the shares are held before being sold is regarded of particular importance. If there is more than one purpose, the test is whether the dominant purpose is one of sale or other disposition If there is a purpose of resale it is irrelevant if the sale is a means to an end. The nature of the asset purchased is an important consideration as is the period for which it is held It is incorrect to say that the purchase of any asset as a hedge against the depreciating value of money falls outside section BB 4(c). 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) This is the taxpayer’s Statement of Position: Statement of Position Linen Co Ltd IRD No. XX-XXX-XXX Date of issue: 25 November 1996 1. Facts 1.1The facts are largely the same as those outlined in the Commissioner’s Statement of Position. 1.2The following additional facts are relevant. The shares were acquired to provide Linen Co Ltd with a subsidiary company through which it could explore new business opportunities. This was undertaken on the advice of Mr Smythe of Money Help Ltd. Those new business opportunities did not eventuate so the shares were sold. 1.3The short term investment of funds by Silk Makers Ltd in the Thai Silk Company was part of the strategy recommended by Mr Smythe. Mr Smythe’s report recommended an indirect investment initially to enable Linen Co Ltd to easily withdraw from the investment if forays into the silk market proved not to be viable. The short term investment does not detract from the intention of Linen Co Ltd to purchase the shares for long term holding to enable exploration of a new business opportunity. 1.4Using a subsidiary company not otherwise visibly linked to Linen Co Ltd meant that if further investment in the silk business occurred and subsequently did not prosper the goodwill of Linen Co Ltd would not be lost. 1.5It is not correct to say that Veiled Textiles Ltd nor Silk Makers Ltd had no assets other than the $1,000,000.00 investment. The investment by Silk Makers Ltd in the Thai Company was by way of loan at 17% interest payable at the end of the term. Consequently at the time the shares were sold Silk Makers Ltd had a right to interest on the loan of $170,000.00 at net present value on the date of sale. As 100% owner of Silk Makers Ltd, Veiled Textiles Ltd also had the right to that interest had it wound up Silk Makers Ltd. The balance of the $500,000.00 can be said to be what an arm’s length party would pay for the right to access an established association with an international silk manufacturer. 1.6The establishment of links with an international silk manufacturer is evidence that Linen Co Ltd acquired the shares in Silk Co Ltd to diversify its business affairs. 2. Issues 2.1. The issues arising are those set out in the Commissioner’s Statement of Position. 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) 3. Evidence 3.1The evidence relied on by Linen Co is largely the same as that outlined in the Commissioner’s Statement of Position. 3.2The following additional evidence is relied on. Oral evidence of Mr Singh - Managing Director Ms Milton - Financial Controller Mr Smart - Accountant Mr Wood - Thailand agent. 4. Propositions of law 4.1Linen Co Ltd relies on the following propositions of law: The purpose test is subjective. As a company has no mind of its own, its purpose falls to be determined on the state of mind of the persons exercising the company’s will. It is a question of fact and degree whether the company had a subjective purpose of resale at the time of acquiring the shares. The length of time that the shares were held is not determinative of the purpose for which the shares were acquired. The length of time the shares were held must be considered in the light of the purpose for which they were acquired. 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Example 5: Late NOPA, Application of Section 113, Tax Administration Act 1994 In June 1996, Anna McAble filed her 1996 IR 5 tax return, which included details of income from her job as a teacher, and the interest income from her bank account. A notice of assessment was issued on 24 June, which showed that she had tax to pay of $45.63. On 21 July Ms McAble went to Korea to teach English for four months. In December 1996, when Ms McAble returned to New Zealand, she wrote to her local Inland Revenue office, enclosing two receipts for donations relating to the 1996 financial year: 123 Trundle St Thorndon 5 December 1996 Dear Sir/Madam I’m writing about my 1996 tax return, which I completed and filed in June before going overseas. My IRD Number is 04-567-890 During the 1996 year I made donations to the New Zealand Foundation for the Blind and the local branch of New Zealand Purple political party. I was going to claim the donation rebate for these payments when I filed my return, but I hadn’t received a receipt from New Zealand Purple, and couldn’t find my receipt from the New Zealand Foundation for the Blind before leaving. When I returned from teaching in Korea I found that the receipt from the Blind Foundation had been in my desk all along, but in the wrong envelope. I have now also received a receipt from New Zealand Purple. Here are both receipts; please could you calculate the correct rebate for me. Your early response would be appreciated. A McAble 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) As a result of this letter, Mr John Smith, an officer of Inland Revenue wrote to Ms McAble as follows: Inland Revenue Private Bag Rukuhia Phone (05) 495 7900 Extension 86412 12 December 1996 Dear Ms McAble IRD No: 04-567-890 Our reference: RKH/PCS/JKS Thank you for your letter of 5 December about your 1996 tax return. The Tax Administration Act 1994 governs when you may adjust a return you have filed. Specifically, you may dispute an assessment by issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment, providing you do so within the applicable response period (two months from the date of the assessment in this case). However, your request is outside the period in which such a Notice may be considered. Regardless of the above, I accept that a rebate of up to $500 is allowable for donations made to charitable organisations. Section 113 authorises the Commissioner to alter an assessment to ensure that it is correct at any time, so under that section I have accepted your request to have a rebate calculated on the basis of your $600 donation to the New Zealand Foundation for the Blind. You will shortly receive an amended assessment allowing this rebate. New Zealand Purple is not a registered charitable organisation, so I cannot accept your request to claim a rebate for this donation. If you disagree with this decision you may wish to issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment. As discussed earlier, generally you must issue such a Notice within the two month response period following the date of the Notice of Assessment. However, the Commissioner may accept a late Notice if he considers that exceptional circumstances have prevented the taxpayer from issuing the Notice of Proposed Adjustment within the applicable response period. If you consider that exceptional circumstances have prevented you from issuing a Notice of Proposed Adjustment previously, you must now write to us detailing the reasons why your notice is late, and enclose your Notice of Proposed Adjustment. I have enclosed a copy of our booklet Disputing an Assessment (IR 210J) for your information. Yours faithfully John Smith 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) As a result of the previous letter, Ms McAble sent the following letter, along with a Notice of Proposed Adjust- ment. 123 Trundle St Thorndon 19 December 1996 Dear Mr Smith IRD Number: 04-567-890 Your reference: RKH/PCS/JKS Thank you for your letter dated 12 December. When I made my donation to New Zealand Purple they told me that donations were ‘tax deductible’ - I probably wouldn’t have given them anything otherwise!! I believe from what they told me I am entitled to a rebate for the donation made, therefore I enclose my Notice of Proposed Adjustment for the ’96 tax year. I apologise for its lateness, however after reading your booklet, I believe that it could be said that ‘exceptional circumstances’ have prevented me from issuing it earlier. Although I knew that a receipt from the party was going to be posted shortly, I filed my return without claiming the rebate because I was going overseas, and wanted to tidy up my affairs. I knew that the assessment showing tax to pay would come out while I was away, but didn’t worry about it because I thought I would get a refund (eventually), when I sent in my claim for a donation rebate. My mother did tell me in a letter (in August) that the receipt had arrived, but I did not think it was important that any thing be done at that stage. I anticipate your early reply. A McAble Mr Smith subsequently replied to Ms McAble, stating that the reasons given for failure to issue her Notice of Proposed Adjustment did not amount to exceptional circumstances, and therefore the Commissioner was unable to accept it. Ms McAble knew that the assessment was incorrect when filing her return, but she did not take any actions to ensure that it would be corrected within the two months after the issuing of the assessment. The Commissioner was required to accept the adjustment for the donation made to New Zealand Foundation for the Blind because of the provisions of Section 113 of the Tax Administration Act, under which he is required, at any time, to make alterations to an assessment to ensure that it is correct. 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Audit procedures Purpose of an audit The purpose of an audit is to ensure that the correct amount of tax has been paid and that taxpayers’ obligations under the various Inland Revenue Acts have been complied with. An audit might simply be a check of a GST registration, or it could be a full examination of business records. For a detailed de- scription of Inland Revenue’s audit procedures, see our booklet A Guide to Inland Revenue Audits (IR 297). How audits are undertaken Each type of audit is conducted differently, although the basic procedures are the same. For example, payroll audits may only take one visit, while an investigation often requires repeat visits by an investi- gator to work at a taxpayer’s place of business. Audits may also vary according to the nature of the taxpayer’s business activities. At Inland Revenue we’ve divided our service areas into various segments based on taxpayers’ needs. The segments are: • Personal Customer Services - for non-business individuals not represented by a tax practitioner • Business Direct - for business and other customers not represented by a tax practitioner • Business Link - for business and other customers represented by a tax practitioner • Corporates - for business groups with a consolidated turnover exceeding $100 million, and specified industries such as banking and insurance • Child Support - for custodial and non-custodial parents or guardians. How taxpayers may be chosen for an audit A taxpayer may be chosen for an audit based on any one or more of the following: • a computer analysis of the taxpayer’s business accounts or tax returns • a manual analysis of the taxpayer’s business ac- counts or tax returns • checking of third party records (such as employer or bank records) and matching to the taxpayer’s records • information received in another audit which suggests that the taxpayer’s records should be checked • a taxpayer’s compliance record (whether the tax- payer has complied with the tax laws in the past) • a taxpayer’s payment record (whether the taxpayer has paid taxes on time in the past) • selection of a particular industry • examination of a particular issue or problem which affects a group of taxpayers • a taxpayer’s place of residence or location of busi- ness if a particular area is selected for audit • information received from other taxpayers • a random basis. We will not tell taxpayers which specific factor or factors led to their selection for an audit. Case familiarisation Investigators work in teams comprising a team leader and several team members. The team leader has a quality control function, but investigators are responsi- ble for their own audits. The case familiarisation phase of an audit task in- volves an investigator researching background infor- mation in order to make informed decisions about whether to carry out subsequent phases of the audit. Case preparation Once a decision is made to undertake an audit, the investigator will prepare the case. This phase of the audit involves research to confirm that the issues identified warrant further work. At the end of this research the investigator will generally formulate a Case Plan. Each case has its own characteristics, so there is no set format for the case plan. It will be based on characteristics specific to the case. Before an audit proceeds beyond the case preparation stage, the investigator will discuss the case plan with the team leader. Following this discussion the team leader may change the focus of the audit if appropri- ate. Starting the audit We will normally send the taxpayer a letter advising of an impending audit. On rare occasions, and only if special circumstances exist, an audit may start with an unannounced visit. An example of this is that Inland Revenue will make unannounced visits to premises and spot check both payroll and GST records to ensure that businesses are in the tax system. The letter which notifies a taxpayer of an impending audit will advise the scope of the audit, ask for the records and information required and make arrange- ments for an initial interview. If a taxpayer questions the Commissioner’s authority to request information or records, we may issue a section 17 letter. Emphasis will be placed on reviewing all the information and records that are considered necessary and relevant. If there is delay in providing information and records, or doubt cast on the ability to review certain records, we will consider issuing a section 17 letter. The initial letter generally won’t refer to section 17. However, the use of section 17 requests reinforces the 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) policy behind the disclosure procedure/evidence exclusion rule that the tax disputes process will only work if there is full disclosure of the matters required. Hence if an informal request for information or records is not complied with, we will request the information or records by way of a formal section 16 or 17 demand. For larger, team audits, there may be a courtesy phone call advising of an upcoming audit. This will be followed up with a letter which sets out the issues to be discussed at the initial meeting. It is at this stage that the scope of the audit, type of records to be reviewed, the expected duration of the field work phase and details such as accommodation, access to records, taxpayers’ office hours, how issues identified will be dealt with in the first instance, audit progress meetings, liaison person and other administrative issues will be discussed. The type of contact and the manner in which initial meetings will be conducted will depend on the nature of the audit. Contact during the audit Our emphasis is on resolving issues early, so commu- nication between the investigator and the taxpayer will be an important issue. We expect that all parties to the audit will conduct themselves in a professional and co- operative manner at all times. Early in the audit there should be discussion on the manner in which issues will be progressed. There could be any number of arrangements, e.g.. advising the taxpayer as each issue arises, or putting informa- tion requests in writing on an issue-by-issue basis, or awaiting the completion of field work before issues are tabled. Once an arrangement is made between the investigator and the taxpayer, every effort should be made to abide by it. There should be some form of communication if the agreed arrangements cannot be adhered to by either side for whatever reason. If the taxpayer feels that there has been a lack of communi- cation, he or she should approach the investigator in the first instance. We anticipate that this communication will lead to the resolution of many issues. Inland Revenue will seek written agreement on issues. The sooner issues are resolved at this stage, the earlier an audit can be completed. In some cases the process could involve swapping letters or issue papers which detail Inland Revenue’s views on particular issues. These will not be a substitute for the NOPA. They are a means of identifying and hopefully agreeing on issues. If agreement cannot be reached, then generally a NOPA will be issued. Technical input Our investigators will seek technical assistance from other segments of Inland Revenue as required. In each Service Centre there will be sufficient technical and legal support to address the more complex cases/ issues. Review of records This phase of an audit involves a review of the business and if appropriate, the private records of the taxpayer. The purpose of the review is to familiarise the investi- gator with the operational processes of the business and to sight evidence to support the tax treatment of transactions recorded in the taxpayer’s tax returns. The investigator may review the taxpayer’s business and private records, tax returns and the working papers of both the taxpayer and the taxpayer’s agent. As the extent or nature of the taxpayer’s records will generally not be known before an audit starts, the initial request for information may be insufficient. Information subsequently supplied by the taxpayer may lead to further issues arising, in which case the investigator will discuss the matter further with the taxpayer and if necessary, request further information. The aim at all times is to gather the information and records which are necessary to resolve an issue. The sooner “all cards are on the table”, the sooner the issue can be resolved/finalised. We will make every attempt to resolve issues which could be contentious before the issue of a NOPA. Requests for information will vary with the type and scope of an audit. Source records will be reviewed in almost all cases. We expect that the combined effect of the new penalties rules and the evidence exclusion rule will ensure that taxpayers improve their record keeping habits, especially in regards to transactional documenta- tion. The types of records that may be reviewed include such records as organisation and group structure charts, tax work papers, tax and accounting work paper files, statutory financial statements, management accounts, general and private ledgers, trial balances, charts of accounts, management and board meeting minutes, journals, minute books, contracts, suppliers’ vouchers and sales invoices, correspondence between associated parties, inter-company memos, bank statements, motor vehicle log books, accountants’ questionnaires, execu- tives’ file indexes, consolidation work papers, employee files/employment contracts, seal registers, accounting and tax policy manuals, copies of tax advice received, solicitors’/barristers’ advice if fraud, tax avoidance or evasion is involved, auditors’ work papers, stock sheets, depreciation schedules and year end work papers. Inland Revenue has recently started auditing taxpay- ers’ computer systems. We generally undertake this some weeks before the actual field work phase of an audit. If a taxpayer’s computer records are to be audited, then we will give advance notice of this event and discuss it fully with the taxpayer. Computer tax auditing has a distinct advantage in timely completion of an audit, which benefits both Inland Revenue and taxpayers. 38 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 - Appendix (August 1996) Appendix to TIB Volume Eight, No.3August 1996 Disputes Resolution This appendix contains worked examples of the Disputes Resolution process.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Introduction to the new disputes resolution process New procedures for resolving tax disputes come into effect from 1 October 1996. This Tax Information Bulletin sets out how the new procedures will operate. In particular, it sets out the administrative procedures that Inland Revenue will follow when conducting audits and assessing taxpayers. The appendix to this TIB gives worked examples of the new procedures, and sets out general audit procedures. These new procedures are established by changes to the Tax Administration Act 1994, other Inland Revenue Acts, and the Commissioner’s administrative practices. There are also new High Court Rules and Taxation Review Authority Regulations, and changes to the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994. The new procedures apply to disputes relating to taxes, levies, duties, penalties and other amounts payable to the Commissioner under the tax laws. Specifically, they apply to: •disputed assessments issued under tax legislation •disputed determinations issued under tax legislation, such as loss determinations and determinations of employer/employee relationships. The new procedures do not apply to assessments issued to liable parents under the Child Support Act 1991 or to ACC premium assessments. The legislative amendments were contained in the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolu- tion Bill 1995. Their purpose is to ensure that: •Assessments are as correct as practicable, first time. •Disputes over tax liability are dealt with fairly, efficiently and quickly. Current audit procedures remain largely unchanged up to what is currently the final interview stage. The new procedures will be used when proposed adjustments are still in dispute. Similarly, the procedures are unchanged for taxpayer or agent-initiated adjustments until such time as the taxpayer wishes to dispute the Commission- er’s decision not to alter the assessment. The new procedures aim to ensure a correct assessment by: •promoting early identification of issues •improving the accuracy of the Commissioner’s decisions in respect of assessments •reducing the number of disputes by ensuring full disclosure •encouraging prompt and efficient resolution of dis- putes. The new provisions implement recommendations made by the Organisational Review Committee in its report Organisational Review of the Inland Revenue Depart- ment. They place increased emphasis on information disclo- sure and discussions between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or agent. The procedures are designed to ensure that each party to the dispute is fully informed of the facts, evidence, issues, propositions of law and interpretations upon which each party’s position is based on. The combined effect of section 17 information requests and an evidence exclusion rule mean that an “all cards on the table” approach will help to resolve disputes as quickly as possible. Built into the pre-assessment process for resolving disputes is provision for conferences between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or agent. Further, within Inland Revenue there is a new Adjudication Unit which provides an impartial and objective review of unresolved disputes between the taxpayer and the Commissioner. Page 44 of this TIB lists the Amendment Acts that were enacted by the Taxpayer Compliance, Penalties, and Disputes Resolution Bill 1995. The Taxpayer Compli- ance and Penalties section of the Bill will be covered in a separate TIB. The new disputes resolution process in context The package is designed to encourage voluntary compli- ance by taxpayers. This is achieved by: •clarifying the behaviour required of taxpayers, and by implication that which is unacceptable •providing comprehensive penalties for non-compliance, including an increase in penalties for hindrance and a reduction in penalties for co- operation and assistance •simplifying lines of authority within Inland Revenue •providing access to efficient and effective means of enforcement such as court orders and prosecution. The new disputes resolution procedures are part of a package of reforms which include: •legislative enactment of taxpayer obligations •enhancement of the Commissioner’s ability to enforce requests for information under section 17 •more comprehensive compliance and penalties rules which come into effect for the 1997-98 income year for standard balance date taxpayers (i.e., 1 April 1997) •a customer segment-based organisational structure within Inland Revenue which identifies and targets taxpayer needs and risks. continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) ards of full and timely disclosure apply to both taxpay- ers and the Commissioner. The nature of the documents required under the new process, combined with an impartial review by a team of technical experts before an assessment is made, encourages both consistency and quality in technical decisions. The new section 17A of the Tax Administration Act 1994 provides that the Commissioner has access to Court Orders to enforce compliance with requests for informa- tion. We expect that this will result in the expeditious gathering of information. All information necessary for an audit should be made available at the earliest possible stage. If information requested has not been produced, or if there have been unnecessary delays in producing it, the Commissioner will seek Court Orders and at the same time will consider prosecution action for failure to furnish information. The combined effect of section 17A and the evidence exclusion rule means that the “all cards on the table” approach to resolving disputes should be reached at the earliest possible stage. The new procedures are designed to encourage full and open discussion between the Commissioner and taxpayer or agents throughout the audit process. We will issue a separate TIB shortly to outline in greater detail the new compliance and penalty provi- sions. In terms of the new disputes resolution process, taxpayers or agents can expect penalties to be consid- ered as part of the audit process. from page 1 The new disputes resolution procedures build on taxpayers’ obligations to ensure that their taxation affairs are in order. In addition to requiring full disclo- sure on a timely basis and penalising tardy or unco- operative behaviour, the Tax Administration Act now contains a new section 15B, which outlines taxpayers’ primary tax obligations. These obligations are to: (a)correctly determine the amount of tax payable by the taxpayer under the tax laws (b)deduct or withhold the correct amounts of tax from payments or receipts of the taxpayer when required to do so by the tax laws (c)pay tax on time (d)keep all necessary information (including books and records) and maintain all necessary accounts or balances required under the tax laws (e)disclose to the Commissioner in a timely and useful way all information (including books and records) that the tax laws require the taxpayer to disclose (f)co-operate, to the extent required by the Revenue Acts, with the Commissioner in a way that assists the exercise of the Commissioner’s powers under the tax laws (g)comply with all other obligations imposed on the taxpayer by the tax laws. In the new disputes resolution process the same stand- Application The new disputes resolution procedures deal with these situations: 1.When the taxpayer disagrees with any of the follow- ing actions which the Commissioner intends to undertake: •issuing a taxpayer with an assessment or deter- mination that differs from the amount or basis declared in the taxpayer’s tax or other return •amending an existing assessment or determina- tion based on new information •issuing a taxpayer with an assessment and the taxpayer has not filed a tax or other return •making a disputable decision. 2.When the Commissioner issues an assessment or a determination instead of a NOPA, and the taxpayer has not previously accepted the assessment or determination in writing, and the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment. 3.When the Commissioner issues an assessment or a determination instead of a NOPA, and the taxpayer wishes to alter a previously-filed return, but the Commissioner disagrees with the taxpayer’s pro- posed adjustment. 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) The new disputes resolution procedures introduce a number of new concepts as well as changes to present practices. This section introduces the key concepts that you need to know about. These concepts are fully described from page 11 onwards. The following is a brief description of the key changes and concepts. The Commissioner will generally issue a Notice of Proposed Adjustment (NOPA) in either of these situations: 1.If the Commissioner wishes to issue a taxpayer with an assessment or determination which differs from the amount or basis declared in the taxpayer’s return. 2.If the Commissioner wishes to amend an existing assessment based upon new information, and in either case, the taxpayer does not agree with that assessment or proposed assessment. The NOPA will set out the details of the assessment or amended assessment which the Commissioner proposes. A taxpayer or agent is able to issue a taxpayer NOPA to the Commissioner if the Commissioner has issued an assessment or determination without first issuing a NOPA to the taxpayer or agent. A taxpayer’s NOPA must contain the same information as is required in the Commissioner’s NOPA. A NOPA is a written document containing all of the following: •the items the Commissioner or taxpayer proposes should be adjusted (an itemised description by nature and amount, with supporting calculations, for each proposed adjustment. Penalties, including penal tax (if any) will be included in a Commissioner’s NOPA.) •the tax laws upon which the proposed adjustments are based (the section or sections of the Revenue Acts relied upon for each separate adjustment) •the facts giving rise to the proposed adjustments (including reference to source documents, contracts, memoranda and other evidence bearing on the facts. Full details are essential to enable consideration of all the facts and issues.) •the legal issues in respect of the proposed adjustments (the legal questions raised by each proposed adjust- ment, including tax laws relied upon) •the propositions of law relied on or distinguished in respect of the proposed adjustments (the reason for taking a particular position stated in terms of estab- lished law. Leading case authorities may be cited here.) A NOPA may contain more than one issue, relate to more than one period and relate to more than one tax type. If a taxpayer or the Commissioner disagrees with one or more of the proposed adjustments in a NOPA, he or she must notify the other party by means of a Notice of Response within two months from the date of issue of the NOPA. A Notice of Response is a written document which: •specifies which items are not agreed with or consid- ered erroneous •specifies the tax laws relied upon •outlines facts contained in the NOPA which are in error •outlines any additional facts •outlines any additional legal issues arising from the NOPA •states the propositions of law relied on in relation to the notice. The definition of taxpayer has been amended. A taxpayer is defined as a person who: •is liable to perform, or comply with, a tax obligation; or •may take a tax position whether as principal, or as an agent or employee or officer of another person. There is a provision relating to adjustments accepted in writing. Once adjustments proposed by the Commis- sioner have been accepted in writing, no further chal- lenge can be made to those adjustments. The legislation also defines response period. This is generally two months from the date of issue of the originating document (NOPA, assessment, disclosure notice or disputable decision). The two month response period is not varied in cases when the period embraces all or part of the Christmas holiday break. Deemed acceptance occurs if there has been no re- sponse to an originating document within the response period. Deemed acceptance results in the loss of rights to challenge the adjustments further. A taxpayer’s late response will be deemed to be received within the response period if exceptional circum- stances apply. Exceptional circumstances are circum- stances which: continued on page 4 Summary - key changes and concepts 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Once the parties have completed their Statements of Position, the evidence exclusion rule applies. Under the evidence exclusion rule, both the taxpayer and the Commissioner are limited in any challenge to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law disclosed in their respective statements of position. The evidence exclusion rule is subject to a judicial discretion to admit previously undisclosed matters. The applicant must show that he or she could not, with due diligence, have found or discovered this material at the time of delivery of his or her Statement of Position, and admission of those items is necessary to avoid manifest injustice. Disputes that aren’t resolved at the disclosure stage or earlier will generally be referred to Inland Revenue’s Adjudication Unit. The Adjudicator is delegated the Commissioner’s power to assess. The Adjudicator exercises this power in a manner that is quite separate from other areas of Inland Revenue, in particular from Operations, as a crucial part of ensuring impartiality. The Adjudicator’s focus is to consider the correct application of the law and determine whether the facts of the case meet the requirements of the legislation. Adjudication also brings an impartial fresh perspective to the dispute. The Adjudicator will not revisit issues which have been resolved during the course of the audit process. Adjudication is an administrative procedure; not a legislative requirement. A disputable decision is an assessment or a decision of the Commissioner under a tax law that may be subject to an objection or a challenge. If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with a disputable decision, he or she may challenge it by filing Court proceedings. There are three different Court forums; the Taxation Review Authority’s Small Claims Jurisdiction, the TRA’s General Jurisdiction, and High Court. These are all explained below. The Commissioner’s policy on the use of information Requests under section 17 of the Tax Administration Act 1994 has been revised to suit the objectives of the new disputes resolution process: •The Commissioner will issue Section 17 requests as required when there is a dispute between the Commis- sioner and a taxpayer over a proposed adjustment. Such requests will be directed at specific issues, and will seek confirmation in writing that the request has been complied with. •New section 17A permits the Commissioner to seek a Court Order for the production of information. This •are beyond the taxpayer’s control; and •provide reasonable justification for a late response. An act or omission of a taxpayer’s agent is not an exceptional circumstance, unless the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent and meets both of the following conditions: •It could not have been anticipated. •It could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. The Commissioner’s late response will be deemed to have been received within the response period if excep- tional circumstances apply. Such circumstances must meet both of the following conditions: •They must be beyond the control of the Commis- sioner. •They must provide reasonable justification for a late response. Before issuing a late notice rejecting a taxpayer’s NOPA, the Commissioner must obtain from the High Court an order allowing the late issue. Reasonable justification includes a change to a tax law, or a new tax law, or a Court decision on a tax law, that is enacted or made within the response period. The statute (time) bar provision has been amended to: •expire four years from the end of the year/period in which a tax return is filed •allow a taxpayer to waive the statute (time) bar for a period of up to six months. A conference process is incorporated into the new procedures to ensure that the parties have every chance to resolve issues during the dispute. A conference may occur at any stage considered beneficial and there may be several throughout the process. The conference is an administrative procedure and is not a legislative re- quirement. The disclosure notice procedure is started by the Commissioner. It requires both the Commissioner and the taxpayer to “lay their cards on the table” by detail- ing, in writing, their respective Statements of Position. Each party’s Statement of Position must contain all of the following for each adjustment still in dispute: •the facts and evidence •the issues considered to arise •the propositions of law to be relied on. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) is an alternative to prosecution action for failure to furnish information. These are the key features of the TRA’s new Small Claims Jurisdiction: •The taxpayer can elect for the case to go to the Small Claims Jurisdiction. •There is a $50 filing fee, payable by the taxpayer. •Its jurisdiction is limited to cases in which the disputed tax amount is $15,000 or less. •It can only hear simple cases in which the facts are clear and not in dispute. •The taxpayer can represent himself/herself, or use an agent. •Its decisions are non-precedential. •There is no right of appeal. •Decisions are not published. There are no significant changes to cases heard in the TRA’s General Jurisdiction. The only significant change to cases heard in the High Court is that the High Court rules have been amended. To take a case to the TRA (either jurisdiction) or the High Court, the taxpayer must issue proceedings in the relevant authority within two months of whichever of the following applies: •the date the amended assessment was issued, if the Commissioner issued the NOPA and the adjustment imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability •the date the amended assessment was issued, if the taxpayer issued the NOPA and the Commissioner has rejected some part of it •the date the Commissioner issued a written notice that the adjustment will not be made, if the taxpayer issued the NOPA and the Commissioner’s rejection does not result in an amended assessment. This two month time limit can be extended by judicial discretion if there are exceptional circumstances. For this purpose exceptional circumstances is defined as an event or circumstance beyond the taxpayer’s control, which gives the taxpayer a reasonable justifica- tion for not challenging an assessment or determination within the prescribed two-month period. An act or omission of a taxpayer’s agent, employee or tax adviser is generally not an exceptional circumstance. If the Commissioner intends to prosecute, this action must be completed before any penal tax or shortfall penalty is imposed. To impose penal tax or a shortfall penalty, the Commis- sioner must issue the taxpayer with an assessment notice showing the amount of the penalty. The new procedures do not affect taxpayers’ rights to judicial review. 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Summary charts - steps in disputes resolution process Diagram 1: Pre-assessment phase - Commissioner issues a Notice of Proposed Adjustment This diagram shows the procedures usually followed when the Commissioner proposes an adjustment to a return.

A dispute arises when the taxpayer and the Commissioner have not reached agreement on a proposed adjustment at the completion of the field work. The new disputes resolution process emphasises early resolution of the dispute by encouraging full disclosure by both the Commissioner and the taxpayer to ensure the assessment is as correct as possible the first time. The new procedures are designed to ensure that informa- tion and evidence gathering are completed during the pre-assessment phase. The procedures will not apply if an audit has started and the taxpayer makes a voluntary disclosure, which has been agreed to in writing. Result- ing penal tax or shortfall penalties which are not agreed to will be dealt with under the new procedures. The new procedures rely on a series of information disclosures between the Commissioner and a taxpayer, designed to ensure that each is fully informed of the facts, evidence, issues (including penalties if applicable), propositions of law and interpretations upon which their respective positions are based. Full knowledge of each other’s position is expected to reduce the potential for disputes and to materially assist in the early resolution of disputes which do arise. The main impact of the new procedures on field activity is the expectation of early disclosure of information. The procedures will also affect the timing of the issue of an assessment. When the field work has been completed but no agreement has been reached on some or all of the issues identified the Commissioner will not automatically issue an assessment. The next step will depend on the status of the issues identified. Commencing the dispute process Identifying the issues Once the field work has been completed there are a number of possible outcomes: •All of the issues are agreed and no discrepancy results. Inland Revenue will issue a letter finalising the audit once the case is independently approved, usually by the reporting officer. •All of the issues are agreed and a discrepancy arises. The investigator and the taxpayer will record the adjustments in writing. The adjustments will then be independently approved, usually by the reporting officer. Inland Revenue will issue an assessment(s) incorporating the adjustments. •Some of the issues are agreed and others are disputed. The investigator will issue a NOPA or series of NOPAs covering disputed issues. Issues which have not been agreed to in writing will be addressed fully within a NOPA. If several return periods are involved and there are no disputes for some periods, Inland revenue will issue assessments for those periods. (These assessments cannot later be challenged). The remaining periods will generally proceed to the NOPA stage. We will not issue partial assessments for periods in which some issues remain in dispute. •The issues are identified but clarification is needed. To continue the audit, the investigator may issue a section 17 request for any outstanding information or may issue a NOPA. •None of the issues are agreed. The issues will be included in one or more NOPAs. If a proposed adjustment results in tax to pay, the taxpayer can make a voluntary tax payment at any time to meet the proposed liability. This would reduce use of money interest (UOMI) that may accrue during finalisa- tion of the audit. Usually the Commissioner will issue a NOPA if there are unresolved issues at the end of the field work phase of an audit. Generally, the auditor will advise the taxpayer that a NOPA is being issued. This can be by letter, phone call or fax. This pragmatic approach may not always be possible, so failure to advise the taxpayer or agent before issuing a NOPA does not render the NOPA invalid. We intend to adopt this approach for other notices issued by the Commissioner, such as the Disclosure Notice. We also expect that taxpayers and their agents will adopt this pragmatic approach. Status and purpose of the NOPA Section 89F Tax Administration Act 1994 The purpose of the NOPA is to ensure that both the Commissioner and the taxpayer are talking about the same issues and are aware of the arguments on which the other party is relying. This is achieved by setting out all of the following in writing: •the items the Commissioner or taxpayer proposes to adjust •the tax laws upon which the proposed adjustments are based •the facts giving rise to the proposed adjustments •the legal issues in respect of the proposed adjustments •the propositions of law relied upon or distinguished in respect of the proposed adjustments. Reducing these points to writing emphasises the need to review the positions taken and fosters open and frank discussion early in the resolution process. When written agreement has been reached on some issues but others are unresolved, a NOPA will be issued continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) new adjustment is proposed or the basis for the first adjustment has fundamentally changed a new NOPA may be issued. For example, when a NOPA contains a proposed adjustment related to depreciation deductions and discussion raises an issue related to calculation of depreciation recovered, a further NOPA will be issued. Another example could be when a case is referred back by Adjudication for rework as one or both of the parties to the dispute are arguing on an incorrect basis. For further discussion on this issue, see “What happens if key arguments are missed” on page 20 of this TIB. When Commissioner may not issue a NOPA There may be circumstances when the investigator has discovered an item which needs to be adjusted, but cannot issue a NOPA. The Commissioner cannot issue a NOPA in any of these situations: •if the proposed adjustment is already the subject of a challenge •after the statute time bar has expired. When Commissioner may issue an assessment without issuing a NOPA Section 89C Tax Administration Act 1994 There may be circumstances in which an investigator finds a discrepancy and issues an assessment instead of a NOPA. Section 89C permits the Commissioner to issue an assessment without issuing a NOPA in limited circumstances. For audit cases this is likely to be in the following circumstances: •if the assessment corrects a tax position taken by the taxpayer, in a way or manner agreed by the Commis- sioner and the taxpayer (sec 89C(c)) •if the assessment reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer (sec 89C(d)) •if the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe a NOPA may cause the taxpayer to: –leave New Zealand; and/or –take steps to make it more difficult for the Commissioner to collect the payment of tax from the taxpayer or an associated person (sec 89C(e)) •if the assessment corrects a tax position previously taken by a taxpayer which is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act or failure to act by the taxpayer (sec 89C(f)) •if the taxpayer has not provided a tax return as required by law (sec 89C(h)) •if the taxpayer has failed to make or account for a deduction required to be made (sec 89C(i)) •if the assessment is consequential to an error made by another taxpayer and an assessment has been, or is able to be, issued to that other taxpayer (sec 89C(k)). to incorporate all the issues still in contention. Agree- ment in writing may be on a standard form available from Inland Revenue or may be by a customised letter. Whatever its form, the agreement must set out the tax type and period, the adjustment, the name of the taxpayer and the name of the Inland Revenue officer who agreed with it. The NOPA is the first formal step in the process of resolving issues. At this stage either party may amend its position as the dispute resolution process advances. The NOPA is not a binding document. However, resolving the dispute is more likely when both parties have fully disclosed their positions. This should prevent any misunderstanding and possible duplication of effort in preparing subsequent documentation if the dispute proceeds beyond the NOPA stage. There is an example of a simple NOPA in the appendix to this TIB. You can get a pre-printed NOPA form from any Inland Revenue office. In large or complex audits the Commissioner may issue a number of NOPAs as issues arise. If the taxpayer wishes to deal with proposed adjustments as they arise the investigator may issue a series of NOPAs throughout the audit. When an audit involves several years and the time bar is pending for one or more of the years in question, the investigator may issue separate NOPAs for each individual period. This will ensure that the assessment can still be issued within the statute time bar period. When several NOPAs are issued, each one must be responded to within two months of when it was issued. A single Notice of Response can be issued to respond to multiple NOPAs issued on different dates, but it must be issued within the two month response period of the earliest NOPA. At the disclosure notice stage, all NOPAs will be incorporated into the one Statement of Position. When a further NOPA will be issued A new NOPA will only be required for issues that weren’t covered in a previous NOPA. This is because the NOPA is not binding. For example, if a motor vehicle expense is initially categorised as private expenditure but subsequent discussion or further evidence indicates that it is actually capital expenditure, no new NOPA is required because the deductibility of motor vehicle expenses is the issue, which is clarified after the initial NOPA. If the issue is not resolved, the issues raised in the NOPA will be clarified through the conference phase and formalised in the Statement of Position. Additional NOPAs may be issued if issues arise which relate to amounts not previously contained in a NOPA and which are not agreed to by the parties. If the change is a refinement of an earlier adjustment (such as the motor vehicle expenses mentioned in the previous paragraph), no new NOPA will be needed. However, if a from page 11 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) The following examples show situations when the Commissioner would issue assessments in accordance with the above provisions without issuing a NOPA: Section 89C(i): •If a taxpayer has failed to account for NRWT or PAYE. Section 89C(k): •In the case of group loss offsetting - if a company has claimed losses to which it is not entitled and that company has been assessed (or is able to be assessed) to disallow those losses, the Commissioner may issue an assessment to the profit company which has offset the losses against its profits. •In the case of GST if the parties have incorrectly assumed a transaction was exempt from GST - if the Commissioner agrees that one taxpayer is entitled to the input tax credit, the Commissioner may issue an assessment to the supplier requiring the supplier to account for output tax on the value of the supply. •In the case of a partnership, if one partner has been reassessed following the dispute process, and the adjustments affect all partners, consequential adjust- ments to all partners will be made. There are other examples and circumstances when an assessment can be issued without first issuing a NOPA. These are noted under “Taxpayer Initiated Resolution of Disputes” on page 17 of this TIB. Section 89D Tax Administration Act 1994 When the Commissioner issues an assessment without first issuing a NOPA, the taxpayer can still dispute the assessment. To dispute the assessment, the taxpayer must issue a NOPA to the Commissioner. A taxpayer- issued NOPA is in the same form as one issued by the Commissioner. The process to be followed for a tax- payer-issued NOPA is discussed under “Taxpayer Initiated Resolution of Disputes” on page 17. If a taxpayer has failed to file a return and the Commis- sioner issues an assessment, known as a default assess- ment, the taxpayer will not have to issue a NOPA, but must file the return for which the default assessment was issued. What to do once a NOPA is received When a taxpayer or agent receives a NOPA, the tax- payer can accept the proposed adjustments in writing, reject the adjustments by issuing the Commissioner with a Notice of Response, or do nothing. Acceptance of NOPA Section 89I Tax Administration Act 1994 The taxpayer can accept a NOPA by agreeing in writing or by doing nothing. If the taxpayer does not respond to the NOPA within the two month response period, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed in the NOPA. If a taxpayer intends to accept a NOPA, we recommend doing so in writing. This will ensure an assessment is issued sooner, with any resultant interest and/or addi- tional tax reduced to a minimum. If the taxpayer accepts any proposed adjustment or fails to respond to the notice within the two month response period, the investigator or other officer has responsibil- ity for issuing an assessment including the adjustment. If the taxpayer has accepted the adjustments or is deemed to have accepted them, he or she may not the assessment. Rejection of Commissioner’s NOPA - Notice of Response Section 89G Tax Administration Act 1994 If a taxpayer does not accept the proposed adjustment(s), the taxpayer or agent must issue a Notice of Response to the Commissioner, within two months of the date of issue of the Commissioner’s NOPA. The Notice of Response must state all of the following with sufficient detail to fairly inform the recipient: •which items are not agreed with and how those items should be changed •the tax laws relied upon •the facts contained in the NOPA which are in error •any additional facts relied upon •any additional legal issues the taxpayer believes arise from the NOPA including, for the sake of complete- ness, any tax laws relied upon •the propositions of law relied on. A taxpayer will not be able to merely state that the proposed adjustments are not accepted or are incorrect. If the notice does not contain the requisite information it will be invalid. If possible the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer and advise that the notice cannot be accepted and that a further notice should be issued within the response period. If the response period has expired the only avenue open to the taxpayer is to make an application for exceptional circumstances. The taxpayer is not bound by the contents of the Notice of Response. However, to be a valid Notice of Response it must contain the requisite information. If it is incom- plete and the response period expires, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the adjustments proposed by the Commissioner. Pre-printed Notice of Response forms are available from Inland Revenue. Small claims election at Notice of Response stage Taxpayers may indicate in their Notice of Response that they would like any unresolved issues to be heard before the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority. continued on page 14 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that meets both of these conditions: •It could not have been anticipated. •It could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. Examples of exceptional circumstances are covered in the Questions and Answers section on page 26 of this TIB. Considering taxpayer’s Notice of Response Once the Commissioner has received the taxpayer’s Notice of Response, it will be considered by the investi- gator or other Inland Revenue officer dealing with the matter. That officer will consider the merits of the taxpayer’s notice and accept or reject, in full, or in part, the taxpayer’s argument. •If fully accepted, the Commissioner will make any appropriate adjustments. •If partly accepted, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer of those issues which he has accepted. The remainder of the issues will progress to the conference phase. •If fully rejected, the Commissioner will advise the taxpayer or agent that the Notice of Response has been rejected in full. The issues will progress to the conference phase. Conferences Purpose The purpose of a conference is to: •identify and clarify the facts or issues in dispute •facilitate resolution of any disputed facts •facilitate resolution of any disputed issues; •state the facts and define the issues in a clear and concise manner for consideration by the Adjudication Unit if they cannot be resolved. The conference phase is an administrative practice of the Commissioner. It is not mandatory to have a conference. It is the Commissioner’s responsibility to ensure that the disputes process moves to the conference stage as required. Conduct of a conference Conferences will be kept as flexible as possible, consist- ent with the taxpayer’s wishes and other factors such as the scope of the audit. Conferences may range from a phone call to several meetings, both before and after the disclosure stage. For complex cases, discussions or conferences are likely to be more formal. If necessary the conference may Because of the nature of small claims cases (i.e. they have no precedential effect and the facts are clear and not in dispute), the pre-assessment exchange and analysis of evidence and issues will often not require the same degree of time. We anticipate that in some cases the pre-assessment process for small claims cases may be fast tracked compared to the usual dispute process. For example, this may involve the Commissioner not issuing a disclosure notice and proceeding straight to adjudication following the NOPA stage. In addition, the documentary evidence will be likely to be produced very early in the process. The time taken to respond to various notices, both by the taxpayer and the Commis- sioner, should be reduced. Exceptional circumstances - taxpayer’s late response Section 89K Tax Administration Act 1994 If the taxpayer responds to a NOPA outside the two month response period, the Commissioner can treat the late Notice of Response as having been received within the response period when exceptional circumstances apply. Any request for consideration of a late Notice of Re- sponse should be in writing and include: •a full explanation as to why the Notice of Response is late, together with any supporting evidence •the Notice of Response which the Commissioner would have received had it been issued on time. The Notice of Response must accompany the request for late acceptance because there is no provision to allow additional time to issue the Notice of Response. The legislation provides a balance between certainty as to time limits and fairness when exceptional circum- stances have prevented the taxpayer from responding to a NOPA within the response period. A taxpayer must make a request for late acceptance as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that the response period has elapsed. If the Commis- sioner accepts the taxpayer’s request for a late Notice of Response, the Notice is deemed to have been received within the response period. If the Commissioner does not accept the late Notice of Response, an assessment incorporating the adjustments proposed will be issued. If a Notice of Response is not received with the letter of request, the Commissioner is not able to accept the request and an assessment confirming the NOPA will be issued in due course (if not already issued). The legislation defines exceptional circumstances very narrowly. We anticipate that late Notices of Response will be accepted only on rare occasions. This reflects the onus on taxpayers to meet their tax obligations. Exceptional circumstances are defined as an event or circumstance outside the control of the taxpayer that provides reasonable justification for not responding within the response period. An act or omission of an agent is not an exceptional circumstance unless the act from page 13 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) adhere to a set agenda with one or more face to face meetings. The meetings may involve not only the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officers dealing with the matter, but also lawyers and other appropriate Inland Revenue officers, accountants and lawyers representing the taxpayer, and, if necessary, other experts advising either party. The experts will be people such as valuers, academics, engineers, bankers, etc. who can provide specialist advice. Legal and other advisers attending a conference If a dispute is not settled during the audit or NOPA stage, both the Commissioner and the taxpayer may want to obtain further expert legal or technical advice. The Commissioner accepts that, in these circumstances it is appropriate for a certain amount of “back tracking” to take place. Some items that have already been discussed between the parties may need to be revisited by the newly-introduced advisers. This approach is consistent with the overall objective of the new proce- dures, which is to ensure a correct assessment. If this were not the case, it would put pressure on the parties in many disputes to involve expert advisers at an earlier stage than is actually required. It is not possible to revisit items that have previously been agreed in writing or have not been rejected within the applicable response period. Conference not held or abridged The Commissioner considers the conference phase to be a vital part of the disputes resolution process. Only in rare circumstances will the Commissioner not hold a conference, or decide to end or abridge a conference that is already in progress. The Commissioner will not prolong the conference phase, even if agreement has not been reached. The conference may be abridged or dispensed with if any of the following apply: •The Commissioner is satisfied that the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s agent is acting in a frivolous or vexatious manner, such as when the taxpayer or agent is setting unreasonable demands as to the time and place or terms of such meeting or refusing to conduct them- selves reasonably at any meeting. •revenue losses may result from delaying tactics on the part of the taxpayer. •the taxpayer or agent and the Commissioner agree to disagree. Any decision to dispense with or abridge the conference process will be made by an appropriate officer. The decision will be communicated in writing to the tax- payer or agent within five working days of when it is made. A decision to dispense with or abridge the conference process may be changed at the discretion of the reporting officer. If issues remain unresolved after a conference, the Commissioner will invoke the disclosure procedures. After the disclosure phase, a further conference may be held if it is likely to help resolve the dispute. Disclosure procedures Section 89M Tax Administration Act 1994 Purpose The disclosure procedure will generally occur towards the end of the discussion/conference process if agree- ment has not been reached. During this part of the disputes resolution process the Commissioner will issue the taxpayer with a Disclosure Notice. A Disclosure Notice can be issued at the same time as or any time after the taxpayer or Commissioner has issued a NOPA. If a Disclosure Notice is issued with a NOPA or before a response to a NOPA is due, a response must be issued in relation to both the NOPA and the Disclo- sure Notice. It would be rare to issue a Disclosure Notice at the same time or within the response period for a NOPA. The purpose of the disclosure process is to require both parties to state their respective positions on issues still in dispute, in a Statement of Position. The effect of the Statement of Position is to bind each party to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law which they disclose. Full disclosure in writing is essential; the Statement of Position forms the basis on which the issues will be argued if the case proceeds to court. The Commissioner will dispense with the disclosure process in some instances, such as when the personal safety or security of an informant is in issue. Authority not to issue a Disclosure Notice will be at a senior level within the Service Centre or National Office. Disclosure Notice The Disclosure Notice is issued by the Commissioner and requires the taxpayer to provide a Statement of Position, covering all issues in dispute. An example of a Disclosure Notice is shown in the sample forms at the back of this TIB, and in the appen- dix. Statement of Position The Statement of Position is a prescribed form, and must contain all of the following details: •the facts and evidence being relied upon •the issues considered to arise •the propositions of law to be relied upon. If the taxpayer’s Statement of Position does not contain the requisite information, and the response period has expired, the taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOPA or Statement of Position. If there is still time available in the response period, the taxpayer will be able to issue a valid taxpayer Statement of Position. If possible, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer and advise that the Statement of Position is deficient or invalid, as the case may be. continued on page 16 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Although the taxpayer has no right of reply the Com- missioner may agree to the taxpayer including further information in the taxpayer’s Statement of Position. This should be rare, particularly we expect that material which is in the taxpayer’s domain can and should have been disclosed earlier in the disputes resolution process. If taxpayer fails to respond to a Disclosure Notice If the taxpayer fails to respond to the Disclosure Notice within the response period, the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOPA, or Statement of Position. An assessment will be issued accordingly. Issues remaining unresolved If the taxpayer responds to a Disclosure Notice within the response period, and the issues remain in dispute, the unresolved issues will usually be referred to the Adjudication Unit. Conferences can still be held before the issues are referred to Adjudication, if this supports the possible resolution of a dispute. Penal tax, shortfall penalties and prosecution One of the objectives of the new disputes resolution process is the prompt and efficient resolution of dis- putes. To be consistent with this objective, the Commis- sioner will raise the issue of penal tax or shortfall penalties as soon as is practicable, which in most cases will be at the time the substantive issues are being discussed. A discussion of the new shortfall penalties will be covered in a separate TIB. A NOPA will be issued before any assessment or amendment of penal tax or shortfall penalties unless there is full agreement with taxpayer before issue of the NOPA or a court has directed the adjustment. In summary penal tax and shortfall penalties will follow the disputes resolution process in the same way as the substantive issues, with the underlying shortfall deter- mining the amount of penal tax or shortfall penalty. Penal tax or shortfall penalty will be assessed or amended in the following circumstances: •if sufficient admissible evidence is held to support imposition of the penalty, and •the taxpayer agrees with the penalty or is deemed to accept the penalty, and/or •a court has directed an adjustment to an existing penalty, or •the Adjudication Unit supports imposition of the penalty (in any case when the penalty remains disputed.) If the Commissioner intends to prosecute this action must be completed before the imposition of any penal tax or shortfall penalty. Imposition does not occur until an amount is notified by an assessment notice. Accord- An example of a Statement of Position is shown in the appendix. When the disclosure procedures are followed both the taxpayer and the Commissioner will be limited in any court challenge to the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law disclosed in the Statements of Position. However, the Notice of Assessment and the basis for this notice (e.g. the Adjudicator’s report) meet the requirements for admission to Court. There will be no need to seek approval for admission of these docu- ments into Court, as this is the Commissioner’s disput- able decision. Taxpayer’s Statement of Position The taxpayer’s Statement of Position must be filed within two months of the date of issue of the disclosure notice. However, the taxpayer can apply to the High Court for additional time within which to issue a Statement of Position, if: •The taxpayer applies before the expiry of the response period, and •The taxpayer considers the two month response period unreasonable as the disputed issues have not previ- ously been discussed between the Commissioner and the taxpayer or agent. When the High Court considers a taxpayer’s application it will have regard to the conduct of the parties to the dispute and the purpose of the new disputes procedures. Pre-printed Statement of Position forms are available from Inland Revenue offices Commissioner’s Statement of Position When the Commissioner issues the NOPA, the Com- missioner’s Statement of Position will be issued at the same time as the disclosure notice. The disclosure notice will require the taxpayer to provide a Statement of Position within two months of the date of issue of the disclosure notice. The Commissioner has a right of reply to the taxpayer’s Statement of Position. If the Commissioner exercises his right of reply he must do so within two months of the date of issue of the taxpayer’s Statement of Position. The Commissioner may apply to the High Court for more time to reply to a taxpayer’s Statement of Position if: •The Commissioner applies before expiry of the response period, and •The Commissioner considers it unreasonable to reply within the response period owing to the number, complexity or novelty of the matters raised in the taxpayer’s Statement of Position. The need to apply to the High Court may arise when the taxpayer’s Statement of Position refers to facts, issues, evidence or propositions of law which have not previ- ously been disclosed. from page 15 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) ingly, if penal tax or a shortfall penalty is to be imposed in addition to prosecution action, it may proceed through the new disputes procedures up to, but not beyond, finalisation of the Commissioner’s decision. If both prosecution and penal tax or a shortfall penalty are intended, imposition will be held up pending comple- tion of prosecution action. Partnerships and income tax The procedure for auditing partnerships is similar to other types of tax returns. In most cases the Commis- sioner will be dealing with the partnership’s agent or manager. A NOPA will be issued to the partnership agent or manager for the partnership, and all the partners will be joined in this NOPA. This requires agreement between the Commissioner and the partners. If this agreement is not forthcoming, a NOPA will be issued to the partner representing the partnership, or to another partner in the partnership. The dispute will follow the usual procedure to resolution or adjudication, whichever is the earlier. Once an issue is resolved for one partner, the remaining partners will be assessed in terms of section 89C(k) - consequential adjustments. Individual partners who have not been kept informed by the partnership’s agent or manager can still contest the assessment by issuing a NOPA to the Commissioner. It is likely that a shortened procedure will apply in these circumstances, as the material for sustaining the adjustment will have been obtained during the review of the partnership itself. When a partnership or an individual partner has initiated an adjustment by way of NOPA, and the Commissioner agrees to the adjustment, all of the partners will be reassessed. Taxpayer-initiated resolution of disputes Sections 89D, 89F, 89H, 89L, Tax Administration Act 1994 Introduction The Legislation requires a taxpayer to issue a NOPA when requesting an adjustment to an assessment or determination. There may be circumstances when a NOPA is not required, such as when the requested adjustment is one that the Commissioner agrees should be made. Therefore, when a taxpayer wants an amend- ment made to an assessment, Inland Revenue recom- mends that initial contact be made by way of telephone, letter, counter enquiry or an IR 960A (agent’s form). If we agree with the proposed amendment the taxpayer won’t have to issue a NOPA. Such agreement would be made in terms of section 113 of the TAA, which is a section enabling the Commissioner to amend returns to ensure their correctness. However, it is essential that the taxpayer contacts Inland Revenue immediately upon receiving an assessment or determination, and does not leave it until later in the two month period. This will allow enough time to issue a NOPA if no agreement is reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer (or agent). This procedure will provide the taxpayer or agent with an early opportunity to explain why they think the assessment is wrong and how it should be amended. If the Commissioner agrees with the request, the amend- ment will be made and an assessment issued. If the Commissioner does not agree with the amendment requested or it is likely that the issue will take some time to resolve, the Commissioner will, if possible, advise the taxpayer or agent accordingly. The taxpayer or agent will then have to formally initiate the disputes resolution process by issuing the Commissioner with a NOPA. Inland Revenue guidelines require us to respond within 21 days to correspondence (e.g., telephone queries, letters, IR 960A). If we cannot give a substantive reply within 21 days, we will give an interim response. We will make every effort to resolve a taxpayer-proposed amendment to an assessment, but we will not extend the response period to issue a NOPA . Therefore, if there is any doubt on a taxpayer or agent’s part as to whether the Commissioner will agree to an adjustment, they should issue a NOPA, especially if there is not much time remaining in the response period. For example, if there is less that 4 weeks remaining before the expiry of the response period, the taxpayer or agent should issue a NOPA. Failure to issue a NOPA, even though a taxpayer or agent may have queried an adjustment with Inland Revenue , will not constitute exceptional circumstances. The ability to issue a NOPA is still within the taxpay- er’s or agent’s control. \[Note: form IR 960A is a new form, designed with the new disputes resolution procedures in mind. It is mainly for dealing with account maintenance amendments/ queries and simple adjustments (such as missing donations receipt or IR 12 certificate, or dividend income not returned). The former IR 960 form can still be used for a limited time, to dispute assessments under the former objection process, but not the new disputes resolution process\] continued on page 18 18 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Section 89C(h) •If a taxpayer has not filed the required income tax return, PAYE return, GST return or any other neces- sary return, the Commissioner will issue a default assessment. In each of the above examples the current procedures fairly, efficiently and effectively identify and address the issues. If disputes arise from assessments issued in these circumstances, the new procedures for resolution of these disputes apply. However, the taxpayer, not the Commissioner, would have to issue a NOPA. Commencing the dispute process Taxpayer-issued NOPAs Sections 89D, 89F Tax Administration Act 1994 When a taxpayer wants an amendment made to an assessment and the Commissioner does not agree with the amendment, the taxpayer must issue the Commis- sioner with a NOPA. Taxpayers may also elect in the NOPA that they would like any unresolved issues to be heard in the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority. The NOPA must be issued within two months of the date of issue of the assessment. If a taxpayer receives a default assessment, he or she can only dispute the assessment by filing a return for that assessment period. The taxpayer cannot dispute the default assessment by issuing a NOPA. The NOPA requirements are cumulative; failure to include all elements will result in an invalid NOPA. If a taxpayer files an invalid NOPA and there is time available within the response period, the Commissioner will try to contact the taxpayer and advise that the NOPA is invalid. This will give the taxpayer an oppor- tunity to make the NOPA comply with the legal require- ments within the response period. If the taxpayer does not issue a NOPA Section 89I Tax Administration Act 1994 If the taxpayer does not issue a NOPA within the response period the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the assessment and may not challenge it in court. However, a taxpayer who considers that he or she is entitled to an adjustment, notwithstanding that the two month response period has expired, may contact Inland Revenue and request that the adjustments are made. This request will not take the form of a NOPA. If the Commissioner agrees that the taxpayer is clearly entitled to the adjustment requested, the Commissioner may make the adjustment under section 113 of the Tax Administration Act 1994. The Commissioner’s policy on the application of section 113 has not changed. Section 113 permits the Commissioner to adjust a return in order to ensure it is correct. If the Commissioner does not consider that the taxpayer is clearly entitled to the adjustment, the taxpayer must request that the Commis- sioner accept a late NOPA under the exceptional circumstances rule as explained below. Assessments Without NOPAs Section 89C Tax Administration Act 1994 Section 89C allows the Commissioner to issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA in any of these situations: •if the assessment corresponds with a tax return that has been provided by the taxpayer (sec 89C(a)) •if the Commissioner considers the assessment corrects a simple or obvious mistake or oversight contained in the tax return (sec 89C(b)) •if the assessment reflects an agreement between the Commissioner and the taxpayer correcting a tax position previously taken by the taxpayer (sec 89C(c)) •if the assessment otherwise reflects an agreement reached between the Commissioner and the taxpayer (sec 89C(d)) •If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe the notice may cause the taxpayer to - –leave New Zealand; or –take steps to make it more difficult for the Commissioner to collect payment of tax (sec 89C(e)) •if the assessment corrects a tax position taken by a taxpayer which is, or is the result of, a vexatious or frivolous act or failure to act by the taxpayer (sec 89C(f)) •if the assessment is issued as a result of a direction or determination of a Court or the Taxation Review Authority (sec 89C(g)) •if the taxpayer has not provided a tax return as required by law (sec 89C(h)) •if the taxpayer has failed to make or account for a deduction required to be made (sec 89C(i)) •if the taxpayer is entitled to issue, and has issued, a NOPA to the Commissioner in respect of a return (sec 89C(j)) •if the assessment is consequential to an error made by another taxpayer and an assessment has been, or is able to be, issued to that other taxpayer (sec 89C(k). The following examples illustrate when the Commis- sioner will continue to issue assessments without NOPAs: Section 89C(b) •if the calculations in a taxpayer’s tax return are incorrect, the Commissioner will correct the calcula- tion and issue an assessment based on the corrected amount. Section 89C(c) •if a taxpayer sends in another tax deduction certificate and asks for the relevant return to be amended, the Commissioner will issue an assessment including the new deduction certificate. Section 89C(d) •If a taxpayer comes to the Inland Revenue office with a valid rebate receipt for a donation, the Commis- sioner will issue an assessment including the rebate. from page 17 19 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) An example of the application of section 113 is con- tained in appendices. If the taxpayer issues a late NOPA Section 89K Tax Administration Act 1994 When the taxpayer issues a NOPA outside the two month response period, the legislation deems the late NOPA to have been received within the response period if exceptional circumstances existed. Any request for consideration of a late NOPA must be in writing and include: •a full explanation as to why the NOPA is late, to- gether with any supporting evidence, and •the NOPA which the Commissioner would have received had it been filed on time. The NOPA must accompany the request for late acceptance because there is no provision to allow additional time to issue the NOPA. The taxpayer must make a request for late acceptance as soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware that the response period had ended. If the Commissioner accepts the taxpayer’s request for a late NOPA, the NOPA is deemed to have been received within the response period. If the Commissioner does not accept the late NOPA, the taxpayer will be notified in writing and an assessment incorporating the adjustments proposed will be issued (if not already issued). If a NOPA is not received with the request for consideration of a late NOPA, the Commissioner cannot accept the request, and the assessment will be final. Exceptional circumstances are defined as an event or circumstance outside the control of the taxpayer that provides reasonable justification for not responding within the response period. An act or omission of an agent is not an exceptional circumstance unless the act or omission was caused by an event or circumstance beyond the control of the agent that: •could not have been anticipated, and •could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. Examples of exceptional circumstances are covered in the Questions and Answers section on page 26. Commissioner’s response to taxpayer’s NOPA Section 89G Tax Administration Act 1994 Once the Commissioner has received the taxpayer’s NOPA it will be referred to the officer dealing with the file for a response. If the officer agrees with the adjustment proposed in the taxpayer’s NOPA, he or she will advise the taxpayer in writing and issue an assessment. If the officer does not agree with the proposed adjustment, the Commissioner will issue a Notice of Response outlining why the Commissioner rejects the proposed adjustment. If the Commissioner does not respond Sections 89J, 89L Tax Administration Act 1994 If the Commissioner does not respond to the taxpayer’s NOPA within the two month response period, the Commissioner is deemed to have accepted the proposed adjustment and must issue an assessment to include the taxpayer’s proposed adjustment. However, the Commissioner is permitted to apply to the High Court for an order allowing the Commissioner to issue a late Notice of Response rejecting a proposed adjustment, if: •The Commissioner considers that exceptional circum- stances apply, and •The application is made before the Commissioner actually issues an assessment including the proposed adjustment. If the taxpayer rejects the Commissioner’s Notice of Response Section 89H Tax Administration Act 1994 Once the taxpayer receives the Commissioner’s Notice of Response, he or she may agree with the Commission- er’s response and accept that no adjustment should be made, or reject the Commissioner’s Notice of Response. To reject the Commissioner’s Notice of Response, the taxpayer must advise the Commissioner in writing within two months of the date of issue of the Commis- sioner’s Notice of Response. There is no specific format for the rejection notice - a simple letter will suffice. At this point the issue will generally proceed to the confer- ence stage. Failure to reject the Commissioner’s Notice of response results in a deemed acceptance by the taxpayer of a Notice of Response as if it were a NOPA. Conference stage A conference is held to further clarify the positions of both the Commissioner and the taxpayer. It may be as formal or informal as the circumstances require. Disclosure procedure If the dispute has not been resolved during the confer- ence phase, the Commissioner may issue a Disclosure Notice to the taxpayer. This part of the process is the same as that for disputes originating from an audit. The significant difference is that when the taxpayer or agent has issued the NOPA, the taxpayer will be required to provide his or her Statement of Position first. The Commissioner will then respond to the taxpayer’s Statement of Position with the Commissioner’s State- ment of Position, within the two month response period. If the issues remain unresolved once the Statements of Position have been completed, the unresolved issues will usually be referred to the Adjudication Unit. 20 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Function of the Adjudication Unit If agreement has not been reached on all issues at the end of the conference/disclosure stage, the case will generally be sent to the Adjudication Unit for considera- tion, regardless of the issue or amount of tax involved. The Adjudicator is an impartial officer within Inland Revenue, independent of the audit functions. The Adjudicator is required to take a fresh look at the application of the law to the facts of the case. What goes to the Adjudication Unit On completion of the pre-Adjudication disputes resolu- tion process, the following documents will be sent to the Adjudication Unit: •Notice of Proposed Adjustment •Notice of Response •rejection of the Commissioner’s Notice of Response (if applicable) •notes of conferences •the taxpayer’s Statement of Position; •the Commissioner’s Statement of Position •any relevant documentary evidence. A cover sheet will be attached giving details of the taxpayer’s (or taxpayer’s agent) and investigator’s names and addresses and the documents attached. A copy of the cover sheet will be sent to the taxpayer or agent together with a letter asking if they would like any other material already disclosed to be sent to the Adjudication Unit. Taxpayers can request copies of any documents they do not already have, such as notes of conferences. Taxpayers will be given 10 working days to respond, after which the file will be sent to the Adjudication Unit. At the back of this TIB there is a sample cover sheet. Limited fact finding It is possible that the Adjudicator may need to contact a party involved in the dispute, in order to clarify a point. However, this should be extremely rare. If the Adjudicator contacts either party the contact will be recorded in writing. The reason for the contact will be noted, and the other party will be notified as follows: •If contact is to be made with the investigator or other officer, an internal memo will be written to the investigator outlining the reason for the contact. The taxpayer or agent will receive a copy of the memo. •If contact is to be made with the taxpayer or agent, a letter will be written to the taxpayer or agent outlining the reason for the contact. The investigator or other officer will receive a copy of the letter. If there is a written response from either party, the Adjudicator will forward a copy to the other party. If the Adjudicator requests a meeting, the other party to the dispute will have an opportunity to attend that meeting. Timeframes The Adjudication Unit will attempt to determine the outcome of a case within four to six weeks, subject to workloads and complexity of cases. Complex cases may take longer than four to six weeks to complete. The timeframe within which decisions are anticipated to be made in will be periodically reviewed. What happens if a key argument is missed On rare occasions the Adjudicator may believe that the assessment will be materially incorrect if he or she accepts either line of argument, because some important legal issue has been missed by both parties, or has not been pursued. In these circumstances, the Adjudicator will refer the case back to the investigator or other officer for rework. In this situation another conference may need to be held or a new NOPA may need to be issued. The Adjudication Unit will prepare a “reference back” letter to the taxpayer or agent advising that the file has been referred back to the investigator or other officer. This letter will state the reasons why the file has been referred back. For cases referred back for rework, the procedure to refer the case back to Adjudication will start at the disclosure notice phase, as the earlier Statement of Position may no longer be valid for the issues referred back. In some instances the taxpayer and the Commis- sioner may agree to amend their Statements of Position, having regard to the reasons for the case being referred back to the investigator. These procedures are intended to meet the objective of issuing correct assessments first time. Adjudicator’s decision In all cases a copy of the Adjudicator’s decision will be sent to the taxpayer or his/her agent, and the investiga- tor or other officer involved with the case. If the Adjudicator agrees with the taxpayer’s position If the Adjudicator determines all of the issues in favour of the taxpayer, then: •if the Commissioner issued the NOPA, the query will be at an end. (Note: If any issues were agreed to before the case was referred to Adjudication and an assessment is required, the Adjudication Unit will issue the assessment). Adjudication 21 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) •if the taxpayer issued the NOPA, any assessment action will be undertaken by the Adjudication Unit, taking into account any issues agreed upon before the case was referred to adjudication. If the Adjudicator agrees with the Commissioner’s position If the Adjudicator agrees with the adjustments proposed by the Commissioner, the Adjudication Unit will issue an assessment on that basis. If the Adjudicator agrees with the Commissioner’s position not to accept a taxpayer’s proposed adjustment, he or she will issue a disputable decision. Any challenge to that assessment or disputable decision (section 138B), must be filed in the appropriate hearing authority within two months of the date of issue of the assessment or disputable decision. If the Adjudicator agrees in part with the taxpayer’s position If the Adjudicator agrees in part with the taxpayer and in part with the Commissioner, the Adjudication Unit will issue any assessment required to be made. When the Adjudicator determines an issue/adjustment in favour of the taxpayer, the investigator has no ability to challenge that decision. Challenges - Taxation Review Authority or High Court Introduction A taxpayer who disagrees with the Adjudicator’s decision, or an assessment issued following the disputes process, may challenge that decision by filing proceed- ings in the Taxation Review Authority (in either its small claims or general jurisdiction) or in the High Court, provided that both of these conditions are met: •The assessment includes an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner which the taxpayer has rejected, or which was the subject of an adjustment proposed by the taxpayer which the Commissioner has rejected. •The proceedings are filed with the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court within two months of the date of the assessment or determination. If the taxpayer issued a NOPA and the Commissioner decided not to amend the assessment, proceedings must be issued within two months of the date that the taxpayer is notified of that decision. Proceedings before the Taxation Review Authority Limitation period Sections 138B, 138C, 138D Tax Administration Act 1994 Taxpayers must issue proceedings within two months of whichever of these dates applies: •the issue date of an amended assessment, if the Commissioner issued the NOPA and the adjustment imposes a fresh liability or increases an existing liability. •the issue date of an amended assessment, if the taxpayer has issued the NOPA and the Commissioner has rejected some part of it. •the date the Commissioner issued a written notice that the adjustment will not be made, if the taxpayer issued the NOPA and the Commissioner’s rejection does not result in an amended assessment. If a hearing authority considers that exceptional circum- stances have prevented a taxpayer or their agent from issuing proceedings within the two month period, the taxpayer or agent will be allowed to start a challenge. Evidence exclusion rule Section 138G Tax Administration Act 1994 When the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice to a taxpayer, the Commissioner and the taxpayer cannot introduce any further facts, evidence, issues or proposi- tions of law in any subsequent challenge, unless both parties agree otherwise. If agreement is not reached, either party may apply to a hearing authority to have the further facts, evidence, issues or propositions introduced. If the new material is to be introduced, the hearing authority must be satisfied that both of the following apply: •The party concerned could not, with due diligence, have discovered the facts or evidence, or issues or discerned those propositions of law, at the time of delivery of the Statement of Position. •Having regard to section 89A (the purpose behind the dispute procedures), and to the conduct of the parties, the hearing authority considers the admission of those facts or evidence or issues or propositions of law is necessary to avoid manifest injustice to the Commis- sioner or taxpayer. The evidence exclusion rule imposes a very high threshold for the introduction of new evidence, and reinforces the need to disclose all relevant matters at the early stages of the disputes resolution process. Paying half of the tax in dispute Sections 7A, 128A & 138IA Tax Administration Act 1994 The legislation requires a disputant to pay the non- deferrable tax (50% of the tax in dispute). If the taxpayer cannot pay the non-deferrable tax, he of she may provide acceptable security to the Commis- sioner instead. This security could take the form of a mortgage or other encumbrance over any asset or right, and a guarantee or indemnity given to the Commis- sioner to meet any tax obligation. continued on page 22 22 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Taxation Review Authority small claims jurisdiction Sections 89E, 138B & 138C Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments to Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 An optional and simple “fast track” non-precedential procedure for dealing with small claims has been introduced as part of the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority. The procedure is intended to deal with simple cases with small amounts of tax in dispute. Key elements of the Taxation Review Authority small claims jurisdiction The key elements of this jurisdiction are as follows: •There is a $50 filing fee payable by the taxpayer. •It can hear cases in which the tax in dispute is up to $15,000. •It can only hear simple cases, in which the facts are clear and not in dispute. •Its decisions do not set precedents. •There is no right of appeal. •The taxpayer can appear in person or use an agent. •It is a fast track system for hearing disputes. •Its decisions are not published. The Commissioner may apply to have small claims cases transferred to the TRA’s general jurisdiction if any of the following apply: •The facts are not clear. •The case may have precedential implications for other taxpayers. •There are recurrent amounts of less than $15,000 involving the same taxpayer. The small claims procedure is as informal as possible within the bounds of natural justice. How to elect the small claims procedure A taxpayer can elect in either the NOPA or Notice of Response that the case is to proceed as a small claim if not resolved. If the taxpayer so elects Inland Revenue may follow an abridged pre-assessment procedure (e.g. an expedited conference phase). The taxpayer is bound by the election and cannot later choose to file the case in the Taxation Review Authority’s general jurisdiction or in the High Court. If the taxpayer has not made a small claims election in the NOPA or Notice of Response, the taxpayer may still choose to file the case in the Taxation Review Authori- ty’s small claims jurisdiction. That action is binding upon the taxpayer. If a taxpayer has already paid all of the tax in dispute, the taxpayer can ask the Commissioner to refund one half of it. The authorisation for the Commissioner to take securi- ties is contained in section 7A of the Tax Administra- tion Act. That section enables the Commissioner to accept securities on whatever terms and conditions may be required by the Commissioner, to call for replace- ment securities if the existing securities become inad- equate or insufficient, and to enforce a security if the taxpayer defaults in the performance of his or her tax obligation. If a taxpayer is not able to pay the non-deferrable tax or provide security for it but nevertheless has a dispute that should be resolved through the courts, section 128A of the Tax Administration Act allows the Commissioner to waive the requirement for payment or security if, in the Commissioner’s view, both of the following apply: •paying the tax assessed before the dispute is resolved will unduly prejudice the taxpayer’s business or personal circumstances. •there is no material risk to the revenue in waiving payment or the provision of security. In order for the Commissioner to be satisfied that the conditions outlined above have been met, an affidavit of assets and liabilities together with any relevant informa- tion will be required. A waiver of the requirement to pay the non-deferrable tax, or to provide security for it, is only provisional. If the taxpayer’s circumstances change, the requirement to pay or provide security may be reinstated. In addition, the waiver extends only for the period during which there is a dispute. The discretion to waive the requirement for payment or to accept securities will be exercised by an appropriate officer of Inland Revenue in conjunction with the Litigation Management Unit. Litigation Management Inland Revenue’s Litigation Management Unit will be responsible for managing the litigation of all tax cases and ensuring their timely outcome. Once a case has been filed, but before counsel is ap- pointed, all contact with Inland Revenue by the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s agent must be made through the Litigation Management Unit, unless the unit has specifically authorised contact with some other Inland Revenue officer. Following appointment of counsel, all contact must be made directly with counsel. Service of proceedings is discussed on page 24. from page 21 23 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Filing a small claims case in the TRA Taxation Review Authority Regulations 1996 When the taxpayer elects to have the case heard in the Taxation Review Authority, he or she will complete a Notice of Claim, including ticking the appropriate box on that form to indicate whether the case is to be heard by the Taxation Review Authority in its small claims or general jurisdiction. If neither box is ticked, the case will be proceed under the general jurisdiction. The Notice of Claim is a cover sheet to be completed by the taxpayer. Copies are available from any Inland Revenue office. The taxpayer must complete and file three copies of both the Notice of Claim and the docu- ments outlined below, with the Taxation Review Authority in Wellington. The filing fee is also payable at this time; it is $50 for claims to be heard in the small claims jurisdiction and $100 for claims to be heard in the general jurisdiction. Filing may be done either in person at the Authority’s office in Wellington or by registered mail. The Authority will travel to centres outside Wellington to hear cases. The following documents must be attached to the Notice of Claim: •If a Disclosure Notice has been issued: The Adjudica- tor’s report (if one is issued), the Commissioner’s Statement of Position and the Taxpayer’s Statement of Position. The Notice of Response and the NOPA may also be attached at the taxpayer’s option. •If no Disclosure Notice has been issued: The Adjudi- cator’s report (if one is issued), the Notice of Re- sponse and the NOPA. Inland Revenue to consider small claims application The Taxation Review Authority will advise Inland Revenue’s Litigation Management Unit that a Notice of Claim has been received requesting that the case be heard as a small claim. It will also supply one copy of the notice and attached documents to the Unit. The Litigation Management Unit will consider the documents, and advise the taxpayer if the Commissioner considers the case should be heard under the Taxation Review Authority’s small claims jurisdiction, or in some other authority. Transfer to general jurisdiction or High Court Sections 138M & 138N Tax Administration Act 1994 If the Commissioner considers that the case should not be heard as a small claim, the Commissioner will apply for the case to be transferred to the Taxation Review Authority’s general jurisdiction or to the High Court. The Commissioner will also have a similar discretion to request transfer of cases to the general jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority or the High Court if recurrent amounts of less than $15,000 are involved. The Commissioner will not meet the additional filing fees payable where a challenge is transferred to a higher jurisdiction. The Commissioner may apply for a challenge filed with the Taxation Review Authority to be transferred to the High Court. Each hearing authority also may transfer a challenge to one of the other hearing authorities, other than to the Taxation Review Authority’s small claims jurisdiction. When a case is transferred from one hearing authority to another, the Commissioner will not pay the taxpayer’s costs of taking the case to the higher jurisdiction. Hearings once filed The Taxation Review Authority will arrange a hearing date and advise the taxpayer and the Commissioner accordingly. Representation The Taxation Review Authority is traditionally a forum where taxpayers can represent themselves or where accountants can represent their clients without the need to engage legal representation. This will continue to be the case under the Taxation Review Authority’s small claims jurisdiction. Legal representation is permitted but is not obligatory. Judges The small claims procedure is part of the jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority and will be convened by Taxation Review Authority Judges. Procedure Hearings will be conducted with a minimum of proce- dural formality, within the bounds of natural justice. Cases will be determined according to the law. The evidence exclusion rule will also apply to small claims cases. Decisions Decisions will not be published, and will have no precedential effect. It is likely that the Judge will often give an oral decision at the end of the hearing. No right of appeal There will be no right of appeal for a case heard under the small claims procedure. continued on page 24 24 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) $100. Copies of the Statement of Claim and all accom- panying documents must be served on the Commis- sioner. The Statement of Claim states the facts and propositions of law which the taxpayer is relying upon in support of the claim, and the issues which the taxpayer considers require determination by the Court. All of these items must be described in sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner and the Court. If a disclosure notice has been issued, the Statement of Claim may only refer to those facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law which were referred to in either party’s Statement of Position. Commissioner’s response to the statement of claim Within 60 days from the date of service of the statement of claim and notice of proceeding, the Commissioner must file a statement of defence and serve it on the taxpayer. The Statement of Defence either admits or denies the allegations of fact contained in the Statement of Claim. It also sets out any further facts and evidence which the Commissioner considers are relevant to the issues, any propositions of law which the Commissioner is relying upon, and the issues which the Commissioner claims require determination by the Court. The Commissioner is limited to raising only those facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law which have been disclosed in either party’s Statement of Position under the disclosure notice procedure. Service of proceedings For all proceedings, whether in the High Court or the Taxation Review Authority, any documents which are required to be served on the Commissioner must be served in one of the following ways: •by registered mail addressed to: Litigation Management Unit Inland Revenue Department P O Box 2198 WELLINGTON •by delivery to the street address: Ground Floor Freyberg Building Aitken Street WELLINGTON When the Commissioner is required to serve court documents on the taxpayer, service may be effected in any of these ways: •personally •by sending a copy to the taxpayer by registered post to the usual or last known place of abode or residence •by service on a solicitor who accepts service in writing on behalf of the taxpayer •by effective delivery to an address for service supplied by the taxpayer to the Commissioner. Taxation Review Authority general jurisdiction Sections 138B & 138C Tax Administration Act 1994 Amendments to Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 This procedure is in general the same as the Taxation Review Authority’s small claims procedure. The essential difference are: •Decisions will be published. •Decisions may be appealed. •Decisions will be precedential. •The filing fee is higher ($100). Transfer of cases from Taxation Review Authority to the High Court In certain circumstances the Commissioner may apply to have a challenge filed by the taxpayer in the Taxation Review Authority transferred to the High Court. For example, the case may be extraordinarily complex or of general or public importance. Application of evidence exclusion rule The evidence exclusion rule will apply to cases heard in the general jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Author- ity. Transcripts In certain circumstances involving complex and pro- tracted matters, the Authority may decide that a simul- taneous transcript of proceedings is required. Filing a claim in the general jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority The procedure for filing a claim in the general jurisdic- tion of the Taxation Review Authority is the same as that outlined earlier for the small claims jurisdiction of the Taxation Review Authority. High Court Sections 138B & 138C Tax Administration Act 1994 and the High Court Rules A new Part of the High Court Rules deals with tax disputes. The rules prescribe the initiation of tax disputes by Statement of Claim and ordinary proceeding processes, the evidence exclusion procedure and the availability of interlocutory steps such as discovery and interrogatories upon application to the Court. Filing a case in the High Court When a taxpayer elects for the case to be heard in the High Court, he or she must draft and file a Statement of Claim in the form identified in the High Court Rules. The Statement of Claim should be filed in the office of the Court closest to where the taxpayer lives. The taxpayer must also file a notice of proceeding along with every Statement of Claim, and pay a filing fee of from page 23 25 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Test case procedures Sections 138P, 138Q Tax Administration Act 1994 When the Commissioner considers a challenge may be determinative of all or a substantial number of issues involved in other challenges, that challenge may be designated a test case. Test cases are to be heard in the High Court. When a test case has been designated, the Commis- sioner may stay proceedings on other challenges by notifying the taxpayers concerned that: •The test case is considered to be determinative of all or a substantial number of the issues in the challenge proposed to be stayed. •The challenge proposed to be stayed has not yet been determined by the hearing authority. The taxpayer may contest the stay at any time by issuing a notice requiring the challenge to be heard. The Commissioner may, within 14 days of receiving the taxpayer’s notice, apply to the High Court for an order that the challenge be stayed. Statute (time) bar Sections 108, 108A, 108B Tax Administration Act 1994 Income Tax Act 1994 Changes have been made to the statute (time) bar provisions. These provisions apply if four years have passed from the end of the income year in which a return was filed. The Commissioner cannot alter the assessment to increase the amount of tax after the four year period unless one of the following applies: •The return was fraudulent or wilfully misleading. •The return omitted income which was of a particular nature or was derived from a particular source. The change to the statute (time) bar applies to returns filed on or after 1 April 1997. Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 If four years have passed from the end of the GST return period for which a GST return was provided or GST was assessed, the Commissioner cannot make an assessment or alter any assessment made to increase the amount of tax, unless the taxpayer has knowingly or fraudulently omitted to make a full and true disclosure. If four years have passed from the end of the GST return period for which a GST return was made under sec- tion 17 of the GST Act, or GST was assessed by the Commissioner under subsection (1A) or subsection (1B) of section 27 of the Act, the Commissioner cannot make an assessment or alter any assessment made to increase the amount of tax. Suspension of statute (time) bar The statute (time) bars in Sections 108 and 108A are to be suspended if at any time before the expiry of the statute (time) bar period, the taxpayer agrees to extend the statute (time) bar by a period or periods of up to six months. Transitional issues There will be many audits and disputes that will not have been resolved before 1 October 1996. These will be at various stages when the new procedures come into effect. Finalisation of these audits and disputes will depend upon what stage they are at on 1 October 1996. Audits under way but no assessment issued Regardless of what stage the audit is at, if no further assessment has been issued for the particular period, the new disputes resolution procedures will apply. Assessment issued but no objection received or received but not determined The taxpayer must file a notice of objection within the two month objection period. If the Commissioner either fully or partly disallows the objection and the taxpayer wishes to proceed with it, the taxpayer must do so under the case stated procedures under Part VIII of the Tax Administration Act. Neither the small claims rules nor the disclosure stage of the new procedures will apply. Objection received and fully or partly disallowed If the objection has been either fully or partly disallowed and the taxpayer wishes to proceed with it, the taxpayer must proceed to court under the case stated procedures set out in Part VIII of the Tax Administration Act. Neither the small claims rules nor the new disputes procedures will apply. Objection disallowed but case not yet requested A taxpayer who wishes to challenge the assessment must request a case stated under the case stated proce- dures set out in Part VIII of the Tax Administration Act. continued on page 26 26 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Questions and answers Notices of Proposed Adjustment Q.Does a new NOPA have to be issued each time one party changes the basis for issuing the initial NOPA? A.If the change is a refinement of an earlier adjustment no new NOPA will be needed. However, if a new adjustment is proposed or the basis for the first adjustment has fundamentally changed then a new NOPA may be issued. This will be determined on a case by case basis. Q.Will the adjustments referred to in NOPAs refer to income figures or tax figures? A.NOPAs will generally refer to income figures unless otherwise specified e.g. the amount of penal tax proposed. Determinations Q.Are determinations subject to NOPAs? A.A determination which is a “disputable decision” may be disputed using a NOPA. Disputable decision is defined in sec. 3(1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. Q.Is a PAYE deduction determination an assessment or a disputable decision? A.A PAYE deduction determination is a disputable decision. Either the employer or the employee may challenge an assessment or reject a NOPA that relates to a PAYE deduction determination. Assessments without NOPAs Q.Will a NOPA be issued in every case in which the Commissioner does not agree with the return filed by the taxpayer? A.No. Section 89C allows the Commissioner to issue an assessment without having to issue a NOPA in a number of cases. The most common examples are: –the assessment equates with a return –if the Commissioner and the taxpayer agree on the adjustment –if the Commissioner considers that the return contains a simple or obvious mistake or oversight –if the Commissioner considers that a taxpayer may hide assets or leave New Zealand to make collection of the tax more difficult. Q.What is a simple mistake or oversight? A.The Commissioner will generally treat the following as simple mistakes or oversights: –arithmetical errors, –transposition of numbers from one box to another, –when a rebate has not been claimed which the taxpayer is entitled to or was incorrectly calcu- lated, e.g. less than $30,875 rebate. Q.Can an assessment be issued before the response period for the NOPA has expired? A.Technically section 89B(3) does not prevent the Commissioner from issuing an assessment before the expiry of the response period. However in practice the Commissioner will generally wait until the end of the response period before taking further action. Q.In what circumstances will the Commissioner issue an assessment before the end of the response period? A.The Commissioner will issue an assessment before the end of the response period if there is a risk to the revenue, such as if the taxpayer takes steps to leave New Zealand or to hide assets so that the collection of tax is made more difficult. In this instance the file will not be referred to the Adjudication Unit before the assessment is issued. When the Commissioner and a taxpayer agree in writing, and an assessment or reassessment is issued after 1 October 1996, it may be treated as having been issued before 1 October 1996. In this case the objection procedures contained in Part VIII of the Act will apply. An example of when the standard transitional proce- dures may not be followed is when an issue has been objected to in prior years but has not yet been deter- mined by the Courts. In such a case, it may be prefer- able that the same issue be dealt with under the same disputes procedure. An alternative situation may be if the case is nearly finalised when the new disputes resolution procedures are implemented. The taxpayer and the Commissioner may agree that it would be preferable to deal with the case under Part VIII. Case stated request already received under previous procedures The case will continue to be dealt with under the case stated procedures set out in Part VIII of the Tax Admin- istration Act. Exceptions to the transitional provisions Section 124A Tax Administration Act 1994 When the Commissioner and a taxpayer agree in writing, and an assessment or reassessment has been issued before 1 October 1996, it may be treated as having been issued after 1 October 1996. In this case the new disputes process will apply. from page 25 27 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Q.What happens if the Commissioner issues an assessment without a NOPA and none of the section 89C exceptions apply? A.When the Commissioner has issued an assessment and none of the exceptions in section 89C apply the taxpayer can issue the Commissioner with a NOPA to dispute the assessment (section 89D(1)(b) of the Tax Administration Act 1994). Q.Can the Commissioner reaudit an assessment if the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the assessment? A.Yes. The Commissioner can reaudit a taxpayer at any time to ensure an assessment is correct. This applies to default assessments and ordinary assess- ments. The only limitation on the Commissioner reauditing the assessment is if the statute time bar has passed and the Commissioner proposes to increase the amount of the earlier assessment. Taxpayer initiated adjustments Q.If a taxpayer or agent wants an adjustment made to a tax return or an assessment, does a NOPA have to be given to the Commissioner in every instance? A.No. If the Commissioner agrees with the adjustment requested by the taxpayer or agent, the taxpayer does not need to issue the Commissioner with a NOPA. This is because the Commissioner is still under a duty to ensure that the correct amount of tax is assessed. If the Commissioner does not agree, the taxpayer or agent will have to issue a NOPA. For that reason, it is important to contact Inland Rev- enue as soon as possible after the assessment is issued to ensure that the taxpayer has sufficient time in which to issue a NOPA before the expiry of the response period. Examples of when the Commissioner is likely to accept requested adjustments include: –omitted interest, dividend or IR 12 certificates –omitted donation or housekeeper rebate claims Q.What is the procedure for a taxpayer or agent to request an adjustment? A.A taxpayer or agent may write to the Commissioner, make a telephone enquiry or visit an Inland Revenue office. If the Inland Revenue officer agrees with the request the adjustment will be made and an assess- ment issued. If the officer does not agree with the requested adjustment the taxpayer will be advised to seek independent advice or to issue a NOPA to the Commissioner. A blank NOPA form is available if required. Q.What should a taxpayer who receives a default assessment do ? A.The only way that the taxpayer can dispute the default assessment is by filing a return for that assessment period. Q.Will an Inland Revenue officer help a taxpayer to fill in a NOPA? A.No. It would not be appropriate for an Inland Revenue officer to assist a taxpayer in completing a NOPA and then to determine whether the contents of the NOPA should be accepted or not. The Inland Revenue officer may advise the taxpayer to seek independent advice. Q.Is there a central address for NOPAs, Notices of Response and Statements of Position to be sent to? A.No. Send the document to the address where the Inland Revenue officer actioning the case works and mark it to the attention of that officer. If a taxpayer issues a NOPA to the Inland Revenue without having discussed the proposed adjustment with an Inland Revenue officer, the NOPA should be ad- dressed to the nearest Inland Revenue Office. Agreements Q.What is the effect of accepting an adjustment proposed by the Commissioner? A.If the adjustment is verbally accepted a taxpayer is not precluded from subsequently challenging the adjustment. In an audit scenario, agreement will usually be recorded in writing. If the adjustment is accepted in writing, the taxpayer may not further challenge the adjustment. Q.What happens if a taxpayer claims to have been coerced into signing or did not know the effect of what was agreed to in writing? A.When a formal written agreement is entered into, a statement of the effect of the agreement will be included in the written document. The taxpayer will be advised to seek advice if he or she does not understand the document - Inland Revenue will not coerce taxpayers into signing agreements. Q.If the taxpayer agrees with the adjustment, will he or she always be required to sign a written agreement? A.No. However, Inland Revenue recommends that taxpayers do sign an agreement, as acceptance in writing brings finality to the issue. Q.What is the form of the written agreement? A.Written agreements could include: –a letter requesting the Commissioner to make an adjustment. –a simple standard form for simple adjustments. –a letter of agreement tailored to meet the require- ments of the issue being agreed upon. We expect that tailored agreements will be needed for more complex adjustments or when there are multiple adjustments being agreed upon, perhaps covering multiple types of taxes or multiple revenue periods. continued on page 28 28 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Q.How long is the response period - two calendar months or 60 days? A.The response period is defined as two months starting on the date of issue of the originating document. For example, the response period for a NOPA issued on 15 February 1997 expires on 15 April 1997. Q.Will the response period be strictly adhered to? A.Yes. The Commissioner has no authority to grant an extension of time, and exceptional circumstances are likely to be rare. Exceptional circumstances Q.What happens if a taxpayer issues a NOPA after the two month response period and the Commissioner agrees to the adjustments requested by the taxpayer? A.The Commissioner has a duty to ensure that assess- ments are correct. If the Commissioner considers that an adjustment is required, he will issue an assessment incorporating the adjustment provided it meets the Commissioner’s policy on the application of section 113, TAA. The request will not be treated as an acceptance of a late NOPA, but a recognition by the Commissioner of his duty to ensure that assessments are correct in terms of section 113. Q.What happens if a taxpayer issues a NOPA after the two month response period and the Commissioner does not agree to the adjustments requested by the taxpayer? A.The Commissioner cannot accept a late NOPA unless exceptional circumstances apply. If excep- tional circumstances do not apply, the adjustments cannot be made. Q.What are exceptional circumstances? A.Exceptional circumstances are events or circum- stances beyond the control of the taxpayer that provide the taxpayer with a reasonable justification for not issuing the NOPA or Notice of Response within the response period. If the taxpayer has an agent, an act or omission of the agent will not amount to an exceptional circumstance unless the act or omission was beyond the control of the agent, could not have been anticipated and could not have been avoided by compliance with accepted standards of business organisation and professional conduct. The following situations are not exceptional circum- stances: –A taxpayer completes her own GST returns but her agent completes her income tax return. An adjustment is made to a GST return which the taxpayer does not dispute. The adjustment will affect the taxpayer’s income tax position but the taxpayer does not discuss the issue with her agent. When the agent completes the taxpayer’s income tax return six months later, he discovers Q.Who can sign an agreement? A.The taxpayer or the taxpayer’s authorised agent can sign the agreement. Q.If an agent signs the agreement will an authority to act be required? A.If an agent regularly acts for the taxpayer and has been involved in the pre-agreement discussions it is unlikely that proof of authority to act would be required. However, the agent would sign the agree- ment as duly authorised agent. An Inland Revenue officer may ask for proof of authority to act if the agent has not previously been acting for that tax- payer or the agent has had no involvement in earlier discussions. Q.What should an agreement contain? A.There are a number of items that should be included in a written agreement. These are: the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, the date, the tax type in issue, the period in issue, details of the adjustment agreed upon, the implications of the agreement, the name and designation of the Inland Revenue officer signing the agreement, and the taxpayer’s or agent’s signature. Q.Can the Commissioner amend an assessment for an issue following written agreement or deemed acceptance of that issue? A.The Commissioner has an overriding duty to ensure assessments are correct, provided that this function is completed within the statutory four year time limit. A written agreement does not generally limit the Commissioner’s ability to subsequently amend an assessment. Once a NOPA, Notice of Response, or a Statement of Position is accepted or deemed accepted, the Commissioner may not subsequently amend issues contained in it. Once an issue is determined by formal disputes procedures, under either the new or the old procedures, that determination is final unless the Commissioner has been wilfully misled or a fraud has been committed. Extensions of time Q.If a taxpayer is concerned that the response period may expire can the Commissioner grant an exten- sion of time? A.The legislation does not allow the Commissioner to grant an extension of time. Before the expiry of the two month period the Commissioner has no power to consider a request from the taxpayer for permission to issue a late notice. The Commissioner may only consider an application for a late notice to be treated as having been received in time after the response period has expired. The notice will only be treated as having been received within the response period if the exceptional circumstances test is met. from page 27 29 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) the GST adjustment and wishes to issue a late Notice of Response well outside the response period. This is not an exceptional circumstance because it was not beyond the taxpayer’s control. She could have taken professional advice when the GST adjustment was made, but she chose not to. –A taxpayer files a return but doesn’t claim a rebate to which he is clearly entitled. Eight months later, he discovers his error and asks the Commissioner to allow his rebate. The Commis- sioner agrees that the taxpayer is clearly entitled to the rebate and makes the adjustment. The Commissioner is not required to consider whether exceptional circumstances occurred in this scenario because he is under a duty to ensure that assessments are correct. –A taxpayer is selected for an audit. During the course of the audit, the taxpayer is sent a number of letters outlining the matters being investigated and speaks to the investigator several times on the phone and is told that a NOPA is about to be issued. The taxpayer then decides to travel overseas for six months. She does not appoint anyone to handle her tax affairs. The Commis- sioner issues the NOPA and the taxpayer does not issue a Notice of Response within the re- sponse period. An assessment is issued. When she returns, three months after the response period has elapsed, she issues a Notice of Re- sponse. The taxpayer does not satisfy the excep- tional circumstances test. It was not beyond her control. She was aware that she was being audited and should have appointed someone to manage her tax affairs if she was not going to be able to do so herself. Alternatively, she could have made arrangements with the Inland Rev- enue officer to suspend the issue of the NOPA until after her return. –A taxpayer is audited and a dispute arises as to the deductibility of certain losses. The Commis- sioner considers that the losses were not deduct- ible and issues a NOPA proposing to disallow the losses. The taxpayer contacts his agent who advises him that the losses are not deductible. The taxpayer does not issue a Notice of Response so is deemed to have accepted the adjustment disallowing the losses. An assessment is issued. The following year the Court of Appeal issues a judgment which makes it clear that the losses would have been deductible. The taxpayer requests the Commissioner to accept a late Notice of Response. The Commissioner does not accept that this is an example of exceptional circumstances. It was within the taxpayer’s control to issue the Notice of Response within the time frame required, or alternatively it was within the agent’s control to advise the taxpayer that there was a pending appeal which may affect the taxpayer’s affairs. Section 89I overrides section 113 in these circumstances. –A taxpayer is issued with a NOPA. Two weeks before the response period ends, the taxpayer is admitted to hospital for a hip replacement which she has scheduled some months previously. The taxpayer does not issue a Notice of Response within the response period and seeks to rely upon her hospitalisation as an exceptional circum- stance. This is not an exceptional circumstance. The failure to issue a Notice of Response within the response period was not due to an event beyond the taxpayer’s control. The taxpayer had time to organise for her tax affairs to be looked after or could have advised the Commissioner at an earlier time that she would be unable to run her tax affairs at that time. The following situation would count as an excep- tional circumstance: –A taxpayer is issued with a NOPA. Two days before the response period ends, the taxpayer suffers a severe heart attack and is not able to provide a Notice of Response. Three months later, the taxpayer is well enough to go through his tax affairs and wishes to issue a late Notice of Response. The Commissioner accepts the Notice on the basis that the failure to respond in time was due to an exceptional circumstance. The Notice is treated as having been received in time and progresses through the new procedures in the usual manner. Conference Q.What is the status of pre-assessment discussion in evidence? A.Notes of pre-assessment discussions may be used in evidence. The discussions may also be held on a without prejudice basis, but if the taxpayer’s expla- nations vary widely this may affect the credibility of the taxpayer. Q.In what circumstances will the Conference stage be dispensed with? A.If the Inland Revenue officer considers that the taxpayer or the agent is employing delaying tactics, approval may be sought to dispense with the confer- ence. However if a taxpayer or agent is not available because of authentic work commitments, alternative conference arrangements may need to be considered such as the use of conference calls. In addition, suspension of the statute (time) bar may be sought. Q.Who decides whether to dispense with the Confer- ence stage? A.If the Inland Revenue officer considers that the conference stage should be dispensed with approval will be sought from his or her reporting officer. If the reporting officer agrees that the conference stage continued on page 30 30 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) to the other party at an early stage. The disclosure of all the information being relied upon by each party means both parties are better able to determine the correct amount of tax to be paid and can do so on a more timely basis. Q.What is evidence exclusion? A.The evidence exclusion rule limits the parties to only those facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law that have previously been disclosed to the other party in a Statement of Position. The evidence exclusion rule prevents either party from attempting to admit further information at the last minute. Q.When does the evidence exclusion rule apply? A.The evidence exclusion rule only applies when a dispute is taken to court. However, the point in time at which final disclosure must occur is at the State- ment of Position stage. Q.How will the evidence exclusion rule be invoked? A.Evidence exclusion is instigated by the Disclosure Notice. The Commissioner will issue a Disclosure Notice which requires the taxpayer to provide a Statement of Position within two months of the date of issue of the Disclosure Notice. If the Commis- sioner has issued the NOPA he will provide his Statement of Position with the Disclosure Notice. If the taxpayer has issued the NOPA the taxpayer must provide a Statement of Position first. Q.What happens if a taxpayer discovers new material relevant to the case after the Disclosure Notice stage? A.All requests for additional information to be added to the Statement of Position after the Disclosure Notice stage should be directed to the Inland Rev- enue officer handling the case. The officer will then determine whether the Commissioner should accept the new information. If the officer agrees to accept the new information it is deemed to be part of the taxpayer’s original Statement of Position in accord- ance with section 89M(14). If the file has been passed to Adjudication the officer will forward the new information on to the Adjudication Unit to be added to the original Statement of Position. If the officer does not agree to accept the new information and the assessment is subsequently challenged in court the taxpayer may apply to the court for leave to include the new information. Q.Does the evidence exclusion rule apply to informa- tion held by a third party? A.Yes. It is important that both parties produce all the information which they hold or know of which leads them to the conclusion that their position is correct. Q.What factors will an officer consider in deciding whether to accept additional information after the Statement of Position? should be dispensed with that decision will be related to the taxpayer forthwith. Q.Can further discussions or conferences be held after the Statements of Position are exchanged? A.Yes. In some cases once Statements of Position have been exchanged, further discussion may resolve one or more of the outstanding issues. If all the issues are resolved, the appropriate assessment will be issued. If all of the issues are not agreed at the post disclosure discussion, only those unresolved issues will be sent to Adjudication for final determination. Disclosure Notices Q.Will there be a Disclosure Notice in every case? A.The legislation states the Commissioner may issue a disclosure notice. In practice the Commissioner will issue a disclosure notice in most cases if the dispute cannot be resolved before the adjudication phase. There will be limited exceptions such as if the personal safety of an informant is at risk or if investigations into an alleged offence may be jeopardised by full disclosure. Q.When can a Disclosure Notice be issued? A.A disclosure notice can be issued at any time on or after the issue of a NOPA. Q.If a Disclosure Notice is issued before the NOPA response period expires, does a Notice of Response still have to be given within the response period? A.Yes. The Notice of Response must be given within the response period for the NOPA and the Statement of Position must be given within the response period for the Disclosure Notice. Statement of Position Q.What happens if the taxpayer’s Statement of Posi- tion does not contain all the requisite information listed in section 89M(6)? A.The Statement of Position will be invalid. If a valid Statement of Position is not issued within the response period, the issues cannot be disputed any further, unless exceptional circumstances apply. The taxpayer will be deemed to have accepted the Commissioner’s NOPA or Statement of Position as the case may be. If possible, the Commissioner will contact the taxpayer and advise that the Statement of Position is deficient, provided there is still time within which a valid Statement could be issued. Evidence exclusion Q.What is meant by “all cards on the table”? A.The ‘all cards on the table’ approach is designed to ensure that all the information relied upon by each party to support their respective position is disclosed from page 29 31 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) A.The officer will consider the same factors that a court will have to consider if an application was made to include the information at hearing stage (section 138G(2)). Those factors are: whether with due diligence the information could have been disclosed earlier, and whether the admission of that information is necessary to avoid manifest injustice to the Commissioner or the taxpayer. Q.What is the procedure for asking a court to accept new evidence? A.The TRA operates in accordance with the District Court Rules which require a formal application to be made accompanied by an affidavit if the parties are represented by Counsel. If the taxpayer is unrepre- sented an informal oral application or letter may be allowed at the discretion of the Authority. For proceedings in the High Court, the High Court rules must be followed. Q.Does the evidence exclusion rule also apply to the Commissioner? A.Yes. Only those facts, evidence, issues or proposi- tions of law raised in the Commissioner’s or the taxpayer’s Statement of Position can be used by him to support the assessment. If the Commissioner discovers new information after completing his Statement of Position, the Commissioner may add that information with the consent of the taxpayer or he may apply to the Court to have the new informa- tion added. In any application to the Court the Commissioner must meet the same test as the taxpayer for the addition of new information. Q.Do expert opinions, valuations, texts etc. need to be disclosed in the Statement of Position? A.Yes. All the information that a party seeks to rely on in support of their position must be disclosed at the earliest stage. This is to encourage resolution of any disputes. Encouraging this information to be ob- tained and disclosed earlier may lead to one party’s position being recognised as the correct position at a much earlier stage. Q.How should the information be disclosed? A.The legislation requires that an outline of the information be given in sufficient detail to fairly inform the Commissioner or the taxpayer as the case may be. The Commissioner considers that this means an outline of all the information giving sufficient detail to ensure that both parties can identify each piece of information. For example, a list of documentary evidence providing a description of each document, the date of the document and the parties involved would be a sufficient outline to easily identify the document. An example of how the Commissioner proposes to disclose the information available is provided in the appendix. Q.Is it possible that more information will be disclosed in the Statement of Position than will actually be produced in Court? A.Yes. The information disclosed in the Statement of Position is that information which a party has relied upon in support of their position. It may be that if the dispute progresses to Court not all of that information will need to be produced in evidence. Q.Can the taxpayer raise matters contained in the Commissioner’s Statement of Position in any Court challenge to a disputable decision ? A.Yes. In any Court challenge to a disputable decision, both the taxpayer and Commissioner can raise matters in both their own and the other party’s Statement of Position. Q.What is due diligence in the context of the evidence exclusion rule? A.The first limb of the exception to the evidence exclusion rules requires a person to have exercised due diligence in trying to obtain the facts, evidence, issues and propositions of law before the date of the challenge. In that context a person will have exer- cised due diligence if that person has taken all reasonable care in the circumstances of the case and taking into account their personal situation. Adjudication Q.How does the taxpayer’s position get put fairly to the Adjudication Unit if it is being sent by the Inland Revenue officer? Can the taxpayer comment on the report prepared by the investigator? Can the tax- payer prepare his or her own report? A.The file that is sent to the Adjudication Unit com- prises the NOPA, Notice of Response, Statements of Position and a schedule of adjustments remaining in dispute. If there is a significant amount of documen- tary evidence it is possible that not all the evidence would be included in the file that is sent to the Unit. Before the file is sent to the Adjudication Unit a letter will be sent to the taxpayer enclosing a list of all the material in the file. If the case is one in which there is significant evidence and not all of it has been included in the file, the letter will ask the taxpayer to advise whether any other disclosed evidence should be included. It is important to note that only disclosed evidence can be sent to the Adjudication Unit. Further, because of the disclosure procedure there should be nothing in the file which the taxpayer is not already aware of. The file is simply a collation of material used by the parties in support of their respective positions. The purpose of sending the taxpayer a list of what will be sent to Adjudication is to ensure the openness of the Adjudication process. Q.Will the Adjudicator talk to the Inland Revenue officer without notifying the taxpayer? A.No. The Adjudicator’s role is to determine the technical and legal correctness of the proposed adjustment based on the position put by the Inland continued on page 32 32 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Position, does the evidence exclusion rule prevent these documents from being raised in court? A.No, the evidence exclusion rule does not prevent these documents from being raised in Court. The Adjudicator’s report and assessment may be used in court as the final consideration of the reasons for the assessment, i.e. the disputable decision itself. Q.How long will the Adjudicator take to issue a decision? A.We anticipate that an Adjudicator’s decision will be made within 4-6 weeks of receiving the file, subject to workloads. In less complex cases a decision may be able to be made in less time but in complex cases a decision may take longer. Q.If the Adjudicator does not agree with the Inland Revenue officer’s position will the officer be able to ‘appeal’ from the Adjudicator’s decision? A.No. The Commissioner has delegated his authority to determine disputed adjustments to the Adjudica- tor. The Inland Revenue officer and the Adjudicator are both acting under the Commissioner’s authority. The Commissioner can only have one view of the law. The Adjudicator’s decision will therefore be final. Q.Will an Adjudicator follow the Commissioner’s policy in all cases? A.The Adjudicator will seek to determine which position is legally correct. If this does not accord with a previous interpretation statement, the Adjudi- cator will not follow that interpretation. We expect that recent interpretation decisions will be in accord with the legislation and will be correct. In addition there would have been extensive consultation processes used before their publication. Q.Can a taxpayer contact the Adjudicator during the Adjudication phase? A.No. To retain independence and objectivity any contact will be rare. If contact is necessary it will be initiated by the Adjudicator. An Adjudicator will determine if any contact needs to be made. Any contact will be in writing and a copy will go to the other party to the dispute; if a meeting is proposed both parties will be invited to attend. The taxpayer or agent’s point of contact will remain the Inland Revenue officer they have been dealing with throughout the dispute. Q.What happens if a taxpayer wants to add more information to their Statement of Position - should the information be sent straight to the Adjudicator? A.No. The information should initially be sent to the Inland Revenue officer dealing with the case. That officer and his/her reporting officer will decide whether to agree to its inclusion in the Statement of Position in accordance with section 89M(14). If the officer agrees to its inclusion, the information will Revenue officer and the taxpayer. The Adjudicator is not to do further investigation. Contact between the Adjudicator and the Inland Revenue officer or taxpayer should rarely be necessary. If it is necessary for a point of clarification the Adjudicator will always make contact in writing. The same procedure will apply when the Adjudicator wishes to talk to the taxpayer. A copy of the written request and a copy of the response will always be sent to the other party. In extraordinary cases the Adjudicator may need to call a meeting to clarify an issue. In this case both the Inland Revenue officer and the taxpayer will have the opportunity to be present at such a meeting. Q.What will the Adjudicator base his or her decision on? A.The Adjudicator’s decision will be based on the information provided in the Statements of Position. The Adjudicator will consider the correct application of the law and determine whether the facts of the case in question meet the requirements of the legislation. The Adjudicator’s role is to achieve the legally correct answer based on the information presented in the file. Q.How will the Adjudicator decide on cases when the law is unclear? Will the Adjudicator let the Courts determine the issue? A.The Adjudicator’s concern is to ensure that the resulting assessment is legally sound. The Commis- sioner must have an opinion on the application of the law to be able to assess the amount of tax. He will do this by determining the better view of the law and applying it to the facts. Q.How will the parties be notified of the Adjudicator’s decision? A.The Adjudicator will prepare a brief report indicat- ing what the Commissioner’s final decision is on each proposed adjustment. (Note that the Adjudica- tor will not review previously agreed adjustments). A copy of the report will be sent to both the taxpayer and the Inland Revenue officer. If the Adjudicator agrees with the proposed adjustments or any of them, an assessment will be raised in due course. Q.Can the taxpayer discuss the Adjudicator’s report with the Adjudicator? A.No. If there is any ambiguity in the Adjudicator’s report, then the taxpayer can raise the matter with the Inland Revenue officer involved in the pre- adjudication stage in the first instance. It will be up to this person to clarify anything in the Adjudica- tor’s report. Contact with the Adjudicator will not be possible as the taxpayer has further rights to chal- lenge the decision. In addition, contact with the Adjudicator may compromise the Adjudicator’s impartiality. Q.As both the Adjudicator’s report and the Notice of Assessment are generated after the Statement of from page 31 33 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) be sent to Adjudication. If the officer does not agree to include the information the Adjudicator will not be influenced by information which was not avail- able to the officer at the time the officer made his or her decision. If the Adjudicator decides against the taxpayer and the taxpayer subsequently wants to challenge the assessment in court the taxpayer can then request that the Court allow the new informa- tion to be admitted. Q.What happens if a new Court decision is released which is relevant to an issue which is still at Adjudi- cation? A.If neither party has mentioned the underlying principles raised in the new case law, and they are seen as being material, the file will be sent back to the Inland Revenue officer for further discussion with the taxpayer. If the underlying principles have been mentioned in the Statements of Position, the Adjudicator will take the implications of the new case into account without the need to refer it back to the Inland Revenue officer. Q.What happens if there is a conflict of fact depending upon the issue of credibility? A.The Adjudicator will make a determination based on all the information and material presented. Small claims Q.What does precedential mean in the context of the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA? A.A case is likely to be considered precedential if it is likely to affect the tax treatment used by other taxpayers or if it is likely to affect the tax treatment used by the disputant taxpayer in other tax periods. Q.Will decisions from small claims be published? A.No. Decisions from the small claims jurisdiction of the TRA are non-precedential so will not be pub- lished. Q.What happens if the taxpayer elects small claims at the NOPA stage because the tax in dispute is less than $15,000 but with penalties and penal tax it exceeds $15,000? Can a taxpayer still file in the small claims jurisdiction? A.Yes. The $15,000 jurisdiction relates to the substan- tive tax in dispute, not to the penalties. Q.What if the taxpayer elects small claims and subse- quently changes her/his mind? A.The taxpayer’s election to have a case treated as a small claim is irrevocable. However, if the case changes so that the small claims jurisdiction is no longer appropriate the Commissioner or the TRA may apply to have the case transferred to another jurisdiction. Q.Is the small claims jurisdiction only $15,000 for all types of taxes or for each revenue? A.The jurisdictional limit is $15,000 per case, not per revenue type. Hence even if there are three types of taxes in issue for the same taxpayer, if the combined tax in dispute is greater than $15,000 the dispute cannot be heard in the small claims jurisdiction. Q.If a disputed GST adjustment affects the taxpayer’s income tax position can the taxpayer use the small claims procedure to challenge both adjustments? A.The answer will depend on the facts and issues in question. However, it is at least possible that the case may not be precedential but may be consequential. Q.Will a loss adjustment be able to be taken to small claims? A.Yes. The new section 13B(2)(b) of the Taxation Review Authorities Act 1994 includes loss adjust- ments within the jurisdiction of the small claims tribunal. QCan the Commissioner reject a small claims elec- tion? ANo. The Act does not allow the Commissioner to reject a small claims election if that election is made in the taxpayer’s NOPA or Notice of Response. However, if the dispute proceeds to court, the Commissioner may make an application to have the case moved to a different jurisdiction. The transfer will be requested if the case involves precedential issues, or if the facts are not clear or are still in dispute. The TRA could also transfer the case to another jurisdiction. Such transfers override the taxpayer’s election. Q.Will a disclosure notice be issued for all small claims cases? A.When the facts and issues are clear, and there is no added benefit from using the disclosure notice procedure, a disclosure notice may be dispensed with. Statute (time) bar Q.Has the statute (time) bar changed for GST returns? A.No. For GST returns the statute (time) bar runs from the end of the return period for which the return is provided or, if an assessment has been issued, from the date of the assessment. Q.How does the taxpayer waive the statute (time) bar? A.The taxpayer must sign a prescribed form setting out the taxpayer’s name and IRD number, the revenue type and tax period in question, the date on which the statutory period commenced and the date on which it is due to expire, and the period of the suspension, being a period of up to 6 months. Any number of suspensions can be agreed to provided that the total period of the suspension is no longer than six months from the date on which the statutory period would otherwise have expired. continued on page 34 34 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Q.Some contracts fall over after the payment of duty is made. In such circumstances a duty refund is currently sought by the taxpayer making a written application for a refund. Does a taxpayer now have to issue a NOPA?. A.If the Inland Revenue officer agrees to refund the duty a NOPA will not need to be issued; the written application for a refund will suffice. However, if the Inland Revenue officer does not agree to the refund a NOPA must be issued. Test cases Q.Can an Inland Revenue officer negotiate with the taxpayer not to issue an assessment until after the test case is heard? A.Subject to the statute (time) bar, nothing precludes a taxpayer and an Inland Revenue officer from reaching an agreement to delay an assessment until after a test case is heard. Q.When will test cases be identified? A.The Commissioner will not be in a position to know that the outcome of one case will affect a number of other cases until there have been two or more cases filed in Court on the same issue and raising the same arguments. Consequently, the Commissioner can only designate a test case and stay the other cases once they have been filed in court. Penalties and prosecutions \[Penal tax refers to penalties that apply for returns filed up to the 1997 income year, i.e. 31 March 1997 for standard balance date taxpayers. Reference to shortfall penalties means those penalties that apply from 1 April 1997 as a result of the new compliance and penalty provisions. These will be detailed in a separate TIB. It is likely that both penalty systems will operate for a number of years while tax audits cover both pre- and post-1 April 1997 periods\]. Q.If the substantive issues have been agreed to but not any applicable penal tax or shortfall penalties, does a separate NOPA have to be prepared for these adjustments? A.Yes. If penal tax or shortfall penalties are proposed and there is no agreement as to chargeability or amount, a NOPA will be issued. Q.Does the Adjudication Unit decide on penal tax or shortfall penalties, or only the substantive adjust- ments? A.If penal tax or shortfall penalties are in issue and agreement has not been reached the issue will usually be referred to Adjudication as for any other disputed adjustment. Q.What penalties will be referred to in the NOPA? A.Penal tax or shortfall penalties adjustments will be referred to in detail. If it is considered that penal tax Q.In what circumstances does the Commissioner consider a taxpayer is likely to waive the statute (time) bar? A.There are two probable situations - firstly when the dispute is not resolved and more time would allow completion of the disputes resolution procedures with the mutual agreement of the parties rather than the Commissioner having to issue an assessment, and secondly if there is another case before the courts which is likely to resolve the issue in the current dispute. Duties assessments Q.Do the exclusions contemplated in section 89C take into account duties assessments? A.Yes. Section 89C(a) allows the Commissioner to issue an assessment that corresponds with a tax return provided by the taxpayer. A tax return is defined as any form or document that a taxpayer is required by law to complete and provide to the Commissioner. Consequently any document together with the prescribed form (IR 664) which must be submitted for stamping will be within the definition of a tax return. The Commissioner can therefore issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA. Q.What happens if the self assessed duty is not correct? A.As with other types of assessments the Commis- sioner can issue an assessment without first issuing a NOPA in limited circumstances: if the return contains a simple mistake or oversight, if the taxpayer agrees with the adjustment or if the Com- missioner thinks there is a risk to the revenue. In all other cases the Commissioner must first issue a NOPA before issuing an assessment which differs from that returned by the taxpayer. Q.What happens if the duty payable has not been calculated? A.If the document is presented for stamping and the prescribed form (IR 664) does not have an amount of duty payable calculated the Commissioner will issue an assessment based on the information provided. The Commissioner does not need to issue a NOPA because the assessment will correspond with the information provided. Q.Does the taxpayer have to issue a NOPA to chal- lenge a stamp duty assessment? A.In the first instance the taxpayer should approach the Inland Revenue officer for an explanation of the altered assessment or to seek a change to the as- sessed duty. If the Inland Revenue officer does not agree with the change or the taxpayer does not like the explanation a NOPA must be issued by the taxpayer within the response period to dispute the duty assessed. The Commissioner is most likely to have issued an assessment in terms of section 89C(a) or (b). from page 33 35 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) or shortfall penalties may apply at the time the initial NOPA is prepared, they will be referred to in the initial NOPA. However, if it only becomes apparent as the audit progresses that penal tax or shortfall penalties could apply, a further NOPA may be issued dealing with the penal tax or shortfall penalties. Other consequential adjustments such as Use of Money Interest, additional tax, etc. will not be detailed in the NOPA. In the case of additional tax, Use of Money Interest and incremental tax, these figures will only be able to be determined once the dispute has been resolved and an assessment issued, as they continue to accrue until the date the outstanding tax is paid. Payment of tax owing Q.If there is more than one adjustment but some are agreed to and others are not, can the taxpayer make a voluntary payment to avoid penalties? A.Yes. Under the new disputes procedures an assess- ment is not raised until all issues relating to that assessment are resolved. If the due date for payment is set as the original due date, significant additional tax may be incurred by the time all the issues are resolved. In that instance a taxpayer can make a voluntary payment at any time. Q.When will the due date for payment of tax, penal tax/shortfall penalties be mentioned? A.These will generally be covered in the NOPA and/or the referral cover sheet to Adjudication. For returns filed for the year starting 1 April 1997, a new due date will always be set but interest will be payable from original due date. Further details will be covered in the upcoming TIB on the new Taxpayer Compliance and Penalties regime. Miscellaneous Q.What are propositions of law? A.A proposition of law is a statement regarding the application of the law. It may be based on statutes (tax laws) or case law, or other opinion. Propositions of law may also include a statement on the applica- tion of the law that has not been considered by the courts previously. Propositions of law should state the authority for the proposition relied upon, e.g. the particular case it is drawn from. Q.What happens if the taxpayer issues a NOPA, Notice of Response or Statement of Position, but the Commissioner does not receive it? A.Initially the Commissioner may require some proof from the taxpayer that a Notice was actually issued, particularly if the document was a NOPA. In the cases of Notices of Response or Statements of Position the Commissioner will be aware that there is a dispute in progress and will be monitoring the passing of the response period. If the taxpayer has issued a Notice, and the Commissioner has taken all reasonable steps to ensure that he receives it but he does not actually receive it, the Commissioner may apply to the Court for approval to respond outside the response period. Q.What happens if the taxpayer does not receive the Commissioner’s NOPA, Notice of Response or Disclosure Notice? A.All Notices sent out by the Commissioner will be recorded in the Inland Revenue computer system. The date of issue recorded in the computer system will be used as verification of the date of issue. The Commissioner will endeavour to advise the taxpayer when a notice is about to be issued. If the taxpayer does not receive the Notice, the taxpayer can file a NOPA and apply to the Commissioner for it to be accepted outside the response period due to excep- tional circumstances. In the case of the Commissioner’s Notice of Re- sponse it is unlikely that failure to receive will amount to exceptional circumstances because the taxpayer will be aware that there is a dispute in progress and the status of the dispute. In that instance failure to verify whether the Notice has actually been issued may not give rise to exceptional circumstances. In the case of a Statement of Position, failure to issue the Statement of Position within the response period prevents the taxpayer from proceeding further - the taxpayer is deemed to have accepted the Commis- sioner’s position, unless he or she successfully seeks an extension under section 89M(11). Q.Will the Commissioner acknowledge receipt of the taxpayer’s notices? A.Yes. Procedures have been established for prompt acknowledgment. Q.What will the Commissioner do if the taxpayer issues a NOPA or Notice of Response which does not meet the requirements of the legislation? A.If the Notice is manifestly inadequate it will be invalid. The Commissioner will contact the taxpayer if possible, and advise that the Notice cannot be accepted and that a further Notice should be issued within the response period. If the response period has expired the only avenue open to the taxpayer is to make an application for exceptional circum- stances. However, if the taxpayer has prepared an inadequate Notice previously and has elected not to seek advice to prepare a valid Notice it is unlikely that this would, on its own, amount to exceptional circumstances. Q.If the Commissioner does not advise the taxpayer that the NOPA or Notice of Response is invalid within the taxpayer’s response time, will it meet the exceptional circumstances test if a valid notice is provided later? continued on page 36 36 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) A.Approval to apply section BB 9 will be sought at the NOPA stage. Approval will be given by either National Office or Service Centre management. If the application of section BB 9 is disputed by the taxpayer the final decision will in most cases be made by the Adjudication Unit. If the application of section BB 9 is not disputed by the taxpayer final approval will be given by the Team Leader. Q.If the taxpayer does not agree with the proposed adjustment can the resolution process be put on hold while the taxpayer seeks a binding ruling? A.No. An application for a binding ruling can not be made while the Commissioner is undertaking an audit. However the dispute resolution process may be put on hold while advice is sought from other experts both within and outside Inland Revenue. A.No, because the requirements for exceptional circumstances are specifically set out in the legisla- tion. There is adequate material available from Inland Revenue which explains to a taxpayer how to complete a valid notice. Q.If the Commissioner issues a disclosure notice soon after a NOPA, is the conference stage dispensed with? A.The need for a conference will depend on the issue in question. The purpose of the new procedure is to resolve disputes. If a conference is likely to help resolve the dispute the conference stage will not be dispensed with. Q.In tax avoidance cases at what stage will the Inland Revenue officer have to seek approval to use section BB 9? from page 35 37 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.3 (August 1996) Notices issued by Inland Revenue - examples The following are sample forms that will be issued by the Commissioner. The sample forms contain the sub- headings that are stated in the legislation, and that will be used for each type of form. They will be generated on Personal Computers, using pre formatted templates. The length of each document will depend on the number of issues involved. Pre printed NOPA, Notice of Response and Statement of Position forms are available from Inland Revenue for use by taxpayers and agents.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) Example 1 Purchase of a motor vehicle: payment in arrears and 10% deposit Calculation of a lowest price by buyer for section EH 4 using various rates and methods This is a simple example of a Foreign Currency ASAP with a deposit, payment in arrears, and no charge for the deferral of the payment. It shows the different results that will arise under the base price adjustment (section EH 4), using Rates C, D and E to calculate the core acquisition price. It also shows how Method E would apply to the calculation of income/expenditure from the arrangement. 1.1 On 1 February 1997 a NZ resident with a 31 March balance date agrees to purchase a motor vehicle from a US resident for US$14,000. The buyer pays a deposit of US$1,400 on 1 February 1997. The Rights Date will be 15 March 1997, when the vehicle is delivered to the buyer in Los Angeles. The final payment of US$12,600 does not have to be made until 15 September 1997. The price that the buyer would have had to pay for a cash sale is US$14,000. The car is acquired for business use. 1.2 The US$/NZ$ exchange rates for the various dates are: 1 February 19970.5600 15 March 19970.5500 31 March 19970.5300 15 September 19970.5700 1.3 This fact situation can be represented diagrammati- cally as follows: Rate and Method C 1.4 If the buyer applies Rate C, the NZ$ Lowest Price will be the US$14,000 Lowest Price converted into NZ$ at the spot exchange rate on the Rights Date, ie. US$14,000 .5500 which is $25,454. 1.5 Leaving aside any income or expenditure that might be recognized by the buyer under the accrual rules in the 1997 year, the base price adjustment in the 1998 year would be: $24,605 - $25,454 = ($849). This would be income to the buyer. Rate and Method D 1.6 If the buyer applies Rate D, the NZ$ Lowest Price will be the US$14,000 Lowest Price converted into NZ$ at the spot exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. US$14,000 .5600 which is NZ$25,000. 1.7 Leaving aside any income or expenditure that might be recognized by the buyer under the accrual rules in the 1997 year, the base price adjustment in the 1998 year would be: $24,605 - $25,000 = ($395). This would be income to the buyer. Rate and Method E 1.8 If the buyer applies Rate E to calculate the NZ$ Lowest Price, it must apply Method E to calculate its income/expenditure from the Foreign Currency ASAP in the 1997 year. Method E requires it to calculate the result of the formula: a - b - c where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price. This is the total of: (a) US$1,400/.56 = $2,500; (b) US$12,600/.53 = $23,774. The buyer uses the spot rate on balance date to convert the final payment, because it is required to file its tax return for the 1997 tax year before the agreement is com- pleted. ‘a’ is therefore $2,500 + $23,774 = $26,274; ‘b’ is the Lowest Price converted into NZ$ using the weighted average of the spot rates used to calculate ‘a’. The weighted average is: US$14,000 (US$1,400/.56) + (US$12,600/.53) which is .53285. ‘b’ is therefore US$14,000/.53285 = $26,274; ‘c’ is the unaccrued interest, treating the agree- ment as two US$ loans as follows: (a) a loan (i)from the buyer to the seller; (ii) advanced on 1 February 1997 (the Contract Date); continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) (iii) of US$1,400; (iv) repaid on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (v) with a payment of $1,400. (b) a loan (i)from the seller to the buyer; (ii) advanced on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (iii) of US$12,600; (iv) repaid on 15 September 1997 (the date of the second payment); (v) with a repayment amount of US$12,600. The buyer must calculate its income from this arrangement in US$, and then convert it into NZ$ using the same rate used to calculate ‘a’. Because the US$ amount paid by the purchaser is the same as the US$ Lowest Price, the buyer has no unaccrued income or expenditure from the notional loans in the income year ended 31 March 1997. 1.9 The result of Method E is therefore $26,274 - $26,274 - 0 = 0. The buyer has no income or expenditure under section EH 1 in the 1997 year. 1.10 In the income year ended 31 March 1998, the buyer applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the issuer. This is the US$ price of the vehicle, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This will be: (i)in relation to the deposit, US$1,400/.56 = $2,500 (ii) in relation to the final payment, US$12,600/.57 = $22,105 giving a total of $24,605; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using the weighted average Spot Rate on the Payment Dates. The weighted average spot rate is: US$14,000 (US$1,400/.56) + (US$12,600/.57) which is .5690. The acquisition price is therefore $24,605; c = expenditure already recognized, of 0. The base price adjustment is therefore $24,605 - $24,605 = 0. from page 1 Example 2 Payment in arrears; charge for deferral Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various methods and rates This example involves deferred payment with a charge being made for the deferral. It shows how Rates and Methods A to D would apply to calculate the buyer’s income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 2.1 On 1 February 1997 a US resident agrees to sell a quantity of plate glass to a NZ resident glass wholesaler for US$140,000. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the date the glass is landed in Auckland, which is expected to occur on 1 March. The glass will be at the seller’s risk until it is landed in Auckland. The date it is landed will be the Rights Date. If payment were made at that time, the price would be US$130,000. 2.2 The glass is unloaded in Auckland on 15 March 1997. Therefore the term of the arrangement is 1 February 1997 to 15 September 1997 - 226 days. The purchaser’s balance date is 30 June.

Rate and Method A 2.5 If the purchaser applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the glass using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) the expected Rights Date, it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.6 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses Determination G9A. 2.7 Under Determination G9A, income or expenditure will be: a + b - c - d where ‘a’ is the value in NZ$ of the closing tax book value, using the spot rate at balance date; and ‘b’ is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consid- eration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given; and ‘c’ is the value in NZ$ of the opening tax book value, using the spot rate at the start of the year; and ‘d’ is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consid- eration given during the income year by or on behalf of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given. 2.8 The closing tax book value is calculated as follows: e + f + g - h - i where ‘e’ is - (i)the opening tax book value at the begin- ning of the period, if the person was a party to the arrangement at that time; and (ii) in every other case, nil; and ‘f’ is the sum of the US$ value of all considera- tion given during the income year by or on behalf of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement; and ‘g’ is the purchaser’s US$ income in respect of the financial arrangement during the year; and ‘h’ is the sum of the US$ value of all considera- tion given during the income year to or for the benefit of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement; and ‘i’is the US$ expenditure of the purchaser in relation to the financial arrangement. 2.9 In this case: (a) ‘e’, ‘f’ and ‘g’ are zero; (b) ‘h’ is the amount advanced under the notional loan, ie. US$130,000; (c) to calculate ‘i’, the purchaser allocates the US$10,000 of expenditure over the period on a straight line basis. For the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (107/184) x US$10,000 = US$5,815. The closing book value of the financial arrange- ment is therefore (US$135,815). 2.10 To calculate ‘a’ in the formula, the purchaser converts this closing tax book value into NZ$ using the spot rate on the balance date. This gives a figure of (US$135,815)/.5750 = ($236,200). 2.11 ‘b’ in the formula is the amount advanced under the notional loan, converted into NZ$ at the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 = $224,138. 2.12 ‘c’ and ‘d’ in the formula are zero. The result of the formula in Determination G9A in the year ended 30 June 1997 is therefore ($236,200) + $224,138 = ($12,062). Because this is a negative amount, it is expenditure to the purchaser. 2.13 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 = $224,138; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 1 March. This is US$130,000/.55 = $236,364. The result is therefore ($12,226). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be income to the purchaser. 2.14 The purchaser’s income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($12,062) + $12,226 which gives income of $164. 2.15 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; ‘b’ is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate A, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. US$130,000/.55 = $236,364; continued on page 4 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) ‘c’ is income already recognized, of $164. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,086. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.16 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $236,364 for the glass will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. Rate and Method B 2.17 If the purchaser applies section OB 7 (1)(b) and calculates the NZ$ Lowest Price of the glass using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.18 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 2.4. However, in calculating this income or expenditure, it does not use determi- nation G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). 2.19 To calculate the foreign currency income/expendi- ture, the purchaser allocates the US$10,000 expenditure (ie. the difference between the Lowest Price and the price) over the period from 15 March to 15 September on a straight line basis. For the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (107/184) x US$10,000 = US$5,815. 2.20 The purchaser converts this amount into NZ$ using the spot rate at year end, which gives NZ$ expendi- ture of US$5,815/.575 = $10,113. 2.21 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 30 June to 15 September (the expected Settlement Date on 30 June). This is US$130,000/.577 = $225,303; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 1 February (the Contract Date) to 1 September (the expected Settlement Date on 1 February). This is US$130,000/.585 = $222,222. The result is $3,081. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be expenditure to the purchaser. 2.22 The purchaser’s income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($10,113) + ($3,081) which gives expenditure of $13,194. 2.23 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: ‘a’ is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; ‘b’ is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate B, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date ie. US$130,000/.585 = $222,222; ‘c’ is expenditure already recognized, of $13,194. The base price adjustment is therefore $10,198. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.24 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the glass of $222,222 will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. Rate and Method C 2.25 If the purchaser applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the glass using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.26 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses determination G9A to determine its income or expenditure from the loan. The calculations are set out in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.12, which will give it expenditure of $12,062 from the notional loan. 2.27 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: ‘a’ is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; ‘b’ is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate C, the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. US$130,000/.58 = $224,138; ‘c’ is expenditure already recognized, of $12,062. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,414. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) 2.28 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $224,138 for the glass will also be its cost price for tax purposes. Rate and Method D 2.29 If the purchaser applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the glass using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 30 June 1997. 2.30 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997 the purchaser first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 2.4. The purchaser uses determination G9A to determine its income or expenditure from the loan. The calculations are set out in paragraphs 2.7 to 2.12, which will give it expenditure of $12,062 from the notional loan. 2.31 The second step requires the purchaser to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$130,000/.58 which is $224,138; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Contract Date. This is US$130,000/.56 = $232,143. The result is ($8,005). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the purchaser, it will be income to the purchaser. 2.32 The purchaser’s income/expenditure for the 1997 year is therefore ($12,062) + $8,005 which gives expenditure of $4,057. 2.33 In the 1998 income year, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: ‘a’ is all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the glass, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$140,000/.57 = $245,614; ‘b’ is the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate D, the spot rate on the Contract Date, ie. US$130,000/.56 = $232,143; ‘c’ is expenditure already recognized, of $4,057. The base price adjustment is therefore $9,414. Since this is a positive amount and the purchaser is the issuer of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 2.34 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the glass of $232,143 will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. This is an example of a contract with payment in arrears and no charge for the deferral. It shows how Rates and Methods A to D would apply to calculate a seller’s income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. Initially, it is on the basis that both delivery and payment are after balance date. Then the balance date is changed so that the delivery is before balance date. 3.1 On 15 October 1996 the taxpayer, a NZ wool exporter, agrees to sell 10,000 kg of wool for US$3 per kilo, delivered to a Japanese port specified by the buyer. On both the Contract Date and 31 March, the exporter reasonably expects that delivery will occur on 20 April 1997. US$3 is the price the parties would agree for payment on the delivery date. Payment is required 60 days after delivery. The exporter has a 31 March balance date. 3.2 The wool is actually delivered on 25 May 1997, and payment is made on 29 July 1997. 3.3 The US$/NZ$ exchange rates in the 1997 income year are as follows: SpotForwardForward exchangerate torate to Daterate20 April 199720 June 1997 15 Oct 19960.5850.6050.62 31 Mar 1997 0.61 0.6120.615 25 May 1997 0.635 30 June 1997 0.645n/a0.58 29 July 19970.64 n/an/a 3.4 Diagrammatically, the transaction can be repre- sented as follows: General 3.5 Whichever method the exporter decides to use, it will have to treat itself as party to a notional foreign currency loan: continued on page 6 Example 3 Sale of trading stock: payment in arrears Calculation of income by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various rates and methods 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) (a) from the exporter to the buyer; (b) advanced on 25 May 1997 (the Rights Date); (c) of an amount equal to the Lowest Price of US$30,000; (d) repaid on 29 July 1997 (the payment date); (e) with a repayment amount of US$30,000. Rate and Method A 3.6 If the exporter applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the wool using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.7 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 3.5 above. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at this date, there is no income or expenditure. 3.8 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for delivery of currency on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April 1997. This is US$30,000/ .612 = $49,020; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April 1997. This is US$30,000/.605 = $49,587. The result is therefore ($567). Since this is a negative amount and the exporter is the seller, it will be expenditure to it. This will be the exporter’s expenditure from the agreement for the year. 3.9 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the Forward Rate on 15 October 1996 (the Contract Date) for delivery on 20 April 1997 (the expected Rights Date). This is US$30,000/.605 which is NZ$49,587; ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognized, which in this case is (NZ$567). The base price adjustment is therefore ($2,145) which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. This amount is attributable to the fluctuation in the US$/NZ$ exchange rate between the balance date and the payment date. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $49,587. 3.10 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the taxpayer had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June 1997 is NZ$1:US$0.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the taxpayer applies Determination G9A to calcu- late its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from delivery date to balance date, in the principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: 30,000 - 30,000 .645 .635 =46,512-47, 244 = ($732). This will be expenditure to the taxpayer. 3.11 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. 25 May. This is US$30,000/.635 = $47,244; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 April. This is US$30,000/.605 = $49,587. The result is therefore ($2,343). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be expenditure to the seller. 3.12 The taxpayer’s total expenditure from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $3,075. 3.13 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the amount received by the taxpayer. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the forward exchange rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. it is NZ$49,587; ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($3,075). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the taxpayer. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) Rate and Method B 3.14 If the exporter applies section OB 7(1)(b) and calculates the NZ$ Lowest Price of the wool using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.15 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan described in paragraph 3.5. However, in calculat- ing this income or expenditure, it does not use determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on Payment Date (or year end, if Payment Date is after year end). 3.16 As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure. 3.17 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on 31 March for delivery of currency on the expected Settle- ment Date, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.615 = $48,780; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.62 = $48,387. The result is therefore $393. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be income to it. This will be the exporter’s income from the agreement for the year. 3.18 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the US$ into NZ$ using Rate B, the Forward Rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date. This is US$30,000/.62 which is NZ$48,387; ‘c’ is income already recognized, which in this case is NZ$393. The base price adjustment is therefore ($1,905) which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $48,387. 3.19 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter does not use Determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). Since there is no US$ income from the notional loan, there will also be no NZ$ income using this method. 3.20 The second step required is for the exporter to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date (now 30 June) for delivery of currency on the expected Settlement Date. Although the expected Settlement Date on the Contract Date was 20 June, the wool has been delivered late, and the expected Settlement Date is now 29 July. Assume that the forward rate from 30 June to 29 July is .61. ‘a’ is therefore US$30,000/.61 = $49,180; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date at that time, ie. 20 June. This is US$30,000/.62 = $48,387. The result is therefore $793. Since this is a positive amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be income to it. The exporter’s total income from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $793. 3.21 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the US$30,000 into NZ$ using Rate B, the forward exchange rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Settlement Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.62 = NZ$48,387. ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is $793. The base price adjustment is therefore ($2,305), which is an allowable deduction to the taxpayer. continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) Rate and Method C 3.22 If the exporter applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the wool using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.23 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 30 June 1997, the exporter first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan, set out in paragraph 3.5. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure in that year. 3.24 In the 1998 income year the exporter applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4 to the contract to sell the wool. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the buyer. This is the US$ price of the wool, converted into NZ$ at the Spot Rate when paid. This is US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using Rate C (the spot rate on the Rights Date), ie. US$30,000/.635 = $47,244; c = expenditure already recognized, of 0. The base price adjustment is therefore ($369). Since this is a negative amount and the exporter is the holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, this will be an allowable deduction to the exporter in the 1998 year. 3.25 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price for the wool will also be its sale price for tax purposes. 3.26 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter applies determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from the Rights Date to balance date, in the NZ$ value of principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: 30,000 - 30,000 .645 .635 =46,512-47,244 =($732). This will be expenditure to the exporter in the 1997 year. 3.27 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the amount received by the exporter. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated converting the Lowest Price into NZ$ using the spot rate on the Rights Date, ie. it is NZ$47,244; ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($732). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the taxpayer. Rate and Method D 3.28 If the exporter applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the wool using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997. 3.29 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the exporter first calculates its income from the notional US$ loan set out in paragraph 3.5. As no amounts have been advanced under the loan at 31 March, there is no income or expenditure in that year. 3.30 The second step requires the exporter to calculate the result of: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price using the spot rate on balance date. This is US$30,000/.61 which is $49,180; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price using the spot rate on Contract Date. This is US$30,000/.585 which is $51,282. The result is therefore ($2,102). As this is negative and the exporter is the seller, this is expenditure to the exporter. This will be all of its expenditure in the 1997 year from the wool contract. This ex- penditure is solely attributable to the fluctuations in the US$/NZ$ spot exchange rate. 3.31 The exporter must perform a base price adjustment for the wool contract in the 1998 year. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price on the date of payment, ie. US$30,000/.64 = NZ$46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price. Because the exporter is using Rate D, this is calculated by convert- ing the US$ into NZ$ using the exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.585 which is NZ$51,282; from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognized, which in this case is (NZ$2,102). The base price adjustment is therefore $2,305 which is an allowable deduction to the exporter. The exporter will be treated as having sold the wool for $51,282. 3.32 Suppose that the facts are the same except that the exporter had a 30 June balance date. The spot exchange rate on 30 June is NZ$1:US$.645. With respect to the notional loan, made on 25 May, the exporter applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the 1997 year. Since there is no implied interest component, this will be equal to the NZ$ currency fluctuation, from delivery date to balance date, in the principal amount of US$30,000. This will be: 30,000-30,000 .645 .635 =$46,512 -$47,244 =($732) This will be expenditure to the exporter. 3.33 The exporter will also have to make the adjustment a - b. In this case: ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price con- verted using the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is US$30,000/.635 which is $47,244; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the spot rate on the Contract Date. This is US$30,000/.585 which is $51,282. The result is therefore ($4,038). Since the exporter is the seller, and this amount is negative, it is expenditure. 3.34 The exporter’s total expenditure from the wool contract for the 1997 year is therefore $4,770. 3.35 In the 1998 year the wool contract will mature, so a base price adjustment will have to be calculated. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the amount received by the exporter. This is the US$ price received, on the day it is received, ie. US$30,000/.64 = $46,875; ‘b’ is the acquisition price. Because the exporter is using Rate D, the US$30,000 is converted into NZ$ using the exchange rate on the Contract Date, ie. it is US$30,000/.585 which is NZ$51,282; ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognised, which in this case is ($4,770). The base price adjustment is therefore $363, which will be income to the exporter. Example 4 Further example of income calculation by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various rates and methods This is an example with payments in advance and in arrears, and no difference between the actual price and a cash settlement price. It shows how Rates and Meth- ods A to D would apply to calculate a seller’s income/expenditure under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 4.1 On 7 November 1997, a NZ furniture manufacturer with a December 31 balance date sells a consign- ment of pine furniture to an Australian purchaser for A$2,000,000. The furniture is to be shipped on a FOB basis, ie. the purchaser takes property in it once it is loaded on the vessel. A$150,000 is payable on 7 November, a further A$150,000 is payable once the furniture has been accepted by the shipper, and the remainder of the price is payable once the furniture is unloaded in Sydney, which is expected to be at the end of February. 4.2 Because the furniture is shipped FOB, the Rights Date is the date it is loaded, which is expected to be 20 February 1998. The parties agree that A$2,000,000 is the price they would have agreed on for the furniture on the basis of payment in full on 20 February. 4.3 The goods are in fact shipped on 5 March 1998, and arrive in Sydney on 10 March 1998. The A$/NZ$ Spot Rates on the relevant dates, and the resulting NZ$ spot values, are: SpotForwardForward exchangerate torate to Daterate20 February28 February 7 Nov 19970.88750.92050.9250 31 Dec 19970.91100.93000.9275 5 Mar 19980.9505n/an/a 10 Mar 19980.9550n/an/a 4.4 Diagrammatically, the transaction can be repre- sented as follows: continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) General 4.5 Whichever method the manufacturer decides to use, it will have to treat itself as party to two notional foreign currency loans, as follows: 4.5.1 A loan from the buyer to the seller: (a) advanced on 7 November (the Contract Date); (b) of A$150,000; (c) repaid on 5 March 1998 (the Rights Date); (d) with a repayment amount of A$150,000. 4.5.2 A loan from the seller to the buyer: (a) advanced on 5 March (the Rights Date); (b) of A$1.7m; (c) repaid on 10 March 1998 (the Settlement Date); (d) with a repayment amount of A$1.7m. Rate and Method A 4.6 If the manufacturer applies section OB 7(1)(a) and calculates the Lowest Price of the furniture using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Rights Date it must apply Method A to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.7 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan set out in paragraph 4.5.1 above. Applying the formula in Determination G9A, the furniture manufacturer’s income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 will be calculated in accordance with the following formula: a + b - c - d where: ‘a’ is the value of NZ$ of the closing tax book value, using the spot rate at balance date; and ‘b’ is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consid- eration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given; and ‘c’ the value in NZ$ of the opening tax book value, using the spot rate at the start of the year; and ‘d’ is the sum of the value in NZ$ of all consid- eration given during the income year by or on behalf of the person in relation to the financial arrangement, using the spot rate when that consideration is given. 4.8 The closing tax book value is calculated as follows: e + f + g - h - i where ‘e’ is the opening tax book value at the beginning of the year, if the person was a party to the arrangement at that time. This will be zero because the transaction was entered into during the year; and ‘f’ is the sum of the A$ value of all consideration given during the income year by or on behalf of the seller in relation to the notional loan. This will be zero for the year, since the manufacturer does not repay the loan until the 1998 year; and ‘g’ is the manufacturer’s A$ income in respect of the loan during the year. This will be zero, since there is no difference between the A$ amounts lent and repaid; and ‘h’ is the sum of the A$ value of all consideration given during the income year to or for the benefit of the manufacturer in relation to the notional loan. This will be A$150,000; and ‘i’is the A$ expenditure of the manufacturer in relation to the notional loan. This will be zero. The closing tax book value is therefore (A$150,000). 4.9 To calculate ‘a’ in the formula, the manufacturer converts this closing tax book value into NZ$ using the spot rate on the balance date. This gives a figure of (A$150,000)/.911 = ($164,654). 4.10 ‘b’ in the formula is the A$150,000 paid to the manufacturer during the income year, converted into NZ$ using the spot rate on the date of pay- ment, ie. A$150,000/.8875, which is $169,014. 4.11 ‘c’ and ‘d’ in the formula are both zero. The manufacturer therefore has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. 4.12 The second step requires the manufacturer to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for exchange of currencies on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/ .9300 = $2,150,538; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date for exchange of currencies on the expected Rights Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9205 = $2,172,732. The result is therefore ($22,194). Since this is a negative amount and the manufacturer is the seller, it will be expenditure to the seller. from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) 4.13 The manufacturer’s income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997 is therefore $4,360 + ($22,194) which gives expenditure of $17,834. 4.14 In the year ended 31 December 1998, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be equal to: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer. This will be the total of (a) A$150,000/.8875 = $169,014 (the payment on the Contract Date); plus (b) A$150,000/.9505 = $157,812 (the payment on the shipment date); plus (c) A$1,700,000/.955 = $1,780,105 (the final payment) which gives a total of $2,106,931. ‘b’ is the acquisition price, calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate A, the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the expected Rights Date, ie. it is $2,172,732 (A$2,000,000/.9205); ‘c’ which is income/expenditure already recog- nized will be ($17,834). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($47,967). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.15 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,172,732. Method B 4.16 If the manufacturer applies section OB 7(1)(b) and calculates the Lowest Price of the furniture using the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date it must apply Method B to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.17 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional foreign currency loan described in paragraph 4.5.1. However, in calculating this income or expendi- ture, it does not use Determination G9A. Instead, it must treat the foreign currency loan as if it were in NZ$, and convert the resulting foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on payment date (or year end, if payment date is after year end). Since there is no A$ income on the notional loan, there is also no NZ$ income. 4.18 The second step required is for the manufacturer to calculate the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the balance date for delivery of currency on the expected Settle- ment Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9275 = $2,156,334; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price converted using the forward rate on the Contract Date to the expected Settlement Date, ie. 20 February. This is A$2,000,000/.9250 = $2,162,162. The result is therefore ($5,828). Since this is a negative amount and the taxpayer is the seller, it will be expenditure to it. This will be the manufac- turer’s expenditure from the agreement for the year. 4.19 In the 1998 year, the manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer, which will be A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate B, the forward rate on the Contract Date for delivery on the Settlement Date, ie. it is A$2,000,000/.9250 = $2,162,162; ‘c’ which is income/expenditure already recog- nized will be ($5,828). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($49,403). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.20 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,162,162. Rate and Method C 4.21 If the manufacturer applies Rate C, it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the furniture using the spot rate on the Rights Date, and must apply Method C to calculate its income/expenditure under section EH 1 from the contract in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.22 Under Method C, the manufacturer treats itself as being party to a notional A$ loan, as set out in paragraph 4.5.1. It applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997. It therefore undertakes the calculations set out in 4.7 to 4.11 above, and has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. continued on page 12 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) 4.23 In the year ended 31 December 1998, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the total of the amounts received, ie. A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate C, ie. the spot rate on the Rights Date. This is A$2,000,000/.9505 = $2,104,156; ‘c’ is income/expenditure already recognized which will be $4,360. The base price adjustment will therefore be ($1,585). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.24 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,104,156. Rate and Method D 4.25 If the manufacturer applies Rate D it will calculate the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price of the furniture using the spot rate on the Contract Date, and must apply Method D to calculate income/expenditure in the year ended 31 December 1997. 4.26 In calculating its income/expenditure in the year ended 31 March 1997 the manufacturer first calculates its income from the notional A$ loan set out in paragraph 4.5.1. It applies Determination G9A to calculate its income/expenditure for the year ended 31 December 1997. It therefore under- takes the calculations set out in 4.7 to 4.11 above, and has income from the notional foreign currency loan in the year ended 31 December 1997 of $4,360. 4.27 The furniture manufacturer must also take into account as income or expenditure the amount: a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price calcu- lated using the Spot Rate on the balance date. This is A$2,000,000/.9110 which is $2,195,390; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price calcu- lated using the Spot Rate on the Contract Date. This is A$2,000,000/.8875 which is $2,253,521. The result is therefore ($58,131). Since the furni- ture manufacturer is the seller, this will be ex- penditure to the seller. 4.28 The furniture manufacturer’s expenditure from the contract for the year ended 31 December 1997 will therefore be $4,360 + ($58,131) = ($53,771). 4.29 In the 1998 year, the furniture manufacturer calculates a base price adjustment. This will be: a - (b + c) where ‘a’ is the total of the amounts received by the manufacturer, ie. A$150,000/.8875 + A$150,000/.9505 + A$1,700,000/.955 which gives a total of $2,106,931; ‘b’ is the acquisition price calculated by convert- ing the Lowest Price into NZ$ using Rate D, the spot rate on the Contract Date of the Foreign Currency ASAP, will be $2,253,521; ‘c’ which is income/expenditure already recog- nized will be ($53,771). The base price adjustment will therefore be ($92,819). Since the furniture manufacturer is a holder of the Foreign Currency ASAP, and since the base price adjustment is a negative figure, this will be an allowable deduction to the furniture manufacturer. 4.30 The furniture will be treated as sold for NZ$2,253,521. from page 11 Example 5 Purchase of a building: payment in arrears Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using rate and method E This is an example with payment in arrears, and a charge for the deferral. It shows how Rate and Method E would apply to calculate a buyer’s income/expendi- ture under sections EH 1 and EH 4. 5.1 A commercial property is sold by a US resident to a NZ resident for US$1,400,000 on 1 February 1997. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the date possession passes, which is expected to occur in March, after the seller has undertaken certain repairs. They also agree that if payment were made on the date of possession, the price would have been US$1,300,000. 5.2 Possession of the property passes on 15 March 1997, which is the Rights Date. Therefore the term 13 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight , No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) of the agreement is 1 February 1997 to 15 Septem- ber 1997 - 226 days. 5.3 The purchaser’s balance date is 30 June. 5.4 The US$/NZ$ spot exchange rates for the various dates are: 1 February 19970.5600 15 March 19970.5800 30 June 19970.5750 15 September 19970.5700 In this case the purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules. 5.5 This fact situation can be represented diagrammati- cally as follows: 5.6 The purchaser is entitled to use Rate and Method E, and elects to do so. For the year ended 30 June 1997, it calculates its income using the formula: a - b - c where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price. This is US$1,400,000/.57 = $2,456,140. Although the payment date is after the end of the relevant year, it is before the taxpayer is required to file its return for the year (for a 30 June year, 7 October - see section 37 of the Tax Adminis- tration Act 1994); ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the Lowest Price, using the same exchange rate used to calculate ‘a’. This is US$1,300,000/.57 = $2,280,702; ‘c’ is the unaccrued difference between the price and the Lowest Price, treating the agreement as a loan: (i)from the seller to the buyer; (ii) advanced on 15 March 1997 (the Rights Date); (iii) of US$1,300,000; (iv) repaid on 15 September 1997; (v) with a repayment amount of US$1,400,000. 5.7 To calculate this unaccrued difference, the pur- chaser allocates the resulting US$100,000 of expenditure over the period using an available method under the qualified accruals rules. For a loan of less than one year’s duration, a straight line basis is available, and the purchaser elects to use this. 5.8 For the period after the end of the year ended 30 June 1997, this gives expenditure of: (77/184) x US$100,000 = US$41,848. 5.9 The purchaser converts this amount into NZ$ using the same spot rate used to calculate ‘a’. This gives an unaccrued difference of: US$41,848/.57 = $73,417. 5.10 The result of a - b - c is therefore $2,456,140 - $2,280,702 - $73,417 = $102,021. Because this is a positive amount, it will be expenditure for the purchaser. 5.11 For the year ended 30 June 1998, the purchaser applies the base price adjustment in section EH 4. This will be calculated as follows: a = all amounts of consideration paid by the purchaser. This is the US$ price of the building, converted into NZ$ at the spot rate when paid. This will be US$1,400,000/.57 = $2,456,140; b = the acquisition price, calculated converting the Lowest Price in US$ into NZ$ using the spot rate on the Payment Date. This is US$1,300,000/.57 = $2,280,702; c = expenditure already recognized, of $102,021. The base price adjustment is therefore $73,417, which will be expenditure to the purchaser in the 1998 year. 5.12 If the seller did not complete the repairs until July so that the purchaser did not take possession until after June, the buyer would have no expenditure under section EH 1 in the year ended 30 June 1997, since no payment under the notional loan contract would have been made during the 1997 year. 5.13 Under section EH 8(2) of the Act, the acquisition price of $2,280,702 for the building will also be its cost price for depreciation purposes. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 - Appendix (September 1996) Appendix to TIB Volume Eight, No.4September 1996 Examples for Determination G29 Contents Example 1 Purchase of a motor vehicle: payment in arrears and 10% deposit Calculation of lowest price by buyer for section EH 4 using various rates and methods ...............................................................................................1 Rate and method C ........................................................................................................... 1 Rate and method D .......................................................................................................... 1 Rate and method E ........................................................................................................... 1 Example 2 Payment in arrears: charge for deferral Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various methods and rates ...............................................................................................2 General ............................................................................................................................. 2 Rate and method A .......................................................................................................... 2 Rate and Method B .......................................................................................................... 4 Rate and Method C .......................................................................................................... 4 Rate and Method D .......................................................................................................... 5 Example 3 Sale of trading stock: payment in arrears Calculation of income by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various methods and rates ...............................................................................................5 General ............................................................................................................................. 5 Rate and method A .......................................................................................................... 6 Rate and method B ........................................................................................................... 7 Rate and Method C .......................................................................................................... 8 Rate and Method D .......................................................................................................... 8 Example 4 Further example of calculation of income by seller under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using various rates and methods .............................................. 9 General ........................................................................................................................... 10 Rate and method A ........................................................................................................ 10 Rate and Method B ........................................................................................................ 11 Rate and Method C ........................................................................................................ 11 Rate and Method D ........................................................................................................ 12 Example 5 Purchase of building Calculation of income by buyer under sections EH 1 and EH 4 using method E .......12
1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) Interpretation statements This section of the TIB contains interpretation statements issued by the Commissioner of Inland Revenue. These statements set out the Commissioner’s view on how the law applies to a particular set of circumstances when it is either not possible or not appropriate to issue a binding pubic ruling. In most cases Inland Revenue will assess taxpayers in line with the following interpretation statements. How- ever, our statutory duty is to make correct assessments, so we may not necessarily assess taxpayers on the basis of earlier advice if at the time of the assessment we consider that the earlier advice is not consistent with the law. Tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to GST registered person Summary Directors’ fees are withholding payments under the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979. A company must deduct tax from directors’ fees at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar unless one or more of the following applies: • The director is an employee and the director’s fees are incorporated into the director’s overall remuneration package. • The director is a shareholder-employee of a close company for the purposes of section OB 2 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. • An exemption applies (e.g., the payment is for services rendered by a company or the recipient holds a valid certificate of exemption). • The fees are paid to a company or the partners of a partnership for directorship services performed by an employee or partner, and are business income of the company or partners. • The director holds a valid special tax code certificate which varies the rate at which the tax deductions must be made. The fact that a director is registered for GST does not free the company from a liability to make tax deductions from directors’ fees paid to him or her. In this item, legislative references are to the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985 (the GST Act), or the Income Tax (Withholding Payments) Regulations 1979 (the Regulations) unless otherwise stated. Background There has been some confusion as to whether companies must deduct tax under the Regulations, from directors’ fees paid to directors who are registered for GST. Some commentators have incorrectly suggested that when a director is GST registered the company is not required to make tax deductions. Legislation Cross-reference table Income Tax Act 1994Income Tax Act 1976 NC 2338 Part NCPart XI Regulation 4 of the Regulations states: (1) Subject to the provisions of these regulations, all pay- ments of the classes specified in the Schedule to these regulations are hereby declared to be withholding pay- ments for the purposes of Part \[NC\] of the Act. (2) Notwithstanding anything in subclause (1) of this regula- tion, the following payments shall not be withholding payments for the purposes of Part \[NC\] of the Act, namely: (a) Any payment that is salary or wages or an extra emolument: (b) Any payment made in respect of or in relation to work done or services rendered by any public authority, local authority, Maori authority, or company, not being a company which is a non-resident entertainer or a non-resident contractor: (c) Any payment exempted by an exemption certificate under regulation 5 of these regulations which bears the signature of the person to whom it is addressed and is produced to the person making the payment at the time when he makes the payment. Regulation 5 of the Regulations states: (1) The Commissioner may in his discretion issue to any person an exemption certificate addressed to that person specifying any payments to be made to that person during the period specified in the certificate in respect of which no tax deductions shall be made, being payments which, but for the certificate, would be withholding payments: Provided that this subclause shall not apply with respect to any payment to any non-resident entertainer. ... Regulation 6 of the Regulations states: (1) Subject to the provisions of these regulations, every tax deduction from a withholding payment shall be of the continued on page 2 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) In the course of carrying on her taxable activity, the accountant is appointed as a director of a client company. She charges GST for services performed as a director, and issues a GST tax invoice to the company for those services. Unless the accountant holds a certificate of exemp- tion for her activities as a director, the company must deduct withholding tax from the directors’ fees at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar. As the accountant has issued a GST tax invoice to the company for her services, the company should deduct withholding tax from the GST exclusive amount of the fees. When tax deductions do not need to be made The payer of directors’ fees does not have to make tax deductions under the Regulations if any of the following exemptions set out in regulation 4(2) apply to the director: • The payment is salary or wages, i.e., the director is employed by the payer. If this is the case, the direc- tors’ fees are monetary remuneration and the payer must deduct tax at the director/employee’s standard PAYE deduction rate. Directors’ fees paid to a director who is also an employee are regarded as salary or wages if they are paid “in respect of or in relation to” the director/ employee’s employment. Whether the fees are paid in respect of or in relation to the director/employee’s employment depends on the terms of that employment and whether it includes the duties of directorship. If the director/employee is engaged and remunerated separately for his or her services as a director (e.g., if there is a separate contract in relation to the director- ship and the director/employee receives the fees in the same way as the other (non-employee) directors) the directors’ fees are withholding payments. • The payment is for services rendered by a public authority, local authority, Maori authority, or com- pany. Payments to companies are discussed further below. • The director has an exemption certificate. Regulation 5 states that the Commissioner may issue a certificate of exemption at his discretion. In exercising his discretion, the Commissioner generally only issues a certificate of exemption to a business taxpayer who has a proven record of good accountability to Inland Revenue for returns and payments, e.g., if the appli- cant has a good record as a provisional taxpayer. The certificate will specify that no tax deductions are to be made from payments for the activity stated on the certificate, and will state the period for which the certificate is valid. The payer of directors’ fees does not have to make tax deductions under the Regulations if the director is a shareholder-employee in a close company for the amount calculated according to the amount of the payment at the appropriate rate specified in the Schedule to these regulations or, as the case may be, the amount or at the rate specified in a special tax rate certificate issued pursuant to regulation 6A of these regulations. (2) Subject to the provisions of these regulations, every tax deduction from a withholding payment shall be calculated according to the gross amount of the payment ... Provided that where the gross amount of the payment includes any amount of goods and services tax and the payer holds a tax invoice issued by the payee pursuant to section 24 of the Goods and Services Tax Act 1985, that amount of goods and services tax shall not be included as part of the gross amount of that payment. ... Part A of the Schedule to the Regulations includes, as withholding payments, company directors’ fees. It states that the rate of tax deductions from directors’ fees is 33 cents in the dollar. Section 6(1) of the GST Act defines the term “taxable activity”. Section 6(3) excludes from that term: (b) Any engagement, occupation, or employment under any contract of service or as a director of a company: Provided that where any person, in carrying on any taxable activity, accepts any office, any services supplied by that person as the holder of that office shall be deemed to be supplied in the course or furtherance of that taxable activity ... How the legislation applies Tax deductions from directors’ fees The effect of regulation 4 and Part A of the Schedule to the Regulations is that directors’ fees are withholding payments and are therefore source deduction payments. Section NC 2 of the Income Tax Act 1994 requires the payer to make tax deductions from source deduction payments. Tax must be deducted from directors’ fees at the rate of 33 cents in the dollar, unless an exemption applies or the director holds a valid special tax code certificate. The payer must make tax deductions from directors’ fees whether or not the director is GST registered. There is nothing in the Income Tax Act, the Regulations, or the GST Act which states that tax deductions do not need to be made when the director is GST registered. The proviso to regulation 6(2) of the Regulations states that if the payer holds a tax invoice issued by the director (or by the payer under a self-billing arrange- ment) under section 24 of the GST Act, the payer must make tax deductions from the GST exclusive amount of the fees. If the payer does not hold such a tax invoice, the payer must deduct tax from the gross amount of the fees inclusive of any amount of GST charged by the director. Example A GST registered accountant carries on a taxable activity of providing accountancy services as a sole practitioner. from page 1 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) purposes of section OB 2 (2) of the Income Tax Act 1994. If this is the case, section OB 2 (2) deems the directors’ fees not to be source deduction payments, so the payer does not have to deduct tax from the pay- ments. A director may apply to the Commissioner for a special tax code certificate. Under regulation 6A, the Commis- sioner has the discretion to issue such a certificate specifying that tax is to be deducted at the rate set out in the certificate. This rate may be lower than the standard tax deduction rate for directors’ fees. Directors’ fees paid to a company or partnership Under section 151 of the Companies Act 1993 a com- pany cannot be a director. In some cases an employee of a company (“the employer company”) may be elected to the board of directors of another company as the agent or representative of the employer company. An example of when this could occur is when the employer company provides financial or other specialist advice to the other company or when the employer company is a major corporate shareholder of the other company. Regulation 4(2) of the Regulations states that payments for work done or services rendered by a company are not withholding payments. In this case the employee who is the director is acting on the employer company’s behalf, as its agent or representative, when he or she acts as director. As the employee is acting on behalf of the employer company, the directors’ fees are for services rendered by the employer company and are not with- holding payments. A member of a partnership who is elected to the board of directors of a company may be required, under the partnership agreement, to have his or her directors’ fees paid into the partnership account. If a company pays directors’ fees to a partnership account under the terms of a partnership agreement, in return for a partner performing directorship services, the fees are business income of the partners and the Commissioner will not require the paying company to make tax deductions from the payment of directors’ fees. Section NC 13 of the Act gives the Commissioner authority to reduce the amount which is required to be deducted from a source deduction payment in this way. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) Legislation and determinations This section of the TIB covers items such as recent tax legislation, accrual and depreciation determinations, livestock values and changes in FBT and GST interest rates. Agreements for sale and purchase of property denominated in foreign currency: discounted value of amounts payable Determination G21A This Determination may be cited as “Determination G21A: Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Discounted Value of Amounts Payable”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of this determination) What financial arrangements does this determination apply to? (1) This determination applies to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property (or ‘ASAP’) which is subject to the accrual rules, if the price for the property is denominated in a foreign currency (a ‘foreign cur- rency ASAP’), and certain other conditions are met. It does not apply to a short term ASAP or a private or domestic ASAP (as those terms are defined in the Act), because these agreements are excepted financial ar- rangements. General principles of taxation of foreign currency ASAPs (2) For all ASAPs (whether or not denominated in a foreign currency) which are subject to the accrual rules, you must calculate a core acquisition price. This is the total of (a) (i)the lowest price that you and the other party would have agreed upon for the property at the time the ASAP was entered into, on the basis of payment in full at the time the first right in the specified property is to be transferred; or (ii) if there is no such lowest price, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property as determined under a determination; or (iii) if there is no such lowest price, and no applica- ble determination, the value of the property provided by the seller; and (b) any other amounts paid by the seller to the buyer (for purposes of explanation, these can safely be ig- nored). (3) This determination prescribes the method for determining the discounted value, in the foreign cur- rency, of the amounts payable for the property, as set out in paragraph (2)(a)(ii). (4) For these purposes any amount determined in a currency other than NZ$ is required to be discounted using an interest rate appropriate to the currency. This determination requires the use of a foreign currency interest rate ascertained as at the rights date using a method consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields - this interest rate is the interbank offer rate for the currency and the term of the foreign currency ASAP. (5) The amounts payable are then discounted to the rights date, using the interest rate so ascertained and present value calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods or an alternative method producing not materially different results. (6) Once this amount has been determined, you must convert it into NZ$, using one of the following rates: • forward rate to rights date (Rate A); • forward rate to settlement date (Rate B); • spot rate at rights date (Rate C); • spot rate at contract date (Rate D); or • spot rate at settlement date (Rate E); as set out in paragraph (5) of Method. Use of these rates is subject to certain restrictions, set out in paragraphs 3(2),(3),(4) and (5) below. (7) Having calculated the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price, you must calculate your income or expenditure from the foreign currency ASAP using the corresponding method in Determination G29. (8) The NZ$ value of the foreign currency lowest price is also the price at which the property is deemed to have been sold or acquired by you for income tax purposes (under section EH 8 (2)). How does this determination differ from G21? (9) This determination differs from Determination G21 by: (a) removing the option to discount future amounts payable under a foreign currency ASAP using a NZ$ interest rate; (b) removing the requirement to convert the discounted value of amounts payable using the spot rate on the rights date. 2. Reference (1) This determination is made pursuant to section 90 (1)(h) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) (2) This determination rescinds and replaces Determi- nation G21:Discounted Value of Amounts Payable in Relation to Deferred Property Settlements Denominated in a Foreign Currency, with effect from the 1996/97 income year. 3. Scope of determination (1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5), this determination applies to the calculation of income or expenditure under any foreign currency ASAP: (a) if there is no lowest price; and (b) with respect to which you become a party in your 1996-97 income year or a subsequent income year. (2) This determination does not apply: (a) To any deferred property settlement where more than 20% of the sum of all the amounts payable is due before 31 days prior to the rights date; or (b) Where in relation to any deferred property settle- ment any amount payable, or the date on which any amount is payable, is not known at the first balance date of the person after the transfer date; or (c) Where the term of the deferred property settlement is not known at the first balance date after the transfer date. (3) You may use Rate B only if the period between the rights date and the settlement date (date of final pay- ment) of the foreign currency ASAP is not more than five years. (4) You may use Rates C and D only if the property that is the subject of the foreign currency ASAP is trading stock in relation to you, other than land or shares. (5) You may use Rate E only if the aggregate of your gross income (as defined in the Act) and that of all associated persons, in the income year you became a party to the foreign currency ASAP, does not exceed $2,500,000. For this purpose, gross income should be adjusted by excluding any income from foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to section EH 1 in the income year. 4. Principle (1) Under the qualified accrual rules a foreign currency ASAP gives rise to income or expenditure equal to the difference between the NZ$ value of the acquisition price of the ASAP and the NZ$ value of the price. (2) The acquisition price is equal to the core acquisition price less (in the case of the holder) or plus (in the case of the issuer) any non-contingent fees paid by that party that qualify as item z in the definition of core acquisi- tion price in the Act. (3) The core acquisition price is defined in section OB 1. In the case of an ASAP, the definition provides that in certain circumstances, the core acquisition price should be the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property, determined under a determination made by the Commissioner. (4) This determination provides for the determination of the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property under a foreign currency ASAP. The dis- counted value must be calculated. (a) in the base currency as if it were New Zealand $; (b) using an interest rate appropriate for the currency, the rate being a rate ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13A, Prices or Yields, that is the foreign interbank offer rate appropriate to the term of the foreign currency ASAP; (c) by then converting that amount to NZ$ using an appropriate rate as set out in paragraph (5) of Method. (5) You will have to spread any income or expenditure arising from the ASAP using the method in Determina- tion G29 which is applicable to the rate you have used. 5. Interpretation In this determination: (1) a reference to the ‘Act’ is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994; (2) ‘Acceptable present value calculation method’ means calculation Method A in Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, or an alternative method producing not materially differ- ent results: ‘ASAP’ means an agreement for sale and purchase of property which is subject to the accrual rules; ‘Foreign currency ASAP’ means an ASAP under which the price for the property the subject of the ASAP is denominated in a foreign currency; ‘Forward rate’ means the rate for a forward contract as defined in paragraph 6(4) of Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; ‘Interbank offer rate’ in relation to a term means the rate at which a bank makes funds available to another bank which is a highly reliable credit risk and a trader in the market for such funds and for such a term; and includes, according to the circum- stance, the rates collectively referred to as “LIBOR” and “SIBOR”; ‘Lowest price’ is the lowest price referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of ‘core acquisition price’; ‘Price’ means the Foreign Currency price agreed to be paid in consideration for the property under an ASAP, including any agreed interest charges; ‘Rights date’ is the day on which the first Right in the specified property subject to an ASAP is to be transferred; ‘Specified property’ means property that is acquired or sold pursuant to a deferred property settlement: ‘Spot rate’ means the exchange rate for a spot contract as defined in Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) (3) all other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. As an aid to interpretation only, and not as a definitive list, the following are the terms defined in the Act that are of particular note: right in the specified property, agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 6. Method (1) For the purposes of paragraph (ii) of the definition of “w” in the definition of the core acquisition price in section OB 1, you must calculate the discounted value of the foreign currency amounts payable for the property subject to a foreign currency ASAP to which this determination applies by summing - (a) Every amount payable to or, as the case may be, by you for the property on or before the rights date expressed in the foreign currency; and (b) The amount of foreign currency equal in value to the present value as at the rights date of amounts payable to or, as the case may be, by the person for the property after the rights date. (2) For the purposes of this determination, the present value as at rights date of amounts payable shall be calculated by applying an acceptable present value calculation method to the interest rate determined under subclause (3). (3) The annual rate of interest at which the present value of the amounts payable is required to be calculated shall be: the interbank offer rate for the currency and the term of the foreign currency ASAP at rights date, being a market yield determined in a manner consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. For this purpose the spot rate and the forward rate are to be determined in accordance with Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates. (4) The present value of the amounts payable together with any deposit or other amounts paid on or before the rights date is the amount “w” to be used to calculate the core acquisition price. (5) This amount is then converted to NZ$ using one of the following rates as appropriate; (a) the rate, on the contract date, available to the taxpayer from a New Zealand registered bank for the exchange of NZ$ for that foreign currency on the rights date (Rate A); or (b) the rate, on the contract date, available to the taxpayer from a New Zealand registered bank for the exchange of NZ$ for that foreign currency on the settlement date (Rate B); or (c) Spot rate on the rights date (Rate C) (d) Spot rate on the contract date (Rate D) (e) Spot rate on payment (Rate E). (6) The core acquisition price shall be used to deter- mine the acquisition price of a foreign currency ASAP in accordance with section OB 1. (7) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by apply- ing the Method in Determination G29 which corre- sponds with the rate you use to determine the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price. 7. Example (1) A commercial property is sold for US$1,400,000 under a sale and purchase agreement subject to certain repairs being made to the building. An initial deposit of $140,000 is made on 1 February 1989. On 1 March 1989 repairs on the building are complete and the sale becomes unconditional. The balance of US$1,260,000 is due six months after the date possession passes. Posses- sion of the property passes on 15 March 1989. There- fore the term of the arrangement is 15 March 1989 to 15 September 1989 - 184 days. The purchaser’s balance date is 31 March. The USD/NZD exchange rates for the various dates are - 1 February 19890.5600 15 March 19890.5800 31 March 19890.5750 15 September 19890.5700 In this case the purchaser is the “issuer” for the purposes of the accruals legislation. (2) The US interbank offer rate on 15 March 1989 for a period of six months is 8.0 percent ascertained using a method consistent with Determination G13A: Prices or Yields. (3) Method A of Determination G10B: Present Value Calculation Methods, is applied to calculate the present value as at 15 March 1989 (the “specified date”) as follows - R = 8.0 percent (the specified rate) N = 2 (since the payments are at half yearly intervals) F= R 100 x N = 0.04 (a) At 15 March 1989: A= 0 B = $1,260,000 C= 0 Therefore present value at 15 March 1989 = A + B - C 1 + F = US$1,211,538 (b) To this total must be added US$140,000 deposit, giving a total present value of US$1,351,538, which is the item “w” used in calculating the core acquisi- tion price. Determination signed the 16th day of September 1996 Robin Oliver General Manager Policy Advice Division from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) continued on page 8 Agreements for sale and purchase of property denominated in foreign currency: exchange rate to determine the acquisition price and method for spreading income and expenditure Determination G29 This Determination may be cited as “Determin- ation G29 : Agreements for Sale and Purchase of Property Denominated in Foreign Currency: Exchange Rate to Determine the Acquisition Price and method for spreading income and expenditure”. 1. Explanation (which does not form part of this determination) What financial arrangements does this determination apply to? (1) This determination applies to any agreement for the sale and purchase of property (or ‘ASAP’) which is subject to the accrual rules, if the price for the property is denominated in a foreign currency (a ‘foreign cur- rency ASAP’), and certain other conditions are met. It does not apply to a short term ASAP or a private or domestic ASAP (as those terms are defined in the Act), because these agreements are excepted financial ar- rangements. General Principles of taxation of foreign currency ASAPs (2) For all ASAPs (whether or not denominated in a foreign currency) which are subject to the accrual rules, you must calculate a core acquisition price. This is the total of: (a) the lowest price that you and the other party would have agreed upon for the property at the time the ASAP was entered into, on the basis of payment in full at the time the first right in the specified prop- erty is to be transferred; or if there is no such lowest price, the discounted value of the amounts payable for the property, calculated in accordance with Determination G21A; and (b) any other amounts paid by the seller to the buyer (for purposes of explanation, these can safely be ig- nored). (3) The difference, if any, between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price (plus or minus certain non- contingent fees) and the NZ$ value of the amount paid by the buyer to the seller (the price) is income or expenditure, under the accrual rules. This difference may arise for a number of reasons: (a) In the case of an ASAP where the price is fixed in NZ$, the reason for this difference will generally be the time value of money. If the buyer pays in ad- vance for the goods, the buyer will often require a discount from the cash price. If the buyer pays on a deferred basis, the seller will often require an additional amount as compensation for the deferral. This can be equivalent to: •a loan from the buyer to the seller in the case of a pre-payment, with the discount to the purchase price representing interest payable by the seller; or •a loan from the seller to the buyer in the case of a deferred settlement, with the additional amount required by the seller representing interest payable by the buyer. (b) In the case of a foreign currency ASAP, there can be another reason for the difference between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price and the NZ$ value of the price paid by the buyer to the seller. That is that different exchange rates could be used to convert these amounts into NZ$. The price must be converted into NZ$ using the spot exchange rate on payment date, while the core acquisition price is converted into NZ$ using the forward exchange rate from the contract date to either the date of payment or the date of transfer of the property. If the ex- change rates are different, then there will be a difference between the NZ$ value of the core acquisition price and the NZ$ value of the price, even if the amounts are identical when determined in the foreign currency. (4) Regardless of why it arises, this difference will be recognised: • under section EH 1 (5) of the Act, if you are a party to the ASAP at the end of an income year, by way of an allocation of income or expenditure to that income year; • under the base price adjustment in section EH 4 of the Act, when the ASAP matures or is transferred by you. (5) Section OB 7 (1) deals with the calculation of the core acquisition price in the case of a foreign currency ASAP. It provides that the lowest price is the lowest price the parties would have agreed to in the foreign currency, converted into NZ$ using: • the forward exchange rate, on the contract date, for exchange of the foreign currency into NZ$ on the rights date (this is the date on which first rights in the property pass to the buyer, and will often be the date on which goods are delivered) under the foreign currency ASAP (Rate A); or • the forward exchange rate, on the contract date, for exchange of the foreign currency into NZ$ on the 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) final payment date under the foreign currency ASAP (Rate B); or • such other rate as is approved by the Commissioner by determination. What this determination does (6) This determination approves the adoption of three alternative exchange rates for converting the foreign currency lowest price into NZ$. This is in accordance with paragraph (c) of section OB 7 (1) (which clarifies the calculation of the ‘core acquisition price’ in the case of a foreign currency ASAP) and section 90 (1)(k) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. This determination also prescribes the method you must use to calculate income or expenditure from a foreign currency ASAP under section EH 1 (5). The method you must use depends on the exchange rate you have used. The rates approved by this determination are: •Spot rate on the rights date (Rate C). The effect of using this rate is that currency fluctuations between the rights date and the payment date will give rise to income or expenditure under the accrual rules. This rate can only be used for ASAPs which are for trading stock (excluding land or shares). If you use this rate you must apply Method C to calculate income or expenditure from the ASAP under section EH 1 (5). •Spot rate on the contract date (Rate D). The effect of using this rate is that currency fluctuations between the contract date (the date on which you enter into the ASAP) and the payment date will give rise to income or expenditure under the accrual rules. This rate can only be used for ASAPs which are for trading stock (excluding land or shares). If you use this rate you must apply Method D to calculate income or expendi- ture from the ASAP under section EH 1 (5). •Spot rate on payment date (Rate E). The effect of using this rate is to ensure that foreign currency fluctuations do not give rise to accrual income or expenditure under the foreign currency ASAP. You can only use Rate E if your annual gross income is less than $2,500,000 in the income year you become a party to the ASAP. In calculating that amount, you should exclude income from foreign currency ASAPs not completed at balance date. As an anti-avoidance measure, in calculating the $2,500,000 you must also take into account the annual gross income of associ- ated persons. If you use this rate you must apply Method E to calculate income or expenditure from the ASAP under section EH 1 (5). (7) The NZ$ value of the foreign currency lowest price is also the price at which the property is deemed to have been sold or acquired by you for income tax purposes (under section EH 8 (2)). If you use Rate E and Method E, you may have to convert the relevant pay- ments into NZ$ using the spot rate at the first balance date following acquisition of the property. This ensures that the price can be established in the year the property is transferred to you. 2. Reference This determination is made under paragraphs (c) and (k) of section 90 (1) of the Tax Administration Act 1994. 3. Scope General (1) Subject to (3), (4) and (5) below, this determination applies to the calculation of income or expenditure under any foreign currency ASAP with respect to which you either: • become a party in your 1996-97 income year or a subsequent income year; or • calculate the core acquisition price using section OB 7 (1)(a),(b) or (c), under section EZ 10 (2). (2) Method A is available to all taxpayers for all foreign currency ASAPs if they use Rate A. (3) Method B is available to all taxpayers who use Rate B, which may only be used if the period between the rights date and the settlement date (date of final pay- ment) is not more than five years. (4) Rates C and D, and Methods C and D You may use rates C or D, and Methods C or D only if the property that is the subject of the ASAP is trading stock in relation to you, other than land or shares. (5) Rate E and Method E You may apply Rate E and Method E only if the aggregate of your gross income (as defined in the Act) and that of all associated persons, in the income year you became a party to the foreign currency ASAP, does not exceed $2,500,000. For this purpose, gross income should be adjusted by excluding any income from foreign currency ASAPs which are subject to section EH 1 in the income year. (6) Where both this determination and Determination G9A could apply to an ASAP, you should apply this determination, and not Determination G9A to the ASAP. You may however apply G9A to a loan which is part of the ASAP (see paragraph 6(4)). 4. Principle (1) Under the qualified accrual rules a foreign currency ASAP gives rise to income or expenditure equal to the difference between the NZ$ value of the acquisition price of the ASAP and the NZ$ value of the price. (2) The acquisition price is equal to the core acquisition price, less (in the case of the holder) or plus (in the case of the issuer) any non-contingent fees paid by that party that qualify as item z in the definition of acquisition price in section OB 1. (3) The core acquisition price is defined in section OB 1. The main component of the core acquisition price is, broadly, the lowest price the parties would have from page 7 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) agreed upon, assuming payment in full at the time of delivery. You should refer to the detailed definition of core acquisition price contained in the Act. (4) In the case of a foreign currency ASAP, the lowest price is denominated in a foreign currency, and must be converted into NZ$. Section OB 7 allows the use of two forward rates, Rates A and B (contained in paragraphs (a) and (b) of section OB 7 (1) and described in para- graph 1(5) of this determination), but not all taxpayers will wish to use forward rates. This determination approves the use of the spot rate on certain alternative dates. (5) If you are a party to an ASAP you will have to determine the lowest price, using either one of the statutory rates, or one of the rates prescribed by this determination. You will then have to spread any income or expenditure arising from the ASAP using the method described in this determination which is applicable to the rate you are using. 5. Interpretation In this determination: (1) a reference to the “Act” is a reference to the Income Tax Act 1994. (2) ‘ASAP’ means an agreement for sale and purchase of property which is subject to the accrual rules; ‘Contract date’ means the date on which the foreign currency ASAP was entered into; ‘Foreign currency ASAP’ means an ASAP under which the price for the property the subject of the ASAP is denominated in foreign currency; ‘Forward rate’ means the rate for a forward contract as defined in paragraph 6(4) of Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates; ‘Lowest price’ is the lowest price referred to in paragraph (c) of the definition of “core acquisition price”; ‘Payment date’ means a date on which any part of the price for the property transferred under an ASAP is paid by the buyer; ‘Price’ means the foreign currency price agreed to be paid in consideration for the property under an ASAP, including any agreed interest charges; ‘Rights date’ is the day on which the first right in the specified property subject to an ASAP is to be transferred; ‘Settlement date’ means the day on which final payment is to be made under the financial arrange- ment; ‘Spot rate’ means the rate for a spot contract as defined in paragraph 6(3) Determination G6D: Foreign Currency Rates. (3) all other terms used have the same meaning given to them for the purposes of the qualified accruals rules in the Act. As an aid to interpretation only, and not as a definitive list, the following are the terms defined in the Act that are of particular note: right in the specified property, trading stock, associated persons, agreement for the sale and purchase of property. 6. Rate and method - general (1) All the methods approved by this determination require you to treat yourself as a party to a foreign currency loan or loans. The nature of the foreign currency loan or loans is set out in paragraphs (2) to (4). (2) To the extent that the price is paid before the rights date, treat yourself as a party to a loan: • from the buyer to the seller: • of an amount equal to the amount of the price paid before the rights date; • advanced on the date the amounts are paid; • repaid on the rights date; • with a repayment amount equal to the amount of the lowest price, less any amount paid on the rights date, and less the amount attributable to the advance under any loan referred to in (3). (3) To the extent that the price is paid after the rights date, treat yourself as a party to a loan: • from the seller to the buyer; • of an amount equal to the lowest price, less any amount paid on the rights date, and less any amount attributable to the repayment of any loan referred to in (2); • advanced on the rights date; • repaid on the payment date or payment dates occur- ring after the rights date; • with a repayment amount equal to the price, less any amount paid on or before the rights date. (4) In many cases you may be able to apply Determina- tion G9A to the loan. 7. Method A - forward rate to rights date (1) If you adopt method A you must use Rate A to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. (2) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by apply- ing an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in ‘Method - General’. Also take into account, as income or expenditure in any year up to and including the year in which the rights date occurs, the amount continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using either (i) if the rights date is after the end of the year, the forward rate from the last day of the relevant income year to the rights date; (ii) in any other case, the spot rate on rights date. ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the forward rate to the rights date from whichever is the later of: (i) the last day of the previous income year; (ii) the contract date. using a reasonable estimate of the rights date at that time (unless a(ii) applies). (3) If a - b is a negative, this amount will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a - b is a positive, the amount will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 8. Method B - forward rate to settle- ment date (1) If you adopt method B, you must use Rate B to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. (2) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by apply- ing an available method under the qualified accruals rules to calculate the foreign currency income or expenditure you would have if you were party to a foreign currency loan or loans as set out above in ‘Method - General’. (3) In calculating this income or expenditure, treat the foreign currency loan or loans as if they were in NZ$. In particular, do not apply Determination G9A to the loan contract. Then convert the foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the spot rate on the pay- ment date. If there is more than one payment date, use the weighted average of the spot rates, For payment dates occurring after the last day of the year, use the spot rate on that day. (4) Also take into account as income or expenditure in any year up to and including the year in which the settlement date occurs, the amount a - b where ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using either (i) if the settlement date is after the end of the year, the forward rate from the last day of the relevant income year to the settlement date; (ii) in any other case, the spot rate on settlement date. ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the forward rate to the settlement date from which- ever is the later of: (i) the last day of the previous income year; (ii) the contract date. using a reasonable estimate of the settlement date at that time (unless a(ii) applies). (5) If a - b is a negative, this amount will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a - b is a positive, the amount will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 9. Rate C and method C - spot rate at rights date (1) If you adopt Method C, you must use rate C to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. (2) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by apply- ing an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in ‘Method - General’. (3) Because you are using the spot rate at rights date to convert the foreign currency core acquisition price to NZ$, you will not have any income or expenditure for tax purposes in the period between the contract date and the earlier of the rights date or the first payment date. 10. Rate D and method D - spot rate at contract date (1) If you adopt Method D, you must use Rate D to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price. (2) If you adopt Method D, then even if there is no difference between the foreign currency price and the foreign currency lowest price, you will have income/ expenditure if there is a change in the spot rate from the contract date to the payment date. (3) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the Foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure by apply- ing an available method under the qualified accruals rules as if you were party to a loan or loans as set out above in ‘Method - General’. (4) Because you are using the spot rate at contract date to convert the foreign currency core acquisition price to NZ$, you must take into account as income or expendi- ture, in any year up to and including the year in which the rights date occurs, the amount a - b where: ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the spot rate on the earlier of the last day of the relevant income year and the rights date from page 9 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price converted using the spot rate on whichever is the later of the last day of the previous income year and the contract date. (5) If a - b is negative, this will be income if you are the buyer, and expenditure if you are the seller. If a - b is positive, this will be income if you are the seller, and expenditure if you are the buyer. 11. Rate E and method E- spot rate at payment date (1) If you adopt Method E, you must use Rate E to calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price, subject to (2)(ii) below. If there is more than one payment date, you must use the weighted average of the spot rates on the payment dates. (2) If you need to know the NZ$ price of the property for the purpose of calculating your assessable income for an income year (other than under the qualified accrual rules), and any payments under the foreign currency ASAP are made after the end of the relevant year, you must determine the NZ$ value of the lowest price by converting those payments into NZ$ at either: (i) the spot rate on the payment date if the agreement is completed before you are required to file your income tax return for the relevant year, and you elect to use that rate; or (ii) the spot rate on the last day of the relevant year. (3) If you choose to use Method E, and if there is no difference between the foreign currency price and the foreign currency lowest price (plus any amount com- prised in item x in the core acquisition price definition), you will have no income or expenditure under the qualified accruals rules from the foreign currency ASAP (unless paragraph 2(ii) applies). (4) In a year before the year in which you are required to do a base price adjustment for the foreign currency ASAP, calculate your income or expenditure from the ASAP as the result of a - b - c where: ‘a’ is the NZ$ value of the price. Determine this NZ$ value by converting the price into NZ$ using the spot rate on the payment date or payment dates. Convert any payments required to be made after the end of the year: at the spot rate on the last day of the year; or if the agreement matures before the date on which you must file your tax return for the year, at the spot rate on the relevant payment date, if you elect to use that rate; ‘b’ is the NZ$ value of the lowest price. Determine this NZ$ value by converting the lowest price into NZ$ using the spot rate used to calculate ‘a’, or the weighted average of the spot rates if there is more than one payment date. However, if you have taken the cost of the property into account in calculating your assessable income (other than under the qualified accrual rules) in a previous income year, you must calculate the NZ$ value of the lowest price using the same exchange rate used to calculate the lowest price in that previous income year. ‘c’ is the NZ$ value of the unaccrued difference between the price and lowest price, calculated in accordance with paragraph (6). (5) If the result of the calculation in paragraph (4) is positive, that amount will be income if you are the seller of the property and expenditure if you are the buyer. If the result is negative, the amount will be income if you are the buyer of the property and expenditure if you are the seller. (6) ‘c’ in paragraph (4) is calculated as follows: Apply an available method under the accrual rules to calculate the foreign currency income or expenditure you would have if you were a party to a foreign currency loan or loans as set out above in “Rate and Method - General”. In calculating this expenditure, treat the foreign currency loan or loans as if they were in NZ$. In particular, do not apply Determina- tion G9A to the loan contract; Convert this foreign currency income or expenditure into NZ$ using the exchange rate used to calculate ‘a’ in paragraph (4). 12. Example (1) A US resident agrees to sell a quantity of plate glass to a New Zealand resident glass wholesaler for US$140,000. The parties agree that the price will be paid six months after the glass is landed in Auckland, and will remain the seller’s risk until it is landed. The parties also agree that if the price were paid at the time the glass is landed, the price would be US$130,000. (2) The New Zealand resident wholesaler must calcu- late the ‘lowest price’ by converting the US$130,000 to NZ$ using one of the rates set out in section OB 7 (1) of the Act, or in this determination. The difference be- tween that amount in NZ$, and US$140,000 at the spot rate on payment date, will be income or expenditure to the New Zealand resident. It must then apply the appropriate method to spread that income or expendi- ture over the life of the ASAP. Determination signed the 16th day of September 1996. Robin Oliver General Manager Policy Advice Division The appendix to this TIB contains examples of how this determination applies. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) FBT prescribed interest rate increased to 11.5% The prescribed rate of interest used to calculate the fringe benefit value of low-interest employment- related loans has been increased to 11.5% for the quarter starting on 1 October 1996. This rate will continue to apply to subsequent quarters until any further adjustment is made. This prescribed rate, up from 10.6% for the quarter starting on 1 July 1996, is a reflection of the recent rise in market rates.

We have published these as they may be of general interest to readers. These items are based on letters we’ve received. A general similarity to items in this package will not necessarily lead to the same tax result. Each case will depend on its own facts. Income Tax Act 1994 Non-resident withholding tax on interest and swap payments Section NG 2 (section 311, Income Tax Act 1976) - Non-resident withholding income and swap payments: Taxpayers have asked us whether payments made to non-residents under swaps are non-resident withholding income subject to non-resident withholding tax (NRWT) or approved issuer levy. This issue turns on whether the swap payments are “interest” and the swaps themselves are “money lent” under section OB 1 (section 2, Income Tax Act 1976). For conventional swaps, such as Interest Rate Swaps, Interest Swaps, Currency Swaps, Interest Rate and Currency Swaps, or Interest and Currency Swaps as defined in accruals rules Determination G27: Swaps, NRWT or approved issuer levy will not be payable. The Commissioner accepts that conventional swaps do not involve money advanced, deposited, or let out; or credit given or any other form of “money lent”. Swap payments on such swaps are accordingly not “inter- est” for NRWT or approved issuer levy purposes. This applies even when swaps involve actual, as opposed to notional, exchanges of principal. However, swaps are flexible financial instruments. One or a combination of swaps can be used to create what is effectively a loan from a non-resident to a resident. For example, a non-resident may make what is effectively a floating rate loan to a resident by entering into a fixed to floating interest rate swap that provides for the non-resident to make fixed rate swap payments and the resident to make floating rate swap payments. The parties may have intended from the outset, and arrange, for the swap to be converted into a synthetic loan by the non- resident pre-paying its fixed rate obligations before the first payment is made. The Commissioner generally expects NRWT or approved issuer levy to be paid for such a synthetic loan. Depending on the particular circumstances, the Com- missioner may consider applying the general anti-avoidance provision in section BB 9 (section 99, Income Tax Act 1976) when NRWT is not paid. Certain submissions to the Commissioner have argued that the wording of the current section NG 3 (section 317, Income Tax Act 1976) prevents the Commis- sioner from applying section BB 9 to impose NRWT. The Commissioner disa- grees with that view. The legislative ambiguity that gave rise to this argument has been removed by the Taxation (Core Provisions) Act 1996. The issues will be discussed in a forthcoming Tax Information Bulletin on the Act. Similar considerations apply with respect to swaps transacted between residents and the resident withholding tax regime. 14 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) Legal decisions - case notes This section of the TIB sets out brief notes of recent tax decisions made by the Taxation Review Authority, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council. We've given full references to each case, including the citation details where it has already been reported. Details of the relevant Act and section will help you to quickly identify the legislation at issue. Short case summaries and keywords deliver the bare essentials for busy readers. The notes also outline the principal facts and grounds for the decision. Where possible, we have indicated if an appeal will be forthcoming. These case reviews do not set out Inland Revenue policy, nor do they represent our attitude to the decision. These are purely brief factual reviews of decisions for the general interest of our readers. Losses carried forward not deductible when calculating Family Support Case:TRA 96/17, 96/20 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - sections 188 and 374B, D, E Keywords:Assessable income, losses Summary:The objector was not able to deduct losses carried forward from previous years when determining her assessable income, nor could she deduct them when calculating her entitlement to Family Support and guaranteed minimum family income. In any case, the objector was not entitled to Family Support and guaran- teed minimum family income beyond 1992 as her child had turned 18 years old. Facts:The objector had rental losses from previous years. The Commissioner excluded these losses from the objector’s assessable income when calculating her family support and guaranteed minimum family income entitlement. Decision:The TRA applied the decision of Case S10, in which it was held that “assessable income cannot include losses carried forward because assessable income and losses are mutually exclusive ... as is recognised by section 188.” The TRA held that the application of section 188, which allows losses to be offset against future profits, is limited to cases in which relief is sought from income tax liability; it is irrelevant for the purpose of determining assessable income, and in calculating a taxpayer’s entitlement to Family Support and guaranteed minimum family income. The objector was not entitled to Family Support or guaranteed minimum family income beyond 1992 as her child had turned 18 years old in that year. In addi- tion, the Commissioner’s discretion under sections 374D (1) and 374E(2) of the Income Tax Act 1976 to permit entitlement beyond that date had not been exer- cised. Property sale not zero-rated as supply of a going concern Case:TRA No 96/34 Act:Goods and Services Act 1985 - section 11(1)(c) Keywords:Zero-rated supply of a going concern Summary:The TRA found that the sale of the objector’s property was not a sale of a “going concern”. The sale was not a zero-rated supply under section 11 and therefore was subject to output tax. Facts:The objector is a registered person carrying on a business as a market gardener. The objector entered into an agreement to sell a piece of property to a horticul- turist who was a registered person. The settlement date was 1 September 1994. 15 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) The objector did not return output tax on the sale of the property, but the pur- chaser claimed and was allowed an input credit. Decision:The objector submitted that it had transferred a tomato growing business to the purchaser as a “going concern”. The TRA did not accept the objector’s submission, and held there was no evi- dence to suggest an intention that the vendor agreed to sell, and the purchaser agreed to buy such a business. Moreover, the evidence indicated that there was no sale of a business. The agreement form was not a usual one used for the sale of a business. There was no reference to the sale of the business in the agree- ment, nor was there any reference to goodwill, restraint of trade, inspection of accounts, or other similar references usually included in an agreement for the sale of a business. The TRA also put some weight on the fact that the purchaser now uses the land and structures for carrying out his own business, growing pot plants and shrubs for hire. Property sale not zero-rated as supply of a going concern Case:TRA No 96/16 Keywords:Supply of a taxable activity as a “going concern” Summary:The TRA found that there was no business activity going on at a property at the time of its transfer to the objector, so there was no supply of a taxable activity in the form of a “going concern”. Facts:The objector entered into a sale and purchase agreement with the vendor in April 1993 for a piece of commercial property. The objector settled and took possession of the property in June 1993. The property had been leased by the vendor prior to the agreement for a period of 3 years with a termination date in October 1993. The tenants of the lease had been in default, and the vendors sued them for rental for the months of April 1993, May 1993, and June 1993. The tenants vacated the property in May 1993. Decision:The TRA found that there was no supply of a taxable activity in the form of a “going concern” as there was no undertaking of a business or commercial nature in existence at the time of the agreement. The business undertaking had ceased before the sale, and therefore did not pass to the objector. The transfer of assets capable of being used for some business activity is not in itself the transfer of a “going concern”. The TRA found the relevant time for determining whether a “going concern” exists is the date at which the purchaser takes over the assets as per the agree- ment between the parties. At settlement, the commercial element of the relation- ship, a sitting tenant, ready, willing, and able to pay rent for the property was absent. Time limit for amending assessments - when it runs from Case:TRA No 93/103, TRA No 95/21 Act:Income Tax Act 1976 - section 25 and section 99 Keywords:Statute bar, time limit for reassessments, tax avoidance Summary:The TRA found that the Commissioner could not re-open the objector’s assess- ment. The four year time limit under section 25 applies to the first assessment 16 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) made and the last reassessment in time to be made. The last assessment in- creased the tax payable, and as it was made out of time it was illegal and a nullity. Facts:1. Inland Revenue issued an income tax assessment in June 1990 for $311,270.40. This was amended in March 1994 to $428,246.56 and again in August 1994 to $750,246.56. After Inland Revenue received an objection from the taxpayer the assessment was further amended to $428,246.56 in June 1995. 2. The objector borrowed $10 million from Company A and paid interest in advance of $417,772. The objector then purchased shares in a subsidiary company which on-lent the share price to another subsidiary. This money was advanced to Company C (who issued a debenture) and paid interest in advance of $375,860. Company C then purchased a “bearer bond” with a face value of $10 million in the name of Company A. This bearer bond was ulti- mately transferred to Company A. The debenture was transferred to the objector’s account with Company A, and the bearer bond was used to extin- guish the objector’s loan with Company A. The interest paid by Company C was a non-taxable receipt which ultimately was paid to the objector. Therefore, the objector received a deduction of $417,772 at an actual cost of $41,912. Decision:1. The TRA held that the Commissioner was unable to reopen the assessment because section 25 only applies to the first assessment made and the last reassessment in time to be made. The last assessment increased the tax pay- able from $311,270.46 to $428,246.56, so it was made out of time, and was illegal and a nullity. Earlier assessments were cancelled by subsequent amended assessments. Although, the TRA concluded that it may follow that an unlawful assessment cannot have any legal effect including the effect of amending any earlier assessment, nevertheless, the Commissioner did not seek to rely on the assessment dated 31 August 1994. 2. The TRA held that the arrangements entered into by the objector were for the purposes of tax avoidance. The transaction was circular and lacked economic reality. The tax effect was not incidental as the profit on the transaction was the tax saved. However, given that the assessment was unlawful such conclu- sions are obiter and may not be enforced. The Commissioner is appealing this decision. 17 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.4 (September 1996) Due dates reminder October 1996 5 Large employers: PAYE deductions and deduction schedules for period ended 30 September 1996 due. 7 Provisional tax and/or Student Loan interim repay- ments: first 1997 instalment due for taxpayers with June balance dates.

1 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Previous rules The foreign investment fund (FIF) regime was originally introduced as part of a package of reforms targeted at persons with interests in foreign entities used to accumu- late income and gains outside New Zealand. Such interests could be used to defer New Zealand tax or avoid it altogether. Foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies were specifically targeted by the FIF measures as they were identified as a possible investment vehicle for deferring or avoiding New Zealand tax. Pensions and annuities received from an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy will be subject to tax under the FIF regime, unless the interest is specifically excluded from the FIF regime. Interests in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy will be excluded from the FIF regime if any of these conditions are met: • The interest is an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme (section CG 15 (2)(c)). • The aggregate cost of all of the person’s interests in foreign entities (which would otherwise constitute an interest in a FIF) is less than $20,000 (section CG 15 (2)(d)). • The person is a natural person and the interest was acquired before whichever of the following applies: – 8 pm on 2 July 1992 – the date when the person first became resident in New Zealand – the date when certain exchange controls (which apply to the person and the interest) were imposed by a country or territory other than New Zealand, if those exchange controls prevent the person from deriving either any profit or gain from the interest or disposing of the interest for New Zealand currency or consideration readily convertible into New Zealand currency. • The new resident exemption for interests in foreign life insurance policies and superannuation schemes applies (section CG 15 (2)(f)). Persons with interests that are subject to the FIF regime must disclose that interest to the Commissioner and calculate their FIF income or loss from that interest. There are two methods prescribed by the FIF regime applicable to interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies: the comparative value and deemed rate of return methods. The comparative value method measures the change in market value of the FIF interest over the income year and takes this into account for both income tax and New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge purposes. Any pension or annuity received from a FIF interest is taken into account in the formula that measures the change in value. If the deemed rate of return method applies, a certain rate of interest is deemed to be received by the beneficial owner of the entitlement on the book value of the interest in a foreign entity. This deemed interest amount is subject to income tax and surcharge. Any pension or annuity received reduces the book value, although this may be assessable if it exceeds the FIF income for that year. The following diagram illustrates the relationship between the new QFPA rules and the previous rules. It shows that an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy can be a FIF interest, and/or a QFPA interest, or neither. All interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies Interests subjectInterests in to the FIF regimea QFPA The FIF regime is fully explained in our booklet For- eign Investment Funds (IR 275B). New rules Under the new QFPA rules, any pension or annuity received from a QFPA interest is excluded from the FIF regime and taxed on a receipts basis (in the same manner as salary and wages). Essentially, a QFPA is an entitlement to benefit from a pension or annuity provided by a foreign entity, if the consideration provided in return for the pension or annuity was provided at a time when the person was not resident in New Zealand, or within a qualifying period after becoming resident. The qualifying period will be between three to four years depending on the date the person became a New Zealand resident. For surcharge purposes any pension or annuity paid from a QFPA interest will be subject to surcharge only on fifty percent of the gross amount of the pension or annuity. This surcharge treatment is also extended to certain interests that are specifically excluded from the FIF regime and also fail to meet the QFPA definition because the contributions were made while the person involved was resident in New Zealand. This is explained fully in part 4 of this TIB, which discusses the surcharge treatment. Part 1 - Previous rules and new rules for overseas pensions 2 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) The principal difference between the two treatments is that domestic pensions and annuities are exempt from income tax in New Zealand because contributions have been made from tax-paid income, and the income derived by trustees of the superannuation scheme or the life insurance fund is assessable as it is derived. On the other hand foreign pensions may not have been funded from tax-paid contributions. Moreover, the superannuation scheme or life insurance company may have been taxed concessionally, or not taxed at all, on Reason for the new rules The objective of the amendments is to give effect to paragraph 3.2.1 of the Accord on retirement income policies. They do this by aligning, as far as possible, the taxation and surcharge treatment of foreign-sourced private pensions and annuities with the treatment of their domestic-sourced equivalents. However, this is not always possible because of the way New Zealand taxes life insurance funds and superannuation schemes, so differences remain. Summary flowchart - is the interest an interest in a qualifying foreign private annuity? 3 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Part 2 - Qualifying foreign private annuity definition Section OB 1 (and 245R of the Income Tax Act 1976) has been amended to insert a definition of “qualifying foreign private annuity”, or QFPA. Analysis of the main parts of the definition The definition of a QFPA is directed at interests in foreign entities, namely interests in private foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies, that provide a pension or annuity in return for consideration provided by or on behalf of the person entitled to benefit. Therefore the definition excludes pensions and annuities received from foreign social security schemes, which are likewise excluded from the FIF regime. The definition is targeted primarily at interests that were acquired while a person was not resident in New Zea- land. For practical reasons it was decided to allow limited contributions to be made while the person was resident. For the purposes of this analysis, the definition is broken down into its component parts and discussed separately. The component parts are shown in the shaded boxes. Qualifying Foreign Private Annuity “Qualifying Foreign Private Annuity” means an entitlement of a natural person to benefit from a pension or annuity provided by a foreign entity while the person is resident in New Zealand, if - Entitlement of a natural person to benefit, in this context, describes the right a person has in relation to a foreign entity to receive a pension or annuity from the entity. This is also covered by the definition of “entitle- ment of the person to benefit” contained in section OB 1, which ensures the term includes vested, contingent and discretionary entitlements. A superannuation scheme that provides for the pension to be paid to a person’s spouse on the death of that person would be a contingent interest and come within the definition “entitlement of the person to benefit”. However, this expanded definition is targeted at the person who has a present entitlement to benefit. Inland Revenue does not interpret this provision as applying to a spouse’s contingent interest in this circumstance. Therefore if a widow or widower receives a pension from a deceased spouse’s superannuation scheme, Inland Revenue will accept that the pension is received from a QFPA if the spouse’s interest was a QFPA immediately before death. Because the legislation focuses on the entitlement of the person to benefit, it does not matter who contributes to the foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy. For example, contributions could be made by an employer, parent, guardian or spouse without disqualify- ing the interest from the QFPA rules. In the case of a life insurance policy, the person entitled to benefit may not be the insured person, but rather an employer or spouse. The principal point is that the legislation focuses on the person who is entitled to benefit. Foreign entity is defined in section OB 1 as a foreign company. The other relevant parts of the definition specifically include: • natural person issuers of life insurance policies offered and entered into outside New Zealand • foreign superannuation schemes. “Foreign superannuation scheme” and “superannua- tion scheme” are defined terms. Specifically included in continued on page 4 its earnings. Foreign pensions and annuities will therefore still be assessable for income tax when paid to a New Zealand resident. In policy terms, to give effect to the principles expressed in the Accord it was necessary to ensure that the taxation treatment of the contributions and foreign schemes’ earnings was taken into account. It was also necessary to ensure that New Zealand’s superannuation and life insurance regimes were not undermined by weakening the FIF regime. These requirements are reflected in the new rules in two key areas: • Only those foreign private pensions and annuities for which the contributions were made primarily when the beneficial owner of the pension or annuity was non-resident are excluded from the FIF regime and eligible for the fifty percent surcharge exemption 1 . This ensures that the FIF regime still applies if contributions to foreign superannuation and life insurance policies are made when the beneficial owner is primarily resident in New Zealand. • Foreign pensions are not exempt from income tax in New Zealand and, for surcharge purposes, fifty percent of the gross foreign pension or annuity is subject to the surcharge. This acknowledges the potentially concessional taxation of foreign superannuation schemes, and is also in accordance with international norms regarding the taxation of foreign pensions. 1 An exception to this applies for surcharge purposes for those interests in foreign entities that are excluded from the FIF regime under sections CG 15 (2)(d) to (f). This is discussed in part 3 of this TIB. 4 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Exceptions to the principal rule Subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) contain two exceptions to the principal rule in subparagraph (i). Subparagraph (ii) This exception allows people to continue to contribute to a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy for a limited period of time after they assume or reassume their New Zealand resident status. The exception was designed for reasons of practicality and to parallel the new resident exemption in section CG 15 (2)(f). It permits people to have some flexibility to continue to make contributions to a foreign superan- nuation scheme or life insurance policy while resident in New Zealand. For instance, without this exception those people who visit New Zealand and later decide to emigrate to New Zealand would not meet the QFPA definition in respect of their foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy interests if they continued to contribute to the scheme following the date they become resident. The operation of subparagraph (ii) is best explained by way of example. Example 1 Ms B arrives in New Zealand on 14 May 1996 for a holiday, and subsequently decides to retire here. Under section OE 1 (2) she is deemed to be resident from 14 May 1996. The income year in which she became resident is the year ending 31 March 1997. Thus Ms B has until 31 March 2000 (being the day before the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the year ended 31 March 1997) to cease contributing to her foreign superannuation scheme before she will fail to meet the definition of a QFPA. Example 2 Mrs P, who was previously resident in New Zea- land, returned permanently to New Zealand on 11 July 1997, after an absence of 12 years. She continues to contribute to her foreign superannua- tion scheme until her retirement in 2005. To meet the definition of a QFPA she may continue to contribute to her foreign superannuation scheme until 31 March 2001, being the day before the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the year ended 31 March 1998. In this case the definition of a QFPA is not met because she continued to contribute to the foreign superannuation scheme after 31 March 2001. In addition, the new resident exemption in section CG 15 (2)(f) will not apply as the time did not fall before the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the income year in which she first became a resident of New Zealand. In this case paragraph (c) of the definition of “superannuation scheme” are arrangements that are constituted under a foreign country or state’s legislation principally to provide retirement benefits to natural persons. Therefore foreign pensions received from a superannuation scheme established by legislation of a foreign country are included within the definition of superannuation scheme. This is regardless of whether any contributions were made to the scheme by the person who is the beneficiary or recipient of the annuity and regardless of whether the contributions were compulsory or not. However, social security pensions and benefits provided under a foreign country or state’s legislation that is equivalent to the Social Security Act 1964 are specifi- cally excluded from the definition of superannuation scheme and therefore from the QFPA rules. For the same reason the entitlement to a social security pension does not constitute an interest in a FIF. Subject to the provisions of any relevant double taxation agreement, the income from these pensions is therefore assessed in New Zealand on a receipts basis. Paragraph (a) of the QFPA definition 2 The consideration for the entitlement to the pension or annuity is provided to the foreign entity- (i) At a time when the person is not resident in New Zealand; or (ii) At a time when the person is resident in New Zealand falling before the first day of the 4th income year succeeding the income year in which the person last becomes a resident of New Zealand; or (iii) From the accumulated balance or proceeds of an interest of the person in a superannuation fund and that interest is commuted or transferred in anticipation of, or following, the person ceasing to be a resident of New Zealand; and Subparagraph (i) (the non-resident contributions test) ensures the policy objectives of the QFPA rules are achieved, by requiring all contributions to have been made while the person was not resident in New Zea- land. That is, permitting only those people who contrib- uted to foreign superannuation schemes and life insur- ance policies while they were non-resident to pay tax on a cash basis (as opposed to including the pension or annuity in FIF income calculations) will not undermine the policy objectives of the FIF regime or the domestic superannuation and life insurance regimes. Therefore the FIF regime still applies in either of these situations: • if the consideration was provided for the interest when the person was resident in New Zealand • if the person continues to make contributions to the foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance fund after the time defined in paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition has expired. 2 Paragraph (a) contains the non-resident contributions test. from page 3 5 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Mrs P was resident in New Zealand from birth. She will therefore have an interest in a FIF from the date she became resident in New Zealand again (11 July 1997). Example 2 also illustrates the difference between the test in section CG 15 (2)(f) (the new resident exemp- tion) and the test used in the QFPA definition. For QFPA purposes the test is taken from the end of the income year in which the person last became resident in New Zealand. However, in the temporary resident exemption in CG 15 (2)(f), the test applies from the income year in which the person first became resident. Thus, to ensure the definition of a QFPA is met and also avoid the application of the FIF regime, contributions to a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy will need to cease before the expiration of the period ending on the first day of the fourth income year succeeding the income year in which a person becomes resident in New Zealand. This was illustrated in exam- ple 1 and would also be the case in example 2 if Mrs P had ceased making contributions on or before 31 March 2001. Subparagraph (iii) This provision is the other exception to the non-resident contributions test. Without this exception people who emigrated from New Zealand may not meet the QFPA definition if they return to reside permanently in New Zealand. This is because commuting 3 or transferring proceeds of a superannuation scheme from New Zealand to a foreign scheme would, for these purposes, be a contribution to a foreign entity. The definition of a QFPA would not otherwise be met if the proceeds were commuted or transferred while the person was still resident in New Zealand. Example 3 Mr C, a New Zealand resident who worked for a British based multinational company, left New Zealand on 30 June 1977. Before that time, and in anticipation of Mr C leaving New Zealand, his employer commuted his interest in their New Zealand based superannuation scheme to the company’s British-based superannuation scheme. In the absence of subparagraph (iii), if Mr C later returned to New Zealand his interest in his employ- er’s superannuation scheme would not meet the definition of a QFPA. That is, Mr C would not have met the non-resident contributions test as he was still resident at the time his interest was commuted. However, subparagraph (iii) ensures that Mr C does not breach the non-resident contributions test. Accordingly, assuming the other parts of the QFPA definition are met, his interest in the foreign superannuation scheme will qualify as a QFPA. 3 Commuting is the process of converting a pension to a lump sum. The lump sum is determined by an actuarial projection of interest and mortality rates to produce a commutation factor which is then multiplied by the amount of the pension to produce the capital value. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of QFPA definition (b) The future benefits of the person arising from the entitlement are not assignable (except to a spouse under a matrimonial property arrangement) unless the value of the future benefits is substan- tially decreased as a consequence of the transfer; and (c) The future benefits of the person arising from the entitlement are not able to be surrendered, charged, or borrowed against in exchange for a current receipt of cash or other property unless the value of the cash or other property received is substantially less than the decrease in the value of the future benefits resulting from the surrender, charge or borrowing: Assignments Paragraph (b) of the QFPA definition requires that the future benefits of the person arising from the entitle- ment are not assignable. This means that an interest in a foreign entity will not be a QFPA if the scheme or fund in which the rights to the pension or annuity are held has a provision in its deed, policy or contract which permits the pension or annuity to be assigned and the law governing the fund permits such assignments. However, there are two exceptions to this assignment prohibition. The first is when there is a transfer to a spouse under a matrimonial property arrangement. The second is if the value of the future benefits is substan- tially decreased as a consequence of the transfer. This is best explained by way of an example. Example 4 Mr G receives a purchased annuity. The contract under which his annuity was purchased allows him to assign his rights to the annuity to any other nominated person. Under paragraph (b) of the QFPA definition this would, prima facie, exclude the interest from being a QFPA. However, Mr G’s contract further provides that if the annuity is assigned, it will be reduced by a figure of 15 percent. That is, when the annuity is transferred its value will be 15 percent less than what it would have been had the assignment not taken place. In this case his annuity may still qualify as a QFPA if the 15 percent reduction in the value of the annuity can be regarded as a substantial reduction. It will be necessary in each case to determine what constitutes a substantial reduction in future benefits (see discussion on the meaning of “substantial” below). Note that if Mr G’s contract allowed him to transfer the annuity to his spouse then the QFPA definition would have been satisfied regardless of whether there is a reduction in future benefits or not. continued on page 6 6 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Borrowed This too refers to the situation when someone is able to borrow a sum of money (whether from the accumulated balance of his or her scheme or policy or otherwise) from the foreign entity, or a third party, by using the entitlement to benefit as security for the borrowing. Meaning of the word “substantially” The use of the word “substantially”, in the legislation was deliberately chosen to convey the meaning that the decrease in the future benefits must be of a large size or amount. Because the meaning of the word “substan- tially” is not precise it must be considered objectively in light of the facts of each case. There is no rule of thumb that can be used - what is a substantial decrease in future benefits in one case will not be a substantial decrease in another. Measuring the decrease For the purposes of paragraph (c) of the QFPA defini- tion, in comparing the value of any decrease in the future benefits of the annuity with a current receipt of cash or other property, it will be necessary to measure the two amounts in the same dollar value terms. Example 5 Mr T contributed a lump sum to a foreign life insurance policy in return for an annuity of $1,000 per month for 10 years, to start in 15 years’ time. Assuming a discount rate of 8 percent, the value of that annuity in year 15 is $25,364. Mr T withdraws $10,000 today, subject to a partial surrender of future benefits of $200 per month. The value of the future benefits surrendered ($200/month) in 15 years’ time is $16,104. On the face of it, paragraph (c) of the QFPA definition is satisfied as $10,000 is substantially less than the decrease in the value of the future benefits. However, that is not correct as it is necessary to compare the decrease in future benefits in the same dollars. The present value of $16,104 is $5,073. Given this, the current amount received of $10,000 is not substantially less than the decrease in future benefits. Mr T’s policy does not satisfy paragraph (c) of the definition. Surrender, charge or borrowing Paragraph (c) of the QFPA definition requires that the future benefits are not able to be surrendered, charged or borrowed in exchange for a current receipt of cash or other property. In this context the reference to future benefits, includes any surrender, charge, or borrowing of the accumulated balance or value of the current entitlement as this directly affects the level of future benefits. As with assignments, note that the law, as enacted, requires only that the terms of the superannuation scheme or life insurance policy contain a provision which permits the surrender, charging or borrowing for it to fail the QFPA definition. Thus, even though a person may never exercise their right to borrow from the scheme or fund, or they borrow from the scheme or fund and later repay those borrowings, the fact that the scheme or fund makes provision for surrender, charging or borrowing is sufficient to disqualify it from the QFPA definition. As with paragraph (b), which applies to assignments, there is an exception to this prohibition. Paragraph (c) will not disqualify the superannuation scheme or life insurance policy if the value of the cash or other prop- erty received as a consequence of the surrender, charge or borrowing is substantially less than the decrease in the value of the future benefits attributable to that event. Example 5 below illustrates this exception. Surrendered In the context of this provision, the term “surrendered” refers to the situation when someone gives up their rights or entitlement to benefit from a pension or annuity in return for a current receipt of cash or other property. This term therefore includes such actions as withdrawing funds (including partial surrenders) or cashing up the future benefits. Charged In general commercial terms a charge is a binding obligation secured (or charged) upon a particular asset of the person who is under the obligation. Thus charg- ing an asset is simply another means of borrowing against the security of an asset, which, in this context, is the entitlement of the person to benefit from a pension or annuity. from page 5 7 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Section CG 15 (1) defines the types of interests in foreign entities that constitute interests in a FIF. Sec- tions CG 15 1(b) and (c) specifically include an entitle- ment of a person to benefit, as a beneficiary or member, if the foreign entity is a foreign superannuation scheme; and an entitlement of a person to benefit from a policy of life insurance upon human life of which the foreign entity is the issuer. Therefore, under section CG 15 (1) anyone who is resident in New Zealand and who has an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme or life insurance policy issued by a foreign entity will have an interest in a FIF. The very wide nature of these definitions means that these are the only foreign-sourced pension or annuity schemes that are excluded from the FIF regime by section CG 15 (1) • those to which one of the exemptions in section CG 15 (2) applies • foreign social security type schemes established under legislation that is similar to New Zealand’s Social Security Act 1964 - see the definition of a “superan- nuation scheme” in section OB 1. QFPA interests excluded from FIF regime Section CG 15 (2) sets out the types of interest specifi- cally excluded from the FIF regime. This section now includes a new paragraph (g) that excludes an interest that is a QFPA from the FIF regime. The new subsec- tion (g) states: “CG 15 (2) An interest held by a person in a foreign entity at any time during an income year shall not be treated as an interest in a foreign investment fund - (g) If, subject to subsections (3) and (4), at the time, the interest is a qualifying foreign private annuity.” Section CG 15 (2)(g) therefore makes it clear that an interest that is a QFPA is not an interest in a FIF. This means that any pension or annuity received from an interest that is a QFPA will now be assessed on a receipts basis. Because the interest in the foreign entity is specifically excluded from the FIF regime, the nature of the pension or annuity received may depend on how the foreign entity is classified for tax purposes in New Zealand. This is particularly relevant in the case of foreign superannuation schemes. For example, if the QFPA is an interest in a contributory foreign superannuation scheme, the QFPA will be an interest in a unit trust under the definition of unit trust in section OB 1. Therefore, any pension received will be assessable under the dividend rules. In the case of a superannuation scheme that is non-contributory it may be necessary to consider the trust rules. If a QFPA is an entitlement to benefit from a life insurance policy issued by a foreign entity, the annuity will be assessable under section CE 1 in the normal manner. Option to continue FIF treatment Because the application date of the QFPA rules is retrospective to the beginning of the FIF regime, which applied generally from the 1993-94 income year, people who had complied with their obligations under the FIF regime (that is, disclosed and calculated FIF income from that interest) would, unless exempted, have their tax returns reassessed by the Commissioner to tax the pension or annuity income on a receipts basis. However, this was considered particularly harsh on people who had been complying with the FIF regime, particularly if the liability under the FIF regime is less than the liability on the pension or annuity assessed on a receipts basis. These people can therefore opt out of the QFPA rules and continue with the FIF regime. This election is provided in subsections (3) and (4) of section CG 15. A separate election is required for each FIF interest. Section CG 15 (3) This section applies to people who held an interest that is a QFPA at any time during an income year before the 1996-97 income year. It permits them to irrevocably elect that the interest not be a QFPA, but instead be treated as a FIF interest for the period from the begin- ning of the FIF regime until the end of the 1995-96 income year (or date of disposal, if earlier). Only people who complied with the FIF regime for this period can elect to stay in the FIF regime for the period. The election must be in writing and be given to the Commissioner of Inland Revenue before the due date for filing the person’s 1996-97 tax return. Period for which election applies Section CG 15 (3) elections apply for the period from the start of the FIF regime until the end of the 1995-96 income year, provided the person disclosed and returned FIF income in relation to the FIF interest for the whole of that period. (If the person acquired the FIF interest after the start of the FIF regime, and/or disposed of it before the end of the 1995-96 year, and returned FIF income for the whole period the interest was held, the election will apply for the period the interest was held.) Part 3 - Relationship of QFPA rules with the foreign investment fund (FIF) regime continued on page 8 8 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) from page 7 That is, a person cannot use the QFPA rules for the period from the beginning of the FIF regime through to the end of the 1995-96 income year and then elect under CG 15 (4) to return their pension or annuity under the FIF regime thereafter. Inland Revenue’s booklet Overseas Private Pensions (IR 258A) contains forms for making the above elec- tions. You can get a copy from any Inland Revenue office. Interests excluded from FIF regime not eligible for election under either sections CG 15(3) or CG 15(4) Both section CG 15 (3) and 15 (4) contain provisions to ensure that it is not possible to elect back into the FIF regime when the interest is excluded by any one of the specific exclusions provided in the FIF regime. Relationship between QFPA and an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme If a person has an interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme (ERFSS), the interest is wholly excluded from the FIF regime if no further contributions to the scheme were made following the later of the date the person became a New Zealand resident, or the expiry of the new resident exemption. Those interests that are only partially excluded from the FIF regime because the person continued to contribute to the scheme after becoming resident in New Zealand (and the temporary resident exemption period) will continue to be interests in a FIF. Because of the close relationship between an interest in an ERFSS that is wholly excluded from the FIF regime and the QFPA definition, the definition of an “interest in an employment-related foreign superannuation scheme” in section OB 1 has been amended to exclude interests that are a QFPA. Although, in the absence of this amendment, these two exemptions from the FIF regime could have applied concurrently without causing any problems, it was considered appropriate to amend the definition of an interest in a ERFSS to clarify that the QFPA regime took precedence. Because the election is only for that period, people may decide whether they wish to stay in the FIF regime (in which case they can make a further election under section CG 15 (4)) or whether they wish to switch to the QFPA rules. If they change to the QFPA rules from the 1996-97 income year onward, there is a deemed dis- posal of the FIF interest under section CG 23 (8) at the end of the 1995-96 income year. As both the 1976 and 1994 Income Tax Acts apply to this period (from the beginning of the FIF regime until the end of the 1995-96 income year), the election in the 1976 Act is specifically linked to the election in the 1994 Act. This means that only one election is required for the purposes of both Acts, and that a person cannot elect for the purposes of one Act and not the other. Section CG 15 (4) This section permits a person who acquired an interest that is a QFPA at any time before the 1996-97 income year, and who complied with their obligations under the FIF regime for that interest, to elect irrevocably that the interest not be a QFPA, but instead be treated as an interest in a FIF, for the income years after the 1995-96 income year. Section CG 15 (4) only applies if all of the following conditions are met: • The interest was acquired before the 1996-97 income year. • The requirements of the FIF regime have been met at all times up to and including the 1995-96 income year, as required by either the 1976 or 1994 Income Tax Acts. • A written notice is given to the Commissioner, before the date on which the person is required to file their 1996-97 tax return, electing that section CG 15 (2)(g) not apply to that interest for the income years follow- ing the 1995-96 income year. Relationship between sections CG 15 (3) and CG 15 (4) Sections CG 15 (3) and CG 15 (4) are linked in the sense that a person cannot make an election under section CG 15 (4) independently of section CG 15 (3). 9 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Two key definitions have been amended to ensure that only one-half of income received from the following is taken into account for surcharge purposes: • QFPAs • interests in a foreign entity that would have been FIF interests but for certain exclusions 4 and would also have been interests in a QFPA but for the non- resident contributions test. The amended definitions are the “other income” and “net New Zealand superannuation” definitions. Other income Section JB 2 (1) imposes New Zealand superannuitant surcharge at the rate of 25% of the amount by which a superannuitant’s other income in that income year exceeds his or her specified exemption. Section JB 3 (1) and item “a” The definition of other income in section JB 3 (1) has been amended by repealing item “a” of that definition and inserting a new item “a”. Paragraphs (i) and (ii) of item “a” Domestic pensions and annuities are generally exempt from income tax in New Zealand, either under section CB 9 (f) (for annuities) or under section HH 3 (5) (for pensions). However, paragraph (i) of item “a” adds back one-half of those pensions or annuities for surcharge purposes. Pensions or annuities received from a QFPA are fully assessable for income tax in New Zealand. Paragraph (ii) of item “a” therefore deducts one-half of these pensions or annuities from a superannuitant’s other income. Paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B) of item “a” Paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B) are more complex and require additional explanation. These paragraphs were added to give the concessionary surcharge treatment to those pensions and annuities that are received from interests in foreign superannuation schemes and life insurance policies that meet both of these conditions: • They are specifically excluded from the FIF regime. • They do not meet the QFPA definition because the non-resident contributions test is not met. The policy reason for extending the concessionary surcharge treatment to pensions and annuities received from these foreign entities relates to the key policy issues discussed in Part 1. That is, the QFPA measures are targeted at interests in foreign superannuation schemes or life insurance policies that, if removed from the FIF regime, would not undermine the FIF regime or New Zealand’s life insurance and superannuation regimes. 4 In sections CG 15 (2)(d) to (f). People who receive pensions or annuities from interests in foreign superannuation schemes or life insurance policies that are specifically excluded from the FIF regime will be taxed on a cash basis in any event. However, a significant number of these people would not meet the non-resident contributions test, so they would have to pay surcharge on the whole pension or annuity from that interest. Accordingly, it is appropriate that people with interests of this nature, such as New Zealand residents who meet the de-minimus test in section CG 15 (2)(d), should not be deprived of access to the concessional surcharge treatment. Without paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B) of item “a”, pensions and annuities received from such interests would be fully subject to surcharge, even though they would be assessed on a cash basis, in the same way as someone with an interest that is a QFPA. With the addition of paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B), people with interests of the type referred to in those paragraphs will now be charged surcharge on only one-half of their pensions and annuities. Paragraph (iii)(A) refers to interests that are not treated as interests in a foreign investment fund because they are excluded by sections CG 15 (2) (d) (which relates to the $20,000 de minimus rule), section CG 15 2(e) (which relates to the exchange controls of foreign countries which prohibit a person from deriving any profit or disposing of their investment); and CG 15 (2)(f) (which relates to the new residents’ exemption). Paragraph (iii)(B) refers to those interests that would be a QFPA but for the fact that the non-resident contri- butions test in the definition of QFPA is not met. Example 6 Ms Q, who has been resident in New Zealand since the age of five, has an interest in a life insurance policy which was taken out by her parents with a UK life insurer before the family emigrated to New Zealand. The contributions continued to be made until Ms Q’s 21st birthday. Aggregate contributions made to the life insurer do not exceed $20,000. The interest is excluded from the FIF regime by section CG 15 (2)(d). The policy matures and begins paying an annuity of NZD $2,000 a year. The interest in the life insur- ance policy is not a QFPA because contributions were made at a time when the recipient of the annuity was resident in New Zealand, and contin- ued after the three to four year period of grace allowed in the QFPA definition. The annuity payable in this example would be assessable on a receipts basis. Only one-half of the Part 4 - New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge continued on page 10 10 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) annuity will be subject to the surcharge because of paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B) of item (a) of the definition of “other income” in section JB 3 (1). Net New Zealand Superannuation The amount of surcharge a person is liable to pay in any income year cannot exceed the net amount of New Zealand Superannuation actually received in that income year. That is, the surcharge cannot exceed the after-tax amount of New Zealand Superannuation. In calculating net New Zealand Superannuation, the amount of the tax to be deducted is calculated by assuming the New Zealand Superannuation is the last amount of income earned for that year and had tax imposed at the highest marginal tax rate applicable to a person. The formula used in the Act to determine net New Zealand Superannuation starts with the gross New Zealand Superannuation, then deducts an amount of tax that is represented by the difference between the tax that would be payable on the superannuitant’s total income derived in that year and the tax that is payable on the “other income” and any foreign social security pension derived in that year. Item “c” of the net New Zealand Superannuation formula therefore adjusts the “other income” amount to bring it back to what it would have been for income tax purposes. That is, it deducts one-half of any amount from page 9 received from a domestic pension or annuity and adds one-half of the foreign pension or annuity. In essence, it represents the opposite of the treatment applied by item “a” of the “other income” definition. Section JB 2 (3) and item “c” The definition of net New Zealand Superannuation in section JB 2 (3) has been amended to accommodate the changes necessary as a result of the new QFPA rules, by repealing item “c” of that definition and inserting a new item “c”. Paragraphs (iii), (iv)(A) and (B) of item “c” These paragraphs of item “c” contain the provisions necessary to deal with pensions or annuities received from any interest that is a QFPA or would be a QFPA but for the circumstances described in paragraphs (iv)(A) and (B). An understanding of these paragraphs is provided in the discussion on paragraphs (iii)(A) and (B) of the definition of “other income” above. Foreign social security pensions The entitlement to these pensions would not constitute an interest in a QFPA as they would not meet the definition of a foreign superannuation scheme. Any foreign social security pension received by a New Zealand resident is deducted from the amount of “other income” for surcharge purposes. These pensions, which are referred to as “specified social security pensions”, are therefore not subject to surcharge. Part 5 - General examples Examples - QFPA definition met Example 7 Ms P transfers to New Zealand from the USA as part of her job with a large multi-national company. She becomes resident in New Zealand in September 1996 and continues to make contributions to the scheme until 31 March 2000. She continues work- ing in New Zealand until her retirement in 2010. At this time she receives her pension from her employ- er’s USA superannuation scheme. The scheme cannot be assigned, surrendered or borrowed from. This superannuation scheme meets the definition of an interest in a QFPA as all contributions were made to the scheme within the time allowed in the QFPA definition. Example 8 Mr U, who emigrated to New Zealand to retire, has an interest in a foreign superannuation scheme which was established by an Act of Parliament in his country of origin. Contributions to this scheme were earnings-based and compulsory. Mr U has not made any contributions to this scheme since he began residing in New Zealand. In this case, Mr U has an interest in a foreign entity as all contributions were made while he was non- resident. The QFPA definition is satisfied. Examples - QFPA definition not met Example 9 Mr F has an interest in a foreign life insurance policy. He became resident in New Zealand in December 1995, not having been resident in New Zealand previously. Mr F continues to make contributions to the foreign entity after 31 March 1999. Mr F has not met the non-resident contributions test in the QFPA definition. He will be deemed to acquire an interest in a FIF on 1 April 1999, being the day following the last day of the new resident exemption in section CG 15 (2)(f). 11 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Example 10 Ms J has an interest in a foreign life insurance policy. She stopped contributing to the fund on becoming resident in New Zealand. Her policy document allows her to withdraw limited amounts of money from the policy before its maturity date. The future benefits of the policy will be reduced to take the interim withdrawal into account, but not by an amount that is substantially more than the amount withdrawn. In this case the QFPA definition is not met because of the operation of paragraph (c) of that definition. The interest in the life insurance policy will become an interest in a FIF after the new resident exemption in CG 15 (2)(f) expires. Example 11 Ms Z has been a New Zealand resident since birth. She works in New Zealand for an employer based in the United States. The employer requires all employees to contribute to their superannuation scheme, which is also based in the United States. Ms Z will not have an interest that is a QFPA as all contributions were made while she was resident in New Zealand. In this case she will have an interest in a FIF since the later of the beginning of the FIF regime or the date she began contributing to her employer’s superannuation scheme. 12 IRD Tax Information Bulletin: Volume Eight, No.5 - Appendix (September 1996) Appendix to TIB Volume Eight, No.5September 1996 Foreign-sourced pensions: detailed analysis of tax treatment Part 1: Previous rules, the new qualifying foreign private annuity (QFPA) rules and key policy issues ........................... 1 Part 2: Detailed analysis of QFPA definition ....................................... 3 Part 3: Relationship between QFPA rules and foreign investment fund (FIF) regime ...................................... 7 Part 4: New Zealand Superannuitant surcharge and QFPAs ........... 9 Part 5: Examples: interests in foreign entities that meet or fail the QFPA definition ............................................. 10
