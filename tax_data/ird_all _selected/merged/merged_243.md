We are very fortunate to have a tax system which is far simpler and easier to both comply with and administer than that of many countries. Compliance costs, although not a prominent talking point in the mass media, are real and significant and should be a very important consideration in any proposed tax reform. Simplicity and a tax system which is both easy to understand and hard to avoid are very much good things. To speak to a more specific example, my concern is around modifications to GST to encourage or dissuade the consumption of certain products; aka 'sin taxes'. Examples include fresh vegetables, women's sanitary products, sugary drinks, fast food and so forth. My fear is this will open a Pandora's box of corporate interest groups lobbying to have their products treated more favourably, as well as self-interested 'health experts' looking to bolster their own reputations and legacies by lobbying to have certain products treated less favourably. Over time this will lead to an increasingly complex and difficult to understand tax code, increasing compliance costs, and leading to absurd categorizations of different products into different tax brackets as we have seen overseas - very similar products being taxed at different rates due to the arbitrary decision of a bureaucrat. Once this Pandora's Box is opened I fear it will only get worse and worse over the years as various exemptions and sin taxes accumulate, and once established will be almost impossible to simplify and reform. As to the other points raised in the Future of Tax working group, I am in favour of broad, flat, low and simple tax system - I am a libertarian at heart. Having said that however I recognize that there are important trade offs that must be considered here in consultation with many people across the community. My main concern, as stated, is the retention of the relatively simple and efficient tax system which New Zealand currently enjoys - complexity and high compliance costs benefit no one. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my submission. Sincerely Simon Holdsworth \[1\] 2 From:Steve Sent: Sunday, 25 March 2018 6:21 AM To: ^DailyNews: Editor Cc: TWG Submissions Subject: Taxation Proposal Taxation proposal In response to Stuff News question “Should NZ have a wealth tax”, I choose option 2; “No way, keep your hands off”. Because of an aging work force it has been suggested that government be more reliant on taxing capital gains and less reliant on taxing wages. In this 21 st century it has become more critical to stop government borrowing and to minimise credit creation by modernising money and taxation. Government bonds can never be assets if the debt is never repaid. It does not matter whether credit (money) is created as debt or debt- free as both cause inflation and reduce the purchasing power of our currency (invisible taxation). But debt- free money has three immediate benefits. It stops the payment of interest to banks, allows the modernisation of taxation and controls inflation by being spent into the economy not lent. By stopping the diversion of tax revenue away from consumption and tangible capital investment allows personal income tax to be abolished and goods and services tax to be upgraded (20- 25%) to tax the economy fairly as it was designed to do (no loopholes). There would be no need to consider inheritance tax , capital gains tax or wealth tax. Only the wealthy would say the poor are disadvantaged by such a proposal but really it would be the wealthy that would be disadvantaged as they have more wealth and income to spend. The “ wealthy experts” must stop thinking of themselves. Steve Laurence \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 3 From:eyewazear . Sent: Saturday, 24 March 2018 11:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Pure Democracy Dear The New Zealand Government My name is Joe Higgins. I'm a rebuild worker living in Christchurch. While I write this message I'm living in a tent and about to be unemployed, with no job prospects as yet. I've proposed a new political party called Eco NZ. My intention is to run for Government in 2026. Until then I'll be making a name for myself growing gardens in the Christchurch CBD, as well as setting up permaculture gardens and hemp farms. I think New Zealand will be ready for a landscape architect-rebuild worker by 2026. Here are some of my ideas- http://www.ecoisland.co.nz/EcoNZobjectives.html I'd like to ask the Tax Working Group to look into the costs of setting up the political system of Pure Democracy- Community Politics The political system of Pure Democracy, as proposed by EcoNZ, includes people voting for a national government, regional council and a residents association. People will vote for a chairperson of their local residential area. These areas will be based on suburbs or rural areas. Pure Democracy also includes a system of direct democracy, where people can propose a law change or policy change, which can be put to a public vote, which if successful will be enacted into law. People wanting to propose a law or policy change will vote via submitting 350 signatures to their Residents Association Chairperson. This submission will be then put on a public forum, such as a website, for all people to see. Each Residents Association Chairperson in the country will then vote on the submission. If the results of the submission are 77% or more in favour of the submission, then the submission will be put to a public vote in the form of a postal-referendum. The votes will be tallied by independent people. If more than 50% of the country vote in favour of the submission then the submission is enacted into law. Pure Democracy also includes the provision that Residents Associations operate the function of all arable-public-land within their area. The Residents Association Chairperson will be responsible for deciding which areas of public land are to be used for agriculture and horticulture. Residents Association Chairperson's will be voted on once a year. Residents wanting to use public land for agriculture or horticulture will apply to their residents association to be allocated land. The total amount of land available will be divided by the number of residents wanting to use land, thus each resident will be given an equal portion of land to use. Resident Associations will work alongside local councils and the government organising funding for activities such as garden-bed construction, education and other activities. Pure Democracy includes a provision that a nutritionist-nurse be employed in each residential area. Both the Chairperson and the nutritionist-nurse will be paid for via government-taxation. Regards, Joe Higgins. \[1\] 4 From:David Miller Sent: Saturday, 24 March 2018 4:05 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission - DG Miller ATTENTION: THE TAX WORKING GROUP A. FIF REGIME 1. The submission concerns the FIF taxation regime as it applies to small investors, and specifically to "ineligible" foreign shares. 2. The present FIF tax regime does not allow carry forward of losses. It is based on the assumption that there is an even, sine wave type movement in ineligible shares over time. 3. Contrary to the sine wave assumption, a well-known principle of sharemarket behaviour is that shares "go up the escalator and down the elevator". 4. Having invested in a number of (primarily Australian) mining shares for many years, sadly a number of them have performed very badly. The practical implications of the FIF tax regime on such shares can be exemplified as follows: a. I buy a share for $1. b. In a particular year, it suddenly falls from $1 to 5 cents. c. For the year concerned, I have no tax obligations under the FIF regime. d. The following year, the share price improves to 15 cents. e. I am immediately taxed on the 10 cent increase. f. The share price is still 85 cents less than my purchase price. I face a substantial loss, but am paying tax on “incremental improvements”. 5. If this were a health tax designed to tax people for improving their health status, the analogy would operate something along the following lines: a. I suffer a serious accident and end up covered in bandages and immobile in a hospital bed. b. The IRD representative arrives and assures me that I will not face any health tax obligations for the year concerned. So far so good. c. The following year, I improve to the point where I can move about in a wheelchair. d. The IRD representative again arrives and tells me that I have a health tax obligation on the grounds that my health status has improved. I protest to no avail. e. The following year, I improve to the extent that I can now walk on crutches. f. I get the same news from the IRD representative and again protest to no avail. g. It is possible that I face no prospect of ever returning to my original health status but will continue to face further health tax obligations because of incremental improvements. 6. I trust that the inequity of the above situation is painfully obvious, both for the health tax analogy and for ineligible shares. I have previously written to Minister Peter Dunne when he was Minister of Inland Revenue about this matter and received what I can only describe as a pathetically argued response. 7. It is time that carry forward of investment losses on ineligible shares is permitted under the FIF regime. B. HEALTH AND DENTAL CARE PROVISION 1. I would like to draw the Tax Working Group's attention to two broad areas of national social expenditure. Illness and Accident Victims – Inequitable Differential Rights 2. First, I referred to the differential rights of those seriously disabled as a result of illness and accidents. I think the time has come to address at least the worst cases, so that those disabled through illness receive the same benefit rights as those disabled as a result of accidents. I appreciate that the cost of such a change will be very considerable which is why I think that the Tax Working Group should in the first instance seek to reduce the most outstanding inequities. It is of course likely that these will be the most expensive to address. Even an attempt to partially "closie the gap" in the differential rights between victims of accidents and illness would be an improvement over the present inequitable situation. \[1\]\[1\] 5 Inclusion of Essential Dental Care in Publicly Funded Healthcare 3. Second, I am extremely concerned about the inability of many lower income citizens to afford dental care. There are large numbers of people with missing, poorly maintained and seriously uneven teeth. It is not equitable that treatment for serious dental problems are only available to higher income people. I believe that the time has come to include dental treatment (excluding non-essential cosmetic dental care) within the definition of healthcare that is made available free of care to the public. I would be happy to discuss any of the above points with members of the Tax Working Group or relevant officials. Your sincerely David Miller \[1\] 6 From:Clare Brown Sent: Saturday, 24 March 2018 3:56 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Possible capital gains tax on houses I would like to make a submission that the exemption from any capital gains tax already confirmed for owner-occupied homes is also extended to homes owned by the Trustees of a family trust and occupied by beneficiaries of the trust. There are up to 500,000 family trusts in New Zealand. Each one has been set up for legitimate reasons and not necessarily by affluent people. In each case the family home will probably be owned by the Trustees and occupied by beneficiaries. To impose a capital gains tax on those homes would mean that Trustees may transfer those homes back to beneficiaries, forgoing asset protection to avoid a tax. The issue does need to be addressed to avoid uncertainly and inequity. As an aside, middle income New Zealanders pay a HUGE percentage of their income in various forms of tax (income tax, tax on interest, GST, rates, excise duty on petrol etc.) Tax cannot be constantly be increased otherwise where is the incentive to work hard and be productive.

I believe we will get the following benefits from this. 1. A bigger kiwisaver account for members giving more funds to access in retirement. 2. A bigger pool of funds for investment. 3. More money for member's to access under the first home scheme. 4. Another incentive for staying in the kiwisaver scheme. Which means potentially more New Zealanders with funds to access in their retirement. 5. A happier kiwisaver member as they see their account grow through bigger contribution's. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to submit an idea to the group. Regards Stein Dando \[1\]\[1\] 8 From:Alison Salmons Sent: Friday, 23 March 2018 7:14 PM To: TWG Submissions Dear Tax working group, I would like to make a submission. I am very pleased that there is a tax working group at the moment. The things I would most like to see change are these: I want very strong behaviour changing pollution taxes. The current holocaust on nature is ruining everything. The environment taxes are THE most important task for the tax working group, I believe. To anyone who argues against this, it is unrealistic that we can have a slither of a hope of solving our horrific pollution problems without utilising tax incentives to the full. I believe that the government must pull out all the stops now, bravely. The Arctic was above zero degrees for 8 days this winter in Feb ruary, which was completely new crazy crazy weather. Is this not enough to fly ibto action??!! Hurry hurry. Please pull all those tax levers now, if we are going to survive. Droughts and floods will lead to war. I want big multinationals to pay tax properly, and for NZ to take a strong stand on this. This is one the biggest causes of many social problems. Specifically, I want the removal of GST on fully electric cars for EVs of under $40,000, so as to help NZers on average wages be able to afford to convert to EVs I want capital gains tax. It was very upsetting that the next door apartment to mine 2 years ago sold for $398,000 then 1 year later sold for $620000 and that the speculators paid no tax on about $200000 profit, while I slaved away working about 48 hrs a week that year, contributed something to society in my work, and paid tax on all my earnings and managed to save only $10,000 on a teacher salary. Not fair! NB: I do not want people to be able to claim tax rebates if property prices fall! I want free public transport, funded by taxes elsewhere. For people in cars, they gain too by getting clear roads. Those using public transport should not have to pay as they already get seriously taxed with time and inconvenience, whilst car drivers cause so much noise, belch pollution and CO2, take up space, cause loss of fitness and generally cost in many ways that they do not properly pay for. In Melbourne the roads were empty during the Commonwealth games because public transport was free. So that is how NZ can solve Auckland's clogged roads, surpass our stingy levels of reduction in the Paris agreement, help poorer people etc. Please raise car licensing fees to Oz levels to fund public transport. Thank you, Alison Salmons \[1\] 9 10 From:Ian Breeze Sent: Friday, 23 March 2018 5:16 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Putative tax submission I would like to make a submission to the tax working group. I am a retired consultant general surgeon age 68 and I take an interest in nutrition and health. I recommend the introduction of a sugar tax aimed at reducing sugar consumption. Sugar has been regarded by some as the “new tobacco”. Tobacco taxes have been effective in New Zealand in reducing consumption and I consider that a sugar tax could similarly modify behaviour. Opponents of the sugar tax opine that it is ineffective citing the 10% tax in Mexico as evidence. A 10% tax is a “Clayton’s” tax designed to placate public health officials and at the same time not alienate “Big soda” (the former employer of a recent Mexican president) I understand that 75% of the cost of cigarettes is tax , equating to a tax rate of 300%. Obviously a sugar tax has to be set at a high enough rate to reduce consumption, whatever that rate is. A reduction of the salt content of food has historically been successful and beneficial. The reason we need a sugar tax in New Zealand is that we have an epidemic of “diabesity”. We have a third fattest nation globally after the US and Mexico, 7% of our population have type II diabetes and 25% are prediabetic. The health effects of “diabesity” are in some ways worse than those of cigarette smoking.. Approximately half of cigarette smokers die from smoking related illness and those half die on average 14 years prematurely, Death from the ill effects of smoking, coronary artery disease, stroke and various cancers, it is usually quite swift, and this reduces the cost of treatment. In contrast long- term survival occurs in “diabesity” and its complications, particularly renal failure are huge drain on health resources. Adult obesity is a contributing factor to the need for expensive joint replacement surgery, Once established, obesity is very difficult to reverse. Auckland diabetologist Robin Toomath now recognises that counselling patients to lose weight is waste of time. Therefore prevention is the key i.e. targeting the potential future generations of “Diabesity”- children and teenagers. This group can not immediately vent its displeasure at the ballot box!! I recommend that initially a tax be levied on all sugary drinks and sugary foods, including confectionary and biscuits and perhaps eventually also include those foods that have sugar ‘smuggled”into them such as canned baked beans and sauces. This will target primarily low income families but their socio-economic status will increase the potency of this tax. This should result in an prompt reduction in the incidence of dental care is in childhood. I am aware of the huge number of New Zealand children with such advanced dental decay that they required dental treatment under general anaesthetic in public hospitals. I am aware of the primary school in Hamilton with childhood obesity has been virtually eliminated by a focus on diet and sport. As New Zealand is an island nation the introduction of tax could not be defeated by black- market importation of sugar from overseas. We have a health service in New Zealand that is greatly in need of increased funding and the general public would be readily receptive receptive of a sugar tax if the revenue was targeted at health care. New Zealand has led the world in many initiatives, and I see this as another opportunity. Type II diabetes is a societal problem that requires a societal solution. Not consuming excess sugar needs to become the default option. I also support any initiatives whereby tax can be used to clean up our environment and reduce inequality. Thank you for considering my submission. Yours sincerely, Ian Breeze FRACS MBChB \[1\] 11 From: Sent:Friday, 23 March 2018 12:46 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Re: Submission I suspect a submission on tax change will be nothing but a farce if the submissions do not line up with the already decided agenda. A quick perusal of 'the questions to be answered' does not allow for the free interchange of ideas and opinions. I hold much doubt that what I have to submit will make a difference but I take this opportunity to voice my opinion. The perception of those 'that have not' seems to be that... it is the fault of 'those that have' This appears to be the opinion of the politicians also. Most of the 'haves' own their own home. Have what they consider necessary and are able to afford what some may consider are 'luxury items'. As such things are unattainable by the 'have nots', these 'haves' are somehow blame for the plight of the 'have nots'. Life is all about choice. Consider this. Choices are made not only this year, nor just the last decade but through the whole of life ....and is the reason for 'the haves' perceived wealth. Installed in the psych of generations past was the need to be responsible. Perhaps they were fortunate in that with no such thing as welfare, the base from which they, \[most of them\] sprang from was....although not apparent at the time.... was of great benefit. The depression WW1 and WW2 made that generation the responsible people they are today. There was no 'sense of entitlement' back then. The taxes paid by them built New Zealand's infrastructure. Taxes were high, no one complained. Laziness was frowned on as was accepting charity. There was absolutely no sense of entitlement or grievance. about one's plight....but now, there is. That should change, must change and throwing more and more money via broadening the tax base will do nothing but divide. Govt. policy should aim at encouragement to attain but it is my observation that Govtt governments policy instead encourages discontent. What needs to be realized is that those that have strived to have a little above the pension will find quitting the industry an attractive option and who could blame them with the proposed changes in NZ? Clobber them, via more taxes and what will happen to the many in need of houses? Australia offers a far better choice. Considering the damage caused to rental property via 'methamphetamine' damage and in some cases just downright disgusting behavior by some of those that are at this time being championed as needy and homeless. It seems the proposed tax changes is encouragement enough to flee the country. Exiting honest taxpayers will leave, leaving this govt with the burden of those responsible for huge welfare payouts, many who are where they are because of poor choices. \[1\]\[1\] 12 Beryl Curreen 13 From: Sent:Friday, 23 March 2018 10:27 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Taxing activities that impact negatively on the environment will not only provide an incentive for industries etc. to clean their act up (financial penalties are often the only action that works), but it will have positive results for the entire country.

This will cut down on obesity. The proceeds can be used to subsidise free dental care. 2) Also a Tobin tax on foreign currency transfers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobin\_tax The NZ dollar is over-traded compared to its economic power. This will help cut down on speculation which does not directly aid the economy. Investments can then be redirected into more productive areas. 3) Taxes to protect the environment. Thanks, Bevan McCabe \[1\] \[1\] 15 From:Vinnie Steenkamp Sent: Thursday, 22 March 2018 4:19 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax review submission I am Vinnie Steenkamp. As a way of introduction and qualifying myself I am a 57 year old male New Zealand born European. I am a stay at home parent in a defacto lifetime relationship. I am a qualified cabinet maker with advanced trade. I spent 27 years in the New Zealand police, 20 yrs as sworn and 7 years as a non sworn. 9 of those years as a crime analyst as well as a supervisor for extended periods of time. In 2010 I suffered a major stroke which a left post side effects. We are a single income family earning under 50k per annum. I am not entitled to any benefits due to this figure. SUMMARY  A new financial class of citizen emerging  Employment environment changing more quickly as technology advances  Less skilled need a purpose  Sources of tax revenue need to be readdressed  Rewards for better financial and environmental management by the population (1st family home buyers and 1st time family home builders need to be encouraged)  Social conscience needs to be encouraged  GST As time goes on and traditional form of taxing continue the largest group being taxed, in financial terms, is the middle class. This is to be expected at a central government level. But it should also be recognised that other tax regimes also impact on this group, Local and regional council rates, petrol taxes etc. Because the financial pressures on the middle class is increasing the lower half of that class is now finding it harder to cope therefor are considered the upper lower class. The biggest change in recent history is the internet and the means to convey technology through this means. Hand in hand with this is ever quickening pace of technology improvement. With this improvement the employment opportunities for unskilled workers is being restricted year by year. Technology is making certain academic qualifications void of value. I know of several examples where those with multiple degrees are unemployed, still. The resonbeing technology ha taken over the positions that they may have held. In the future I see a emerging business sector of keeping people occupied in their free time. I believe that those with skills both practical and academic, will be employed from contract to contracts. Contracts will last for the work needed to be done at that time. Once done the contractor will move onto next contract. The scenario will be that contractors will have to plan for down time between contacts. It is inevitable the the Traditional 40 hr week will disappear. With change, as seen throughout history, will come a part of society that will either be left behind or feel disenfranchised. These groups often feel the options available to them are either unsuitable or not wanted. These groups will need a purpose or they will cause a greater burden on govt finances. The form this purpose takes my not be traditional work for cash schemes. But I do believe a community based practical skill education scheme where people are required to choose and attend these courses to learn practical skills which then can be channelled into local compulsory work skill schemes where skills learnt are put into practice in the local community. \[1\] 16 With an aging population and also a lessening birth rate tax revenue sources will be inadequate. New sustainable tax sources need to be found with overtaxing current sources. Corporate loopholes need to be addressed, so that multinationals pay their share of tax instead of milking NZ and sending funds overseas. I also believe that significant land buyers from overseas should not be able to buy land but instead have long term leasehold land that can be returned to owners or forfeit to owners if the leaseholder abandons land for any reason. Lease payments should be based on a 1 to 5 year period with a minimum of 10 yr lease with a maximum lease of .(x) amount and a right of renewal. Whatever activity is carried out on that land would be taxed under normal NZ tax law I also believe that .charities should pay tax. The definition of a charity, charity income should be revisited. Housing will remain a contentious issue. I believe that property developers are necessary and the tax status quo should remain, unless as stated above the developer is an overseas investor. I believe that first home buyers and first home builders (IE family decides to build their own home rather than buy existing), should be encouraged. I think school leavers should be encouraged to join a first home save and buy scheme where the more they save the more the govt contributes, similar concept to those in the 1980s. Those who decide to build and use renewable energy, resources etc should be rewarded through a % tax drop for a specified period. Also there could be room for a scheme where the concept is that keeps the land and allows those who build and agree to build and maintain that build to certain specs (incl use renewable energy, resources etc) join a scheme where the govt agrees,after a period agreeable to both parties, That the govt buys the house off the build partner. That house then goes into state stock and the build partner may the have enough to deposit on another purchase out of the scheme in the normal real estate market. At the moment in current rental market there is not enough reasonably priced rental stock. Being a landlord I believe that Landlords need a social conscience. Not only in quality of rental but also the price thereof. From my own experience we never increase rental prices because of a tenants anniversary. We have not increased our rents for two years and do not foresee a rent increase in the next year. We also work with our tenants when financial times are hard for them through no fault of their own. In return we get the loyalty and consideration from our tenants. I also believe that overseas landlords are a mistake as their values differ as the saying goes ‘out of sight out of mind’. I believe an environmental rating system on rentals needs to be linked to tax. Better the rental lower the tax. I also believe that a lot more families are forced, through lack of opportunity due to age and other social influences, to have a parent stay at home. This is becoming less of a choice and more of a necessity. These families need support. GST is now an integral part of NZ tax. GST Influence on incomes for the population of New Zealanders is significant. If GST removed from fresh food items I do not believe it would make significant benefits for the population in general. But, remove GST from fresh food items and increase GST for food items that cause significant health issues could work. The concept of forgiving GST for first home buyers may work. In general society is changing and is changing quicker than we think. As the population ages the cost of maintaining services will increase. Tax revenue may not unless we as a country truly and honestly place value on what NZ has. Not what it wants. Thank you for reading this submission. Sincerely Vinnie Steenkamp \[1\] 17 From:Kevin Varney Sent: Thursday, 22 March 2018 8:17 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Online revenues If a profit is made in NZ it should be taxed in NZ. Big technology firms face paying more tax under plans announced by the European Commission. It said companies with significant online revenues should pay a 3% tax on turnover for various online services, bringing in an estimated €5bn (£4.4bn). The proposal would affect firms such as Facebook and Google with global annual revenues above €750m and taxable EU revenue above €50m. The move follows criticism that tech giants pay too little tax in Europe. EU economics affairs commissioner Pierre Moscovici said the "current legal vacuum is creating a serious shortfall in the public revenue of our member states". He stressed it was not a move against the US or "GAFA" - the acronym for Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon. According to the Commission, top digital firms pay an average tax rate of just 9.5% in the EU - far less than the 23.3% paid by traditional companies. \[1\] 18 From:Matt hew Sent: Thursday, 22 March 2018 7:37 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I believe that the poor are currently proportionately overtaxed and the rich are undertaxed. The fact that financial transactions and property trading (speculation) aren't taxed at all is a major contributor to this. Historically, in New Zealand, only imports and land use were taxed, until 1891 when income tax was introduced. It was previously believed that it was immoral and wrong to tax a person's labour - You owned your labour and it was untaxable. When income tax was introduced in 1892 it was only paid when a person earned over £300 (the equivalent $50,000 in 2008). Earning money from financial transactions and capital gains is earning money without contributing anything to society and it should not be tax free. It should be taxed rather than taxing people's contributions to society (their labour). Introducing a Robin Hood or Tobin Tax and Capital Gains Tax while at the same time not taxing the first $30,000 - $50,000 any person earned would be a good way to bring proportional balance to the amount of tax the poor paid compared to the rich. The tax break given to very low income earners would give them the opportunity to improve their situation and raise them out of poverty. \[1\] 19 From:faith baillache Sent: Wednesday, 21 March 2018 10:52 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Re tax I would like to know why people are not taxed for taking home stays There are some taking up to 5 home stays Which is $1000 + a week Get Outlook for Android \[1\] 20 From: Sent:Wednesday, 21 March 2018 9:03 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group Submissions To whom it may concern; My submission is split in two parts - the first, an outside-of-the-box suggestion for supporting tax reforms (whatever they may be), and then also my brief opinions on particular aspects of a tax reform. I apologise that it's not very formal, but better something than nothing. I'm happy for you to contact me further if you wish. Section 1: better uses of technology to support future tax reforms Speaking as a data scientist, the key factor in most 'disruptive' changes to a business is good data. My proposal is that the Tax Working Group should consider recommending a further working group into what technical solutions could be implemented such that better data could be collected, which would enable a) more efficient tax administration, and b) make it much easier to trial and test different approaches. A possible example is as follows. Currently, the fundamental economic unit transferred is a portion of money - be it in cash, internet transfer, etc. - but there is no inherent 'purpose' for the attached data (e.g. " paying for petrol"). Of course, this can be inferred - if money was transferred fr om an employer to an employee, it was probably income tax. However, doing this inference is often very hard to do well, and very expensive - and relies in large part on the honesty of those reporting the data. Put another way, the tax system would be considerably 'better' (to be defined soon) if one had perfect knowledge about the purpose of a particular monetary transaction, in an easily consumable/processable format. I propose that, in the modern digital economy, this is a relatively soluble problem. Retailers already have POS systems, an can elucidate every line item, so it'd be little work to provide this meta-data for each transaction. Online retailers already capture a lot of metadata (think how much Amazon learns about me from the content of what I purchase, not just the value). All employer to employee payments could have the payslip included as meta-data. When I pay the plumber a bill, information about me, his business, and the particular invoice, could all be attached as meta-data. Why would this be useful? Firstly, tax administration could potentially be much more efficient. For income tax, just sum all things categorised (automatically) as 'income'. Want to exclude GST on fruit and vegetables, and implement a tax on sugary drinks? Trivial. Administer capital gains taxes? Ignore income tax on retirement savings? Tax on financial transactions? All straightforward. Basically any tax on the flow of money (i.e. not something like a land tax, where no money flows) is feasible. Secondly, one could very easily implement new tax policy. Want to remove GST from bread too? Or now include the family home in a capital gains tax? Easy. In addition, one could even get really smart and carry out A/B testing, or simply run trials - try a tax reform for a few months, and if it fails, just switch back. Easy. Of course, I've glossed over some significant details: - the key hurdle will be what metadata to store, and how to obtain that - in most situations, transactions (and goods and services) will need to be categorised in some way, which may be painful for business and individuals. That said, it won't be too onerous for businesses, as most will already do this to some degree (especially as more and more online accounting is used). \[1\]\[1\]\[1\] \[1\] 21 - there'll need to be a lot of technical integration work regarding how this information is sent. Many forms of payment already collect some form of data (online banking: reference etc.; credit card: card number, merchant and terminal, etc.), so it's really a matter of extending the amount of data to be collected. Some of the hardware is already there (e.g. POS systems), but there'd be a fair bit of re-configuring. And other non- trivial matters like, standardizing the format of what an invoice is (so that it includes all the relevant metadata that can be used by IRD in a standard way). - the identity of the sender and receiver must be recorded. This also shouldn't be hard, and is done in most situations already. - cash would require some thinking, being non-digital, but is probably feasible, to some degree. (If all monies were individually identified, this could be transmitted too, and allow for detection of when it's flow hasn't been correctly recorded, i.e. tax evaded.) There's a lot more to it, and I'm not proposing it's the best solution (or even a good one) by any stretch. However, I believe that something like this should be considered earlier rather than later, even if it doesn't come to fruition for a decade. For a paltry sum, you could get NZ's best and brightest IT professionals together to give this a pretty good going over. Maybe they'd do it pro bono, for the civic good. As a final comment, blockchain (and it's more mature ilk) should be seriously considered as a platform for supporting this (i.e. recording transactions and metadata). A lot of neat benefits could flow from that. Section 2: my thoughts on possible tax reform ideas - For the purpose and fairness of the tax system: I'd place a lot of emphasis on income and wealth equality (or, more aptly, equality of purchasing power). The main caveat is that equality can also be determined by transfers, which is outside the tax system. However, I believe the tax system should at least not worsen equality (and hope that transfers keep up in remedying this). My preference, however, would be to have no transfers - while they may result in the same financial equality, they do not result in equality in terms of social standing and self-satisfaction etc. (In other words, if I were on a low income, I'd prefer to keep all of it and get no transfer, as opposed to being taxed X% of it, and being given that back as a transfer, as it means I'm "below" those who don't need to ask for help, etc.) - removing GST on particular items is really easy (speaking as a guy in IT). I recommend setting up the infrastructure to support this - and then if successive governments want to change the goods that are included/excluded, so be it. Personally, I'd favour less GST on foods (preferably health and NZ grown), and adding GST to any imported goods (including 'low value' online-purchased ones). It'd also be trivial to, within that same infrastructure, support varying GST rates (as opposed to just all or nothing) - and one could, for example, have higher GST rates for higher value items. - taxing low-value imports could be easy, with a little technology. Likewise enforcing customs duty, etc. - in general, I support capital gains tax, including on the family home (since I intend to use it as a home, and never sell it). However, I appreciate that it's excessively messy, and one can easily be unfair and unequal. So, I'd treat carefully, and probably start small. (Which is actually what our current tax system does - in certain cases, you get capital gains tax.) One such that comes to mind is if I'm forced to sell my home as it's grown too small with a growing family - in this case, as long as I buy another house (of equal or higher value) it could be free of capital gains. This concept of 'capital exchange' (i.e. exchanging one non-liquid asset for another non-liquid asset of equal of higher value) being excluded from capital gains could be general, and would possibly be fair. I guess this is equivalent to getting a 'capital gains credit' when I buy an asset - which may be easier to enforce. - I'm wary of land/wealth tax, in part because most people already get that from local council, and it can be hard on those without the cashflow to support it (especially the elderly). If something is implemented, I'd have reasonably high limits before it was applied (e.g. the 90th percentile, so only 10% of individual pay it). - I'm somewhat in favour of a blanket tax on any transfer of money as a replacement to all of our distinct taxes, though I admit to not having thought it through much. It'd be very easy to administer, and would also remain unchanged by various governments (who would instead change how they distribute the resulting pot of money - some of which may be to replicate e.g. higher tax on higher incomes). Once could possibly be a little smarter around e.g. a varying tax rate based on certain criteria. 22 Kind regards, \[1\] 23 From:Rahul Darbari Sent: Wednesday, 21 March 2018 7:19 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Capital Gains Tax and Property Tax Kia Ora, I would like to make the following suggestions on the capital gains tax on properties and discouraging or imposing a tax on foreigners to buy properties in NZ. NewZealand is a beautiful country with open minded and warm people. We need foreign capital to grow our economy and build infrastructure. We also want to make sure that our people are not marginalised because of rise in property prices and ideally we want a home for every family in the country. I would like to draw attention to the model of Singapore where I have lived for more than 14 years and worked in Financial Institutions Singapore in 2010-2012 saw rampant increase in property prices causing a lot of residents unable to buy their first property. This caused a lot of discontentment among the population. Singapore Govt then introduced the Seller's Stamp Duty and Buyer's Stamp duty to curb the speculative activities in the property market. The way it works is seller has to pay a duty if he sells the property within first 4 years of purchase. It is graded slab, maximum stamp duty is for sellers who sell their property in 1 year and it tapers off in 4years. So if a genuine investor who want to invest long term, he would not be affected but it will impose a heavy penalty in terms of taxes for speculators. Everyone( including residents ) has to pay that duty. This curbed the speculators who were looking to make a quick buck by buying and selling the properties. For Foreigners , Govt imposed ABSD Additional Buyers Stamp Duty ( In Singapore, every buyer has to pay 3 pct for buying a property). This duty was 10 pct for foreigners who were not residing in Singapore. This curbed a lot of speculative activities from foreigners The tax collected by Sellers Stamp Duty and Buyer's stamp duty can be utilised to build more houses and infrastructure and subsidise it for residents of NZ. There shall be earmarked fund which is formed by collection of these taxes and spend for housing needs of residents. The residents shall be mean tested before they can apply for getting a house in those projects. Capital Gains Tax on other investments like equities and other financial instruments I would strongly suggest that we shall not impose a tax on capital markets. We are a small economy and we don't save enough for our retirement and other needs. As a result govt spends a lot of money on elderly people to provide basic amenities. We shall encourage investments in our capital markets and encourage people to save for their retirement. The more people save, the less money would be required from Govt to support them in old age. This would allow people to build their nest for future. Just a brief introduction about myself : I have worked in Banks for last 15 years, based out of Singapore where I was global head of Standard Chartered FX Options and Global Head of ANZ FX & Precious metal derivatives.

Lynette Ellison \[1\] \[1\] 26 From:Pete Kemp Sent: Wednesday, 21 March 2018 3:20 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Capital Individuals with capital will naturally invest in whatever investment gives them the best return, in New Zealand that means (as a reflection of reality or perception, doesn't matter) property. This is a contributor to the unsustainable widening of the income to property value ratio. This type of investor is therefore enjoying tax free returns on any capital gain and is placing their capital in a non-productive segment of the economy. This capital is easily handed from generation to generation, keeping wealth concentrated in families, often from a limited set of socioeconomic groups. It is difficult for those who do not have such circumstances to break through the barriers to significant capital accumulation. This creates a disparity, an unfairness, between the pay-as-you-earn tax payer and the pay-nothing capital holder. Tax burden should be distributed in a way that sees income and capital gains in non-productive parts of the economy taxed evenly. Tax equality will enhance socioeconomic equality through improvements in real-incomes for those who need it. This supports a wider application of the property based capital gains tax - removing the current 'bright-line' test. The advantage of CGT over a land tax is again a question of fairness; the tax is taken when the gain is realised, not based on a valuation outside of the landholders control. The burden of an annual land tax will present another barrier to home ownership to those on a low-income. GST GST is applied to the purchasing population without differentiation of any kind. The tax on food (essential need) is at the same rate as a TV (a non-essential 'want'). A wealthy person is likely to spend a larger proportion of their income on non-essential items than a poorer person, meaning tax is weighted to work against those of lower income. These non-essential items are also often imported, hurting NZ's balance of trade. GST should be removed from food (excluding sugary drinks) as a reasonably straightforward solution to this problem. The practices of other countries can be used as examples here. It is acceptable for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact me. I am aware that my submission will be released on this website, with my email address withheld, and have noted the Official Information Act and privacy considerations that apply.

This would make for a more equitable society and provide many more benefits to both the tax payer and the Government. The current tax system is extraordinarily complicated, and any legal tax return can only be completed with the help of a professional. This I believe has made the system un-democratic. My submission is for the introduction of an across the board, fully automated transaction tax, where every transaction is automatically taxed (at a fixed percentage) through the banking system. GST would be withdrawn and all incomes at least at (and below) the personal average would be tax free. The tax would be deducted fr om the payer in each transaction. The fixed percentage of TTX must be kept as small as possible to avoid spooking the financial markets. A few things to note on what this would mean if such a system was introduced: -  Cash withdrawals will deemed to be a transaction.  Those opting to trade in cash would have to make TTX returns similar to GST now.  Those trading in bitcoins, livestock/machinery swaps and anything else other than the $NZ would need to make TTX returns.  All purchases, loans, loan repayments, interest payments, dividends, investment payments, payrolls etc will be subject to TTX.  Gambling and gifting would be taxed.  Payments for imports would be taxed. Export income would be TTX free.  Payments and transfers to overseas accounts would be taxed.  Markets would have more stability.  Money laundering will be reduced.  Tax avoidance will be reduced.  Non-residents making purchases in NZ from overseas accounts will have to pay an equivalent TTX to keep a level playing field with locals.  Some means would need to be found where tourists have their transactions taxed when using overseas credit cards.  User pay taxes can remain as needed. In conclusion I would like to emphasis that for a TTX to be successful (and acceptable) it must be automatic, simple and the percentage needs to be small and non-varying.

I am a tradesman and earn enough to support my wife and 5 children at home. Often my wage is described as below the poverty line but as non drinkers, non smokers and non gamblers we can afford everything we need except orthodontist care. But that is a red heering. I think our current tax system has significant areas that need improvement. Firstly having family support as a rebated benefit rather than a tax rebate creates extremely high marginal tax rates for working families. The tax on an extra dollar earned is 30% paye plus 30% family support rebate plus 6% ACC plus 15% GST. That creates a massive disincentive to work. Most tradies struggle to find workers who are willing to work longer hours if some time pressure is on. Make the family support back into a tax rebate and the effect is to lower the marginal tax rate significantly which will help fix the skill shortages without the negative effects of importing so called skilled workers. The people who miss out on their full family support entitlement because they don't earn enough are often the very people who need the most incentive to work. Due to bracket creep the level where the 30% tax rate starts is now the minimum wage if you work 6 days a week. I think a flatter lower tax rate would increase the tax take and boost the economy. Everyone being richer is not a bad thing even if some people gain more than others by working harder. Making income equality the goal rewards the lazy which makes them fat and unhealthy. Making things equitable or fair means that some people do better than others because they work harder and smarter. They then make good role models. I don't want you to overdose on common sense so I will sign off.

Regards Mark Wilkins \[1\] 34 From:Matt Paulin Sent: Tuesday, 20 March 2018 3:09 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission The current tax system is way too complex, providing loopholes and outs for many, especially larger companies and corporates. It takes way too many resources to administrate, which is wholly unproductive. It is incredibly inefficient to tax the general public, then provide some of that money back to those who need it to survive. So, it’s time to think out of the box. If, for example, we abolished PAYE, company taxes, and GST, how would we start with a clean slate? And a system with the lowest possible overheads to operate.. It seems to me that a flat rate, say 5%, on ALL financial transactions, no exceptions, would provide a larger tax base, more evenly spread, than what we currently have. We could regulate it, so the banks must take the 5% and pay it directly to the Government. They will complain, of course, but it its across the board for all banks wishing to operate in NZ, then they will comply. After all, it’s a simple calculation for a computer, and th e banks could easily incorporate this into their systems, whatever they say. If this were the case, there would be no need for virtually all of the IRD dept, except a few staff to ensure the banks follow the rules. This is a major cost saving to the Government. Accounting services for Business would be much easier, and reduce costs of doing business – no GST returns, no provisional or other tax, and no complicated wages with various tax rates to calculate. Yes, there would be a move towards a cash and black-market economy, but this could be addressed to a large extent by making the cash rate a bit higher (want to be paid in cash, maybe 7.5% for a cash deposit or withdrawal?). Most payment days are electronic anyway, so would be caught. Perhaps even a cashless society? No exceptions, for anyone. Simple is best, and fairest. Is this not a least worth consideration?

Whatever changes are made to the tax system will not affect me for long as I am already in my seventies, but they will affect my children and my grandchildren. So please accept my comments as those from a disinterested individual, albeit one with some training in economics and one with a lifetime’s experience of governments and politics in many different countries. 1. While government budgets are always under pressure, much of the pressure is generated by ever- increasing costs and ever-increasing demands to help the less fortunate. Of course we should support those who cannot help themselves, either mentally or physically – no question. However “the poor are always with us”. In this country there are third generation unemployed and 92,000 young people between the ages of 18-25 are unemployed and are not in any form of training. It is quite wrong that hard-working tax-paying New Zealanders are forced to support these people who are not prepared to work for themselves. The third generation unemployed, for example, get the same superannuation as those who have paid tax all their lives, even though they have never done a day’s work. The inequity of this situation will be obvious to any thinking person. 2. The tax system must be set up in such a way as to give every encouragement to those who want to work. Taxing all income from the first dollar earned gives little incentive to those who want to get ahead. As an employer of 23 years’ experience in this country I was always saddened by the very high deductions that I had to make from employees’ wages for PAYE. 3. There are thousands of small businesses in New Zealand that have to pay the same company tax rates as the big corporates. Company taxes for all businesses should be substantially reduced to a flat rate. The result will be a massive boost to the economy as companies will be able to pay better wages and take on more staff to expand in due course. Just look at the immediate difference to the US economy in the wake of a substantial reduction to the company tax rate. In popular parlance this is a “no-brainer”. 4. The New Zealand Government, of whatever stripe, needs to undertake a comprehensive review of how it spends the tax-payer’s money. At present all political parties have been content to look at the ever- increasing demands and just raise taxes to try to balance the books. This is quite wrong. There is huge waste in government spending. Concentration on provi sion of essential services and rigid efficiency must be the way ahead. Government spending must be substantially reduced - and with the right people in charge it would not be difficult. As an aside there are too many levels of government here and far too many civil servants contributing very little. 5. This country was built by hard-working men and women who took responsibility for themselves and their families, people who did not need a “nanny state’ to tell them what to do or to spend their hard-earned money for them. While it may not be possible to turn the clock back that far, the Tax Working Group should seize this opportunity to revise Government spending sharply downwards, roll-back the tax take allowing those who work to keep more of what they make and provide incentives for the voluntary beneficiaries to provide for themselves – a hand up not a hand out. 6. Should you have difficulty with any of the foregoing I would be delighted to explain it to you in person.

Tax policy is primarily about gathering revenue in a fair and equitable manner without destroying the incentives for wealth creation. Social objectives should not be confused with revenue raising rather any proposed social objectives should be debated separately under appropriate government spending initiatives. The New Zealand tax base as a percentage of GDP is currently too high and programmes should be pursued to lower it to a target level of ~ 25%. Most developed and democratic countries around the world are pursuing policies to lower tax rates and this should be seen as a priority for this Group.

Chis Hawkes \[1\] 42 From:Kerry Hart Sent: Tuesday, 20 March 2018 7:37 AM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Subject:Submission on Tax Reform I have serious concerns about the direction that the Working Group is taking because of the following: 1. Everything that the Working Group is doing is underpinned by the chairman’s belief that those people on the right are “rich pricks” and therefore his philosophy will shape the outcomes of the review so the recommendations are going to be highly political, favouring the supporters of Labour (a minority in parliament). 2. Wealth redistribution should be carried out through the policies of the elected government after strong debate in the House, where it can be scrutinised and the representatives of the people have a say in its final shape. As a person who has worked extremely hard all my life I totally object to the wealth that those endeavours have produced being taken off me and given to those people who are not willing to work at all but sit on their bums on Queen St and put their hand out to passersby. There is plenty of work in this country that is available to them if they change their attitude, clean themselves up, get off the addictive substances and act responsibly. Government spending needs to be kept at or lower than 25% of GDP and taxation needs to encourage citizens to put in the hard graft to earn that income that is taxed. That will be achieved by lowering taxes not increasing them. 3. This paper indicates that there will be additional taxes that will be introduced by stealth. Over the years, tax reviews have eliminated sales tax, excess retention tax, land tax, estate duty, stamp duty, gift duty and cheque duty; and they have rejected financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes, and capital gains taxes. However, under the guise of public concern about inequality, Chairman Cullen now intends reversing the trend, by politicising and complicating the tax system: “The tax system can play a major role in combating inequality both through taxing people with higher incomes at higher rates, and through redistribution and spending.” It is obvious that the goal of the review is to find new ways of increasing taxes to pay for higher levels of Government spending and so the level of taxation will need to increase. That is not the objective of tax reform. Any thinking person knows that a good tax system should be simple, with a broad base and as few exemptions and incentives as possible, Dr Cullen wants the system to become more redistributive, business taxes to become progressive, Maori to be given further tax breaks, and he wants to see a raft of new taxes introduced, including environmental taxes and taxes designed to change people’s behaviour. 4. I find the current tax regime that gives Maori tax breaks totally repugnant because it is racist . Why should the ”Maori economy” get benefits that non-Maori can’t? Michael Cullen’s Labour Government not only introduced the discounted Maori Authority business tax rate (now 17.5 percent), but also changed the law to enable billion-dollar tribal corporations to register as charities and avoid paying tax. This anomaly - which gives wealthy Maori businesses a significant competitive advantage - must be rectified, by requiring corporate profits not used for charitable purposes to be t axed at the normal rate. My concern is that additional tax benefits and exemptions are being planned that will further entrench racism in tax laws, instead of eliminating racism. Maori have been handed out billions of taxpayer dollars - why do they need a further handout. The treaty settlements haven’t made a tad of difference to their failures, shown by their continuing high representation in all of the worst social statistics. 5. I totally disagree with the view that income inequality needs to be addressed by any government. If the Working Group takes the attitude that a fair society is one where everyone \[1\] \[1\] 43 earns the same regardless of effort and skill then we are looking at a communist state driven by Karl Marx philosophies. What is fair about rewarding somebody who hasn’t taken the time and effort to get a decent education and using that to lift themselves by their own bootstraps? What is fair about taking away earnings from the diligent and conscientious and giving it to those who couldn’t be bothered paying attention at school, getting a good job, putting in extra hours to get ahead, taking risks in business? Fairness is recognising that this country has been built by those people who put everything on the line and worked incredibly hard to succeed. Any attempt to take away the fruits of those endeavours will cause a huge backlash I promise you.

The argument, usually re Capital Gains Tax, that “all other countries do it” confounds me. Does no one recognise that being different from “everybody else” can be shaped to advantage for the country’s growth and prosperity. One theme might be to attract smart innovative people to live here to do technical or medical research capitalising on our first-world infrastructure, attractive living conditions, liberal sensible politics, good education system, and protected natural environment. An important added incentive could be the advantage of local commercialisation of original work under an established tradition of NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX. 2. The best example of Michael Cullen’s narrow, I would almost say vindictive, mentality is embodied in his “Fair Dividend Rate” on offshore equities.

This will take more than simply encouraging a furniture-building industry in the interest of ‘adding value’ to our timber exports. Kind regards, David Weikart \[1\] \[1\] 45 From:Matthew Newman Sent: Tuesday, 20 March 2018 5:59 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Good morning I wish to make a brief statement with respect to the tax working group established by this new government 1. It’s evident from the government’s brief and subsequent comments from the chairman of the working group, that a range of new taxes are a ‘fait accompli’ . So the term ‘review’ is somewhat disingenuous . 2. The range of new tax es which will be recommended by this group, will doubtless, be presented at very low levels, initially, so as not to scare the electorate. Those of us capable of looking beyond one electoral cycle know once in place, future governments will readily lift rates to satisfy their desire to increase spending, in their forlorn attempt to address any number of real, or imaginary societal ills 3. I am concerned that the proposed ceiling for government activity at 30% of GDP is too high. By its very nature, much of government spending lacks accountability, as its not ‘personal money’ . I would encourage an alternative perspective, which focuses on accountability and efficiency, rather the soft option of continuing to raid the long suffering tax payer of his or her hard earned income and as now proposed, wealth 4. A brief comment on the prospect of expanded environmental taxes, in particular, carbon. Be assured that no amount of taxation will influence climate or the weather . Sadly the net result of such taxes will be ‘waste on an unprecedented scale’. Neither the tax working group, this government nor me, will be here to witness the onerous consequences of such waste 5. With respect to water, the tax working group should be acutely aware that the imposition of a broadly based tax or levy on the commercial use of water will inevitably trigger a significant new treaty claim, with its potential for further expansion of divisions in society. Similarly, in the attempt to ‘punish’ commercial enterprises for their use of water, be very aware of the law of ‘unintended consequences’, including risks to future productive investment. Also be aware, business’ increased costs will be passed on to the consumer by way of higher prices. 6. Lastly, for any new taxes proposed, I would encourage the tax working group to recommend reductions to taxation elsewhere in the system, so as to, firstly, limit the impact of such taxes on the community, and, secondly, signal the importance of efficiency and accountability as essential precepts in effective government. I would like to be heard on this submission and can be contracted on my cell phone number Matthew Newman March 20th 2018 Chs \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 46 Matthew Newman CEO South Auckland Motors/CEO Southern Autos - Manukau 47 From:Rick Cameron Sent: Tuesday, 20 March 2018 3:56 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Team, If considering a capital gains tax, inflation should be a legitimate offset expense as should be a capital loss and their credits claimed.

The future of tax to me looks like it rewards those who work hard with less tax % deducted from wages AND with more of these $$ going toward rewarding those who work i.e. creating an environment where not working is not an option! 2. The purpose of tax is to pay for core community services that reward those, who pay it, with a better quality of life and also cover the cost’s of those who legitimately cannot work 3. Taxing the right things? – we pay enough tax we don’t need to be taxing anymore things! We especially don’t need to be taxing any gains we’ve made using our already taxed income to make these gains! Initially we’ve foregone the enjoyment of spending the invested $$ in hope of it paying off later i.e greater reward down the track. Paying tax twice for this just isn’t on! 4. Tax will not make the housing market more affordable just make less homes available to the market. Besides it hasn’t worked in other countries. 5. Tax issues that matter most – health, social order, quality community services, creating a tax environment where tax rewards those who work hard by taxing them less for their efforts With Kind Regards Jarred \[1\] 50 From:Chris Steptoe Sent: Sunday, 18 March 2018 4:36 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Business tax submission Hi, This submission is to encourage business to continue to hire people (as opposed to investing in automation). I see a large proportion of the working population that are at risk of automation. Where companies are competing at a national level (e.g. Retail, call centres, tansportation), capex that is automation related should not be eligable as a taxable expense. This will either encourage companies to keep using humans or provide the government with additional tax to provide a saftey net for these individuals. Where companies are selling goods overseas, this tax rule would not apply. An example of automation is the self service checkouts or robots that stack shelves at super markets. The capex (depreciation) for these machine would not be a taxable expense. As all supermarkets in NZ are on a level playing (ie. not competing with overseas), this would not make the supermarkets less competitive. It may possible make the supermarkets less profitable, but in the long run, it is important that all citizens are able to contribute to society by having a job. Kind Regards, Chris \[1\] 51 From: Sen t: Saturday, 17 March 2018 6:48 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I suspect a submission on tax change will be nothing but a farce if the submissions do not line up with the already decided agenda. A quick perusal of 'the questions to be answered' does not allow for the free interchange of ideas and opinions. I hold much doubt that what I have to submit will make a difference but I take this opportunity to voice my opinion. The perception of those 'that have not' seems to be that... it is the fault of 'those that have' This appears to be the opinion of the politicians also. Most of the 'haves' own their own home. Have what they consider necessary and are able to afford what some may consider are 'luxury items'. As such things are unattainable by the 'have nots', these 'haves' are somehow blame for the plight of the 'have nots'. Life is all about choice. Consider this. Choices are made not only this year, nor just the last decade but through the whole of life ....and is the reason for 'the haves' perceived wealth. Installed in the psych of generations past was the need to be responsible. Perhaps they were fortunate in that with no such thing as welfare, the base from which they, \[most of them\] sprang from was....although not apparent at the time.... was of great benefit. The depression WW1 and WW2 made that generation the responsible people they are today. There was no 'sense of entitlement' back then. The taxes paid by them built New Zealand's infrastructure. Taxes were high, no one complained. Laziness was frowned on as was accepting charity. There was absolutely no sense of entitlement or grievance. about one's plight....but now, there is. That should change, must change and throwing more and more money via broadening the tax base will do nothing but divide. Govt. policy should aim at encouragement to attain but it is my observation that Govtt governments policy instead encourages discontent. What needs to be realized is that those that have strived to have a little above the pension will find quitting the industry an attractive option and who could blame them with the proposed changes in NZ? Clobber them, via more taxes and what will happen to the many in need of houses? Australia offers a far better choice. Considering the damage caused to rental property via 'methamphetamine' damage and in some cases just downright disgusting behavior by some of those that are at this time being championed as needy and homeless. It seems the proposed tax changes is encouragement enough to flee the country. Exiting honest taxpayers will leave, leaving this govt with the burden of those responsible for huge welfare payouts, many who are where they are because of poor choices. Beryl Curreen \[1\] \[1\] 52 From:Chris Rapson Sent: Saturday, 17 March 2018 2:11 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submissions which do not fit under the "five key questions" To whom it may concern, The following are a collection of thoughts and opinions related to the ideas raised by my reading of the Tax Working Group's background paper. As they did not fit well under the "five key questions" format, I submit them below as a free-form submission. The simplicity of NZ's tax system is a huge advantage. Please keep things that way (i.e. no exemptions to GST, no progressive corporate tax rate). In some cases, I believe the system could even be simplified, and it would be beneficial to do so: - there should be no exemptions on carbon tax, as is currently the case for dairy. (I am relatively ambivalent on whether it should be a carbon tax or a cap-and-trade system.) - while I have not dealt with the spending or "transfers" side of the ledger directly, benefit payments seem to be incredibly complex. This is an attempt to improve fairness, but may actually achieve the opposite by making it hard for those in need to receive what the need and are entitled to. Obviously, it also drives up costs. I would welcome a higher priority on enforcement of existing laws. Tax fraud costs the country far more than benefit fraud, but enforcement seems to be relatively under-resourced. New technology should make it far easier to process large amounts of data to identify cases which need further investigation (keywords: big data, machine learning). Aspects of tax on foreign income seems unfair e.g. gains from forex fluctuations or share value increases are taxed but losses are not. Gains/losses as well as foreign/domestic income should be treated consistently. I am generally in favour of stamp duty (or tax on transfer of property ownership). Even a small (e.g. 1-2%) tax would be a valuable source of revenue, would be simple to collect, would not distort the market and would discourage speculation. However I accept that this will not be popular in NZ society at this time. Since local rates are already effectively a land tax, I think it would be redundant for central government to add a similar levy. Yours Sincerely, Dr. Chris Rapson \[1\] 53 From:Chris Rapson Sent: Saturday, 17 March 2018 1:44 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to "Are we taxing the right things?" The following was intended as a submission to the question "Are we taxing the right things?" However it exceeded the 1000 character limit. I feel strongly that exempting Capital Gains from taxation is extremely inequitable. Capital Gains Tax should apply to any asset appreciation, including shares and the "family home". Exclusions will lead to loopholes. I do not see how it is fair to differentiate between money obtained from a wage or salary, and money obtained by selling an asset for more than it was bought for. If anything, an individual should have less right to money from arbitrage than what is earned by working. Since a capital gains can be accumulated over many years and then realised at one time, it is likely to have large year-to- year fluctuations, which make it not well suited to a progressive tax system. A flat rate is more appropriate. The increase in value which is the basis for a CGT can be compared to the "value added" which is the basis for GST. This suggests to me that GST should be the benchmark rate for CGT i.e. 15%. If CGT is not charged at a flat rate, then it should be ring-fenced. It is difficult to define which assets should be subject to CGT. As noted above, my preference would be for all land, buildings and shares to be included. Otherwise the tax revenue should be balanced against compliance costs, either by class or by de minimus. Offshore assets should be subject to CGT and double tax agreements, as is the case for income tax. The reverse should be true for non-residents, i.e. assets in NZ should be taxed at NZ rates (perhaps a reduced non-resident rate) with the remainder subject to tax in their country of residence. Kiwisaver should be subject to CGT. Roll-over relief would be an unnecessary complication. Since new tax laws should not penalise decisions made before the laws were in place, CGT should only apply to purchases made after it is passed into law (post introduction). As a compromise, the valuation at the date of inception could be used, however this would add significant costs. Wealth Tax would be an extremely effective measure against inequality. Although it is out of scope for this review, I still think that the easiest form of wealth tax would be an estate tax/inheritance tax/death tax. This would have to be combined with a gift tax, otherwise wealth transfer would simply be achieved by gift. People should not feel entitled to money which they have not earned. Of course, the tax should not give wealthy people too much incentive to move their wealth offshore, and providing for their children should still be a strong motivation for people to work hard. I believe a relatively moderate 5% flat rate would be appropriate. CGT and estate tax should be revenue neutral, i.e. compensated by a reduction in personal income tax. \[1\] 54 From:Mark Hubbard Sent: Saturday, 17 March 2018 12:49 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission - Tax working group: abolish RWT on interest income & reinstate child rebate. Submission to the Tax Working Group. 16 March 2018 To the Members of the Committee. It will be pointless me advocating less tax and the need for a smaller state to this committee, so I won’t try. I long ago realised that society is once again on the road to its big state serfdom (this iteration via taxation, securities, and our monstrously expensive and intrusive anti-money laundering legislation), and that individuals like myself with the quaint belief that freedom is an end unto itself are a dying breed whose graves will soon enough be jackbooted over by these awful social justice warrior clowns demanding their entitled ransom of flesh from the free and self-reliant... which brings me back to tax. The only point I would ‘plea’ for among the otherwise damage you will be recommending, is the abolition of resident withholding tax (RWT) on interest income. A decade after the GFC we have had central banks around the world, including RBNZ, move us to command economies whereby in an act of insane hubris bureaucrats have destroyed the price discovery of free markets by commanding for themselves the pricing of that most basic commodity of all: money. Worse, over this decade they immorally decided to price money, via interest, artificially low to grow historic speculatory asset bubbles in financial assets, including property, at the expense of, and the sacrifice of, prudent savers such as myself and the elderly, whom wisely won’t touch these stimulunatic markets – modern portfolio theory be damned – and have confined ourselves to term deposit investments in investment grade banks, (having also learned from the junk grade finance company collapses pre- 2008): this investment strategy has been made costly for us. All my wife and I savings are in such deposits that were saved almost solely from our earnings over the last 30 years on which we both paid the top personal rates of tax. Now we are effectively being taxed a second time on those same earnings, and we are the investor class earning least of everyone: why are conservative, and in our case, high tax paying people, the ones being victimised by the state through this immorally disproportionate burden of tax? My wife is adamant our returns are so ludicrous we may as well just drink our bloody savings. And we are, to some extent, doing that, despite the cost due to the excise taxes on alcohol – (side-line note, taxing fun is pathetic, and Mr Cullen’s stated aim on using the tax system to change lifestyle choices is totalitarian. Not on at all.) Not only do we need a microscope to see our real return on investment, which across all our PIE deposits is currently 0.15% after tax and inflation, but the RWT thus plays havoc with the otherwise magic of compounding – (noting at least we have PIEs to cap our tax at 28%, but that is still over a quarter of our measly interest income). Further, people like myself look at farmers growing hugely rich on tax free capital gains in land they’ve filled with shit ponds, due in big part to this decade’s cheap funny-money credit, and at perhaps one in twenty share traders/investors paying tax on capital gains in their NZX/ASX sharemarket investments, and are justifiably pissed off at RBNZ having sacrificed our returns to the speculators of this loose monetary policy from the asylum. Albeit, please note, the answer is not to tax their wealth, which is communist: the answer is to stop taxing my wealth, thereby punishing myself and my wife, and fellow \[ \[1\] 55 savers, for taking conservative, prudent investment decisions. The financial world currently is turned on its head, and is lunatic, frankly. Given savings are the powerhouse of properly functioning free economies – and okay we are far from those with the lunacy we’ve seen of QE (every governor of the BOJ should be in a straitjacket) – it defies sense for any government to tax and disincentivise such saving. We need to encourage saving, but for the reasons given above, given such pathetic interest rates, RWT on top of inflation makes prudent investment imprudent, and I suspect many elderly have been forced to move their term deposits into inappropriate riskier class assets which will, on the coming Great Collapse of Keynesian economics and this laughable price stability by central banking, be beyond sad. It will be tragic for them. Many would not have made this switch, had they been left with the tax deducted from their interest income - it could have made all the difference. And that’s it, other than one final point, small, but necessarily symbolic of the free society over the command state we voted in at the emoting booth: reinstate the child rebate that the miserable bastards in National cancelled; let a kid do a paper round without being fleeced by an out-of-control state and allowed to live with the illusory vision of a free life and volition up until at least their late teens.

My idea is a simple deduction of tax from every dollar earned at source regardless whether the entity is an individual or a business. The Reserve Bank would be responsible for collection of the taxes. The Inland Revenue would not be needed because tax returns would be unnecessary. There would be no need for tax claims. Under the counter deals would not escape tax payments because the money they bargain with would have already been taxed at source. GST should be abolished as total tax collected should increase substantially because no one would escape paying tax. Pensions, share dividends and all business transactions will still pay a tax. I believe that stages of income limits should pay stages of tax fair to the income earned. Eg $1 to $100,000 pays 15 cents in the dollar; $100,001 to $250,000 pays 20 cents in the dollar, and $250,001 on pays 25 cents in the dollar. You may consider different rates and even an exempt rate for the poor. This system would eliminate all tax evasion. Businesses and entities employing personnel would be required to channel payments through the Reserve Bank for taxing and return to the payees bank accounts so no tax evasion can take place. Furthermore, If we had a cashless society, the drug dealers could have problems.

The ACC is not an insurance scheme. It is a statutory legal system introduced in 1974 to replace the common law right of accident victims to sue to recover damages for their injuries. The Woodhouse Report, following the principle of community re sponsibility, recommended funding the ACC scheme by a flat levy rate based on a percentage of the national payroll. The levy would be collected by IRD under the normal tax collection provisions. This recommendation was never adopted and variable risk based levies have been struck each year for different industries prescribed by regulation. The levies payable on this risk based principle, is a form of compulsory tax collected in advance by the ACC. In 1998 the then Minister for ACC the Hon Nick Smith, persuaded his colleagues and the public, that the ACC was running out of money and it was necessary to build up reserves to pay the ongoing cost of current claims. That is clearly an insurance principle based on the fact that insurance companies sometimes go out of business leaving the ongoing cost of claims to be dealt with from a premium reserve. The then government also decreed that each account should be fully funded. The result has been that the ACC has accumulated reserves which, according to the 2017 Annual Report, now total over $36 billion. These funds are managed by an investment committee of the ACC which prides itself of regularly exceeding the financial industries investment bench mark. The funding system has meant that over the last 20 years, $36 billion has been withdrawn from the economy for investment by the ACC . Since the ACC is a Crown Entity the funds are regarded as “government funds” and feature in the Government Accounts. They must be invested as if the Corporation was a trustee and are invested in a number of areas both in New Zealand and overseas. ACC is now one of the largest investors in the NZ Stock exchange next to the Superannuation Fund. It is important that the TWG does not ignore ACC levies, a compulsory tax which has a direct impact on employers and the income of the self-employed and earners.

We need a Congestion Tax on car’s so people use public transport or move house to where they work. You also have a great chance to improve congestion and the use of public transport in NZ. Especially in Auckland where it costs the country Billions of dollars. Have congestion charges on motorways and regular tolls along the motorways and busy routes for the users to pay the cost of this. And that will actually push more people into using Public Transport. This improves road conditions by reducing traffic where there are congestion problems, increases use of public transport. And provides funds for general taxation and to improve public transport, or subsidise it. Help the workers. My submission on Land Tax is that we already have a Land Tax or Capital Tax. And that is “Council Rates” which go up significantly each year and pay for a lot of services throughout New Zealand. This is a tax on land owners that is paid whether they are a true investor or a speculator. That hurts investors more than speculators, as they are not trying to make a profit, just hold and flip for x amount of years. So a new Land Tax would kill investors, but not really hurt speculators. What you should have is a robust capital gains tax on speculators, in addition to the Bright Line test. You should have a Capital Gains tax on Speculators who hold a rental properties with the real intention of just selling them to make a capital gain and huge profit in the short and medium term. It takes about 10 years for a rental property to start making any sort of return. The Bright Line test increased from 2 to 5 years is excellent, and will stop some Speculators, especially Chinese funded (through NZ residents) speculators. Have a Capital Gains Tax for Speculators who hold for 2 to 5 years and then sell in that 5 to 10 year gap, maybe even up to 15 or 20. Have it at a lower more reasonable rate so it’s not too onerous to pay, and you won’t have the accountants working overtime on avoidance methods and loop holes. But for the true investor who pass’s his rental properties on to his children. I would make sure that is not treated as a sale, if done correctly through a trust system. You should also make sure that Overseas Buyers are not able to buy houses in NZ as per this new rule coming in. But you should let them be able to buy land and build houses. As then overseas money will help the supply of houses in NZ, which is a win win. Making them sell them, as per current legislation, will kill the usefulness of this new law. Other changes to tax etc:  Ramp up the tax on anti-social goods that cost the country money, such as junk food, cigarettes, and alcohol, and petrol.  Implement a zero tax schedule on a core basic food items to help poor people – Bread, Rice, Flower, Margarine, Milk, apples, Potatoe’s, Seeds, Fishing lines etc.  Implement a sugar tax and a strong tax on junk food such as Coke and other fizzy drinks. \[1\] 60  Make medical marijuana legal and collect the tax from that.  Tax on share trading – why on earth do they not pay tax  Tax on all imported products  Supply people on govt support with seeds to grow vegetables and fishing line instead of money  Instead of planting 100 million native tree’s each year – plant fruit tree’s close to or in towns, within half an hours bike ride.

An amount that a person derives from disposing of personal property is income of the person if they acquired the property for the purpose of disposing of it. Defined in this Act: amount, income, personal property Compare: 2004 No 35 s CB 3 Dear Sir Background I am a chartered accountant in public practice and have been so since 1996. My firm files approximately 3000 tax returns every year and has done so for the last 20 years. I am a life member of the Auckland Property Investors association having served as its treasurer for 10 years. I am the author of the book, Property Tax in New Zealand an investor’s guide. My Submission. My submission focuses on the inconsistent approach of taxation of speculative transactions in New Zealand’s taxation system and the selective enforcement of existing law. Legislation. Sections CB4 expressly tax gains from sale of personal property where property is acquired for disposal. Section CB5 extends this to those in the business of speculating in personal property. Sections CB6 – CB 15 contains similar provisions dealing specifically with land. My Observation Personal property includes shares and equities. In recent times we have seen significant resourcing of IRD to enforce the existing law as it relates to land, specifically , the legislation contained in CB6 – CB 15. This saw significant increases in government funding announced in successive budgets that was directed specifically to enforcement of tax law relating to land. This resourcing even enabled the IRD to establish the “property compliance division” which was a team focused specifically on enforcement of laws designed to tax speculation in the property market. The increased focus on “ land” seems to have been driven principally by a political concern over rising property prices and in an environment where no capital gains tax existed, enforcement of the existing law was given priority. The intense focus on the enforcement of the land tax rules though sits in stark contrast to the complete lack of enforcement of sections CB4 and CB5 that tax speculative gains in the stock market. \[1\] 62 In twenty years as a tax practitioner filing 3000 returns per year I can never recall ever having had a client called to account for tax on a speculative transaction in the share market. Not one ! The equity markets function to enable quick and easy purchase and sale of stocks and shares and as such facilitate and make possible a culture of rampant speculation that is far more extensive and fluid than anything in the property sector. Whilst participants in the stock market may include those that purchase purely for dividend yield there is a significant portion that care little for dividend yield and participate purely on a speculative basis. Yet virtually none of the income that should be declared on these speculative transactions in personal property under CB 4 and CB 5 is ever declared and no enforcement of these provisions is undertaken. A quick review of the volumes of transactions flowing through the NZX and observations on the volatility in the market to external shock factors paints a picture of widespread speculation and accumulation of wealth through this speculation yet no enforcement of tax on these gains is undertaken. Reflect for a moment on the manner in which fund managers of stock and share portfolios are remunerated and the contrast with their colleagues in the property sector. Fund managers fees are typically charged as a percentage of funds under management, so as the value of funds under management increases so to do the fees the manager generates. Their fees are not linked at all to the dividends their funds generate. By contrast a property managers fees are generated relative to the rental income they collect from the asset and are not impacted by the movement in the assets capital value. The point being that the way the entire fund management sector operates is to place emphasis on the increasing capital value of the shares under management which in turn promotes and rewards speculation in the sector, but despite this, tax law that taxes these gains is universally ignored and not enforced. One might ask , why ? We now have a specific bright line test of 2 now 5 years to remove the ambiguity of “intent” at acquisition from the taxation of land transactions but yet we have no such bright line test to strengthen the CB 4 taxing provisions that require declaration of speculative gains from the stock market. Why ? Taxpayers can rightfully conclude that the government seems only interested in taxing one type of speculative transaction, land, and that this can only be because land is politically problematic but this seems to then undermine the tax system and allows different outcomes for speculation in shares than can be expected from speculation in property. Conclusion The intense political spotlight on the price of residential property has led to a targeted enforcement of tax laws that are designed to tax speculation in the property sector. I submit that these enforcement measures have been very successful and that there is now a very high degree of compliance with tax law across the property sector. I believe this sits in stark contrast to taxation of speculative gains in the equities sector, presumably because increasing equity values that are in part driven up by speculative behavior are not politically problematic. I submit though that taxation of all speculative transactions under existing law should be enforced with an even hand and this is not occurring currently. This leads to taxpayers becoming cynical about the taxation system and how it is used, is it being properly used to generate the revenue needed to fund government expenditure or is it simply being used as a political lever to alter certain behaviors and achieve political outcomes ? I ask that the working group consider the fact that existing laws that tax speculative transactions are not enforced consistently or fairly and that the bias toward property speculation is causing vast tracts of taxable income from speculation in the share market to go undeclared and that this lackluster or “cherry picking” approach to enforcement potentially undermines the fairness of the systems and the perception that the system is not equitably administered. 63 So as the working group seeks to examine even more initiatives designed to tax the property sector, like land taxes for instance, spare a though for all the speculation in other sectors that goes untaxed and what perception that lack of enforcement creates for those that actually seek to comply with all of our existing tax law. Ask yourselves also why we would seek to introduce a capital gains tax that would presumably include capital gains on stocks and shares when we are not willing now to enforce existing law that imposes taxation on speculative gains on personal property that includes shares and equities.

Thanks Don’t stuff it up Michael. I am 57 years old and the place I am working at is closing down, which is the second time this has happened to me. I have white hair, don’t sleep well because of the surgical menopause and I am stiff and sore, possibly from going to the gym and golfing too much. My fault, I accept that. I look rich because I own a house worth a lot and h ave savings in the bank as well as a bit of KiwiSaver. But I’m actually up shit creek because my money earns next to nothing in the bank, even the one owned by New Zealanders. I have several university degrees but from here on in I could be earning the minimum wage. I have a lot of expenses. These include a very expensive dog – have you seen what vets charge? I also have to pay for healthcare because even though I have had cancer twice the public system has chucked me out. My GP only refers privately so I am saving a bit of money currently by not bothering to go to see her. Because I am fat I find the pretentious doctors trained at the Otago Medical School look down on me and will only treat me if I pay. They seem hell bent on Americanising the New Zealand health system. Nice for them but not so nice for patients. My plan is to rent my house out and live in either a very cheap house in the middle of nowhere or in a motorhome for the eight years until I qualify for super. At the age of 65 I expect to be living the life of larry on $315 a week. It should easily cover the $750 for rates and $750 for insurances that went out of my account last week. That happens every three months. So my “home” will be used to support me to get through to retirement and I won’t be living in it. I look comfortably off but I’m not. \[1\] 65 Don’t stuff it up Michael. 66 From:Dharan Longley Sent: Friday, 16 March 2018 10:15 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Nelson Hello I’m 66 years of age, and despite receiving Super (which I’m grateful for, despite being inadequate to live on), I need to continue working to earn enough to live. As an ordinary NZ'er who has worked hard and put savings into one extra property as a nest egg to supplement Super, it is absolutely essential that whatever outcome the Tax Working Group decides, that it DOES NOT tax ordinary Kiwi’s minimal extra assets like one or two rental properties. Any extra tax should be on those who have such excess that it won’t affect their ability to survive financially. Tax the wealthy, on high incomes, NOT the large majority of us who just want enough to live comfortably in retirement. Its about fairness and genuinely supporting people. Adding new taxes just discourages savings and investment. We are already taxed excessively. PAYE plus GST is too much. The government needs to provide tax cuts for young NZ’ers so they can have hope that they can own a home, not be burdened for most of their lives paying off student debts and just managing. With a government tax revenue of $78.2B this year and projected $93B in 2021, the government CAN afford to reduce ordinary kiwi’s tax and actually support our people to have a comfortable life, not a more ‘taxing' one. And it is right that you consult widely, not just ”interest groups”, such as those who want to maximise their tax avoidance through loopholes. I warmly recommend you place ads in all major newspapers, and organise road shows where Kiwis are invited to attend and express their views, to alert us that our views are valued, will be listened to, and more importantly acted upon, and that they can make a submission. Thank you Dharan Longley \[1\] \[1\] 67 From:Susan Davis Sent: Friday, 16 March 2018 10:17 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Fwd: GCT and/or Land Tax is Sexist, Ageist and Will Destroy Relationships I had not heard about the abysmal "value capture" tax when I put in my original submission. ( "This is a process under which a special tax is levied on property owners deemed to have benefited from the building of infrastructure." https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/102122026/finance-minister-grant- robertson-considering-property-value-capture-tax-to-fund-rail) Please add this to my submission: 7. A Value Capture Tax will drive people from their homes Only income should be taxed, because low-earning home owners, including pensioners, would not be earning more just by happening to own a property 'deemed to' have higher value, and could be driven out of their homes by higher rates or tax. If landlords are earning more rent due to better infrastructure, then they will automatically be paying more tax from the rental income. As an area will gradually gain higher density from being nearer a transport hub it will also gain more rates without having to hit locals with a 'value capture' tax. Regards, Susan Davis ---------- Forwarded message ---------- From: Susan Davis Date: Tue, Mar 6, 2018 at 3:39 PM Subje ct: GCT and/or Land Tax is Sexist, Ageist and Will Destroy Relationships To: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz 1. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses is SEXIST and AGEIST. 2. CGT or Land Tax in home businesses destroys Auckland's aim of reduced commuting. 3. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses will destroy relationships. 4. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments or 'wealth' is really taxing inflation and discourages people from saving for retirement. 5. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments is AGEIST. 6. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments will destroy relationships. Introduction If developers or speculators aren't paying their tax (already required by current tax \[1\] \[1\] 68 laws), the bill should not be picked up by small investors, home business business people and 'Mum and Dad' rental property owners who have worked hard and scrimped and saved for retirement. In the past Labour has threatened CGT for home businesses despite the claim that family homes are exempt (see evidence at end of this email). A Land Tax would be even worse: a huge annual fee, not feasible for many small home business and rental property owners. A Land Tax on top of rates would also be a very unfair double dipping Property Tax. Auckland City Council has now stated that rates are really Property Tax: I quote Debbie Acott, Radio NZ 21 November 2017 said that rates are "basically a property tax," and that Aucklanders "wouldn't get any extra services." Many small home businesses will close or instead rent commercial spaces and commute to them. Many small home business owners can't earn enough to make up for huge Land Tax or so called 'capital gains', which are really just housing inflation anyway. Encourage long-term small rental and shares investors who have tried to save up for retirement. Don't punish them for working hard, saving and investing over the years. 1. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses is SEXIST and AGEIST. Small home businesses are often run by women and by people in semi-retirement. Charging CGT or land tax on small home businesses will prevent many women and semi-retired people from starting a business. Such a tax would be extremely sexist and ageist. 2. CGT or Land Tax in home businesses destroys Auckland's aim of reduced commuting. Working from home policies are part of Auckland’s Draft City Plan. However, Land Tax or CGT on home businesses will destroy Auckland's aims of reduced commuting, as people will be discouraged from working from home. 3. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses will destroy relationships. There will be serious disputes between spouses/partners if one wishes to start a home business and the other may resist if Land Tax and CGT are threatened. 4. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments or 'wealth' is really taxing inflation and discourages people from saving for retirement. 69 A house in 2018 is no better than it was in 1990 - worse, in fact. The so-called 'capital gain' is nothing but inflation. If someone's home business property or rental investment has to be sold, they should be able to afford to buy a similar property, but if CGT is charged, they won't be able to. Long term rental property owners are often small 'Mum and Dad' investors, including retirees have no way of paying annual Land Tax from the rental returns, when just maintenance and rates are difficult enough. And a CGT upon sale would mean that they would never be able to buy a similar property. The same will apply to so-called 'wealth'. There are already extremely low returns on investments. Charging on so-called 'capital gain' is really just taxing inflation. 5. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments is AGEIST. Small rental property holdings are the way many middle-aged and elderly Kiwis have invested. Charging Land Tax or CGT on these will deprive them of their retirement income. 6. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments will destroy relationships. Two people each owning a home may wish to live together, while renting out the other home. But if CGT and Land Tax would then be charged on one of the homes, many middle-aged and older people wishing to live together may well decide that they can't afford to do so. Regards, Susan Davis Evidence that Labour wanted home businesses to pay CGT: In 2014 Labour's website included this pdf : ‘Labour’s Fairer Tax System’. “Business run from home Dorothy owns a small gift shop. She owns the building and lives upstairs with her store taking up the bottom floor. 50% of the area of 70 the property is used for commercial purposes, and 50% is her primary residence. At 45 she decides to wind up the business and sell the property. She makes a capital gain on the property of $200,000.” “The family home exemption means the portion of Dorothy‟s property that is for the family home will be exempt. Dorothy is only liable to pay 15% tax on half of the capital gain – as 50% of the area of the property was her primary residence.” Best Regards, Susan Davis 71 From:Adam Dowsett Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 9:47 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Working Group submission Dear Sir/Madam, Thank you for this opportunity to share thoughts and ideas for such an important future perspective impacting all within our special country. I'm not an expert on tax, however I believe politicians are properly elected by us - yet continuously consider more tax increases to existing citizens - rather than to those people temporarily enjoying our country. The MBIE predicts that by 2023 we will have more short- term visitors to NZ each year than we have as a natural population; the visitors should therefore be paying more to enjoy our beautiful country. Why should those NZers who voted the politicians making these important tax decisions, and who already pay income tax/GST, also have to carry the further full tax burden of pressures to infrastructure caused by overseas tourism? Yet no political party has actively taken the initiative to tax non-Kiwis (tourists and non-residents) to a greater extent; NZ is a very very desirable country to visit as a tourist, or to be educated in with a potential to live. This attractiveness will always be there, therefore a smart tax initiatives to these groups of people are important opportunities. Summary of major points:  Increase taxes to tourists and non-residents: they will still come in increasing numbers  Tourists will soon outnumber population; this is where to increase percentage point taxes  Transactional based taxes, highlighted in the Recommendations below, re easier to implement and administer  Increased numbers of people is a burden to all infrastructure across the country; smart taxing initiatives in key tourist areas/cities will maximise this initiative Recommendations:  Hotel taxes (including AirBnB?) to pay for sewerage, water, waste. Such hotel taxes are levied in other major tourist cities across the world  Local city taxes (also paid at hotel/motel checkout): to pay for roading, policing, hospitals  Car rental tax for cars & campervans hired by non-NZ (and Australian) drivers' licences  Water export tax: increasing tax on bottled NZ water sent offshore (and other selected natural resources?) I'm definitely open to discuss any of the above points in greater detail with the Tax Working Group and Secretariat. With thanks, Adam Dowsett \[1\] 72 From:John Bonallack Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 6:15 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Sir Michael and the Tax Working Group I appreciate the opportunity to make this submission to your group. I believe that the tax system should remove the tax and investment advantages landlords have when buying investment housing properties. Behind this viewpoint is the conviction that the community, and society as a whole, is enhanced when people are enabled to buy and own their own home – and undermined when they are forced to rent. My wife and I brought up our family in an older ex-state housing area We have been here for 35 years. When we arrived, most of the homes were, like ours, ex- state houses that had been sold to others like us who were starting at the bottom of the ladder. When we bought it (for $41,500), the house was an unpainted fibrolite-shingle dwelling on a large bare section. There had been a kitchen fire and the interior was smoke damaged. Since then we have painted and renovated it, built onto it twice, built a detached granddad flat for my father, done a lot of paving and planted several hundred trees and ferns. We are now retired and hope to stay in this house as long as we can. Others around us also improved their homes and gardens, but over the last ten years as owners moved on, many of the properties were bought by investors as rentals. The tenants have, with a few exceptions, been perfectly decent people, but the landlords tend to live elsewhere in “better” suburbs, and neither they nor their tenants have the level of pride in their properties that home-owners tend to have, nor much interest in their hedges, fences, maintenance or improvements beyond what is absolutely necessary. The landlords are naturally interested in getting maximum rental for minimum input. The tenants I’ve spoken to have all said they would like to own but can’t afford to and, unsurprisingly, have little interest in enhancing the properties for the benefit of the absentee owners. It seems to me that this reflects an unintended consequence in the tax structure that incentivises those who have a bit of capital or can leverage off an existing property to make themselves comfortable at the expense of not only those who cannot afford a first home, but of the community and society as a whole. I believe that if the tax incentives were removed, investors would be likely to sell their rentals. This would depress house prices and enable more first-home buyers to find affordable homes. I am also in favour of dated Housing Corp stock being sold cheaply (provided replacement state houses are built). After all, that’s how we got into our house. In recognition of an artificially low price, certain caveats on the sale and subsequent sales – perhaps limiting purchasers to first-home buyers with families through a ballot system, and preventing the home from being used in the future as a rental. I am not experienced in making submissions. If it should be that this is not in the correct form, I’d be grateful if you would let me know so that I can resubmit it correctly. Yours faithfully John Bonallack Marathon Books NZ Ltd \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 73 From:Mike Diggins Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 4:40 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on "Future of Tax" - Mike Diggins Ladies and gentleman I make no apology for lack of brevity – as a member of both the ageing population and the bastard landlord class, I need to comment. You asked for a summary, please find one at the end. I want to mention superannuation, capital taxes, consumption taxation and options that will help reduce my inevitable footprint on expenses by delaying the need for them. I want to put some extreme cases so you think about where the lines of decency are. Mainly though, I want to ask a question. Is your intention to encourage me to make the best of what I am, or to punish me for the position into which I have worked myself? Let me explain. As an example, the 1986 Fringe Benefit Tax (47%?) was a punishment for trying to help your staff. It created an avoidance industry. The 1968(?) British wealth tax regime put the Rolling Stones into France, which was not where they wanted to be. Not only did it reduce tax from that source, it made the government a laughing stock among the young. I was there – I laughed. I suggest as a principle you wish to avoid the perception of punishment. Let’s look at that. Superannuation makes a great poisoned chalice. Us old farts have nothing to do except go on government- sponsored cruises, right? Wrong. After Sir Rob’s promise to the nation was broken, I assumed I would receive no superannuation and acted accordingly to protect and provide for my family. I do not expect to be punished for doing that, but that is my minimum position. If you want to muck about with it, abolish it, and make hardship grants easy to apply for. This is a good option if the National Party wins the 2020 election – I’d love to hear the PM’s explanation. But DO NOT TOUCH the savings I have built up as a hedge against that position. Do that, you punish me twice. Handling superannuation that way might even help. Confused people would need help and there might be a case for a government sponsored ‘gig’ economy composed of folks like me to provide it from a position of knowledge. Great motivation, helps keeps the brain moving and might keep me out of hospital – so pays for itself. Minimum, sorry living, wage is fine. I work from home, when I want to, and travel after 9am to avoid expense claims. While on about ageism, very grateful there is no official retirement age – I have no love for the idea of forcing you out of the working “tribe” to die. I was able to leave on my own terms, went past the use by date a bit and knew why I was ready to stop full-time work. I’m in Auckland, I love my HOP card, it gives me freedom and I can choose not to drink and drive by giving up driving. I love the freedom of being able to devote time to doing things I believe important. This is one of them. I love the different, almost loving, approach the MSD takes with seniors – I’ve seen the same between staff and patients in Auckland Hospital’s Oncology department. The suggestion I made above would make me into a bludger again. I would rather that didn’t happen. I would be happy if superannuation was set based on the amount of tax (excluding super) you paid in a year. I volunteer to be part of the gig economy chasing down tax evaders, as above. By the way, thank you for not being slaves to the GDP gods. I like your example on page 21 a bout how investment decisions are made, or not. It goes to the heart of my opinions as a residential landlord. Bottom line, tax me too much and you take the consequences of a reduced ability to make investment decisions. There is only so much in the landlord’s war chest. \[1\] 74 I got into that business 20 years ago. Only a couple of properties but chosen on two principles. One, I wouldn’t buy a place I wouldn’t live in. Two, we bought for capital gain. This was retirement saving; I expected to take very little out of the properties, trusting them to recognise two decades of labour when they sold. Hence my opinion on capital gains. In 1998, I expected to realise maybe 200% to 240% of the purchase price at sale (we still have one property). I do not regard the realisation of almost 400% as my fault and I do not expect to be punished for it. If you are going to do that, you need to tax lotto winnings above fifth division, the dogs, the gee-gees and the casino in the same way. I already believe there have been years in which I paid more tax than Fletcher Challenge. However, you need more money, not least to get the bullshit out of our streams and the death of trees out of our forests before we pay for that in reputational damage. It will cost us to retain the reputation that underpins one of our biggest income earners. There are other reasons, too. Page 43 makes me rather proud – the removal of all those minnow taxes like stamp duty that were just a nuisance. As a principle, government needs to be seen not to clip the ticket on this sort of business – we’ve done that by bundling of airport taxes. Example – with stamp duty, let the lawyers charge for it, collect it and pay in bulk. No one cares if you go after lawyers for evasion. Its particularly good that you are no longer punished for being nice to others when you die. SKIing is one thing – accidentally leaving a legacy that creates the worry of the IRD going after your grand-kids quite another. Stuff like that is not missed. To property. What the ability to offset losses 20 years ago gave me were two things. Firstly, I could dream bigger if I could do that. Secondly, that rebate at the end of the year gave me something I could use to make capital improvements on properties that needed them. Depreciation did the same and I was grateful for both. Didn’t even mind paying the clawback, too much. Take that away and you take away any motivation to improve the properties. I can honestly say that I derived no personal gain from that rebate – my customers (tenants) did. Maybe that’s me, but you have to decide if you want to punish people like me for making improvements on a tight budget, because I have an idea of how much you have to spend in advance and can make that money go further by advance planning. Capital gains – if I’m taxed on capital gains in Epsom, can I have a rebate for my property in Bexley, East Christchurch, please. Would help offset the legal cost of the insurance claim! Not true – but if volcano no. 51 goes up in Auckland, it could be. Gains in housing are an assumption that cannot be certain. What bothers me about CGT is that you haven’t told me how it will apply. That goes back to my original directive to you – do not punish me. Suppose I bought a place in 1997 for $270,000. In November 2018 I sold it for $970,000, completing on January 31 st , 2019. On January 1, 2019, you suddenly introduce a 50% CGT, effective immediately. You’ll get a note saying IOU $350,000. Is that right? I don’t know. My best option is not to pay and continue not paying until you put me in jail. I get Sky TV, three nice meals a day, as much free education as I can handle, guaranteed reasonable treatment, free hospital care and a nice room I can, within reason, decorate myself. I can sell the family home for ten times what I paid for it because I don’t have to buy a retirement unit! And when I’ve done my time, I can live off the interest of the legal gain. Come to think about it, that’s not a bad plan.... I would support a capital gains tax, even on the family home, that I saw as a fair reclamation from unearned income. In other words, an income tax. At introduction, your contribution to that is a free registered valuation (why should I pay for what you demand?) specially to act as a basis for CGT, and government backed as valid and accepted. I pay tax on the income I have earned (or lost, in Bexley) from that point. 75 I support it as fair – but until you tell me if we are to have that or the option that puts me in jail, I can’t trust you. Same applies to the other windfalls – Lotto, the gee-gees, the dogs and my gambling problem. Of course, if I lose, I should be able to claim a capital loss for the session – which may motivate me to have a problem. Do not mess with my KiwiSaver. I paid tax on the m oney I contributed, I pay tax on the interest, I contribute a decent wedge to my fund manager who I assume pays tax on their profits. If that’s not enough, put me in a nice jail, please. GST. I helped introduce GST in 1986 and after Thatcher’s multi-rate stupidity in 1970s Britain, I loved the idea that you taxed the invoice rather than the invoice line. Selective GST would be a computing nightmare – but maybe good for my gig economy. If you want to do that for staple foods, ask the markets to reduce the cost to the customer by the GST difference (a fixed percentage, applicable through their pricing for special offers) and let them claim a rebate as thanks. No change to transaction systems, minor changes to reporting and submissible online – that’s effective. Sorry, I don’t like the “efficiency” moniker. I’ve worked for local government and seen lots of people running in very small circles very efficiently. Didn’t get much done, though. IN SUMMARY One guiding principle: taxation must avoid any perception of punishment for achievement. Superannuation – no support for means testing:  It is a privilege, not an entitlement – unlike the dole.  I would rather see it reduced than means tested.  I would rather see it removed entirely than means tested.  I would love to see encouragement of seniors to be, in their terms, useful.  Seniors with spare cash will generate GST when using it – if they have gained that spare cash legally, don’t punish them for doing so Property:  No support for ring-fencing losses – stifles motivation to improve property  Limited support for CGT, given that we do not know what is proposed (see notes for possibilities)  Under some circumstances, I am better off in jail for not paying CGT than free for paying (see above)  No support for being jailed GST:  No support for changes that charge it at line, rather than invoice, level – ICT nightmare  Support for variation on staple items that uses “special offer” provisions in retail software, then allows claims by the retailer. That should be do-able If you’ve read this far, thank you. Some of the above might have sounded flippant but I believe the best way to get points across is to try to be entertaining. My objective was always to enjoy retirement without assuming any Government contribution. I’ve achieved that objective. Do not punish me as a cash cow for doing so, because an old fart like me has nothing better to do than read about your contradictions and pursue sniping actions. It took Kristine Bartlett twelve years, and I’ve got more time, I hope ( and #metoo as an example). Thank you for the opportunity to comment, and the general clarity of your documentation. These views are mine, and mine alone. I have no objection to being contacted for further information.

Good afternoon Mr Cullen, I read the article in this morning’s NZ Herald with interest. The key point you made was: ‘We are not being asked to raise more revenue...but... how to maintain the current level in the face of some major future challenges such as an aging population and new technologies’. This is all WRONG. Imposing a greater taxation burden is not a valid method of raising more revenue... but... ... rather increased revenue should be obtained by improving our business performance. When you were Minister of Finance you largely stayed away from interfering in business activities; instead had a focus of supporting our very capable business people who have both the training and experience. The current Prime Minister despite her almost total lack of business experience describes herself as ... ..........an ‘interventionist’ ( surely the first requirement is exceptional proven experience ) Below is a letter I sent some time ago to the Minister of Finance. It is not surprising that I have not received a reply as I believe their all-out attack on ALL our major INCOME EARNING industries simply can NOT be substantiated. Perhaps the most glaring barrier to increasing our foreign earning is by preventing us from fighting on a level playing field with the rest of the world ...through the failure to lower the company tax rate to 25%. Roy Wilson \[1\] \[1\] 79 From: Roy Wilson Sent: Sunday, 17 December 2017 4:12 p.m. To: roy Subject: MINISTRY of FINANCE - ARTICLE NZ HERALD - for Attention of Mr. GRANT ROBERTSON. Good morning Mr. Robertson. Ever since the election I have been amazed that various commentators have not analysed your programme as follows : 1. Your leaders have negotiated your way into power by promising programmes, handouts, and giveaway ( bribes ) to the Greens and NZ First using tax payers money ... the full amount of which your PM stated has NOT been costed!! 2. All these promises/new programmes will have to be funded from taxation from our income earning industries. Yet instead of incentivising them to increase their revenue you have actually attacked them making it more difficult for them to perform well : TOURISM. You are cutting off their source of critical immigration staff so essential to maintain our quality service. MINING. Stopping some future mining with no regard to any proven reason on a case by case basis. FARMING. No more irrigation regardless of the fact that modern schemes are now controlled so as not to damage the environment. EXPORTERS. Removing the proposed tax cuts for commercial firms which would bring our rates more in line with the rest of the world with whom we have to compete. ( The USA are showing the way... down from 35% to 21% ) As you know we are one of the highest trading nations per head of population on the world stage and yet you are deliberately preventing us from competing on an equal basis ! IMMIGATION. While we are now in a position to gradually cut back on the number of our new residents this needs to be carefully managed to ensure we get the skills we need... plus enough capital to ensure a smooth transition. 3. OBJECTIVES. How can you justify your comment “in transition...to a productivity based growth?” . Business confidence has slumped... you have removed all the incentives to encourage productivity... and replaced them with handouts... plus... ......... placed obstacles in the way of our most powerful industries. \[1\] 80 SUMMARY It appears we are heading for a period when all the gains we have made over the past few years will be frittered away ...with incentives replaced with head winds. It would seem we have an extremely inexperienced government following an ‘interventionist’ policy without the experience and knowledge to understand the full consequences... as they rush headlong into one reckless action after another. I hope that you will be able to show me that the picture is not as bad as I have painted. Roy Wilson. 81 From:David W. Scott Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 1:27 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax changes perspective from late 40s good income earner The following changes I'd like to see are from the perspective of someone I consider to be trying to be environmentally conscious, a solo parent, modest home owner, well educated, decent salary owner in the technology industry, and an aspiring business starter. Primarily I would like to see less taxation on personal income generated and a rapidly increasing ratio and a greater emphasis on taxes that are placed on "consumption" which I see as basically the root of most of the ills in the environment, population health and mega-wealthy excess. For example, GST is charged on everything (other than specific exceptions) that people want to buy, as such, it is very hard to avoid. Most wealthy people would naturally end up paying a greater fair share of this tax due to the expensive purchases they make. In addition, there is a built-in encouragement to be environmentally-conscious with their wealth e.g. choose to live in 'small footprint' ways to reduce their tax burden. Similarly, with lower income people, they also pay a lower fair share on their purchases, with some additional exemptions for non-processed foods, and the same built-in encouragements to live in environmentally-conscious ways, avoid junk food, etc., to reduce their tax burden. In line with gradual increases on GST, there should be a commensurate reduction in income taxes (and fewer brackets but very high earners still paying a higher rate). I'd also like to see tax-free bracket maybe increasing eventually to $10,000 p.a. which would greatly benefit those on or close to the poverty line. I would also expect eventually that, as more and more automation and AI takes peoples jobs, this tax-free bracket could also gradually become a universal basic income bracket and likely removing or reducing the need for income support/job seekers allowance etc. I'd would think these GST/Income Tax "levers" could be extremely useful and able to be adjusted "on a dime" to m aintain the current overall tax take required to provide services, and also help drive down costs of many services such as the health system. I would definitely support a capital gains tax on financial services and property, other than the main family home (not additional baches etc) and certainly not investment properties. Corporate tax could be reduced somewhat but I would like to see it always above that of personal income tax. Carbon tax or emissions trading should be implemented on all industry, including farmers and energy generators and fossil fuel extractors... however, farmers for example should also have this bitter pill sold to them with new support to reduce their emissions and also offer greater financial support for the increasing extreme weather events and droughts. Similarly, highly polluting equipment and vehicles should have this tax applied. Carrots and sticks. Encouragements to live healthily and for environmental benefit of future generations and NZ's image. \[1\] 82 I have a very bright 19 year old son, who has recently left school, has no hope of owning a home and was struggling to find work. So much so that he has decided to give Australia a try despite the inherent big hurdles kiwis get over there. We need to do better for our kids. I would see all of the above as a great opportunity to increase income equality, future prospects, encourage healthier eating and environmental choices, encourage affordable home ownership and a small eco-home building boom, support/improve NZ's clean green image, and make NZ the progressive forward-thinking nation that we were born to be, again! This could be the defining moment to show the way in the 21st century just as we were with women's right to vote, anti nuclear policy, etc., in the 20th. I would be happy to make these submissions in person or available to the public. Good luck Regards David Scott 83 From:Mike Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 1:24 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax working group My submissions with this future of tax; I believe that any tax reform should encompass local govt rates as well, Local Govt rates keep on increasing on a yearly basis, they are a cost regardless of ones Ability to pay and the increases are just compounding. Taxes should be based on disposable incomes and should take into account a taxpayer ability to maintain a reasonable standard of living. Retirees should have their situation noted, the effects on their savings, particularly with rates. Taxes and rates should be treated as one item. GST being an all embracing tax does affect the lower income people more than those on high incomes and does contribute to the difference between the rich and poor. GST should not be such income earner for Govt, direct taxes are a better option. Governance money should include both rates and general taxation and the people’s ability to cope with this should be factored in.

Please carefully consider the possible implications of making changes to how investments properties are taxed. Currently the majority of landlords in this country are what is termed as “Mum and Dad” investors, I believe around 80%. They are not necessarily wealthy but are trying to build a nest egg for retirement as the superannuation will not be sufficient to live on. Nor was there an incentive or any such schemes like KiwiSaver around hence investment properties as the vehicle for some sort of life at retirement. We are one of those investors who has a property that is not cash flow positive, we have tried to keep the rent at a sustainable level for our tenants and have now owned this property since 2011. So we are not in this for a quick capital gain but the long term. In keeping the rent at an acceptable level we have to top up the mortgage and outgoings to the tune of $200 per week. This we have been prepared to do as we are in it for the long game not shot term gain. Any changes to the tax system that increase the amount of tax we need to pay purely because we have a rental property will mean that we seriously will need to rethink this as a proposition either in terms of increasing the rent or selling the property. Neither is an option we want to be forced into and neither option will benefit the housing market. The property will not likely become a rental on sale nor would first home buyers be able to afford to buy this property. The landlords will one or two properties are the backbone of most rentals in this country penalise us will penalise those that need a rental as prices will defiantly increase. So please consider any proposed changes carefully and what implications they may have.

GST: Apply the KISS principle. No exemptions -they just cause bureaucratic nightmares and administration costs and endless arguments. INTRODUCE AN APT TAX: I know this is usually applied at a flat rate but to me it would make more sense to have at least two rates. One rate for transactions within NZ (a circulating ATP, if you like) and this should be the lowest rate. Then a second higher rate on transactions where money goes overseas. This would help offset the loss of a consumption tax for people buying goods overseas by mail order. Buyers of foreign currencies would also pay this tax. And if you are really brave an even higher rate on larger sums sent overseas by foreign owned businesses repatriating their profits to tax havens etc. SOME SORT OF TAX ON EXTRA PROPERTIES: By extra properties, I mean any residential building which is not the family home. Only the well off can afford a holiday house. It is time people owning rental properties were taxed on those extra assets too. Like all taxes it would have to be watertight and I have no idea how it would be implemented. GET RID OF WORKING FOR FAMILIES AND RENTAL SUBSIDIES: These returns of tax just skew the market keeping wages low and rents high. In some ways \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 87 too, they disincentivise people to strive to better themselves because they don’t want to go into the bracket where they lose the subsidy. INCOME TAX: Income tax is also a type of disincentive. It is the one tax everybody sees and thinks about. It should be kept as low as possible once new taxes replace the revenue flow. Thank you for this chance to submit. Yours sincerely, Sent from my iPad \[1\] 88 From:Robyn Carey Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 8:44 AM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Robyn Carey Subject: Submission - additional point Hi, I have already made submissions via your standard 5 question format. I have an additional point to stress: Generally it doesn’t seem to me that a capital gains tax (as opposed to a wealth tax, which I strongly oppose) has any less ethical basis than a PAYE tax. Why should unearned gains not be taxed? In fact, a capital gains tax seems even more justified than a PAYE tax. However, note that the capital value of a property prior to sale would include any value added improvements in cluding owner labour costs, with the provision of relevant receipts etc. Any capital gains tax must also be balanced by the ability to claim capital losses. A capital gains tax cannot apply simply to one asset class, that is, property. A capital gains tax must apply to all asset types, including businesses. Why should companies such as Trade Me, sold for $700million and Sistema, sold for $600million, not have a capital tax applied? It may be that these businesses provide jobs, but property investment provides homes. Providing homes is no less important than providing jobs. The sale of small to medium sized businesses is to provide for retirement, and therefore should not be subject to a capital gains tax, some would say. However, the sale of rental properties by mum and dad investors is also to fund retirement, so the same argument applies. So, apply a capital gains tax if you wish. However, the ability to claim capital losses must be included and the tax must be equitably applied against all investment assets, including businesses. In addition, this new stream of tax revenue must be offset by a decrease in tax in some other area, e.g. PAYE. The government needs to think hard about creative ways of supporting new income streams that don’t increase the tax burden on its citizens, which is attempted by the SOEs and sale of electricity and other assets. Robyn Carey \[1\] 89 From:Cant, Mark Sent: Thursday, 15 March 2018 5:30 AM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Mark Cant Subject: Submission to TWG Hi I have some suggestions that would meet the Tax Working Group (TWG) objectives, the problem, which I am sure will be considered, and reported on, however I think we all know they are not politically advisable. Perhaps the TWG could suggest ideas to make implementation of these ideas more politically feasible or suggest ideas that “reduce the macro impact of significant changes to tax policy”. Suggestions: Capital gains tax (CGT) (on non-primary residence property) this would be expected to have an impact on the housing market, ie increase supply. Stamp duty again on non-primary residence property would also help. this would be expected to have an impact on the housing market, ie increase supply. ISA (tax free savings accounts on cash, equities and other investments) could be introduced, capping the amount to be invested each year that’s tax free. Examples of reducing political obstacles could include. Stamp duty could be avoided if the property is sold to the current tenants CGT could have a pre-set marginal rate increase over time, i.e. starts in 2 years’ time, the rate will start at 2% and increase by 2% each year for 5 years until the taxpayers marginal rate is applicable or whatever. Examples to entice people that have (and people that aspire to have) investment properties to accept a CGT: Set up a government backed home loan bank to lend to those people that traditional banks will not. Capital can be raised via ISA other investments scheme and have a much higher threshold for the tax free threshold. Further explanation of above point: With regards to ISA other investments above, you could potentially investigate creating a fund that lends to kiwi’s (low quality borrowers) on home loans. Ie if for example you have lots of property investors that decide to sell their properties, this would create a lot supply on the secondary property market. To offset (this macro impact of the tax policy suggested) you could create an investment fund in a government guaranteed bank that loans to those who are unable to or don’t have the deposit required to borrow from traditional lenders. Effectively the people that currently rent (and wish to buy) the homes, can do so and the landlords will receive a tax free return investing in a (possibly government backed / secured, to a limit) fund, instead of hoping for tax free capital gains in the future. With this one you could suggest a much higher limit either per year or initial deposit, or have conditions that if it was capital from an investment property it can all be invested etc etc. This would also have the added benefit of helping reduce possible superannuation payments / hardship payments in the future for those that do not own their own home. Bit light on detail I know, i.e. rates, thresholds etc, but ideas all the same, and I’m sure you have various models to test the impact of the above ideas if you thought it worthwhile.

I would like to submit my views on the future of taxation, in the following areas : Capital Gains Tax, Housing Real Estate Bubble As most New Zealanders are aware, the prices of houses in New Zealand are out of kilter with the earning potential of its population. Previous governments, despite having the power, have not worked to address this bubble, with the result that a working Kiwi family cannot buy a home - ever. While taxation of capital gains on sale of the house is off the table - might I venture to suggest there is a very good way of taxing the house on sale, not by capital gain, but rather from profit. This is a mechanism for tackling the bubble, and bursting it very effectively. Lets take the following example : A three bedroom house was built in say 1982, and bought for the then- price of $70,000, in a decent suburb of a major city. If we then extrapolate the growth in value if there had been no bubble, then then house price today would be a not-unreasonable $300,000 for purchase, well within the means of the working family. The same house today if sold is probably north of $1.2 Million. The solution, to me, is relatively simple. There should be no taxation on the inherent value of a property calculated with its inflationary growth in line with the consumer price index of all other goods. that is fair an amicable. However, it is within the Government's power to then tax the profit of the example house, at a value of $1,200,000 - $300,000 = $900,000 at the IRD's Income Tax Rate of 38% to yield $342,000 in taxation. In addition, the imposition of a stamp duty of 10% on the value of the profit made in the sale, would therefore also take the heat out of the market. There is a good consequence with this - greedy homeowners will suddenly be massively disincentivised from attempting to profit from inflating the value of a house by 300% over its intrinsic value. These are only suggestions, but I believe very good ones. Allocation of Taxes I would absolutely love to see the following, if it were possible :  Petrol and Diesel Taxes spent on roads & transport systems only.  Food taxes spent on food production and bringing the price of food down  ACC payments being spent on making healthcare cheaper While I completely understand that other taxation funds schools and hospitals, given the state of our country's needs in these areas, I would earnestly recommend thinking about doing something about these concepts for the public good. \[1\] 92 Petrol & Diesel Tax - Allocation for roads In every major city centre, and indeed across the country, the condition of New Zealand roads is MONUMENTALLY AWFUL and forgive me for emphasising it - in South Africa, for instance, a 3rd world country, the road condition is considerably better. I would like suggest re- investment into roading infrastructure directly by using revenue for petrol and diesel tax sales to rebuild the inner city roads (which are a disgrace) and highways (which are very dangerous) to a British Standard, which is desperately needed to save lives. Food T axes - To increase local food production While Fonterra gets a tax break on export of milk, would it not be better to instead tax them for shipping food away from hungry people in this country ? Our food is so expensive children go hungry - here, every day ! I would like to suggest re-investing taxes on foodstuffs into our primary agriculture industry to make food cheaper and easier to get - by building greenhouses and encouraging fruit growing. We have all the capacity to feed ourselves, needing perhaps only wheat in import..and then, only selling food that is in excess for export, instead of making food so expensive that children starve. I would love to see my taxes spent on agriculture and bringing the cost of food down for the poorest among us. With my very great thanks for accepting my submission, and considering it among many others. My earnest prayers are for you all, that you can succeed in finding balanced solutions to help the poorest among us all, and to reformatting our taxes to improve our lot, and save lives and give dignity to us all.

Perhaps as a transition measure it should be restricted to only those vehicles that have a complete and accurate log book of all journeys made including the purpose and goods transported. I realise that it is out side the scope of your review, but I'd also suggest that the tax deductibility of any payment to an entity in a tax haven also be restricted. Allowing payments to an entity in a tax haven to be deductible for tax in New Zealand provides an implied support for tax avoidance. \[1\] 94 From: Sent:Wednesday, 14 March 2018 3:39 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: submissions-Secondly tax Hello Secondly tax on students and beneficiary’s is outrageous , if someone needs to clam a Accommodation Supplement the are change “Secondly tax” on any work they do or there hours are top up to a livable level in order to pay the rent .

I am a young (under 30yrs) kiwi working in Chch and welcome the discussion paper around tax reform, especially the following important issues: \* Ageing population & affordability of superannuation. \* Rising inequality. \* Changing technologies. It is important that the govt has healthy books & lower debt for issues such as natural disasters (future earthquakes) & economic downturns. Unfortunately it is politically unacceptable/suicidal for any parties to consider raising income taxes, so taxes need to be diversified. Also, no government is willing to address the rising cost of superannuation (because it costs votes); the problem is ignored and deferred to the future. A large loophole at the moment is a lack of capital gains tax on real estate which has fed through to: \* Unaffordable house prices \* Rising inequality between homeowners & renters \* Social dysfunction for children having to move schools when parents are renting \* Higher personal debt levels \* A belief that the only way to get ahead in life is to purchase more property and leverage off existing property in full knowledge that future capital gains will become tax free income (excl. the minimal "brightline test"). I believe the best new methods of meeting future tax obligations include: 1. Means testing superannuation on a sliding scale. For example, no superannuation when wealth (incl. real estate) exceeds a certain multiple of the minimum wage. For example, no superannuation if you have wealth exceeding 30 times the annual minimum wage ($32K x 30 = $960K). 2. Crack down on tax avoidance, and deport people who have been convicted of medium/serious offences. There are too many people coming into NZ, and we definitely don't need the ones who wont conform to our laws. 3. Introduce a stamp duty on a sliding scale similar to Australia to discourage speculation & distortion in the property market. This is easy to administer. 4. Introduce a CGT on all real estate sales, including the family home. Alternatively, an increase in the "brightline test" to 20 years plus may be more politically acceptable! Excaluding the provisions of the "brightline test", it is currently accepted to buy/sell (or "flip") real estate for a profit and not pay any income tax on those gains. This is grossly unfair to those people who earn income in other ways, that are arguably more productive (e.g. Business sale, share, company & PAYE). If I put my money in the bank, I am taxed on the interest earnt; I accept that is fair. Why is it fair that I can buy real estate including a "family home", sell this for a profit and pay no taxes on that income? I have still earned money either way, but one class of investment has a massive advantage over the other. As evidenced by the news nearly every day, this clearly leads to market distortion, inequality, and rising house prices. Kind Regards, \[1\] 96 From:Gary P Stephenson Sent: Wednesday, 14 March 2018 3:20 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dear Sirs My submission to the Tax working group: Capital Gains tax should be implemented on all second homes when sold. This will help eliminate the use of second homes as retirement income. There should be no tax on shares, stocks or bonds. This will enable people to use the share market and kiwisaver for their retirement income and at the same time providing working capital to companies. A reduction of GST on hybrid and electric vehicles to drive the growth from combustion engines to cleaner vehicles. Retirement age should remain at 65. Income tax base level reduced by 1% and no increase or reduction in the top rate. General superannuation rate should be linked directly to the superannuation of a member of Parliament whose base salary is currently $160,000. Taxes should not be used to benefit one group and should only be used if it benefits all New Zealanders as a whole.

There are many ways to improve the collection of revenue in this country.  Tax tourists more. It is very rough making the NZ public fund tourism ventures that most will never see or use. Taxing international visitors as they come in/out of the country (via Airlines) and on key attractions like DOC walks and government funded projects is key,  Have an income tax bracket of 0% for maybe <$10,000/year. People who are earning less than this shouldn’t be forced to give 10%+ of their money away to the government.  Be more restrictive on government spending, there is so much unnecessary spending on bureaucracy that should be cut, and when it is you will not need to go looking for more tax money.  Make the tax system more accessible to everyday kiwis. It is ridiculous that we are in 2018 and the IRD still requires physical paper forms to be filled out and sent around the country, this is something that could easily be done online. It not only takes valuable time that individuals only have so much of but it also has a massive impact on the environment in terms of paper forms and emissions from postage.  The retirement age is one of the key reasons why the government will need more money in coming years and can also be easily solved by raising the age now. This age hasn’t been adjusted 1898. This just absolutely bonkers and I can’t understand how the government isn’t doing anything about it. That is over 100 years ago and over that time the life expectancy has raised from ~60 to 80+. It is time to stop giving people a free ride as soon as they reach 65 when the vast majority are still capable of working.  Get rid of fees free education. I am currently studying in University and I know for a fact it is possible to work to support yourself through uni. It means working 60-70 hours a week over summers and 10- 20hours a week during Uni time but it is possible. Students don’t need to be given this free ride it is something that should be earned and if they don’t feel up to doing earning at the time, let them borrow but charge interest. The NZ taxpayers shouldn’t be funding student’s binge drinking habits and overseas holidays.  Petrol tax is one tax that I think needs to be increased in cities across the country. People within cities shouldn’t be driving. Cheap petrol encourages this and disincentives against using public and other alternative forms of transport. Potentially on top of this a tax credit could be offered to those who bike/use buses and trains. This would also be hugely beneficial to the environment. As evident in Christchurch when the smog descends over winter due to the cars driving everywhere. These are just some of the key changes that need to happen to improve New Zealand holistically.

There are too many negative social outcomes attached to investing in residential property.

The obvious course would be to introduce wealth taxes. But the terms the Government has laid down for the Tax Working Group specifically forbid it to entertain inheritance taxes, or taxing the family home or the land beneath the family home. Since the Second World War, the gradual elimination in New Zealand of land taxes, inheritance taxes, and gift taxes has increasingly quarantined real property, especially the family home, as a safe tax-free haven for the growth of family wealth. The introduction of any form of wealth tax that excludes the family home or the land beneath it, and that also excludes inheritance tax (and presumably gift tax), is fundamentally unfair to all who are not yet home-owners, or who are home-owners in an area where housing has little value. It also seems likely to continue and increase the incentive to invest in the family home rather than other forms of investment. This will push prices higher, ever further beyond the reach of those who do not have the means to buy into the housing market. I submit that a person who does not own, or part-own, and occupy a “family home”, should be allowed a tax-free investment of an amount equivalent to, say, the value of the average inner-city Auckland house; say $1 million. To be fair to the hapless owner- occupier of the $100,000 house in Raetihi or Mataura, let’s say every taxpayer is entitled to tax-free savings or investment (in any vehicles in New Zealand or overseas) of $1 million minus the value of their owner-occupied-home investment. So the single person who owns no home would be able to grow his or her savings tax-free till it reached $1 million; the married half-owner of the $100,000 home in Raetihi would be able to invest $950,000 and pay wealth and income tax only on the capital above that; the half-owner of the $3 million house in Remuera would incur wealth tax on every dollar invested elsewhere, as his or her $1.5 million share surpasses the tax-free investment allowance. Such a tax-free allowance would reduce the disparity between the capital-growth advantage of investing in the family home and the land beneath it (excluded from the tax reform group’s consideration) and other forms of investment. This would encourage New Zealanders to look beyond the family home to more productive investments, which would help to reduce the rate of price increase in homes, and people who did not yet have enough money to buy a house, or who did not want to own a house, would enjoy tax advantages similar to home-owner-occupiers. The obvious disadvantage is that the lauded simplicity of New Zealand’s tax system would disappear: the Inland Revenue Department would need to know the value of each taxpayer’s share of ownership of the house in which he or she lived, then assess how much tax from the taxpayer’s investments to collect or reimburse. However, the increased cost of a more complicated inland revenue collection might be a price worth paying to reverse the growing inequality among New Zealanders, with its unhappy social consequences. \[1\] \[1\] 100 From:Geoff King Sent: Tuesday, 13 March 2018 9:54 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission On Foriegn Investment Funds My situation, I believe is common among those providing for or living off retirement savings. We are retired and have moderate investments in equities. Prudently more than half of these are in other than NZ equities. Up to 2008 I prepared my own tax returns. The introduction of FIF taxation rules I found too complex for one without an accountancy qualification, and so have paid an accountant to furnish our tax returns since then. Given that we have marginally more than the $50,000 exemption, the income these FIF's receive is significantly reduced by accountancy costs. This is a disincentive for small investors saving for retirement. It steers them into solely New Zealand equities which does not provide a balanced portfolio. The remedy I would like to see is anything that would make it possible for an average individual (One not having tertiary accounting qualifications and only moderate investments) to furnish their own tax return. This might be either or both increasing the $50,000 minimum or simplifying the FIF rules for tax purposes. \[1\] 101 From: Sent:Sunday, 11 March 2018 7:49 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: submission on tax revision It is surprising that the tax working group is considering a wealth tax, in view of the destructive effects on business and investment that such a tax has had in countries that have adopted such a tax. A comprehensive capital gains tax is sensible, which works very well in countries like the United States which has one. Any wealth tax which targets accumulated capital that has already been taxed when earned is going to discourage saving, and investment. Such a tax would result in many people attempting to put their money overseas or under the mattress. As we know from experience overseas, people are willing to pay taxes that are seen as fair. But once government oversteps that mark, there is active resistance. Dan McGuire \[1\] \[1\] 102 From:Chris Rush Sent: Friday, 9 March 2018 5:58 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Taxation of iwi and some relgious commercial operations Dear Tax Working Group Members Our submission concerns: 1. Taxation on businesses owned by Religious and Iwi/Hapu Charitable Trusts 2. Taxation privileges extended to Maori commercial operations. Adrianne and I wish to know if as part of your review you will be considering the issue of charitable trusts who operate commercial businesses and the question of whether or not taxation should be paid on their operation and the advantageous tax privileges presently extended to iwi companies and corporations? 1. We contend that Trusts who own and operate commercial enterprises operate under an unfair taxation regime and compete in a distinctively advantageous way over other New Zealand businesses.. 2. Several iwi corporations or / and businesses pay tax at a rate of 17% Presently the company tax rate in this country is 28% Is it fair to other New Zealand businesses, that this tax privilege which is extended to Maori should continue? Two examples of tax paid by iwi businesses will suffice here: Nga Tahu paid $363,636.in tax on their income of $88 million over the past 11 years. This equates to an annual tax rate of 4% on profit. Waikato Tainui received tax rebates on an average income of $70 million over the past 7 years. Is is estimated that at this time iwi economy is worth $50 billion and growing rapidly. It should be perceived by all New Zealanders that there is a taxation regime operating in this country which is treating everyone in a fair and equitable manner. We believe that presently this is not the case. We are in danger of creating a set of injustices if the existing commercial tax differentials continue.

Why is it that when a family is considered for working for families that both partners income are assess ed together as a combined income, yet when this income is taxed it is taxed on an individuals income. Shouldn’t the income be taxed as a combined income? Those are a few suggestions that I have at the moment, maybe later I will have some more suggestions.

Dear Sir Michael, I am hopeful that the tax working group will give serious consideration to income tax splitting for couples with a stay at home parent. As many stay at home parents are women, it is about time that the unpaid, voluntary work that is undertaken mainly by women be acknowledged and valued. During the 15 years I was at home raising my children I was not in paid employment. However, I contributed many hours per week to my community through my work as a La Leche League Leader, providing telephone counselling, home visits and ante natal classes. I also gave breast feeding classes to Parent Centre. I was active on many committees for organisation s in which my children were involved, such as Playcentre, PTA, Pony Club. I was always available to help at their schools and supported teaching staff both in the classroom and on countless school trips. After returning to the workforce part time, I was a member of the Board of Trustees of our local school for 10 years, 8 of those as Board Chair. It is this type of unpaid contribution to communities that keeps society functioning healthily. Over the past decades it has become apparent that the financial burden of housing costs requires 2 incomes. This has had a serious impact on parental involvement in communities at many levels. In my work as a Public Health Nurse I witnessed too much misery in our society and it has only become worse. My family is now very comfortable but as a grandparent, I fear for the future of our coming generations. My husband and I would be happy to pay more tax to support better health care and education in New Zealand. I am aware that former MP Peter Dunne actively promoted the concept of income tax splitting as a way towards a fairer society. By establishing the Tax working group the new Labour Government has signaled that our Tax system is in desperate need of radical change if the ever increasing inequality in New Zealand is to be addressed. Please be bold in your recommendations and take this opportunity to help create a fairer society.

(that is, your net profit from selling capital wealth, like a house. So you’d only pay it if you made an overall profit a year, for most people, by moving from a more expensive house or more expensive housing market, to a cheaper house or cheaper market. Selling a cheaper house and buying a more expensive one would incur zero tax) Genuine landlords could buy properties with the intent of holding on to them for the rent, but speculators and renovators would now pay tax on their income. The Greens propose excluding the family home, but I actually think we could go further and consider whether that’s unnecessary- if an exemption is required, we could try a lifetime sum exemption, (eg. your first $100,000 of capital gains are untaxed) but I think we could actually trial a CGT with no exemption at all, and the only people likely to be affected would be those moving to a cheaper home to pay off a mortgage lump sum, those selling a house they’re underwater on, or to buy some highly expensive but very necessary item or service. If we do need policy to address those situations, though, we could potentially allow those paying off their only mortgage to consider that a capital loss. -- Simon Louisson \[1\] \[1\] 108 From:Hugh Petchell Sent: Thursday, 8 March 2018 9:59 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax fairness 1. I would like to raise the issue of family income where one partner stays home to raise children. The current tax system does not recognize the immense value to society a stay at home parent provides by nurturing young people to become secure and valuable members of society. Two adults are living off one income source but as a family unit are penalized for following doing so. 2. Another issue is the concept of secondary income tax. The purpose of the tax may have been to discourage people working multiple jobs to share the work around, but I think we have moved on from that position and people now work 2 or 3 jobs a week to get around 40 hours work, in which case secondary tax on the second or third job is iniquitous in that it largely aff ects lower paid workers who are not fortunate enough to get a job with a decent salary.

Both UK and Australia have a tax free allowance set at similar level - UK about 10,000 GBP, Australia 20,000 AUD. I've looked at the NZ tax rates and the initial 10.5% income tax bracket is lower than the UK, but due to their initital tax free allowance things balance out roughly to the same when take into account a minimum wage, full time 37.5/40hr week. However, for those working just part-time, students, those with mild disabilities, or just those who prefer more time off to spend time look after children or spend time with family, etc, 1-3 days a week for example, in the UK and Australia they pay NO TAX on income for the first 20,000 NZD earnt, whereas here we are hammered with 10.5% and then 17.5%. I propose a simple change to introduction of a tax free allowance, at say 20,000 NZD, which would encourage not only people to take a bit more time to spend with family or on free time and not be penalised, but which would encourage more into the workforce as those earning at the bottom level will keep all they earn (which to be honest is not a lot anyway in this low wage economy in NZ). My personal circumstances are that I worked in IT earning 100K but now am looking for more life balance and have done a mixture of part-time and full-time, and self-employed work in different areas. I am trying to learn and pickup new skills. But when I only get a few hours here or there or 10- 20 hours a week I am penalised with having to pay tax AND acc on the very little income I receive. Its not easy to put up the amount you charge for manual basic work either in self- employment as minimum wage levels are pretty much the norm. Please consider these points I make and discuss the merits of this in the coming consultation. I would suggest this will definitely complement the existing tax system and be a fairer system for all..especially those on low incomes...as in the following review points: The Government has the following objectives for the tax system:  A tax system that is efficient, fair, simple and collected \[1\] 110  A system that promotes the long-term sustainability and productivity of the economy  A system that supports a sustainable revenue base to fund government operating expenditure around its historical level of 30 per cent of GDP  A system that treats all income and assets in a fair, balanced and efficient manner, having special regard to housing affordability  A progressive tax and transfer system for individuals and families, and  An overall tax system that operates in a simple and coherent manner. The Working Group should report to the Government on:  Whether the tax system operates fairly in relation to taxpayers, income, assets and wealth  Whether the tax system promotes the right balance between supporting the productive economy and the speculative economy  Whether there are changes to the tax system which would make it more fair, balanced and efficient, and  Whether there are other changes which would support the integrity of the income tax system, having regard to the interaction of the systems for taxing companies, trusts, and individuals.  Thanks for your time and consideration.

Will the Tax Working group be looking into a form of Financial Transaction Tax as part of the inquiry. I have taken an interest in such a micro tax as a way of streamlining government tax compliance. As most financial transactions are electronic nowadays it is getting increasingly “easier” to administer / collect. A tax (my estimate ~2%) on ALL financial transactions could, at one end of the continuum, eliminate the need for all other forms of taxation. One advantage is it would kill non-productive overnight speculation on foreign currency, day trading in shares etc.. It would also encapsulate the “black economy” (drugs etc) by way of being applied to cash extractions from bank machines. I realise it would be a huge step for a government to take ... but was wondering if it may be on your agenda.

I have worked for Inland Revenue for nearly 20 years, operated our own businesses for about 20 years, and are now a self-employed Accountant. Over the past 50 years I consider New Zealander's attitude to Inland Revenue has changed significantly. There was a lot more respect and fear of IRD and a lot more self-compliance in the general population. Wages were higher then, and the Government wasn't paying Family Support, which today negates a lot of the tax paid by families. For a consistant tax take, wage PAYE, income tax on profits and GST have to be the main-stay of the Governments tax package. I recent years, New Zealands population has changed dramatically, and a lot of small business owners are new arrivals. From first hand experience, many have no fear of the IRD. Inland Revenue must be more vigilant on cash businesses and ensure that penalties/punishments are well publicised. I consider a low rate Bank Transaction Tax would be accepted by most New Zealanders, and would provide the Government with another income stream. Extending the Bright-Line Rule to five years should be put in legislation as soon as possible. Increasing the GST rate will put many high-employment businesses out of business unless wages are included as part of the GST calculation. Property and wealth taxes are unhelpful and do not provide a steady income stream. Thank you for this opportunity to contribute.

Can you pass it on for me ? Hello Tax Working Group, I’m hoping I’m not the only person to raise this matter, for the unfairness involved seems rather blatant and must surely be widespread! All individuals, no matter what their relationship status, are taxed at the same (the going) rate. Yet when a person in a married or de facto situation loses his or her job of source of income s/he is not entitled to receive state assistance if his/her partner has an income above some figure around $37,000 (gross) per year. Now, I don’t feel means testing is unreasonable, but I do feel that there should be some recognition within the tax system that a married/de facto person is not necessarily entitled to the same benefits as a single person even though their tax contribution is exactly the same. Memory tells me (possibly incorrectly) that, until some time in the (recent?) past, an individual’s tax was adjusted when or if that person supported ‘dependent’ family members. Apparently this no longer applies. Perhaps it should? Certainly the current system is less that fair. And perhaps I should tell you, from experience, that for a non-professional unemployed person, not receiving state support means that person is virtually excluded from the available job market, since WINZ (quite reasonably I suppose) endeavours to find jobs for only those people on the employment benefit. And WINZ , certainly in the provinces, seems to have a monopoly where the biggest employers are concerned. Not your problem I know, but for some of us, a distressing repercussion of the above tax anomaly.

CGT or Land Tax on home businesses is SEXIST and AGEIST. 2. CGT or Land Tax in home businesses destroys Auckland's aim of reduced commuting. 3. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses will destroy relationships. 4. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments or 'wealth' is really taxing inflation and discourages people from saving for retirement. 5. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments is AGEIST. 6. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments will destroy relationships. Introduction If developers or speculators aren't paying their tax (already required by current tax laws), the bill should not be picked up by small investors, home business business people and 'Mum and Dad' rental property owners who have worked hard and scrimped and saved for retirement. In the past Labour has threatened CGT for home businesses despite the claim that family homes are exempt (see evidence at end of this email). A Land Tax would be even worse: a huge annual fee, not feasible for many small home business and rental property owners. A Land Tax on top of rates would also be a very unfair double dipping Property Tax. Auckland City Council has now stated that rates are really Property Tax: I quote Debbie Acott, Radio NZ 21 November 2017 said that rates are "basically a property tax," and that Aucklanders "wouldn't get any extra services." Many small home businesses will close or instead rent commercial spaces and commute to them. Many small home business owners can't earn enough to make up for huge Land Tax or so called 'capital gains', which are really just housing inflation anyway. Encourage long-term small rental and shares investors who have tried to save up for retirement. Don't punish them for working hard, saving and investing over the years. \[1\] 117 1. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses is SEXIST and AGEIST. Small home businesses are often run by women and by people in semi-retirement. Charging CGT or land tax on small home businesses will prevent many women and semi-retired people from starting a business. Such a tax would be extremely sexist and ageist. 2. CGT or Land Tax in home businesses destroys Auckland's aim of reduced commuting. Working from home policies are part of Auckland’s Draft City Plan. However, Land Tax or CGT on home businesses will destroy Auckland's aims of reduced commuting, as people will be discouraged from working from home. 3. CGT or Land Tax on home businesses will destroy relationships. There will be serious disputes between spouses/partners if one wishes to start a home business and the other may resist if Land Tax and CGT are threatened. 4. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments or 'wealth' is really taxing inflation and discourages people from saving for retirement. A house in 2018 is no better than it was in 1990 - worse, in fact. The so-called 'capital gain' is nothing but inflation. If someone's home business property or rental investment has to be sold, they should be able to afford to buy a similar property, but if CGT is charged, they won't be able to. Long term rental property owners are often small 'Mum and Dad' investors, including retirees have no way of paying annual Land Tax from the rental returns, when just maintenance and rates are difficult enough. And a CGT upon sale would mean that they would never be able to buy a similar property. The same will apply to so-called 'wealth'. There are already extremely low returns on investments. Charging on so-called 'capital gain' is really just taxing inflation. 5. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments is AGEIST. Small rental property holdings are the way many middle-aged and elderly Kiwis have invested. Charging Land Tax or CGT on these will deprive them of their retirement income. 118 6. CGT or Land Tax on rental investments will destroy relationships. Two people each owning a home may wish to live together, while renting out the other home. But if CGT and Land Tax would then be charged on one of the homes, many middle-aged and older people wishing to live together may well decide that they can't afford to do so. Regards, Susan Davis Evidence that Labour wanted home businesses to pay CGT: In 2014 Labour's website included this pdf : ‘Labour’s Fairer Tax System’. “Business run from home Dorothy owns a small gift shop. She owns the building and lives upstairs with her store taking up the bottom floor. 50% of the area of the property is used for commercial purposes, and 50% is her primary residence. At 45 she decides to wind up the business and sell the property. She makes a capital gain on the property of $200,000.” “The family home exemption means the portion of Dorothy‟s property that is for the family home will be exempt. Dorothy is only liable to pay 15% tax on half of the capital gain – as 50% of the area of the property was her primary residence.” 119 Best Regards, Susan Davis 120 From:Graeme Poole Sent: Tuesday, 6 March 2018 9:20 AM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: TAX REVIEW TO IT MAY CONCERN PLEASE FIND SUGGESTIONS ON THE TAX REFORM FROM GRAEME POOLE , MY SUGGESTIONS IS AS FOLLOWING , SCRAP ALL TAXES , HAVE ONLY A TRANSACTION TAX THIS WAS SUGGESTED BY THE LATE JIM ANDERTON WHO RAISED IT , AS BOXING DAY TRANSACTIONS 2017 THE AMOUNT THAT WENT OVER THE 24HOURS WAS QUITE AMOUNT , MORE THEN OVER 12MONTHS BRINGS IN MORE MONEY THEN WAS IS REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE COUNTRY WITH FUNDS THAT IS OVER.

What I find most frustrating, is that I see my KiwiSaver balance going up and up but my student loan never seems to go down very much at all. I would like the opportunity to be able to apply my KiwiSaver and my employers contributions toward my student loans so that I can pay them off faster. I believe many other Kiwis holding student loan debt would also like this choice. I appreciate that saving for retirement is crucial and the KiwiSaver scheme is a good way of making sure that kiwis do this, however the real threat to my retirement is entering retirement with a debt and struggling for decades to pay off a loan while I am still raising a family, it just doesn't seem logical. I don't want to complain and I respect my elders however I feel like my generation has had the worst of it with the way things currently sit, having had to take student loans to pay for my education when the generations before me gained there qualifications for free. Most of my student loans were grown from the hefty interest charges from the 90's, not the initial amount I borrowed. Times are tough for your average working class Kiwi, with the additional stresses of entry level house prices where they are and LVR's makes saving for a house deposit nearly impossible for the working generation now. KiwiSaver and home start grants are a good way to contribute to a first home deposit, however servicing the subsequent mortgage and still putting food on the table is harder when you also have student loan repayments and KiwiSaver contributions being withdrawn every pay. The option to be able to choose where my money goes would be awesome, I could pay off this student loan faster, then co ntinue to contribute toward my future without the fear of another unpaid loan looming on the horizon when I finally can retire, at the current rate it won't be until I'm 90! I don't have extra in the budget to put toward my loans as 'voluntary contributions' but I could cross over my KiwiSaver balance and whack off a substantial amount and with all of my KiwiSaver contributions from my pay reducing the balance, my overall position would be significantly better, faster. I would be able to save more for my first home, save more towards my retirement and have a better standard of living, in the meantime. Please consider putting this idea into the long term tax changes as I know this is an easy way to help Kiwis to help themselves out of debt and save for their futures better.

Because of an aging work force it has been suggested that government be more reliant on taxing capital gains and less reliant on taxing wages. In this 21 st century it has become more critical to stop government borrowing and to modernise taxation to minimi se credit creation. Government bonds can never be assets if the debt is never repaid. It does not matter whether credit (money) is created as debt or debt- free as both cause inflation (invisible taxation) and reduce the purchasing power of our currency. But debt- free money has three immediate benefits. It stops the payment of interest to banks, allows the modernisation of taxation and controls inflation by being spent into the economy not lent. By stopping the diversion of tax revenue away from consumptio n and tangible capital investment allows personal income tax to be abolished and goods and services tax to be upgraded (20- 25%) to tax the economy fairly as it was designed to do (no loopholes). There would be no need to consider inheritance tax, capital gains tax or wealth tax. It is logical to say the more you earn the more you spend, so only the wealthy would say the poor are disadvantaged by such a proposal, but the poor have only so much to spend whereas the wealthy have much more! The “experts” must stop thinking of themselves.

Gretel Elisiva Toleafoa \[1\] 124 From:Jae Ellis Sent: Monday, 5 March 2018 10:04 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission - Tax Working Group I believe strongly you should consider a tax free threshold which is available to all. Given there is GST of 15%, and that low earners tend to spend all their income, it would appear far fairer to have a tax free threshold to benefit those at the lower end of the income scale. Currently taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket pay actually in excess of 25% income tax if you combine the lowest 10.5% tax rate and GST payable out of already tax paid funds. Both the UK and Australia have a tax free threshold (and probably a lot of other countries too). It would be a much fairer way to ensure those at the bottom of the income ladder were incentivised to work and those who can only find or do part time would be better compensated. I also believe a capital gains tax allowance should be available every year so you can either use it (or not) as per the UK system. This ensures smaller gains are not taxed at all and takes many smaller investment returns out of the taxation system, and seems fairer to investors who rely on their investments for income. Having recently returned from the UK, I have been shocked at the number of ordinary people I know who have amassed large portfolios of property and capital gains under the lax and unfair taxation of this class of asset over the past two decades. They pay little or no money into pension schemes or any oth er investments and their gains have been made at the expense of tenants unable to save a deposit and ordinary home buyers competing in a distorted housing market. No other investment is so favourably treated. I especially find it extraordinary that (if I understand correctly the FIF rules) a capital gain is realised on overseas funds that ‘increase’ when valued using an improved exchange rates and yet there is no corresponding offset allowed in a tax year when a poor exchange rate has reduced their value, regardless if any gain or loss has actually been realised. Any argument that this is an acceptable method of taxation should logically mean annual increases in investment property valuations should also be subject to the same taxation rate as the FIF tax. It is also of interest that New Zealanders who live in and are taxed in Australia as temporary residents are not taxed on their overseas income. I presume this means there are NZ property owners who live as temporary residents in Australia but do not pay any tax on income or disposal of them here or in Australia, effectively meaning they are outside the taxation regime of either country. This loophole should be closed by the NZ Government. http://www.beyondaccountancy.com.au/something-every-kiwi-in-australia-needs-to-know/ I look forward to the outcome of the Working Group and trust you will bring innovative and exciting change to the New Zealand taxation regime to encourage a fairer and more productive society. \[1\] 125 From:Andrew Fergus Sent: Monday, 5 March 2018 9:21 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Suggestions Hello I am a NZ tax agent and a qualified accountant. I have three recommendations for the tax working group (TWG). Introduction My view is that New Zealand is a not currently a high value economy, as evidenced by the relatively low median wage compared to the more well developed countries in the OECD (18th per here: https://data.oecd.org/earnwage/average-wages.htm). The only country of note behind us is Japan but they have a number of systemic issues that differ to New Zealand. Similarly sized countries like Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark are all ahead of New Zealand. We also have a relatively low rate of saving being 19th in the OECD. Why? In my opinion it is because the cost of living in New Zealand is expensive. For example, the consumer is expected to pay international prices for locally produced milk products and yet we do not earn international wages! For some years we have had a struggling middle class that cannot get ahead. I believe there are too many middle men adding extra costs onto products and we have 'leakage' in our tax take. However, New Zealand is in an enviable position of being a net exporter of food products and the Government should be doing all it can to ensure New Zealand becomes a high value economy by supporting high value food production and exportation. I say 'enviable' because not all countries are in such a position of being able to feed themselves. When this is combined with an increasing global population, it provides a very rosy outlook for the country as a whole. Accordingly, Government surpluses, low unemployment, higher wages, robust social services and increasing OECD rankings will become the 'norm'. Investment should be encouraged into such parts of the economy without penalty for succeeding, i.e. penalties such as wealth taxes. Increased OECD rankings and increased all-round wealth cannot be achieved via wealth distribution by implementing an increased tax burden on, as Sir Michael Cullen says, the "rich pricks". Any such targeted taxes will result in intended consequences. Such individuals have the means, advisers and motivation to avoid any highly targeted taxes and the burden will, once again, be borne by the struggling middle classes who do not have the same means and motivation to structure their affairs to avoid things such as a "wealth tax" (souuce: https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/101970814/new-taxes-could-change-bad- behaviours-suggests-sir-michael-cullen). I believe bad designed taxes will encourage even worse behaviour. There are a number of things that can be done to ensure the tax take is complete, fair and simple. So what can we do that will make a difference? 1) ALL international companies MUST pay their fair share of tax. I realise this is out of scope for the TWG but this statement is not just limited to the obvious examples like Google and Facebook, but other large multinational companies that tend to fly under the radar within the FMCG industry. These companies often export profits to low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland. How many business are paying over-inflated prices for 'secret' ingredients and consulting services as a method of transferring profits out of New Zealand? RECOMMEND the TWG advises the Government to "plug all holes" in the international tax take before introducing new taxes on local taxpayers. \[1\] 126 2) Secondly, Government should also address it's own spending. Rather than imposing new taxes to cover additional spending, is the Government doing all it can to address inefficiencies in it's own spending? The taxpayer should not have to pay for inefficiencies. Inefficiencies can take a number of forms over and above the obvious frivolous spending and entitlements - it includes areas such as "do we need 120 MP's in a country of 4.7 million?" Why do we need 13 city councils and 53 district councils? I believe taxpayers are paying for inefficiency. RECOMMEND the TWG insist local and central Government review it's own spending for inefficiencies before introducing any new taxes on local taxpayers. 3) Thirdly, in the interests of transparency and fairness the TWG must recommend the elimination of taxes on taxes & levies. Where a consumer or taxpayer is required to pay a levy or a tax of sorts, then such levies or taxes must be exempt from GST. For instance, GST is levied on property rates - the homeowner has no choice by to pay this levy imposed by local Government, on which another tax (i.e. GST) is then imposed by central Government. From the perspective of the ratepayer this is a tax on a tax. Another example of a tax on a tax is ACC levies. Where the levy is distinct and separately charged then removal of GST will be simple. However, where the levy is buried within other costs (such as fuel taxes and alcohol & cigarette duties) then it would be impractical to do so and I do not recommend the removal of GST on such products. RECOMMEND the TWG propose removal of taxes on levies. 4) Lastly, I do not support a general capital gains tax (or a wealth tax which is a CGT by stealth) over and above the current provisions for CGT as contained in the Income Tax Act. After all, taxes have been paid through the process of creating this wealth and the country as a whole has benefited from investments made into productive parts of the economy. For example, by investing in farming numerous taxes are paid over many years (PAYE, ACC, Income tax, fuel levies, GST and so forth) but the transfer of the farm from one generation to the next may result in unintended capital gains and, I fear, capital gains tax. If such a risk exists for business owners, who are the backbone of wealth creation for the country, then will such taxes discourage entrepreneurs from establishing businesses in New Zealand? In some cases the wealth has increased due to the impact of the inflationary policies of central Government. Given the spending power of money diminishes with time due to inflation, if the TWG is going to recommend a capital gains tax then I strongly urge the TWG to recommend that any such gains be adjusted for the effect of inflation over the term of the investment. For example, if an investment (e.g. business, farm, property, shares etc) increased in value at the rate of say 3% per annum and the average CPI inflation over the same time period was say 2% then any CGT would only be imposed on the difference being 1%. For the Government to enact policies that drive up inflation and asset prices, only to then tax such gains is, to put it mildly, no better than daylight robbery. In addition, if the TWG are to recommend a CGT then it should only be due and payable once the asset has been sold and/or liquidated (i.e. 'realised'). There are a number of taxpayers who are asset rich but cash poor (e.g. retirees) - they will not have the income or cash to pay CGT on unrealised gains. Given banks will not lend to people without an income, who is going to fund CGT on unrealised gains in a non-predatory manner? Lastly, if the Government is prepared to tax capital gains, then it must give tax refunds for capital losses. DO NOT RECOMMEND a blanket CGT. RECOMMEND the TWG apply inflation adjustment to any new capital gains taxes. RECOMMEND the TWG only apply any new capital gains taxes to realised capital gains. 127 RECOMMEND the TWG advise the Government to treat capital losses in the same manner as capital gains.

Our system is very unfair in taxing total income (including gains in value) from "investment" in land very lightly versus taxing income from work/business. The "Intention" test in section CB6 of the Income Tax Act is one of the most easily avoided tax laws. I really believe the government should introduce a flat land tax, billed with rates, possibly using different % rates for different land types and/or regions. This coul d be an adjustable % based on the average annual value rise over the past 5-10 years. There will be no need to file returns with IRD, and very little work to collect the tax. No exceptions for family home - lawyers and accountants love exceptions. Reduce income tax and GST a little as part of the introduction. Over investment in land is a key part of the NZ economy. The main idea behind capitalism is that profits are reinvested in productive enterprises providing more jobs and therefore more income flowing through the economy. The ownership of residential property does not meet the criteria of productive enterprise. Do you want to continue to encourage a nation of landlords with serious tax benefits from investing in land? Why not encourage investment in businesses that provide employment by reducing taxes on income? Refer to the previous tax working groups suggestion in 2009. So many New Zealanders are obsessed with property investment, a land tax has a captive audience - easy to introduce, easy to collect and easy to administer with the help of QV, as long as there are no exceptions. Yours sincerely, Marcel Spencer \[1\] 129 From:Sarah Russell Sent: Monday, 5 March 2018 7:09 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the tax working group Can we break the mold and have a transaction tax on every dollar which changes hands? This would mean that no one can avoid tax and those who spend the most pay the most tax. I'm not certain if you would need a higher rate of transaction tax on certain types of transaction but I'm hoping you will look at this. I think the cost of administer ing the current system, chasing all those who avoid paying tax here or who have a good accountant to reduce their tax obligation, and collecting GST etc, would be greatly reduced by introducing a blanket transaction tax and scrapping all other taxes. It wo uld appear to take the tax burden off the low/middle income earners, who pay the most tax at present, (like my whole income goes on living and none is saved) and would possibly help create an egalitarian society once again. While you're at this can you look at how profits are taken out of the country by international firms, and especially Australian Banks (if this is part of your brief?). We allow Billions each year out of the country and I think there should be a limit (or if there is already a requirement, make it a higher one) on the percentage of profit which is allowed to leave. Obviously some would go but can we legislate so that more is reinvested, specifically in creating employment, in this country where the profit is made so we don't leak so much wealth to prop up someone else's country with our hard earned money? Regards and best wishes in your task (something we have needed for many years).

I’m a software engineer working for a local Dunedin company PocketSmith. I’d like to own a house one day soon. Around me I am constantly seeing houses increase in v alue as housing is traded, speculated on, land banked & undersupplied. Why are we so keen on having market mechanisms be free for housing? I believe housing is a human right, a right for all NZers to be sheltered and not impoverished. We know that since 1984, house prices have been steadily rising. Supply has fallen, immigration has increased with nowhere to house people. Wealth inequality is rising and it is the worst it has been in New Zealand & climbing. Housing is now a privilege in New Zealand. Most concentrated wealth in New Zealand is in assets such as houses (and yes, the family home). We must consider a fair way to tax all people, and redistribute the wealth fairly among New Zealanders. An asset tax of some sort must be put in place, so that people who are sitting on their wealth and not earning through traditional income means contribute to the economy. Over 30% of us now rent, with not much hope for home ownership. We need to cut income tax for everyone, introduce a (very small) wealth tax on housing & assets. This will take strain off lower income earners as income tax cuts will affect them most. We shouldn’t encourage market bubbles, and where they exist they aren’t useful to anyone aside from the people partaking in them. We need to stop this neoliberal approach to housing, it’s unproductive for the economy, and it’s corporate welfare for the property investors whom land bank and speculate. Please consider taxing the family home with the tax working group, excluding it is nonsense and extremely ideological. Past tax working groups have proposed such wealth redistribution, but (all) governments have been complicit in the idea of a free market - perhaps because certain ministers own property. Push away from unproductive and inhumane investments in the housing market, incentivise investment in companies and innovation so we can progress economically. Please think of the future, this is not a time for shortsightedness. Thanks for the consideration, Lachlan Scown \[1\] 131 From:Vani Elkhishin Sent: Thursday, 1 March 2018 9:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax review submission The margin between those earning up to 14,000 and up to 48,000 is 7%, yet the margin between those earning over 48,000 and 70,000 is 12.5% and then those that earn over 70,000, its a difference of 3%? Yet those earning up to $14,000 get some financial subsidies, those in the mid range pay the most tax for the least benefit - no Community services card, low or nil accommodation supplement, reduced FTC (parents). I propose a fairer tax system that does not penalize the middle income band as there is a huge jump from 17.5% to 30% and yet those earning more than 70,000 only pay 3% extra. There needs to be better scaffolding of income/tax brackets to reflect living costs and different living situations i.e. 2 income households vs single income households. A professional (Uni grad) still paying off student loan who is a single parent is pretty much without adequate financial supplements/supports as FTC and "in work" tax is quickly taken away. this person took a better paying job where the person was earning $11,200 more but is about $75 poorer each week because FTC, Accommodation supplement, in work tax, Community services card have all been pulled away or reduced drastically. This person gets about 815 per week net and 1211 gross after Kiwisaver, PAYE and student loan repayments. This is why a lot of single parents choose to remain on the benefit- they are financially disadvantaged when they work and are worse off financially. There is little opportunity to better oneself financially with limited resources and owning a home is a pipe dream. If NZ wishes to minimize benefit dependence, those on a benefit need an attractive incentive but when the difference between working and being on a benefit is negligible, what is the incentive? Those on a benefit get financial aid, those on a high income bracket get tax breaks, those in the middle earning 40,000 - 80,000 are getting the worst deals, which is compounded when it is then a single income household. I am hoping this tax review would make a meaningful change that is fair for all ratepayers and give New Zealanders' a fair opportunity to progress rather than the lower/middle income earners being in a holding pattern of working to survive. Thank you.

Taxation is a necessary evil for co-operative societies to fund government. At present we tax consumption and income. But we do not tax wealth. The wealthier section of society has the greatest capacity to contribute to the common good, but often avoids paying their fair share of income tax by manipulating their assets into trusts and investing in assets which yield untaxed capital growth, with little or negative income. This may be legal, but it is not fair. They pay GST on their consumption, but proportionate to wealth, they pay much less than poorer taxpayers. The increasing gulf between the wealthy and the poor is socially and politically div isive. A wealth tax would reduce the disparity and be seen as a step to a more equitable distribution of income and wealth. I propose consideration of the introduction of an annual wealth tax on all residents and trusts at a low rate, such as 0.5%. That would be $5,000 per annum on every net $1 million assets. A low rate means it is readily afforded with a low incentive for manipulations to avoid it, unlike income tax which is typically sixty times higher at 30%. \[1\] 133 Tax would be assessed on net wealth (assets less liabilities) owned by the taxpayer, including assets overseas. For administrative simplicity there could be a threshold or initial exemption of $X million, applicable to individuals, but not to trusts. If trusts had an initial exemption like real persons, that would allow avoidance of the tax by dissipation of wealth into trusts. Trusts not having the same exemption or threshold as individuals would mean all trusts would be liable for tax on their net worth. This would, unfortunately, extend the reach of the tax to affect many non-wealthy beneficiaries of family trusts. This is likely to be the greatest source of opposition to this proposal. But given the low rate of 0.5% this would be affordable to many trusts. And should this prove an intolerable burden, the trust could be dissolved and the assets distributed to the beneficiaries, who would only pay wealth tax if they exceeded the threshold. Ideally, charitable trusts should also be taxed to discourage pseudo charitable trusts being established to avoid the wealth tax. Charities pay GST at present but no income tax. This is likely to be highly contested and may not be politically acceptable. The level of the personal threshold/exemption would determine how many taxpayers were liable for wealth tax. A higher level would affect a fewer number, which is easier administratively but yield less tax. I suggest a threshold of about $5 million would be appropriate. The NZ government statistics show that as at 30 June 2015, the top 10 percent of New Zealand households accounted for around half of total net worth. The top 1 percent of New Zealand households had 18 percent of total net worth. 134 An argument against wealth tax is that it encourages capital flight. But given the low rate, is it likely that many residents would flee NZ to avoid a 0.5% tax on their wealth? But capital flight into trusts domiciled overseas to benefit NZ residents is a problem which would need to be addressed. Valuation of assets would be needed to assess the tax. Bank balances and cash are explicit. Share in quoted companies have daily valuations on the stock exchange. Property has rateable valuations. The problems are likely to be greatest in valuations of shares in private businesses, intangibles, collectibles and consumer durables, but this is not insuperable. When we had estate duties, valuations had to be assessed on all types of assets. Possibly some NZ domiciled assets held by non-residents could be included in certain circumstances, such as land, without any offset of liabilities to prevent avoidance by borrowing against the asset. Wealth tax on non-productive assets (such as un-utilised land) held by taxpayers without ability to pay could be accumulated as a debt secured against that asset, similarly to unpaid rates. At 0.5% it would take 200 years to erode the asset to nil value. A well-constructed wealth tax would be: o universal (like our GST and Superannuation) o at a low rate which minimises incentives to avoid and evade o targeted at the wealthy who have the ability to contribute more to our tax pool but who often pay little tax. Capital gains taxes, gift duties, stamp duties on property transfers, land tax and death duties are all crude, arbitrary and distortive compared to a tax on significant wealth. 135 Why not consider a wealth tax? Add a UBI (universal basic income) and we would be a more equitable, prosperous and harmonious society.

Investments in companies resident in these countries were taxed only on dividends if they were held on capital account (which was the case for most individuals). Dividend-only taxation was, in many instances, an inappropriate tax base because many foreign companies have a policy of paying low or no dividends. The investor could still, however, derive an economic gain from the investment via an increase in the share price. It was therefore quite easy to achieve a low tax or no tax result for direct portfolio investment in shares outside New Zealand. This could give higher income or more sophisticated taxpayers significant scope to minimise their tax burden by investing offshore. Residential rental property investment in NZ also achieves the same result for many investors. Refer to the University of Auckland study that shows the annual cash return from properties (especially in Auckland) is way below the risk free rate - so why would you invest other than expected capital gain. http://www.nzherald.co.nz/university-of-auckland/news/article.cfm?c\_id=1503679&objectid=11942765 It is time to introduce a flat land tax on all land in NZ - invoiced with rates. Refer to the 2008/2009 Tax Working Group report on land tax. No exemptions for family home - lawyers and accountants love exemptions. Use slightly different rates for different land types, or even for different regions. These can be calculated by QV, invoiced with rates so there is not a lot of extra work for IRD to collect them. And no way of avoiding/minimising or evading this tax. At the same time as a land tax introduction, income tax rates can be reduced and the GST rate reduced a little lower. Broaden the tax base and provide more of a tax incentive to earn money from productive enterprises and more of a tax cost for non productive investment. GST and the massive market reforms of the 1980’s were considered bold and necessary even though they were unchartered territory at the time. A serious change in how we as a society view residential property is needed now. To reduce the chance of a serious property crash with nasty economic consequences, the land tax rate can gradually be increased over 2-3 electoral terms with corresponding reductions in income tax and GST. Do you just want to tinker around the edges of this problem with a miniscule extension to the Bright Line Test, or a capital gains tax with a bunch of exemptions, or do you want to make meaningful long term change? Or are too many politicians so invested in residential property combined with the fear of upsetting the property owning voters for you to make meaningful and necessary change? \[1\] 138 I own my house.

The Government's declared ambition is to achieve this by 2050. This is a laudable ambition - extremely aspirational in its scope and, as NZ Forest and Bird has proposed, akin to New Zealand's own Apollo mission of placing humans on the Moon. However, and as expected, vast sums of money will be required to deliver on this ambition. Given the vagaries of politics and economic performance, a critical question is how might we ensure for the necessary investment over the very long term ? I believe we have a huge opportunity to fund the required investment for Predator Free New Zealand (PFNZ) AND at the same time provide for the necessary investment in tourism infrastructure. This would be through the introduction of a tourist surcharge at point of entry. If you like, a tourist tax. Say ... $100 per person, irrespective of duration of stay, frequency of entry/exit, or intended activity. And it should be charged at point of entry. Accumulation of funds should be to a specific account and therefore protected cf. into consolidated funds. Funds are then be used to support three things, namely 1) tourism infrastructure (e.g. clean water, toilets and sanitation, recycling, etc), 2) emergency services such as when visitors need rescue which seems to happen repeatedly when inexperienced individuals or groups go into the bush woefully \[1\] 2 uninformed and unprepared and get into trouble, and 3) predator eradication. As progress is delivered in predator eradication, we begin to intensify the future benefits of eco-tourism as our bird-life recovers and flourishes. It's possible such a surcharge will serve to dissuade a number of visitors from coming. But this may be no bad thing given current tourist numbers are already swamping our capacity and given the alarming predictions for growth in visitor numbers. That said, we should not underestimate the relative inelasticity of demand for our tourism product. And besides - it already costs visitors a LOT of money to come to Aotearoa - another $100 is very marginal on top of that. This is a much more efficient approach than incidental charges imposed at any point of use or via a 'room tax'. It negates the need to set up some complex system of excusing residents from charges for use of a product, service or activity than would be necessary under a user pays system. Regards don ———————— Don Kerr \[1\] 3 From:Andrew Yeoman Sent: Tuesday, 17 April 2018 6:30 AM To: TWG Submissions; Subject: Ring fencing losses proposal To whom it may concern, I am writing regarding the proposal to ‘ring fence losses for property investors’ that is going through the Tax Working Group currently. By way of background, our company built more homes in Hamilton than any other company last year. We focus on the more affordable end of the new housing market with our homes being sold for between $399k and $749k with an average of about $550k. A large percentage of these homes were purchased by investors for long term rentals – and the majority of these were ‘mum and dad’ investors purchasing their first investment property. The rental market in Hamilton is in dire need of more houses with the vacancy rate (according to the two largest rental agencies in Hamilton with approx. 5,000 rentals between them) of less than 0.5%. An effect of ring fencing losses, will be that these ‘mom and dad’ investors will have their cashflow worsened by between $150 and $300 per week. But the effect on these current landlords wont be the main effect. The main effect will be that the future ‘mom and dad’ investors of next year and the year after, quite simply, will not be there. This proposal to change their taxes will have the effect that this investor market for buying new homes will completely disappear. Yes, there may still be the professional investors that continue to buy homes for rentals; but it is no secret that the majority of rental homes in NZ are owned by ‘mom and dad’ landlords that own only one or two rental properties. If these ‘mom and dad’ investors are no longer purchasing new homes, the effect will, quite simply, that we will build up to 80% less houses than we did the year before. If the proposal to ring fence landlords losses goes through, this will happen: 1) We (and I am sure a significant number of other builders and developers) will build significantly less houses 2) The lack of new rental houses will cause rents to skyrocket 3) The HNZ waiting list will increase dramatically 4) Homelessness will increase as people are unable to afford (or even find) houses to rent Conversations I’ve had with other builders and developers indicate that they will be far less likely (or able) to take on new projects if this ‘mom and dad’ investor market isn’t there. This would be extremely damaging to the housing market Please take this into consideration before making a final decision.

The tax system in New Zealand requires, to my mind, major overhaul. These changes encompass other issues too, such as the legality of cannabis, alcohol regulation, climate change, poverty, tobacco, generational wealth and opportunity. Tax is New Zealand is progressive. That's a good start. However we can do much better. I would like to see the following changes. Reduce GST overall, but introduce a tiered approach. Items fall into categories for example high risk or beneficial. High risk goods would be linked to societal, environmental or personal harm if used incorrectly or regularly. Examples of high risk would be alcohol, personal vehicles, tobacco and possibly meat and dairy. Beneficial goods boost public health – fruits, vegetables, public transport, bicycles. And so on. This could be hard to define, but not beyond a framework. Introduce a progressive inheritance tax to help prevent family 'dynasties'. Make the corporate/business tax rates tiered and progressive. Raise the personal tax-free threshold. Introduce another top-end tier for those earning above $130k and re-calibrate the remaining brackets. Raise taxes overall – I imagine the top rate being about 50%, and the current highest rate raising from 33% to about 40%. Legalise recreational cannabis under tight age controls. Don't make the same mistakes we've already made with alcohol. Tax cannabis. Raise taxes on alcohol significantly. Introduce a capital gains tax, starting with property, but extending to other capital. Wealth breeds wealth. Land-banking, greater private ownership and the decline in owner-occupied homes all impact society as a whole negatively. Increased taxes on plastics and oil. Decreased taxes on small business. Tax breaks for efficiency measures, such as business mergers and shared office spaces. Tax breaks for recycled goods or services – commercial and personal composting, repairs services (including cobblers, clothing repairs, jewelers and IT services). Tax breaks for civil service jobs such as teachers, nurses, police and elderly care. This would encourage training in these positions. Obesity tax. Foods and drinks proven to cause or contribute to rising obesity levels should be discouraged via tax. Fizzy drinks and high salt or fat foods would also be candidates. \[1\] 6 Green growth tax break. Reduce taxes on new tree planting, sustainable forestry, personal greenery and planting. Electric vehicle tax breaks. Reduced car registration costs. Reduced GST. Reduced import tax. Tax breaks for business selling a high-percentage of electric vehicles. Tax free necessities. Tampons and sanitary items, dentistry, nappies, toothpaste. Anything required to live a decent and healthy life should not be taxed. Repeal tax-exempt status of religious organisations. Profit should be taxed fairly, religious beliefs or otherwise. The above changes would contribute to a vibrant, sustainable and ethical society. One where everyone, our environment and ecosystems are afforded opportunity to thrive. Aim high. We can do better for everyone. Sam Judson 7 From:Heather Heron-Speirs Sent: Monday, 16 April 2018 8:30 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission regarding land tax and capital gains tax Dear Sir Michael and TWG members I have only one brief submission to make, mostly regarding the idea of an annual land tax, but with a note also regarding a capital gains tax. My focus is farming land. I share ownership of a block of dairy-support land in the Horowhenua. Depending on the rate charged, of course, a land tax would very likely be unaffordable for my farm owning partnership. This is because the capital value of our land is completely disproportionate to the income that we derive from it, under our lease. Our annual lease income (ex GST) as of 1 June 2017 is $162,285. The govt valuation on the leased portion of our land, as at October 2016, is $5,539,283. This means our income – before ac counting for expenses or other taxes – is under 3% of the value of the land. If a land tax of any meaningful percentage was imposed, it would therefore seem likely that we would not be able to afford it and would have to sell the land. We are the third generation of our family to own this land, and we have a vested interest in its care, accordingly, as well as in the local community, and the block of native bush on an un- leased portion of it. Sale of the land would therefore have a number of detrimental effects, and not only for our family, but for the community and the environment. I believe the present land use is responsible, in terms of land care and sustainability, and that a more intensive approach would be more damaging, and may still not produce enough profit to pay a land tax. I think a similar scenario would affect a great many farming families. And I believe that intergenerational farming – whether family or iwi based – is the most healthy for the land, as it incentivises long term sustainability and improvement. I therefore oppose a land tax on the grounds that it would likely put a lot of family farming arrangements out of business, replacing them with corporates with short-term goals, and/or force a level of intensification that is not healthy and sustainable for the land. I would prefer a capital gains tax, which can be paid upon sale of the land. However, in the structuring of that tax too, I urge that provision be made to enable/encourage intergenerational retention of land by families, in the interests of the land itself. The health of the land is increasingly vital as pressures from population and climate change mount, and the people who are most strongly incentivised to care for the land are those who intend to pass it on to future generations. Thank you for your consideration of these points.

The value of monetary transactions in New Zealand is substantial and a tax applied to every Dollar transacted would also be substantial. All current taxes could be abolished such as GST, Income tax, company tax ( that many companies avoid ), fuel tax and road user tax. A great deal of revenue is lost to the Government due to smart tax lawyers and accountants that find many loopholes in the current tax rules and regulations. These rules and regulations can also be abolished as there will be only one Tax. Overseas companies profiting by smart accounting practices of only providing enough resources to run their NZ operations and exporting produce at cost do not pay tax. These companies will at least have to pay transaction tax on all revenue in and resources purchased for production. At the moment the stock market, gambling, some real estate investment, used cars to name a few do not attract tax but would pay the tax indirectly through a transaction tax. This form of taxation is simple and fair, it taxes every dollar, does not discriminate from whom or where, there are absolutely no loopholes, it cannot be avoided. This form of taxation should be seriously considered as it is fair, is simple to understand and simple in its application. By knowing the Dollar value of National transactions made annually and the amount of tax revenue received by the Inland Revenue annually it is possible to arrive at cents per dollar Tax rate, this could probably then be fixed for quite some time. \[1\] 10 From:Elizabeth Aaron Sent: Monday, 16 April 2018 4:40 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission A SOCIETY WHICH HAS AN UNFAIR TAX REGIME IS NOT CIVILISED. REGRESSIVE TAXATION IS NOT FAIR. Elizabeth Aaron \[1\]\[1\] 11 From:Benjamin Wylie-van Eerd Sent: Monday, 16 April 2018 4:00 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to tax working group To the members of the tax working group, I have read the Future of Tax Submissions Background paper published by the tax working group, and would like to make a submission. I will structure the submission according to the Questions for submitters in guideline 3, but first I will provide a summary of my most important recommendations. 1. I recommend that the guiding principle for design of a modern tax system be horizontal equity. Minimum distortion to market signals should be an important basic goal, only trespassed with good reason. I realise and celebrate that governments will want to do things which distort market signals, but this should be done visibly and politically rather than invisibly and in the background by the IRD. 2. I recommend that taxes designed to reduce behaviours detrimental to the environment be introduced. This is despite 1. above - the cost of climate change, loss of biodiversity, pollution etc. is not part of the cost of goods and services right now, and therefore there is good reason to violate horizontal equity for this reason. 3. I recommend that the tax working group consider how they can work together with the welfare system to ensure all New Zealanders enjoy a minimum standard of living, health and wellbeing. 4. Specifically, I recommend that all proceeds of individual investment be taxed equally to individual income from employment. This includes business income, dividends, imputed rent, other non-cash benefits of asset ownership, and also capital gains of assets when sold, and capital gains of assets when a loan is taken out against them. Investment decisions must not be driven by tax settings. I realise that aspects of these recommendations fall outside the terms of reference of the tax working group, but I nevertheless must stress the importance of taxing assets equally no matter what form they take. Our historical and current special tax treatment of residential land has driven investment in New Zealand away from areas where it is desperately needed, which ironically includes in higher quality and higher density housing itself. The negative consequences are high. Specific questions from appendix 3, questions for submitters Chapter 2: I see the main risks for the tax system over the medium- to long- term as: an increasing share of the economy in assets/speculation compared to wages; increasing tax avoidance activity by global corporations; and increased inequality. The latter is a risk in that the methods of taxation will be seen as increasingly unfair the more unequally income and wealth are distributed. Consent of the governed is an public good worth maintaining. The tax system can change in response to the identified risks by: increasing the proportion of tax that is collected from non-wage sources; working together with our trading partners to capture ea sily moved global corporation profits, preventing races to the bottom; providing higher levels of redistribution in total when concentration of wealth is accelerating. Tikanga Māori, in particular kaitiakitanga but also potentially manaakitanga are good principles to keep in mind, and also langage to use when communicating with the New Zealand public. Preservation of the environment and of society are goals we all share. Chapter 3: \[1\] 12 The principles I would use to assess the tax system are: Are we minimising distortions to the economy in the ways we collect tax?; and does the tax system together with the welfare system ensure acceptable minimum standards of living, health and wellbeing for all New Zealanders? A fair tax system to me would mean that regardless of the source of income - be it wages, business income, dividends, imputed rent, other non-cash benefits of asset ownership, and also capital gains of assets when sold, and capital gains of assets when a loan is taken out against them - my tax bill would be the same as someone else with the same total income but a different mix of classes. I also consider it fair that those of us whose labour is not being currently demanded by employers in aggregate are supported by those of us who do have jobs or other sources of wealth. However, I realise that this is not the purview solely of the tax system. The welfare system is also of vital importance here. Chapter 4: I propose that 'broad-based, low-rate' is a good guiding principle for the future for NZ, but that our current tax system falls short of that goal. In order to improve it, the tax base must be broadened to include things currently excluded, including imputed rent and capital gains. I believe there should definitely be a greater role in the tax system for taxes to intentionally modify behaviour. These should primarily be used in the case of market externalities such as environmental taxes. I believe that there is also a good argument for using behaviour taxes to nudge people towards the collective optima of various systems where individual optima do not align with collective optima. Encouraging saving for retirement is one example of where individual optima are not in alignment with collective optima, thus I think it is a possible candidate for a behavioural tax as mentioned above. Chapter 5: Ideally I would say that the speculative economy does not need to be supported by the tax system. Investment is what most money wants to do anyway, it can take care of itself, supporting the productive economy is the more important goal. However, as a small country I am aware of the need to compete with other nations over foreign investment, and accept that our tax system will to some degree reflect that. The New Zealand tax system is already very good at minimising costs on business. The compliance costs are relatively low, and the imputation credits system is a good solution to avoiding double-taxation for owners. No action needed. The tax system definitely does not do enough to maintain natural capital. Externalities are too rife in this market, and costs are far too often not borne by those who benefit. It would be wise to level some behavioural taxes in this area as already noted. I don't know enough specifics to answer the third question, except to recommend again that different sources of income all be taxed equally regardless of type. Chapter 6: The main inconsistency in the current tax system is the treatment of property, especially owner-occupied property. This is clear from the future of tax submissions background paper. To a lesser extent other kinds of investments suffer from this, such as proceeds of shares 'not bought with the intent of selling'. The future of work trends such as casualisation and automation mean that greater shares of income will come from assets rather than wages in the future, so ensuring that income from capital sources is taxed equally to other 13 forms of income is vital. In particular, taxation of imputed rent in owner-occupied housing is important to consider in order to ensure that homeowners are not paying less tax than owners of other assets. I support the introduction of imputed rent tax, and various behavioural taxes to lessen the impact of negative externalities in the environment and other areas. Whether or not other taxes be reduced is a political decision rather than one of tax design. If they are, I once again stress the importance of having all income taxed the same way regardless of source. Chapter 7: The tax system affects housing affordability negatively by disproportionately rewarding those who hold housing assets compared with those who develop residential land, this incentivises fewer houses to be built and we have a huge lack of housing caused in part by this. The tax system can help by removing this disproportionate reward by taxing income and benefits from all sources equally, as discussed previously. Further improvement to the housing situation is outside the scope of the tax system and should be a matter of public investment and/or regulation. I recommend that New Zealand should have a capital gains tax. The existing tax is adequate, if it were to be more widely applied. The gains should be taxed equally to income of any other source. The tax should include the family home, it should include all assets, though it may include a minimum threshold. Payment on realisation or accrual bases both have their drawbacks, one is not clearly better than the other to me. Perhaps if accrual basis is slowly introduced people will have time to restructure their assets to include sufficient cashflow and then that will be the superior option. I do not recommend New Zealand introduce a land tax. Too much of the value land provides, such as environmental health and kaitiakitanga lies outside the market. Therefore it would tend to discourage uses of land that promote either of those things, which is a coercion that I want very much to avoid. I recommend that environmental taxes, carefully designed, are a good stop-gap measure to protect the sustainability of our natural environment while these things remain external to the market. Carbon taxes, water taxes, pollution charges, etc are all much needed. (Domestic cap and trade schemes for all the above would be another possible solution). I don't recommend a progressive company tax. If I understand correctly, the problem that progressive company tax would be trying to solve is distortions to markets caused by barriers to entry and monopoly power. I don't consider progressive company tax rates to be a good solution to this problem. Small companies trying to start up aren't making taxable profits anyway so they would expect to be unaffected by the change. It would just be a subsidy to small non-growth businesses, and I suspect most small non-growth businesses tend to distribute their revenue to their owners anyway, so imputation credits already do that job. I should note that my confidence in this position is relatively weak, I don't have much experience in this space. GST exemptions for particular goods may qualify as a reasonable behavioural modification to the tax system as outlined above. I neither recommend for or against this. I understand that submissions will be proactively released to the public and only redacted or withheld on the grounds of privacy, commercial sensitivity, or any other reason under the Official Information Act. It would be acceptable for the Tax Working Group and the Secretariat to contact me to discuss the points raised, if required.

We believe that any capital gains tax that excludes the family home is unfair to most NZers. If you live in Auckland, Queenstown or Wellington and your home is worth over a million, you will be much better of than those of us in smaller centres, whose home would be worth less than half of that. And if they had an investment in another small property that was also worth less than $500,000 they would be liable for the tax, despite having less actual property value than that house in Wellington, Queenstown or Auckland. Also, if there’s a capital gains tax that excludes the family home, people will put their money into the house rather than another kind of investment. The fact is that we believe a capital gains tax would be both unfair and unnecessary, Arthur & Glenys Woollard \[1\] \[1\] 16 From: Al Bell Sent: Monday, 16 April 2018 3:33 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Submission New Zealand has over 28,000 charities , the highest number per capita in the world. Many of these charities have been formed with the sole purpose of avoiding the payment of tax and run substantial business enterprises making large profits. Many charities are, in fact, phoneys who avoid paying tax but share in all the benefits available to New Zealanders. Many of these so called charities have a restricted membership based on religion or race . I cannot see how the tax system is fair, balanced and maintains the integrity which New Zealanders should expect from its tax system. The principle of equal treatment for all New Zealanders is somewhat lacking in the present system. The Iwis phoney charitable status is based on race and it is not apparent that they contribute very much even to there members but are concentrating on building business empires. Why should the Sanitarium group enjoy tax free status? Gloriavale is another instance of charity status abuse. The Brethren Church owns a trust of over $300m invested in North Island farms. Recently Ngai Tahu purchased a large interest in Hilton Haulage Ltd. I presume the share of the profits which previously attracted tax will no longer be taxable in the hands of Ngai Tahu. Why should these relatively small groups not pay tax when the rest of the population have no option but to pay their share. Charities based on race eg Iwis, or religion have no place in modern society. There would be a lot less need for additional taxes if charitable entities running business were forced to meet their moral responsibilities. The integrity of the tax system is severely compromised by the existence of the present laws regarding Charities.

Key idea: introduce tax reform that will proactively support the cooperative business model and that, as part of a wider legislative framework, aim to promote cooperative businesses in New Zealand. This would be an innovative policy with major long term benefits for New Zealand. It has the potential to transform the economic model for regional development. Cooperative would seem ideally suited to NZ with many small business & a general attitude of self- reliance and innovation. It would be applicable to businesses in all domains and regions, but particularly suited to engineering technology, food processing technology, agricultural and food businesses. Fonterra is an obvious example of success, but with tax and legislative assistance we could see many more smaller cooperative business. The advantages of cooperatives have been well documented, a few relevant to NZ are; Wealth would be created in the community and shared by the community It moves away from the reliance on corporate profit & pressure to lower wages It will reduce global business buy-outs of NZ innovation. It will improve the stability and resiliency of small businesses Emelia-Romania, Italy has over 8000 cooperatives. From wiki: Emilia-Romagna is one of the wealthiest and most developed regions in Europe, with the third highest GDP per capita in Italy. Bologna, its capital, has one of Italy's highest quality of life indices. There are extensive reports and guidelines available from the International Co-operative Alliance. “Cooperative enterprises are influential institutions. In both industrialized and developing countries, cooperatives contribute to socio- economic development, support employment growth, and sustain a more balanced redistribution of wealth.” “The main reason for the success and longevity of cooperatives is that they are not motivated to maximize the rate of profit for investors, but rather to address the needs of communities.” ‘Promoting the Understanding of Cooperatives for a Better World’, Euricse and (ICA) March 2012 Derek Reeves 15 April 2018 Submission to the NZ Government tax working group. \[1\] 19 From:roy hopkins Sent: Sunday, 15 April 2018 12:03 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I propose no PAYE tax.

This would simplify the whole tax system, less IRD overhead. I also believe in lowering fuel tax to boost the economy as fuel cost affects everything that has to be transported. Instead of regional taxes on fuel tolls on roads would make them self funding over time. Tax incentives for environmentally friendly packaging such as paper and cardboard.

Roy Hopkins \[1\] 20 From: Sent:Saturday, 14 April 2018 10:26 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Some responses   Dear Tax Working group, NZ needs a tax system that is generally acceptable to the main political parties so it does not become a political football, so that people and businesses can confidently plan their futures. I have read your discussion document!! - long, but I can see that it needs to be. The issues are complex but very important. As a result of its complexity I now really do wonder if my tiny contribution can be of any use to you, but I will give it nevertheless. I copied the seven questions below which I felt I could relate to from two parts of your discussion document.   Questions I have addressed here:   How, and to what extent, does the tax system affect housing affordability for owners and renters? Is there a case to change the tax system to promote greater housing affordability? If so, what changes would you recommend?  Should New Zealand introduce a capital gains tax (that excludes the family home)? If so, what features should it have?  Should New Zealand introduce a land tax (that excludes the land under the family home)? If so, what features should it have?  Should the tax system do more to support small businesses? In particular, is there a case for a progressive company tax?  Should the tax system exclude some goods and services from GST? If so, what should be excluded? What else should be taxed to make up for the lost revenue?  Should the tax system encourage saving for retirement as a goal in its own right? If so, what changes would you suggest to achieve this goal? Housing affordability and capital gains: I believe the first two questions above are irrevocably linked. We have what I see as a very unbalanced system in the housing market whereby people can make large sums of money doing practically nothing while at the same time tying up considerable capital by abrogating responsibility for tax on their capital gains. This has two really important effects: It pushes up the demand for housing - pretty-well everyone with enough extra money, or the capacity to borrow such, will want to buy an extra property. This heavy demand has grossly distorted prices in NZ over the last few years. In addition to that, this tax-free type of transaction also diverts capital which could otherwise be invested in production - real work as distinct from just sitting there and "making money". Surely the latter is seriously corrosive on our economy. This must stop! \[1\] 21 Land Tax? Probably this should be subject to a capital gains tax also. We have seen a devastating rise in land prices over the last few years as purchasers simply sit on the land waiting for it to double in "value" before they make a killing. This cannot be good for the economy surely! Progressive tax for businesses: This could act as a disincentive for businesses to develop. Maybe businesses of various sizes should be asked how they think they would react? Selective relief from GST: No. I think the strength of the NZ GST system is its universality. This makes it easy to manage both for the businesses and for the tax department. It is a highly effective system as it stands. Retirement saving: This is essential! But it would need to be helped by the government in some way because we know from observation that the majority of people would rather spend their money "right now" than conserve it "in case", yet we all need to have some savings!! Also with the steady drive down over the last few years to being a low wage economy in NZ for many there really does need to be a move towards providing sufficient income so people can live decently, and that includes a little left over to save. You cannot expect people to save when they have insufficient income to feed their family. Maybe Kiwi-Saver should be compulsory. I think that will do for now, but I will watch out for your next document. Thank you for the opportunity to have a say.

Education, health and defence. The wealthy have always avoided paying tax because they forget the benefits they receive such as quiet workers and a society that is stable. The threat of being conquered diminishes as well if a population that will purchase the goods and services that keep them happy. Beggars and rebels cost far more than than paying them a pittance. For a thousand years until modern times Tax was open, public and the army enforced the rich to pay a fair share of their assets to the Govt. ( attached a village tax return 1787 ). This has altered as the poor earned money, (not serfs, slaves or knaves.) Originally William the Conqueror wrote the doomsday book (a thousand years ago) to list the assets and who owned them so as to collect tax and has been continually updated from then on until the 20 th century. PROPOSED TAX FORGOTTEN TAX or MILLENNIUM TAX or MULTI MILLIONAIRES TAX ONLY APPLIES TO ANY SUPER RICH PERSON WHOSE ASSETS ARE MORE THAN 5 MILLION DOLLARS (to be adjusted) LIST ALL ASSETS --A PROPERTY \[1\] 23 SHARES OVERSEAS ASSETS OTHER LIST ALL LIABILITIES --B LOANS DEBTS SUBTRACT B FROM A BALANCE = C C MINUS 5 MILLION = D TAX AT 0. 1 % (to be adjusted) = E TO BE PAID AS TAX. (annually)-$1,000 PER MILLION The Vogal Govt. about 1870 taxed the rich ( 1 shilling per fleece- 25%) and that set NZ to prosperity unlike Argentina that still has major problems 150 years later with extreme stratification of society. Here in NZ the very wealthy sold the large farms to young educated farmers that worked hard so everybody prospered. Wealth by the few is grossly inefficient for prosperity of a nation or the people. Capitol Gains and Death Duties are only fit for Lawyers and Accountants so they promote it.. They exploit everybody. 24 My 3x or 5x gt Grandfather, Mr Hopkins was a Yeoman and had a small holding, This time he paid 12 shillings and 2 pence. 50 years earlier the family paid 5 shillings and 4 pence 3 farthings. In 1603 the family had 3 staff and was fit to fight for the King. The son was not fit but they had access to a pike and a sward . The book Men of Arms in Gloucestershire 1603. Notice the wealthy landowner paid 300 times the tax of the average person. This pattern of the wealthy paying the majority of tax was in place for hundreds of years when extreme differences of wealth was the norm. The poor were ignored and if a problem sent as white slaves to the colonies, first America (they rebelled at this treatment) then Australia. The ship owners made a good profit and organised it . Cheaper than prison. Real history is not published but found in the study of genealogy. The courage to have a fair system will always upset the wealthy because they mentally think that it is their right to lead and exploit the poor. Sadly all societies in history who follow this principle have died out without exception. Break the mould and try to have a happy sustaining civilisation that supports all sectors with respect, it could be done if a positive effect was put in place.

I am the General Manager of a mid-sized Financial Services Organisation; a position I have held for 17 years. I am a Property Investor, a tenant, a Mother (I have a 6 month old baby girl, and two boys aged 4 and 6); I am a tax- payer. And I am deeply concerned about the current revision by the Labour Party, of New Zealand’s Property Investment framework. I wondered if I could trouble you for a few minutes of your time to meet or chat over the phone before the submission date to share my thoughts with you - the primary concern being that the introduction of this legislation will make the housing crisis substantially worse. I have put together some thoughts and research below, but would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the adverse impact of this in person, if at all possible. LEVELLING THE PROPERTY PLAYING FIELD Unless you remove around 250,000 people from New Zealand overnight, the only way to level the property-playing field is to deliver more houses to the market. There needs to be one property for every family to live in, whether they rent or own it is immaterial; shuffling around the composition of ownership between landlords and home-owners, does not deal with the problem. However, if you tinker with the cashflow on the average ‘Mum and Dad investment property’ you are going to create a social housing crisis, the likes of which you’ve never seen before. In Australia, ring- fencing was introduced, and taken away quickly once the government realised that the very people they were trying to help had just been levied a 25% increase on their rents. Should this policy be introduced, we estimate that the cashflow contribution for Mum and Dad investors on a brand new property will increase by up to $300 per week. At this point, given that Mum and Dad investors often don’t have significant cash reserves, they will likely just sell their rental properties. Likely we will see some new housing stock for sale, some of it snapped up by first home buyers, but what happens to the tenants that were living in the rental property before? Currently, private investors assist the government in providing housing to the rental market. In fact out of 600,000 (or thereabouts) rental properties, the private sector currently provides around 450,000 -500,000 of these. Without property investors, the government would have to provide the housing, which it can only do for a very small minority of people. Given the budget appears to be spent already, how do you hope to deal with this? \[1\] \[1\] 29 Not all tenants dream of owning their own home and even if they did, most don’t have a 20% deposit, or even a 5% deposit and a sound credit score. For brand new properties, investors rely on the cashflow benefits of negative gearing - now if you remember that removing this won’t gather any additional revenue for the IRD (it merely provides some assistance in relation to the timing of the tax payable) then it’s actually a fantastic gimme for the government....why you would want to remove this incentive (which costs the government nothing) is totally beyond me. In addition to the displacement of tens of thousands of tenants over the coming months (as the decreasing lack of availability of rental housing bites), there is one other key thing that has been overlooked: developers rely on investors to purchase their properties off the plans, so that they can obtain the finance packages required to build their projects. I know this, because I am a developer, and I have now put my development of 200+ low-cost properties over the next 2 years on hold. I am aware of around 15 other developers who have made the same decision. In a low-cost, - high density project, investors make up (on average) 30% - 35% of the sales. Unless a developer hits the 70% pre-sales threshold, they cannot borrow money from the bank to build their project. New houses typically have lower yields, so the ability to offset the property costs is essential; otherwise the cashflow becomes unaffordable for the average investor. This will obviously compound the problem as developers too leave the housing market. We are supposedly short 100,000 houses - how will this shortfall be addressed with less developers interested in building houses? I know that for my 72-house development in Bayfair, we relied heavily on investors to obtain our finance. I should point out that all these people are long-term investors, providing much-needed rental housing to the market, not speculators. Additionally there will be a reduced GST take on new builds (as there will be less of them), this will affect unemployment also as there will be less jobs in the sector. A very large percentage of New Zealand’s property investors are Mums and Dads who are trying to ensure that they aren’t forced to rely on government super in their retirement. Remember that for people in their 50’s or 60’s, it’s likely that they just don’t have enough time for their kiwisaver to reach a meaningful level. These people will become a burden on the tax-payer as their ability to provide for themselves in retirement is undermined by this policy. Likely the ringfencing issue will be the straw that breaks the camels back for these people, they will sell, and the government will discover too late that they have significantly deepened the homelessness situation and stopped the supply of new houses all at the same time. It will be a disaster. See below a report prepared by BIS Oxford Economics Pty Ltd (Business Intelligence Services) for the Australian market on the negative economic impact of limiting negative gearing. BIS Shrapnel have provided business research and forecasting services to clients since the mid 1960s. http://www.smh.com.au/cqstatic/gnanns/BISShrapnelNegativeGearingReportMarch2016.pdf Although the report is based on the Sydney market, the effect will be similar in New Zealand. I summarise the key salient points below:  Rents will rise by up to 10% per annum  New home building will shrink by around 4% nationally  GDP would shrink by around 1% 30  Fewer jobs would be created over the next 10 years, resulting in the unemployment rate rising 0.1%  Government revenue across a range of taxes would shrink  Tens of thousands of extra households will be pushed into housing rental stress  If the government were to compensate these stressed households, it would require an additional subsidy outlay of hundreds of millions of dollars.  The dwelling stock deficiency will triple  In other words, the impact would go well beyond any savings to a multitude of unintended consequences. We have many New Zealand families that don’t have homes to live in; I agree that we need to ensure that good quality homes are available for them to live in, but this isn’t the solution. The government should be investing in freeing up resources to assist development and investment, not tightening the noose. In summary, I believe that this is a very poorly considered strategy that will likely make the current housing problems much worse You can reach me on Kind Regards, Kylie Turgis KYLIE TURGIS GENERAL MANAGER NZINVEST GROUP  Before printing this, please consider the environment T his email and any attachment is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain information that is privileged, confidential or otherwise protected from disclosure.

The current law requires dementia patients and/or their partners, if their assets exceed a statutory amount, to pay for care in either a commercial or not-for-profit care facility. The current cost of providing for dementia care in a not-for-profit facility is $4,421.67 per month or $53,060 per annum. To produce that amount of fees for care, would require a capital sum in excess of $1,000,000 @ an interest rate of 5%. The income required to pay the care fees is taxable at source. However, because of the asset test, the State does not pay for dementia care until the assets are reduced to the statutory amount allowed. It is unfair that care fees are payable from taxable income when the need for care is not the choice of the dementia patient or his/her partner, but is made necessary by the nature of the medical condition. It is submitted that the fees payable for dementia care should be tax deductible from the income necessary to pay the fees. D.A.

Herein is my very basic submission. I have a very severe case of dyslexia so if this submission does not make sense please phone me as my literacy skills are not very good as in reading and writing. I would like to see what’s known as a transaction tax on all and every NZ dollar exchanged one way. In theory this makes tax evasion and avoidance become and none issue as everyone has to pay it no matter what. Even online It’s realised the issues cash jobs means the others can avoid the transaction tax and also green dollars but that’s already happening now anyway and not good. A one way simple transaction tax also means doing away with tax complexities and enforcement per se... which it itself is even more savings. So no PAYE, ACC, GST the lot goes....or any other type of tax besides this one so should be set at a rate to take them all into account. Also places like Alibaba, trademe or any online trading are captured and can’t avoid the transaction tax without breaking the law... Even hopefully Bitcoin transactions have to pay it. You would have to work out a child support formula and just call it supported child payment rather than a tax... By name there should only ever be one thing called a tax and that’s the transaction tax all other called payments, levy and surcharge, and rates or fees even an excise charge not a tax. .... I would like to see charities be able to apply for a discretionary rebate for the transaction tax on a case by case basses. This not being an automatic right per se. I use the word discretionary rebate as some places like Exclusive Brethren, Gloriavale Christian community clearly run businesses within their charities to avoid taxes under the guise of a charity. As an oversimplified exam ple when Apple NZ make $80 million then Apple USA change Apple NZ $79 million in license fees or other changes. That means the pay tax only on the 1 million. Google and alike all seem to do some find of this in way one or another and suck more money out then they put into the New Zealand economy. As gathering tax is often for the purposes of distribution coupled with the transaction tax should be for all the Universal basic income. That’s because much of the work in the future could be mechanised or robotic and in many cases like driving, accountancy, even lawyering it seems that artificial intelligence (AI) will become so common to the point people are no longer needed. I like what someone said we either need to tax the robots and AI who take over our jobs which means loss of income for whatever human they replace. But those employees lost jobs means the potential for work/employment is taken from them therefore the right to a decent standard of living. Everyone should have a reasonable standard of living. Not just existence level so they barely make ends meet. \[1\] \[1\] 35 We lose billions every year in trusts, tax avoidance and evasion and the UN stated that in one of their reports. So everyone has to pay around 2.5% that would be capture those who current avoid any tax obligations even legally as it were...

Dear Members of the Taxation Working Group, Please find below my submission on possible taxation changes. POSSIBLE TAXATION CHANGES. The problem with the present taxation system is it has no guiding principal (no moral compass) other than the government needs money and where can it get it easily without upsetting the voters too much. The nearest the taxation system gets to a moral compass is its vague belief that it has a duty to imitate Robin Hood. Suggested Guiding Principal of Taxation An economy has traditionally been described as being made up of Land, labour and Capital. In reality a country's economy is made up of everything in that country so the above terms would be more fully described as  Environment  People and their Ideas  Financial System  Information System \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 42 It is my belief as a guiding principal that: "Taxation should be aimed solely at anything that harms any of these constituent parts of an economy". Taxes are after all penalties and disincentives. If this guiding principal was followed it would allow a government to both imitate Robin Hood and protect its economy at the same time. By not following this guiding principal to date:  The Environment especially water quality and supply is suffering  The problems of inequity ,drug & alcohol use, obesity, violence, mental illness and lack of personal upskilling affect many of our people.  New Ideas are tied up too long by IP protection leaving our budding entrepeneurs at a disadvantage.  The economy is constantly nervous of the next financial shock and the productive sector is now seen as the servant of the financial sector and not the other way round.  The internet is increasingly coming under attack by hackers and cyber criminals putting our exciting future at risk. I believe by sticking to the above guiding principal it is possible to get the added bonus of at least being able to curb some of the ills that dog our country, people and economy. The aim of the exercise is for the Government to slowly reduce the need for some of its interventions by discouraging harmful behaviour with the taxation system. To a very large degree, you get what you don't tax and you don't get what you do tax. What Not To Tax To tax (ie penalise) activities that help our country, economy and people seems fool hardy at the very least. The most egregious of the current taxes is income taxes which in the main is a tax on peoples labours, endeavours, purpose and efforts. This is true whether they are wage/salary earners or small business people. Peoples efforts are a good thing not a bad thing for our economy, country and people. Especially for the person making the effort. It is my belief if taxes are removed from income derived from labour and small business this will unleash a tidal wave of entrepreneurial endeavour and peoples desire to upskill themselves. There are other ways to satisfy Robin Hood yet still keep the taxation system moral. Income will also become more difficult to tax as the internet makes the world smaller. It could also be argued that GST on fruit and vegetables and services that require no manufacture or transport is also counter productive. I would also reduce corporate taxes as they will have several new taxes to cope with (as below). What To Tax Take any practical way of taxing or fining activities that hurt any of these constituent parts of 43 our economy. Environment  Carbon and fuel taxes i(ncluding aviation fuel) on any non renewable fuels  Fertiliser (especially Nitrogen)- tax at point of sale.  Plastics- tax at manufacture or import source  Other harmful chemicals or products- tax at point of sale  Water Use - Tax on use across board rural, manufacturing and residential  Dumping of solid wastes- Taxes on legal dumping, Fines for illegal dumping.  Discharge of liquid wastes- Taxes on legal discharge, Fines for illegal discharge.  Physical Goods Production and transport- GST as present repackaged as environmental tax People Could use stick(taxes and fines) and carrot(tax rebates) approach here.  Artificial Sugars-Tax at point of sale or importation  Tobacco- Tax as current ( this tax has had some success when right level was found)  Alcohol- Increase taxes . (Right level not found here yet)  Gambling- Tax incl online if possible  Drugs- Legalize Cannabis and tax Massive fines (that don't go away until paid) and confiscations of assets for drug pushing of any other drugs. Declare gangs involved as terrorist organisations as they do more harm on a daily basis to our people (especially youth & poor) than ISIS ever did.  Violence & Other Crime- Larger fines (that don't go away)  Lack of exercise- ?  Bad Diets- Possible taxes  Lack of Personal upskilling- Tax Rebates for fees incurred in upskilling.  Inequity & Poverty-Entitlement system(reduced) but allow no limit tax rebates for upskilling Ideas  Intellectual Property Protection Tax. All new ideas stand on the shoulders of other peoples older ideas. Having new ideas locked up for long periods as intellectual property is counter productive to other people enhancing those ideas. It is my belief that I.P protection should be granted for only short periods of advantage for the people or company that thought of them. After that to continue the I.P protection a graduated tax should be applied growing higher the longer the I.P stays in place. Thus allowing others to stand on their shoulders also. Financial System 44  Comprehensive Capital Gains Tax on all Assets. Including all property, Shares, Interest, Bonds ,Cryptocurrencies etc...(preferred option) In steps Robing Hood.  OR Tax on yearly bank lending increases beyond the yearly increase in productivity of the Country. -Tax banks directly but allow banks to trade between each other market share losses and gains. The aim would be to apply tax on Net lending increases above productivity increases over entire sector lendings.  Fines or taxes on use of dangerous financial instruments. Explanation: The achilles heel of our fiat currency, fractional banking system is that both the money supply and debt in the system can grow much faster than the productive capability of the country. It is in the end the productive sector that pays the interest bill on this debt. Unfortunately because of interest charged on this debt and without enough regular bankruptcies the debt grows faster than the money supply. Thus since the US took us off the gold standard in the early 1970s there has been regular financial crisis (roughly every decade) due to debt in economies outpacing their productive sectors ability to pay for that debt. Along with reckless behaviour of financial sector each crisis gets a little worse.(incidentally NZ inc. has not made a profit with the rest of the world since the early 1970s). Also because of this flaw, it was the 1970s when productivity increases started to separate out from and leave behind labour wage increases. This separation has continued ever since meaning that it is now much easier to make money out of capital (if you have access to it), than it is out of your own labour. These successive financial crisises have led to central banks now only able to run low interest rates for fear of collapsing the entire system. While raging asset price inflation has been left unchecked. I'm not a gold bug but believe just having rapid inflation in revaluing up the same asset classes over and over with the ensuing debt is doing harm to the people, economy and country. Capital gain taxes to curb this excessive lending for asset revaluing is really just a necessary band aid for the deeper problem of this flaw in our fiat currency, fractional banking system. When you peel back all the layers of the onion of inequity & an unstable financial system it is 45 this flaw that is at the centre and is the real cause. (The real answer would be for the world led by the US to put the productive sector back in its rightful place as master and the financial sector back as the servant thus returning banks back to simple savings and lending banks. \[Stopping the tail from wagging the dog\] Allowing only the central banks to increase the money supply at a rate tied roughly to productive sector growth. Thus creating a "Sound Money Supply" and turning the world back to real Capitalism and market signals. It would be suicide for NZ to do this on its own as our currency would rapidly appreciate in value leaving it hard to export.) So we are left with our band aid solutions. A Comprehensive Capital Gains Tax would have the advantage of letting Robin Hood into the picture. However a Capital Gains Tax on top of Income tax and GST would be too much for people to swallow. They are currently being taxed when they toil, shop, drive and when they eat. To tax them on their houses or shares when they are resting or sleeping will not be acceptable. However if the cessation of "income tax" derived from labour and small business was offered as a trade off along with GST off healthy food. I think it would be possible to implement a comprehensive Capital Gains Tax and new environmental taxes. It would need to be phased in to keep the net tax take neutral. Information System  Hacking & Criminal Activity on internet.-This needs to be taken much more seriously as it has the potential to damage our bright future. Again the stick needs to be applied wherever possible and with sufficient force to be effective. Maybe some small rewards for reporting such activity. CONCLUSION: A New Future What would the future look like if the above suggestions were implemented for a working family, small business or farming family. They would  Not be taxed on their efforts, jobs or small business income  Taxed on their addictions and personal vices  Be given tax rebates on any upskilling costs  Taxed or fined on any environmental damage  Be taxed on any Capital Gains Its my belief that the positive side effects for New Zealand of adhering to this guiding principal would include 46  A more sustainable environment  Happier, healthier more motivated, productive people and fairer society  A safer financial system  Free-flowing of new ideas resulting in new technologies  A safer more sustainable internet  More affordable housing  Less need for social welfare  Less mental illness With the government fluctuating in size between 30 & 40% of our economy in recent times. Taxation looms large in our lives. If you want people to act in a moral way towards their country and everything and everyone in it then the taxation system must have a moral compass.

Not for profit organisations operating a business should not have any tax exemption. They operate in an environment that, having a tax exemption status, gives them a competitive advantage over businesses that do not enjoy such an exemption. There is no requirement for them to actually generate a profit for their charitable purpose and therefore they are able to reduce their margins to an extent that is not available for businesses that need to return a profit to remain viable. A fairer method would be to tax these organisations on the same basis as all other businesses and then allow a tax exemption based on their profit before tax that will be used for charitable purposes. Bruce Mauchline \[1\] 49 From:Janine Leighton Sent: Tuesday, 10 April 2018 6:38 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tourist tax and ACC In New Zealand we provide world class search and rescue and emergency services. As well, there are walking and cycle tracks which are free to use by both New Zealanders and tourists. All tourists who enter our country can use these services and facilities. Extra pressue is put on toilets, water use and the environment. Many of these tourists do need to be helped by one or more of our emergency and rescue services. All tourists who enter our country should be charged a set fee, a tax at the border, which will go towards our search and rescue services including rescue helicopters and towards track maintenance, rubbish collection and water and toilets connected with tracks and cabins and our national parks and ACC. We would not object if we were required to pay such a tax when we entered another country and we would happily pay it if we knew that if we got into trouble there would be rescue services to help us. ACC. All tourists and visitors should be required to prove that they have health and accident insurance when entering our country. Why should ACC which is paid for by New Zealand taxpayers for New Zealanders be used by non-New Zealanders who have never contributed towards the fund? New Zealand must stop giving the world free rides. New Zealand taxpayers pay for all these things, or donate to keep our rescue helicopter services in operation. Why should the world be able to access these services for free? Janine Leighton \[1\] 50 From: Sent:Tuesday, 10 April 2018 5:04 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to the Tax Working Group Dear Sirs, I am grateful to have the opportunity to make a submission and I hope that my contribution will receive proper consideration. Here are my thoughts: Assisting the Low paid and Minimum wage If we want to encourage people into the work force rather than relying upon Social Security would it not be worthwhile to have a zero tax band for PAYE like they do in the UK? For example "zero tax" on incomes of less than $1000 per month or maybe $16,000pa or even perhaps $20,000pa. Surely this would be an incentive for people to work. Once in the workforce perhaps many will retain worthwhile and better paid jobs I would suggest that Government focus on attempting to control the cost of living would be more useful than raising the minimum wage because there is a high cost of living in NZ. Raising wages will simply prove to be inflationary and add to the cost of living. The benefit to the low paid is short lived. I would suggest that raising taxes or excise duties is likely to have a similar effect in raising costs and making living in NZ less affordable. There is a balance to be achieved. GST Previous Governments have suggested that it is too complex and too costly to have a two tier GST yet in the UK, Australia fresh food and Children's clothes are exemptions for GST. Could we not consider something similar here? It seems to me that the pressure for an increase in the minimum wage and the so called "living wage" comes from a relatively high cost of living. Exempting fresh food from GST and having a zero tax rate for the low paid would seem to offer relief in this critical area. No matter how desirable it might be to increase the minimum wage one must question whether it is sensible to set our minimum wage without also taking careful consideration the minimum wages paid in other developed countries. Here are just a few examples of current minimum wages in some OECD countries. Australia AUS $18.29 ($20.47), UK GBP 7.50 ($14.50 ), Germany EUR 8.84 ($ 15.20 ) France EUR 9.76 ($16.77) In the USA the minimum varies from state to state but averages only US$7.25 ($10.55). Depending on our exchange rate NZ$20 places us more or less on a par with Australia but 25% or more higher than the minimum wage in most European countries. This places us at a significant competitive disadvantage. The reality is that if uplifted NZ wages and consequential increased costs make NZ products non-competitive with other economies then our exports will suffer and jobs are likely to be lost. NZ is a small nation and its economy relies upon trading with other nations. In terms of world trade, nations are effectively in competition with one another - just as international companies \[1\] 51 compete with one another for the sale of their products. In the corporate world when companies lose their competitiveness they generally lose market share. If companies flounder jobs are lost. Tax v's Wealth Creation The Daily Telegraph UK has recently published the astonishing fact that the top 10% of income earners are responsible for 60% of UK income tax revenue. I suspect that a similar ratio exists here in NZ. This suggests that in order to collect more tax we need more people to become wealthy rather than to tax the rich more. The so called "rich" are evidently already contributing a disproportionate contribution in tax revenue. Rather than focusing on wealth re-distribution perhaps the Tax Working Group should focus on "wealth creation". New Zealander's have aspirations and if we want prosperity for our Country then Government should provide tax incentive's to those who create successful business and generate employment. The alternative and likely consequence of higher taxes is to encourage entrepreneurs and wealth creators to emigrate then we, as a nation, shall be the poorer Corporate taxes. If we want companies and business to base themselves in NZ and employ Kiwis then we need to have a tax regime that is an incentive for international companies to come, invest and stay. This brings with it prosperity through employment (PAYE) and Corporate tax revenue. If the NZ wage structure is too high and/or taxes are too high then we can be sure that it will be a disincentive for companies to be based here. Inward investment will diminish and NZ companies to remain competitive may relocate to other jurisdictions where both wages and taxes are lower. Capital Gains Tax &/or Wealth Tax This is a vote looser rather than a vote winner. Based upon the UK experience it is doubtful that the tax revenue raised would be that significant. There would seem to be complexity involving baseline values, subsequent capital expenditure computations, inflation indexation and potential exemptions. For example exempting the family home. There are better options for raising revenue more effectively and with less complexity rather than re-introducing a wide ranging CGT. A fair tax on multinational companies in the digital sector would probably yield a bigger dividend with less complexity and at lower collection cost The argument advanced in NZ from press commentators that advocate a re-introduction of CGT is that it will assist resolve the housing shortage and make houses more affordable for first time buyers. Unfortunately, the evidence in the UK and other countries that have CGT suggests that this is a myth. CGT has not prevented an escalation in UK house prices. A CGT that includes the family home would be deeply unpopular and electoral folly. A CGT that impacts on investment homes and holiday homes will simply distort the market and restrict the supply of rental properties.The so called "Brightline Test" introduced by the last Government and extended by the current Government would seem to be a CGT in all but name and would seem to be an effective tool to limit property speculation. A wider CGT is effectively a tax on savings and investment. The same applies to a so called wealth tax as assets are generally accumulated from earned income. Should we not encourage the virtues of savings and investment? Inheritance Tax This would be deeply unpopular and again is a tax on savings. Those who spend what they earn end up paying little or no IHT whereas those who are prudent and save from their earned incomes are penalised upon their death - or rather their next of kin are! Furthermore, this tax can generally be avoided by gifting assets during ones lifetime. 52 Tourism Tax This is an option that the Government should consider as reputedly NZ is hosting approximately 3.5m overseas visitors annually. They come an use the infrastructure paid for by NZ taxpayers. It would seem only fair that they make a reasonable contribution but how to make it palatable? Simple. Let's not call it a tax and lets provide something in return! My suggestion is that upon arrival overseas visitors should be required to purchase a "Kiwi Pass" that would allow "free access to all Public Museums throughout NZ and access to all NZ National Parks. This would be easy and cheap to collect at point of entry to the country. The money raised could go into the Government coffers but probably should be earmarked for improved infrastructure that will enhance tourism. Better safer roads, Proper camp sites for "freedom campers" etc. As an example, if each overseas visitor contributed $100 this would raise a whopping 3.5 Billion! I doubt that such an concept would deter overseas visitors (who apparently happily pay to go to museums and National parks when visiting other countries). As it does not adversely affect Kiwi's (NZ passport holders) who should have free access it should not be unpopular with the electorate. Of course, there can be debate about the fee to be levied for the Kiwi Pass and it could be half price for children and free for infants. There could be an exemption for short stay visitors of say less than 3-days which should exempt most businessmen. Conclusion In conclusion taxes should be broad based and fair. The law of diminishing returns applies. When Margaret Thatcher reduced personal income taxes and corporate taxes the tax take went up as there was less avoidance. The more complex and convoluted the tax system the more costly it becomes to operate and the less the benefit. Lets have a tax system that is attractive for others to invest in NZ and for Kiwi's and Kiwi business to stay in NZ.

It seems like small business have to pay a huge amount of tax once they become profitable. On top of this they collect PAYE and GST for the government as well. No wonder so many people give up.

It would force out older people who have lived in their family home for many decades, in many cases forcing them to go and live in another area where they know nobody and are far away from their children and other family and friends – the very people they would in most cases depend on for their well-being. Instead, such a tax should be viewed solely as a deterrent to people buying homes larger than they need. When older people first bought their current homes, they either had or were planning to have children. It would not be right to then turn around and penalise them just because their children ha d grown up and left home. I hope it is not the intention of your group to force older people out of their homes in order to reach some badly thought out political objective. Older people are not political pawns and should be treated with care, consideration and respect – who knows, some of you lot might be fortunate enough to be older people yourselves one day.

If this is too wide-ranging (although fair from an environmental standpoint) the wording can be changed to address only fresh fruit and vegetables with compostable packaging. \[2\] \[2\] \[1\] \[2\] 60 Over time suppliers might well switch packaging to avoid GST, which, whilst improving waste management, would shrink the tax base over time.

Lower tax rate for small companies? I feel that a lower tax rate for small companies would be advantageous and fair, for companies who employ a very low number of employees. Eg 1 to 5. My reasoning is that in business, the first 1 to 5 employees are the most difficult, as the company is not large enough to operate a dedicated employment section, and so there are a number of additional requirements, which take time when you have the day to day business activities that you are trying to manage. If a company is larger, it has dedicated people to manage the employee contracts, pay, tax, student loan, kiwisaver etc payments, plus having to manage annual leave, sick leave and other situations where you need to fulfill the business requirements. A small company employing, say its first employee, can make it impractical to justify. It becomes a question of weighing up: Do I employ someone and get hit with all the regulatory issues, Or just do the job myself. Reduced tax would help the small company when trying to justify employing that first person/s, and so would help to reduce the nationwide unemployment. Also, as the small company is quite likely going to employ a young person, this would help with Student Loan repayments. So taking into account, reduced unemployment, increased PAYE, increased SL repayments; if say, 50% of companies who employ 0 to 4, all employed just one additional staff member, then government would gain a significant amount to offset the reduced small company tax rate.

My thoughts The current Taxation Model is focused on the taxing of Income of Individuals and Companies. This has had the resultant effect of penalizing those gains that these have made in the course of the year. I would like to propose that Government shifts its focus onto an Expenditure Taxation Model. In this new environment, Individuals and Companies are not taxed on income, but on their expenditure. Income tax would be set at 0%, but G.S.T. would be set at 20%. Our economy is a Spending Economy, where Individuals are consumers of goods, and services. This is seen in our increasing consumption of goods across every sector from electronics to automobiles. Under this system individuals and businesses can exercise a greater sense of personal responsibility and independence. While those who are content with hand-outs will have a greater incentive to join the workforce. All people who are employed will have the satisfaction of more full recompense for their labour. Therefore in an Expenditure Taxation Model, for every dollar spent in the economy the Government charges a Goods and Services Tax. Thus where Individuals and Companies make purchases, these are taxed. The level of the tax taken at this time should be set at 20%. The breadth of taxation should be increased to include Residential and Commercial property. This circumvents the question of Capital Gains Tax, as the sale of the property becomes a transfer of Goods ( in this case the transfer of the Title of the property is Taxed ) and the G.S.T.becomes a legal obligation at the point of sale. This will not require a license, but will be a statutory obligation of the parties involved to carry out the G.S.T payment. This will have an adverse affect on the Real Es tate market in the short term, but within a few months the market will rebound and trading will resume. As to its effect on relative values of property this will be hard to predict as human nature will effect the way in which people respond. The standard rules for claiming G.S.T. back would apply, where the products are on- sold. This would also simplify the administrative workload for Companies regarding tax. Some items, such as Fresh Fruit and Vegetables, Unprocessed Meats, Basic Dairy items, and Real Estate, whether domestic or commercial might have a G.S.T. rate of 10%. There may be other items that are taxed at a higher rate, in order to curb their proliferation. In moving to an Expenditure Based Taxation System the Government is able to claim to be rightfully rewarded for a continued, well functioning Economy, and is motivated to ensure that the Economy continues to preform at it best. We need not be concerned about monies held in the Bank accounts of Individuals or Companies. Such Funds are good for the Country as they will reduce the need for Foreign Investment, and they will be used at a future date to purchase Goods and Services, of which the Government will benefit through G.S.T.. We should be encouraging each individual to save for their continued benefit, in the face of a growing tendency to live day to day. \[1\] 64 Care will need to be taken for Inland Revenue to claim its rightful share from the current Cash Jobs Market. Penalties of an additional tax of 5% to 10% in withholding tax could help reduce this problem. The tracking of Bank Notes from issue to Bank could prove useful. Perhaps we should move back to $1 and $2 notes to assist in combating this practice. One area of attention will need to be addressed; that of foreign owned companies that withdraw profits from New Zealand. These funds must be considered as the purchase of goodwill from the foreign owners and will therefore will be taxed at the rate of G.S.T. of 20%. The ideas presented in this brief submission are vastly different from the current method of gaining revenue for the Government. However the adoption of such a system could be of great benefit to the Community and Nation as a whole. Each individual will feel less 'oppressed' by the Government; they would feel more free to live as they see fit; and they would feel empowered to make greater decisions that effect themselves and their families. The additional income in the hands of Individuals and Companies will free them to make more and better choices to meet their particular needs. Should the Tax Working Group like to request a greater level of reflection and input in this matter, I am happy to assist.

Rose FIRSTLY One of the first things I learned in economics back in the late 1940's was ;- "You cannot have a just society without a graduated income tax system" The rich have to resume paying a higher share of income tax, commensurate with their income. SECONDLY I would like to see a Tobin Tax introduced on ALL bank transactions. This will raise a huge amount of revenue and be paid, predominantly, by the rich. The banks will scream blue murder but it will only subject them to the regime THEY impose on THEIR customers. This will also help remedy the huge tax losses to NZ incurred by the Australian ownership of all the major banks. THIRDLY I would like to see the GST system modified along the line of the Australian example. There, all fruit, vegetables and unprocessed foods are GST free.

Whilst they do a lot of good for the community, it creates an unequal playing field not needing to pay tax as they are registered as a charity. This feels different to say, the salvation army running second hand shops. I do not know how to resolve this, but it is an issue. \*Tax being used to benefit the environment/increase environmental stewardship is essential. This mechanism is already present in the Waste Minimisation Act 2008. If a tax was imposed on goods at time of sale, their recycling would be far easier. Some councils require $50 for the disposal of a TV for example and this could be avoided if a tax for resource recovery was imposed from the beginning. \*The fact that so many of our native species are at risk and waterways so degraded is appalling. If the tax system can be used to reverse this trend, it should be supported. \*Businesses with no New Zealand base but make money from New Zealanders absolutely need to be taxed, especially as we are living in more of a global economy. \*I completely support the introduction of a capital gains tax. The government should not offer a refund if the asset value decreased. This would create a negative incentive. \*I like that the GST is a simple, flat structure in New Zealand. Whilst I like the idea of removing the GST of fresh produce (fruit and vegetables in a very close form to when they were harvested), I would only support this if it does not make the system complicated/create too many loopholes. \*I support a 'sugar' tax following the review of implementation in other countries and if it were successful, how that could be applied to New Zealand Good luck and talk to you soon, Pauline \[1\] 70 From:Michael Harding Sent: Saturday, 7 April 2018 3:41 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Are We Taxing the Right Things It is my opinion taxes do not need to increase for the worker in New Zealand, but we need to be smarter and fairer when it comes to collecting tax and ensuring all those that are profiting need to pay their fair share. Sanitarium, Shot over Jet, Huka Jet, are just 3 businesses that come to mind of what I understand are hundreds of businesses. These busesses compete against others in their industry, and are unfairly advantaged by not having to pay tax due to their charity status. NO business in New Zealand should be exempt from paying tax on their profits. If they choose to give some or all of their profits to a registered charity then this can be written off. Churches should pay tax on their profits as should church owned businesses. I am a practising Catholic, and can not see why churches should be exempt. We all must pay our fair share. Government and local government continue to spend collected taxes and rates unwisely and without consideration of the blood and sweat that went in to earning that money. It is perceived by me and many others on talk back that millions if not billionscould be saved if only a little common sense is used all of the time. DHBs - 20 for 4.8 million people. We live all over the country, in all the variety that New Zealand offers, yet our health needs are pretty much the same anywhere. The quality of the boards and the decisions they make is vast. I say we need no more than 4 to 6 DHBs, which need to be running from the current most successful model, who's ever it may be. Resources can be better shared, specialisms can be created, spreading costs and decreasing the doubling of resources. It is my understanding that doctors at Wellington Hospital do not pay for their practising licences. Is this because they can't afford It? But then if this perk was removed the health board would simply increase their wages by the cost of the practising licences, gaining the tax payer nothing. This type of working around the rules needs to be stopped as it happens everywhere. BMWs - Why do we need BMWs for government vehicles? Hyundai Genesis, Honda Legend, Toyota Camry, Lexus ?, Mazda , all offer great cars at half the price and significantly cheaper to maintain. In fact the Hyundai Genesis has better safety, better technology and better levels of comfort than a 7 series. Consultants - or so called experts..... What a absolute waste of money that is doing nothing more than shifting responsibilities from those voted in to others. Lay off the consultants and stand up and make the hard calls. Overseas travel - Minister of Broadcasting travelling officially to the Commonwealth Games??? A drop in the ocean of what happens to our money. Travel, hotel, food, drink, miscellaneous costs all paid for by us. Number of politicians - significantly too many. Do I need to say more? Follow past advice and reports from those over paid consultants and working groups and cull a significant amount of politicians. Political benefits once leaving office - I understand back in the day the politician and a teacher received the same salary. In this case I get why the travel benefits and pension were in place for politician s leaving office as compensation for the lower wage. Why then, now that a politician is earning at least twice that of a teacher are the benefits still in place? Where are those benefits for nurses and teachers, for police officers \[1\] 71 and social workers? Quite rightly, No where. Why then do politicians still have benefits once they leave office? We need you and Labour to wipe these benefits, citing above average wages and benefits received while in office. Afraid to make the big decisions, due to self preservation over the greater good - 3 years in office is not enough and this IS a tax issue, as 3 years is not long enough to make the hard calls due to politicians feeling insecure in remaining in office. A 4 or 5 year term would give politicians confidence to implement tough calls and allow those tough calls time to be seen to work, therefore they would be better supported by the voter. Roading - Like the rest of us, have you noticed the increase of roadworks in NZ during Feb and March? Any chance you've thought about the reasons? Tax year is ending soon and we have all this money..... better spend it or we won't get the same budget next year. Come on folks, toughen up on this practise. As a line haul truck driver I see this every year. Roads almost continually worked on, while other patches never improve. Eg, Kaihere Bridge is shocking to cross and always has been. The quality of work carried out is poor and doesn't last. Road toll - this costs the tax payer millions every year. Stop oussy footing around and start erecting centre barriers in ALL crash areas firstly and then on all SH1 and then keep it going. I care nothing for the idiot that hits them, but everything about the innocent family on the other side. Get real, get serious, get spending to save lives and eventually save billions. Furthermore, any car that hits the centre barrier, must pay for the repair of it. Unemployment - it's unacceptable that a person or generations of a family can receive a benefit and never work. The PC world we live in needs to be pushed aside. Peoples feelings need to take a jump if you're living under the support of the tax payer. All those on the dole will work for it and earn it, or loose it. If they have children, the children will need to go elsewhere, as there will no longer be an in come to support them.

I am making this submission with very little knowledge of the intricacies of the application process for a Student Allowance, nor with much knowledge of the criteria, however I do note in your briefing paper that mention is made of the fairness of the tax system and also the perception of fairness. A comment which has been made to me by parents of tertiary students and by my daughter who is now a student herself is that 'many of the really well off kids are on the student allowance'. I wonder if anyone has researched this allegation and perception of 'unfairness'? An anecdotal way of exploring this would be to ask the wardens of some of the more prestigious halls of residence, such as Knox, Selwyn, Arana at Otago and College House at Canterbury- however you may not get a reliable answer as the wardens may not be privy to this information or they may be only too willing to support very well resourced students. Perhaps the MSD has subjected this concern to rigorous investigation? The allegations seem to be based on families employing very competent and somewhat amoral accountants, having their assets in complex trust arrangements or their farms and businesses having complicated ownership structures. As you know this is not usually within the scope of a wage or salary earner. If ordinary New Zealand parents earn just over the threshold either they can not afford for their son or daughter to attend tertiary study or the young person will finish study burdened by a large debt. However students who qualify for allowance will finish with a lower debt and are able to make more financial progress through their 20s. This creates an opportunity for some of the rich to become richer and could be described by the tongue in cheek expression 'socialism for the rich'. I understand that this is a tiny detail and that your report is very wide ranging. Best regards for this worthwhile undertaking.

Then at the end of their working life they have millions of dollars in the bank, millions of dollars of assests, yet have not payed a cent in tax. How is this fair? Why does it continue to happen? How about instead of pay as you earn, you are taxed as you earn. I'm pretty sure that this tax working group will have little or no effect on closing the wealth/poverty gap because I'm sure the rich already have a "lobby groups" yelling in your ear not to change it.

I am a VERY creative thinker, have global experience from start-ups, social enterprises to large international corporations (over 20 years in the SAP ecosystem), spend a lot of time researching and thinking about “Business for Positive Impact” (Conscious Capitalism, B-Corps and a surprising amount of other globally emerging business initiatives re the Future of Business = Business for Good which is the business we want to support with conducive tax conditions, right?). I have a big picture thinking mind and have done a lot of personal development that has reshaped my perspective on many things in the world. To my surprise during writing the submission and this email I have been emotionally captured which means my passion has been awakened and I tend to follow my passion. Consequently as I am available for a new freelancing contract right now I would like to offer you to contribute more actively to your project as a “Future of Business/Conscious Business Consultant” as I have done recently for the SAP Innovation Center in their German headquarter. They found I bring new thoughts, higher perspective ways of looking things, see things others did not see, sense and anticipate future developments, and as a big picture thinker bring them together in frameworks and connect the dots (between facts and people). I can think outside the box yet aligned with purpose and strategy, and love to co-create in teams. If you feel like you would benefit from an additional such person on board of your team in whatever form, please reply and we can set up an informal chat on Zoom or Skype to explore what opportunities could arise from this.

So being part of your team would be very much aligned with my personal purpose. Warm regards Sandra PS: here soem additions to my below list that were beyond 100 characters: 7. create special councils to run emerging ideas past them e.g. in a form of "world cafes"): 1. expat council -> capture global ideas, values and networks 2. elder council -> capture the wisdom of long life experience 3. youth council -> capture the future gen's visions, energy and sometimes utopian inspiration 4. "spiral wizard" council -> capture the way of thinking that combines high complexity with wisdom and strategic power (“spiral wizards” are a concept from "Spiral Dynamics” and can be identified in the population through academically validated profiling tests) ... \[1\] 77 Ideas that come to mind without having the time to think it through right now: 1. link business tax to positive impact i.e. link it to triple or quadruple bottom line (People, Planet, Profit, Purpose). 2. that gives a natural opportunity for social entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs and NPOs/NGOs to get tax advantages as they are taking on tasks that serve society (which often government agencies would do with tax money) 3. outside the box: how about an app where tax payers prioritise every year what they like seeing their tax being spent on - as a democratic, self-directed input into tax decisions 4. how can Bhutan and their gross happiness product inform our tax design 5. use design thinking, Theory U, system thinking, wicked problems theory, integral theory, Spiral Dynamics to re-invent our tax system (I assume this is happening anyway) 6. really study what other countries do & put kiwi ingenuity on tip - DO NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL , yet innovate and invent on global learnings. create an expat council 78 From:Steve Baron Sent: Friday, 6 April 2018 11:41 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Six years ago, I wrote an opinion piece for the Wanganui Chronicle stating that the average ratepayer in Whanganui paid $36 a week in rates, as their contribution to funding the Whanganui District Council and all the services and facilities it provides to the good people of Whanganui. Reading through the recently published WDC 2018-2028 Long Term Plan I now see this figure has risen to $51 per week... and I thought $36 was expensive! And that’s in Whanganui, one of the most affordable places to own property in New Zealand. So, my question to Prime Minister Ardern, Finance Minister Robertson, all Members of Parliament and this Tax Working Group is this... how can it possibly be fair, that only those who own property, pay rates to fund local council services, when everyone in the community actually consumes these services? I say it cannot possibly be fair in any way, shape or form. I say this is an undeniably unjust and outdated system of taxation that needs to be urgently changed because property owners, especially the retired, cannot afford to continue paying for everything, while others who use these services pay nothing. For a starter, government departments do not pay rates, even though they have a substantial property holding and even though the govern ment insists that the Goods & Services Tax (GST) be added to rates—a tax on a tax no less! Churches and various clubs (who often occupy council land) do not pay rates even though some of them undoubtedly have substantial bank accounts, and or incomes. Adding to that, and based on past census reports, around 33% of the population live in rental accommodation and do not pay rates. Now, I realise that statement is very unpopular amongst tenants, but the fact is that tenants do not pay council rates. Tenants will of course always argue that they do, because their rent goes to a landlord who then pays rates. However, what a landlord does with the rent they collect is their business. For example, if a landlord uses the rent they collect to buy Methamphetamine (P), will the tenant claim responsibility for supporting this illegal habit? Of course not. Another example... if I spend money in a business that pays council rates, can I claim that I therefore should not have to pay any rates? Of course not. These are silly arguments, as is the argument that tenants pay rates through their rent. It is a nonsense and is absolutely spurious. I can also tell you that as a landlord, there were times when \[1\] 79 council rates increased, but I had to drop my rents because of an oversupply of rental properties. It was not possible to pass on this rate increase... so who paid for it? Me, the landlord. A further injustice in the current rating system is that those who own more expensive properties pay more than those who own less expensive properties, even though they often use far less council services, and even though their income may be dramatically less than others. For example, an elderly person on a fixed income, who has lived in their home for a long period of time, for which the value has risen appreciably, can often pay more rates than a working couple with 3 children who consume far more services. Granted, there are those on low incomes who can apply for a rates rebate, but many do not qualify even though they have modest incomes. Our current rates system unfortunately places a huge burden on just those residents who own property. This growing burden needs to be spread amongst everyone who use council services and facilities, to make it fair and affordable. Council rates will continue to increase as councils need to fund a growing list of aging infrastructures. They are also continuously burdened by central government who place more expectations on local councils, but never want to fund them. As I said back in 2012, property tax (rates) is a bad tax—an outdated tax. That is because it is a regressive tax that is not linked to the income of the person paying it, their ability to pay, nor by the amount of services they consume. Rates are therefore fundamentally unfair. Central government needs to devise and implement a new system—a system that is fair. It might not be an easy ask, but what more appropriate time than now, when the government has appointed Sir Michael Cullen to review the country’s tax system. I have initiated an online petition to Parliament but I would ask you all to give this further thought and consideration.

Either the government should consider leaving half of the GST on the sale of a new, affordable home, to a first home buyer ( or the GST equivalent of up to 10% of the sale price) to get people into their own homes. e.g. New home $400,000 -Government leaves in GST of $25,000-$40,000. Or Else the government should allow the developer/construction company to leave up to 10 % of the value of a first home buyer home and change the tax rules so the developer/construction company does not pay tax and GST on the amount left in, until that amount is eventually paid back to the company. e.g. sell a new home $400,000 Leave in $30,000 ( caveated) Tax and GST is only paid on $370,000 adjusted sale. Tax and GST to be paid on the $30,000 when and if it is physically paid back to the company in future.

The most civilised societies are in Europe where a direct tax and also tax on goods and services is high. What that means is that these societies are healthy mentally and physically and this reflects in the fact that these countries are also the happiest. Americanisation does not work if one is to compare say the USA with say Denmark. What do I mean by Americanisation is the notion o f dog eats dog and so the notion of survival of the fittest. More taxes less strife. By increasing taxes you can eliminate poverty, crime and homelessness. Countries in Scandinavia have free health care, Free education and no poverty or homelessness. Crime is lowest too than in countries that adopted the American system with low taxes and high crime rate. Thank you Dimitri \[1\]\[1\] \[1\] 84 From:Vicky Forgie Sent: Wednesday, 4 April 2018 11:25 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Tax reform I support: 1. Environmental taxes to ensure scarce natural resources are consumed wisely and environmental degradation minimised 2. Taxing automation as well as labour 3. A tax system that puts religious businesses on the same footing as other businesses in New Zealand Environmental tax The tax system needs to disincentivise environmental degradation resulting from production and consumption. This requires transitioning to taxing resource use and consumption (i.e. higher taxes on goods) rather than putting the tax burden on labour and service provision. A larger population, demanding higher material standards of living has accelerated the loss and degradation of ecosystems and the services they provide. As these are the ‘life- support’ systems required for human survival, the future will be more hazardous if the tax system does not work to protect natural capital. Taxing automation In the future well-paid employment opportunities are likely to be limited for large sectors of society (i.e. those not in the computer and technology areas). To avoid mass inequality and societal instability a system of universal payments will be necessary. This will give people the means to work in sectors that are productive to society as a whole but not to the individual (in terms of privatised profits). These areas include caring for the young, old and sick and restoration of the environment. In the neoclassical economics production function Y=f(K,L) labour and capital are substitutable. Our current taxation system puts a burden on labour by taxing it and making it more expensive. This favours automation and will over time decrease the number of jobs and by extension the amount of tax collected. Taxing automation (robots, artificial intelligence) as well as labour will provide an additional source of government income to fund universal payments. The McKinsey Global Institute, estimates that AI use for marketing, sales and supply chain management has the potential to generate profits and efficiencies of $2.7trn over the next 20 years for the global economy (Economist 28 May 2018). Religious tax exemptions New Zealand is a secular society so all citizens need to pay their share of taxes. We currently have an unfair situation where religious organisations run commercial businesses, directly competing with non- religious businesses, but able to make greater profits due to paying less tax. This provides more capital to reinvest and increase competitiveness. The benefits from these businesses accrue to the members of the select religious community so they should be taxed on the same basis as any other business. \[1\] 85 From:T Cole Sent: Tuesday, 3 April 2018 7:24 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: I wish to make a submission to the tax working group Please accept my submission to the New Zealand Tax Working Group 2018 I think that a Capital Gains tax that excludes the family home is very unfair. It would disadvantage the groups who do not have a home or who are trying to save for a home and would have to pay tax when trying to keep up with the inflation caused by rising house prices. Having a capital gains tax that excludes the family home would mean people can pay more for a tax free house and push the cost of a house further out of reach of those trying to save for a home If a Capital Gains Tax excludes any assets such as a family home then there SHOULD BE NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX.

This country should stop being under the thumb of religious faith because 42% of us dont have a religion. I think that in order to get granted any tax exemption they should have to meet certain criteria ie donate proceeds to the community in order to help and show proof of where their income is going and it being publicly accessable so we can rest assured that these guys arent just in it to get rich. Going on to charitys.. the charitys that people donate to for the likes of starving children in africa would have paid for all of their educations and feed them all by now if the money had fallen into the right hands.

Our world is changing. Our population is ageing, our environment needs protecting and new technologies mean work could look very different in the future. Tax will play an important role in helping us meet those challenges. 1. There will be an increasing call on the tax take, by those retiring. 2. There will be a reduction in the percentage of the population generating income for the tax take. 3. There is insufficient revenue being generated currently for the tax take to address child poverty, homelessness, inequality and affordable housing. 4. In 1936, the First Labour Government enabled The Reserve Bank to issue credit (money) for the construction of housing and public infrastructure without the need to increase the tax take. 5. We were in a far worse situation in 1936 than we are now and the initiative proved to be very successful. 6. The wealth generated for New Zealand from the Reserve Bank in 1936 allowed for the establishment of the welfare state that became the envy of the world. 8. An IMF Working Paper titled “The Chicago Plan Revisited” endorsed a similar initiative. 7. It is time to repeat the creation of credit by the Reserve Bank to ease the tax burden.

I.e. if the marginal rate is h for income i then the tax paid is 0.5\*h\*I. The marginal rate would be a continuous linear increasing function of income. Maximum possible value would be 200%, ie 100% average tax, but would in reality be flat lined at 2\*desired max average tax rate. 4) Ask the working group to consider the use of triangular based tax rates for company taxes to support smaller businesses. There would have to be strict rules around the splitting of companies into many smaller companies to take advantage of the lower average tax rates as tax avoidance. 5) Ask the working group to consider whether the income and company triangular based tax rates can be aligned. 6) Ask the working group to consider, whether in the longer term, GST could be applied using triangular based tax rates as well. Its much more complicated as previous annual or 12 month rolling cumulative expenditure has to be known at the time of purchase. Regards David Robinson \[1\] 90 From:Bruce Truman Sent: Monday, 2 April 2018 9:54 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: submission Dear Sir Our local economy. Looking at our economy and how much debt is being gained in the name of business, but in truth it is all for chasing the tax free capital gain. Housing and Dairy are 2 very large vehicles for this and look at the hole the economy is in on the West coast while doing this. Has done no one any good. Those in high debt are going to the wall while others are left with new rules being applied to them for the misdeeds of others due to wetlands or native bush being pushed aside for the dairy farms. I own and operate a Sphagnum Moss Exporting Business on the Westcoast and are fighting to use my own land for the purpose I bought it for but along come the Environment Court and slaps me for what the Dairy Industry has done. 4 years so far. I paid $1.2 mill for the land to protect my business from the developers and then get punished for it. Also bought at the time those same dairy players were paying $10k per ha, spend $10k per Ha and have a farm worth $30k per ha. Now dairy land here is sitting unsold at $16500 per ha and the banks are trying to get there money out of some. Bugger, not just for them. Now is the time to value land here. Labor under Clark/Cullen could of sorted this when they protected Pine Forests with the Tax on land conversion but instead gave a green light to these native lands. The conversion tax would save a lot of money being spent on lawyers, staff in councils and the environment court if SNA's and Schedualed Wetlands for example were scrapped and replaced with land use change tax applied. Less of something you want changed, make the tax higher. Can not leave these things to the Councils. Our Regional Council (WCRC) for example is run by the dairy industry and has been for many years. If say tax was $10k per ha, that would be equal to the tax free gain they wanted to make, land protected in it current use. More diverse economy. In the USA, if you want to dig up a wetland, you must make one some where else, ie, total area of wetlands must remain the same. Some wetlands and native bush areas would then be adding to our diversity. Native logs should be value added before allowed for export. Wage earners. Current tax system also only serves to punish those whom go out and pay for an education and then reward them with higher taxes. Our higher educated leave NZ to earn more off shore so can repay their student debt. Answer. Flat tax rate and put it on every profit how ever it is earned. Wages, land, housing, businesses sold. In a loss situation, same as when doing your taxes, sits as a tax credit, going forward forces people to operate at a profit to bank the tax losses accrued. \[1\] 91 Encourage debt reduction, capital repayments tax deductible not just the interest which most of this goes off shore, about 90 cents per kg milk solids. The more businesses not in debt, the more taxes they will pay and be looking to make a profit if they know it is taxed the same as the capital gain when they sell up. The low paid, still pay the same tax but through family support etc they can be brought back up to where they were before as the lowest tax bracket would be higher if the number is 18 -20% In short, the tax system currently over taxes some and does not tax others at all and they are sitting on lots of dollars. Some would rather pay interest than tax and they cannot see the tax would be less and they could put 66% of the interest in their pocket if they had no debt. 80% in pocket if the flat tax was 20%. The banks profits shows what this country is missing out on due to our unfair tax system. Land use change. >$10k per ha. If the country wants it protected in current form could be $100k per ha.

Income from employment is taxed when earned. If invested the interest or dividends are taxed again at source. To tax the same funds a third time cannot be justified. 2. Generally those with wealth have reached that state through their own initiative and should not be penalised for that. 3. Wealthier people will have earned higher incomes and therefore paid more tax during their lives than those with less assetts. 4. People are rightly encouraged to save for their retirement or future security.. If having done that they are then hit with a wealth tax to support those who have not, they will feel angry and betrayed. 5. A wealth tax is a disinsentive for individuals to manage their own finances without relying on the state to do it for them. Hopefully you will consider these points when you submit your recommendations to the government.

As we know tax is deducted from salary/wages from gross amount earned each week doesn’t matter how many hours an individual have worked in a week to earn that gross amount.

What I don't like in our system 1. tax avoidance through trusts and companies. 2. the fact that a person can buy a home and renovate it and not pay tax on the capital gain and this is portrayed continually in the media as somehow successful, while our children pay tax on their small savings in the bank. 3. I would like to see a tax on multiple ownership of properties so we don't have land banked houses or houses only available as Air BnB or book a bach ( and similar arrangements )when people can't rent or buy a home. Recently I was looking for accommodation in Rotorua and realised there are a huge number of houses that are sitting empty for a lot of the year while people are struggling to find rental property. 4.

I oppose this. A land tax is not fair and equitable, which the discussion paper says should be the basis for a taxation system. The value of land you own often bears no relationship to your earnings. A property owner could own a valuable property, but have little in the way of taxable earnings, for example a pensioner. Having a pay a land tax could result in a tax bill which is disproportionate to their earnings. In fact I submit that all property taxes be abolished for this same reason , in particular Local Authority rates. They should be replaced with an ACC type levy on taxable earnings which is transferred to the Local Authority where the property owner resides. This would result in a funding system based on the property owner’s ability to pay, which the existing system property rates system does not.

If you really want people to contribute you could have made them write it out long hand and deliver it on horseback that would have been about as easy. You provided the headings you want addressed yet no clip and paste. No formal submission document. Really is this intended to put us off ? Second you want areas addressed so where is the checklist ? Third you seem to make assumption that the system will remain the system. We must change. What we have and what we consume is the measure of our wealth, not how many hours we work, not the control we have over an unjust or unfair emolument, and in that regard socially every state paid role should be put out to tender. Why can three people not join together and do a $500, 000 job in Government or a Council better than one person ! It is the system that is wrong. Morally I believe no one should be paid more than the Prime Minister unless they pay a tax surcharge. This is a bit left field but every cilvil servant that gets more than the PM should pay tax of 50c on the amount it exceeds it by. There is no evidence they do a better job for being paid more ! As well all bonus payments are to be considered capital and taxed as an increase in asset value. That might have s topped the GFC injustices. Because it would have been charged with Asset Tax, then paid GST on the new Ferrari. We have progressed from a working world to a consuming world.... We have gone from a society with group interests to individuals all seeking their own best outcome yet demanding care from cradle to grave. Maori are part of society demanding more and contributing less. We have a new immigrant culture that does not believe in Tax. They work on cash outside the system These are some random thoughts that just sprang into my mind with out much consideration other than 40 years in the tax system as a Chartered Accountant seeing the wrong headedness of our Tax impositions. I would love to develop these ideas but have no doubt no one will read a word anyway. The first tenet : CONSUMPTION TAX Taxing income is wrong. Tax should be based on consumption. GST on everything including houses. There are ways to “hold” the GST for owner occupiers until the property is sold or not sold. Consumption includes buying overseas currency. Charge GST on that as well. Anything exported for private use, yachts cars diamonds, whatever charge GST. There is a whole lot to cover but it is simple if there are no “exemptions” for ANYTHING including food. The Second tenet: ASSET TAX Everyone whether a Trust, Maori Tribe or Church or school or charity (in some cases the tax can be assessed and held until sale ) but every entity that owns an asset, a house, Land, shares (remember no income tax so no dividend tax,) \[1\] 98 but the increase in the value of assets held is shown for the start and the end of the year.....no increase no tax........no reason not to use GV, and indexed. However tax must be paid on the difference, or if it has gone down an offset credit is issued (subject to refinement) but if the assets have gone up or sold for a profit pay tax on any gain. Debt is irrelevant and non deductible. There is a huge benefit in less borrowing. Foreign owners get taxed and the bright line test is irrelevant. A home may be nominated as a residence and a deferral can be applied but paid on sale. Home trading has wrecked havoc on the “no homers” but that is an aside. No deduction for borrowing. If it was a business capital cost then now it is capital. That is a major cause of asset inflation and device to avoid income tax, so no income tax no deduction. So if KFC (lets give Google a rest) wants to write up their costs and then borrow from the tax haven parent, good oh but no deduction. Every dollar that comes in two NZ gets a “credit” every dollar that goes out get charged GST( with set off for credits)....... Third Tenet : BUSINESS TAX No deduction for capital costs, ie interest. No deduction for depreciation unless the monetary value is paid into a separate fund. Superannuation contributions are charged to the employees account as salary. ( Then subject to asset tax). No deduction for employee benefits. No deduction for assets where there is any element of private use. Even if charged to the user...ie Vehicles helicopters boats... If there is any private use no GST deduction at all. This is a hard one because we need small business but most small business survives because the “owner” runs their house car boat racecar or holidays or whatever through the business The cost of compliance is too high. So GST gets paid on all income and deductions permitted for good and services consumed by the business...only by the business or paid to total third parties. ie registered for GST, not entertaining or advertising unless paid to a GST registered entity. Finally the IRD mentality is wrong. There MUST be a mediation service reintroduced. The IRD do not get it right all the time. Mistakes are made on both sides. There is no safe ground. I know of a case recently where a taxpayer has spent over $100,000 on legal advice. The IRD would have spent double that amount. The monetary value in dispute was near $150,000. So everyone is a looser to save “face” because an IRD officer made a mistake. So did the taxpayer. But why waste $500,000 of resources because our system can not handle fairness ? Taxpayers are entitled to a PROPER mediation service and an OMBUDSMAN so they at least feel as if there is fairness in the system. I spent 20 years negotiating debt remission. I do not believe anyone was favoured or disadvantaged. There is no way to achieve that now so people that for whatever reason are accused by the IRD end up on the scrap heap. Everyone deserves more dignity than that. If deliberate avoidance is demonstrated that is different and should be prosecuted but where there is doubt and there often is why are these people going to Court ? We need a mediation arbitration system urgently and an Ombudsman for the taxpayers that deserve an impartial hearing. Sadly the Government Lawyers are partial because they get paid extravagantly. I WANT A FAIR TAX SYSTEM AND WHAT WE HAVE IS NOT. IT FAVOURS THE GREEDY. Stuart D Robertson \[1\] 99 100 From:Simon Waugh Sent: Friday, 30 March 2018 11:14 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: A submission of views to the tax working group Labour is the main way that people procure an income, but what happens as more and more jobs become automated? There are two ways to view this: Automation threatens livelihoods and robots should be prevented from taking our jobs. Or that as automation increases the burden of work is reduced for humans and our lives are improved. I take the second view. As more jobs become automated many people will need a new source of income. I would like the tax working group to consider that some form of Universal Basic Income may be necessary in the next 100 years. In addition to this, the problem of wealth inequality in this country is becoming worse. Workers are not receiving much of the value they produce. A profit sharing law, where companies could obtain a fiscally neutral tax break in exchange for dividing up 10% or 20% of yearly profits equally amongst all employees on top of their regular wage could go a long way to rectifying this. Such a law would have more than doubled my wage at my previous job. I would also like to see animal agriculture discouraged in this country due to the reduction in biodiversity and the damage to our water ways it causes. Much of the land used for dairy could produce crops instead. This would reduce methane emissions that contribute to climate change, reduce effluent run-off into water ways, and reduce irrigation. Some kind of tax incentive for converting a dairy farm to a crop farm, and/or an incentive for riparian planting private water ways is worth looking at. If there is any way that gst could be reduced and the burden of that tax moved elsewhere then I think that should be considered. It stifles business and it increases the hardship of working families. A carbon tax and a capital gains tax are probably both necessary. Thank you for taking the time to consider my views. Sincerely Simon Waugh \[1\] 101 From:Richard Christie Sent: Friday, 30 March 2018 10:20 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Among the current challenges faced by the NZ government are two problems that are of concern to many New Zealanders: - Finding effective measures to reduce house price inflation - Finding a method to reduce carbon emissions and so meet our Paris Agreement obligations for 2030 and 2050 Comments on the challenges faced by government: The various means being considered by the Tax Working Group to address these two measures are likely to result in adverse downstream effects. No amount of capital gains tax is guaranteed to dampen the value of residential real estate. In fact, some studies have indicated that the introduction of capital gains tax has very little effect on long term property prices. Purchasing international carbon credit units in order to offset emissions by 218 million tonnes of carbon by 2030, on top of the the 31 million tonnes of emissions already scheduled to be reduced by the introduction of renewable energy, tree planting, and the switch to the more widespread use of electric vehicles, has recently been estimated to cost the NZ Government $14.2 billion. It is unclear what will be the cost of meeting the later 2050 Paris Agreement targets; but given the severity of the targets (being a reduction in emissions levels by 50% on 1990 levels, as opposed to the 11% reduction required by 2030), an upwards trajectory in carbon emissions, and the likely increase in demand and price for international carbon credit units as we approach the deadline dates, the cost of meeting the 2050 obligations is likely to be far higher even than those of 2030. These two problems will have a destabilising effect on the New Zealand economy. On the one hand, the rising cost of property will consolidate wealth among the lucky few in a position to purchase it. On the other hand, the costs of raising money to meet New Zealand's obligations under the Paris Agreement for 2030 and again for 2050 will be severe. If the government remains in the Paris Agreement, they will need to either a) reduce government expenditure significantly b) increase taxation significantly or c) print large quantities of New Zealand dollars in order to buy international carbon credits, which in turn will likely result in very high levels of inflation. Low income New Zealanders will eventually suffer the brunt of these policies. While the commitment to plant one billion trees is commendable, the cost of such a proposal should not be ignored, nor should the fact that while new trees act as a 'carbon sink', they do not effectuate a change in gross \[1\] 102 emissions. There will be a significant cost of obtaining land under such a scheme, because the demand for planting hectares will reduce the arable land available for export agriculture, forcing the prices up for both. Part of the difficulty in reducing actual emissions is New Zealand's dependency on the export agriculture sector. Agriculture accounts for an estimated 47% of New Zealand's carbon emissions. It also creates the backbone of wealth for New Zealanders, and the power to make actual deep cuts to emissions in this sector will be impossible for any government who wants to retain popularity with voters. The planting of so many trees also creates a downstream problem in that when the time comes for the trees to be harvested, the oversupply will cause the price of various types of wood to drop. Forestry investors will see this coming (having been burnt by the Kyoto forests) and will sell out of their forests at a time that suits them. In short, the remainder of this century in New Zealand will be one that is rife with economic manipulation. The government will by 2050 be forced to consider drastic action in order to buy itself out of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, at an extraordinary cost to regular New Zealanders. Currently, the government is considering addressing these two problems using taxation. There are a number of problems with using taxation to address this social and environmental imbalance: 1) It is questionable whether taxation will even be effective at curbing house price inflation. 2) It is unlikely that taxation will create actual changes on farms in the agriculture sector that lead to a significant reduction in actual emissions. 3) New taxes imposed on either of these sectors will cause damage to the economy and widespread voter backlash. 4) Any form of taxation causes 'deadweight loss'. The effect of this taxation will be that they create a loss to the economy that cannot be recovered elsewhere. In summary, taxation used as a method to prevent these imbalances will be politically and economically costly. More importantly, however, they will be extremely unlikely to make any real difference to long term house price inflation or to national carbon emissions. Solution: The solution I propose is that New Zealand adopts the gold standard by acquiring a reserve of gold and tying the value of the NZD to the value of gold. Reasoning: 103 During the years 1870 to 1912, when the United Kingdom was on the gold standard, inflation was 0.1% annually. There is no evidence to support the claim that the same environment would arise in NZ; we are a very different economy in a different age and under different circumstances. But it is widely acknowledged that tying currency to gold has a counter-inflationary effect, in part because it prevents the printing of more currency. Adopting the gold standard would have two principle objectives: 1) It would raise the price of the NZ dollar by attracting a large amount of offshore investment. This in turn would make exports less affordable and would serve as a clamp on the high-polluting Kiwi export agriculture sector (particularly beef and lamb). Market forces would force export farmers to change their business models, and carbon emissions from the agriculture sector would drop as a result. Due to the likelihood of widespread farmer insolvency, the government would have the opportunity to purchase farms cheaply and to convert the farmland to forestry at a lower cost to the government, making the cost of planting one billion trees affordable. 2) Property prices would stabilise over the long term. Property prices are currently being driven by the availability of debt. Such debt assumed under inflationary circumstances has a critical advantage: the real interest rate is substantially lower that the nominal interest rate. Using the Fisher equation, the 'real' interest rate on a loan at 4.7% at 3.1% inflation would be just 1.6%. Meanwhile, if the purchaser uses the loan to acquire an asset that appears to be going up in value (such as residential housing), then the net wealth of the person securing the loan increases over time, provided that service repayments can continually be met. The result of this is to create a widespread incentive for people to go into debt, in order to increase their capital gains. Meanwhile, banks will be happy to write more loans that have been secured by assets of apparently high quality. If introducing the gold standard stabilises inflation to 0.1%, it will reverse this trend. This would have a deflationary effect on house prices. Effects on C + I + G + X + M of implementing the gold standard: Consumer spending will decrease due to a number of reasons, chiefly that the loss of revenues from beef and lamb exports will flow on to other areas of the economy. A heightened attentiveness to the lasting value of the New Zealand dollar will also cause people to reduce their consumer spending on unnecessary items and to increase their savings. Investment in New Zealand will increase. The prospect of a currency being backed by gold will mean that overseas investors will invest more money into NZ. Investment inflows into NZ will search for highly stable (ideally government backed) investments with acceptably low risk and correspondingly low rates of return. This will create the opportunity for the New Zealand government to originate bonds at very low rates of interest. Bonds would provide investors a guaranteed income backed by the government, while allowing them to safely invest their valuable gold-backed Kiwi dollars. The funds raised through the origination of government debt can be invested in the economy and to some extent can help to provide an antidote to deflation. The origination of New Zealand government bonds, along with their subsequent disbursement through government spending and 104 loans, would also help to counteract the shortage in the money supply caused by international banks purchasing NZ dollars as a reserve currency. Government spending will increase. Using the funds raised from the origination of new government bonds, investments could be made in forestry, infrastructure projects, as well as small loans to businesses and households that will enable households to reduce their cost base and switch to lower cost renewable technology. Exports will drop. The rising New Zealand dollar will force many exporters to change their business models. This, in turn, would cause emissions from agriculture to reduce correspondingly. Imports will increase. The relative strength of the value of the NZ dollar will make imports from overseas more attractive to Kiwi buyers. Potential safeguards to 'phase in' the introduction of the gold standard: The Gold Ceiling This would involve setting the price of gold at a rate sufficiently above the market ‘spot price’ so as to make the risk of an immediate run on gold less likely. If the gold standard was set at the rate of $3000, and the current spot price was $1900, it would be unlikely that people would exchange their NZD for gold when they could simply buy the same amount at a lower price on the open market. The erosion of the NZD over the span of a few years would lead gold to become more expensive. As the spot price of gold nears the Gold Ceiling, the full effect of the gold standard would take effect. When this happens, inflation will fall, and the New Zealand dollar would appreciate. Implementing a ‘Gold Ceiling’ would enable New Zealand to phase in the gold standard over time, giving business owners, farmers and exporters some time in advance to prepare the changes they would need to make to their respective business models. Restricting Gold Exchange Rights to NZ Citizens and Permanent Residents One way to limit or reduce the possibility for a run on gold would be to limit the people who are legally able to exchange their NZD currency for gold exclusively to NZ Citizens and Permanent Residents. At the same time, NZ could tighten up the gifting regulations in NZ to prevent entities from giving large sums of money to one another without a gift duty. This would not necessarily prohibit other international governments, businesses or market speculators from using the gold standard, but it would frustrate those efforts somewhat by introducing the need for transactions to be undertaken through a locally resident intermediary. The aim here would be to restrict somewhat the number of exchange transactions that occur, and potentially prevent speculative attacks on the NZ dollar while the gold standard is being phased in. 105 Limiting the Amount of Gold Exchanged by any Individual to an Annual Maximum The next step would be to allow a simple maximum amount of dollars exchanged per NZ Citizen or Permanent Resident. This could be calculated on an annual basis. While this would limit the potential for the gold standard to achieve market equilibrium, and would require database management and enforcement penalties, it would greatly restrict the potential for a run on the gold standard at any given time. It would also give the Treasury some breathing space to plan ahead and decide how much future gold to purchase, sell or import. Create a Gold Register Rather than having to have the entire NZ population placed on a database, you could simply have an ‘opt in’ system called a Gold Register. Individual citizens or permanent residents could choose to register on the system for the purpose of being able to exchange NZD for gold in the future, before they are allowed to make use of the gold standard exchange mechanism. The process would require that the applicant produce valid ID as part of the registration process. This process might take several weeks to verify each applicant, but once done, would enable individuals to trade currency for gold. Due to the preparatory nature of the system, it could again help to delay or dissuade speculative attacks on the NZD. Why the gold standard would be environmentally efficient Appreciation of the NZ dollar will reduce the profitability of NZ exports and eventually force many agricultural exporters out of business. Emissions from agriculture will reduce as a result. With the failure of many farms, this will create an opportunity for government and foresters to purchase the farms cheaply and to convert them to forestry at a lower cost to the taxpayer. A switch to the gold standard will likely have an effect on household and business consumption patterns. It may in turn lead to the adoption of environmentally friendly technology, as many forms of eco-friendly processes (such as composting, home gardening, solar power installation and electric vehicles) reduce household costs in addition to achieving environmental efficiency. The introduction of the gold standard in NZ raises for NZ the greatest possible chance to achieve net zero emissions and long term house price stability, but not without enormous upheaval to New Zealand society. It will, however, allow the NZ government to achieve the above stated goals using a free market mechanism. It is worth reminding the reader that the gold standard would be a free market mechanism that achieves these outcomes while introducing no deadweight loss from taxation. 106 Sources: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3002430/ http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/politics/2017/05/new-zealand-to-spend-14-billion-to-meet-paris-agreement- targets.html https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/f3 https://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/s40-banks-liabilities-deposits-by-sector 107 From:Tyron Phillips Sent: Thursday, 29 March 2018 8:06 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax working group submission Secretariat, New Zealand has a simple GST system and we could adopt a simple system for individuals. For example, setting the first $20k income tax free. Next bracket up to $60k at 25% with income over $60k at current rate 33%. This will reduce tax compliance and requirements for low income earners who need the most relief. In this scenario an individual on $50k would have an effective tax rate of 15% and someone on $100k would be 23% which is comparable to our current range. With a tax relief at the lowest end this m ay remove the need for a minimum wage increase to $20 which impacts small businesses. Consideration may be put into having a $150k plus bracket but I have not considered the wider impact of this. NZ should also adopt a household tax rate. Combining a couple's income as a tax group. This would eliminate the issue of wage earners being disadvantaged compared to business owners who can shift income between shareholders. It would also allow a low-income family on a combined income of $40k to not be liable for tax in the above situation. This would provide a better quality of life as one member of the family can work less to be home for children while the other is not hindered by paying more than their fair share of tax. In this situation you could see a tax relief of $5k for a household income of $50k where one parent doesn’t work full time. The aim of this would be to make our tax system more equitable. No consideration has been taken into how this works with current benefits. This would also require the couple to file a tax return and would see a small compliance cost to obtain this unless they completed this through IRD website. A review of the company tax rate to 25%. Company tax often flows to shareholders and ultimately individual tax rate applies. Rate of 25% is to allow a small business to match the individual rate of 25%. No consideration has been taken into imputation credits and dividend withholding tax as a small business would typically be taking a shareholder salary out. Luxury tax should be considered. For example, families and business will buy vehicles that are $50k or less (GST excl) as these are affordable and practical. New vehicles that are over this price could have a luxury tax imposed of a further 15%. This could be applied to a wide range of luxury items, including boats, residential homes over $2m or $500k over the regions average house price. Rental properties could see a maximum of 50% interest deduction. In the form of allowing rental properties to gain a deduction for interest if the loan is only 50% of the rental property, any loans over and above this would be non-deductible. This would provide an incentive to have rental properties cashflow positive. The aim of rental properties should be for passive income, not for short term capital gains. Thank you for taking the time to read this submission. Tyron Phillips | Director Next Consulting Limited \[1\] \[1\] 108 From:Stephen Bishop Sent: Thursday, 29 March 2018 1:48 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I would like to make a few simple points to the Tax Working Group on what is a very complex matter. I think its time we had a zero base definition on what we use our tax for in New Zealand. I understand tax is to pay for essential Government services but Government expenditure has gone way beyond what is necessary,essential or required. I believe it is time for Government 1.to seriously and carefully decide what our tax should be spent on .This should be documented so all New Zealanders understand what our tax is used for. 2.Tax must be spent wisely. Numerous examples of non essential Government expenditure and waste exist. 3.Government should put together a team of expert advisors to look at every item of Government expenditure to see if its relevant or recommend it be done differently or cease. 4.keep the tax system simple. It appears from experts comments that our tax system is simple so retain this as a tax principle. 5.have a level tax playing field. I cannot understand why charities,religions and iwi don’t pay tax.Every person or organisation benefits from paying tax so should contribute 6.tax should create incentives. Currently Im taxed on what I earn,what I save ,what I invest in and what I spend. If you want to incentivise people to save or invest then incentivise them accordingly don’t tax them. I cannot understand the anti- publicity and hatred in some instances of people who have invested in property for their financial security and future. Good landlords provide an essential service. If they don’t provide this then the taxpayer will need to spend its money providing housing. Again if Government wants private landlords to provide a service its role should be to set the standards to be achieved and provide an incentive for the provision of rental property. I hear the Government and experts stating that “we must encourage investment in shares not housing” as this more productive. Productive to who!! I can’t understand this as shares have never been good to me .They are so volatile and influenced by what happens overseas or issues non relevant.People with shares have no input into how a company is operated and in most cases wouldn’t have a clue. The share market in my opinion is no different than gambling!! Who decided that investment in shares was better for me than property?? Probably someone with an interest in the share market I guess. This is a very important issue your group is looking at. If your Group is tempted to bring in some sort of capital gains tax then please adhere to the level playing principle and apply the tax to EVERY item where an increase in value occurs. For the sake of clarity I am totally opposed to any form of capital gains tax It is nothing more than an ENVY TAX . Good luck with your very important deliberations.

Regards, Joseph Corbett-Davies 115 From:kevin morland Sent: Wednesday, 28 March 2018 6:57 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I have a view of tax from and equitable and fairness perspective and 30 odd years of direct work in the tax compliance area. One of the ugliest and more recent and aggressively pushed practices that directly impact on and put the tax base at ever growing risk is the predatory use of Labour hire contracts. Inshort businesses take on staff in so called labour hire positions and they do exactly the same work at a materially less rate than an employee who would otherwise be on the minimum wage with holidays sick leave etc etc. Truck drivers and building trades are where I see a lot of this however it is spreading out into pretty much all areas where people are employed. It is allowed to do so with the simple use of a labour hire company to front it. Im not talking about the genuine labour hire companies here Im talking about a company structure put in place to access the ability to use predatory labour hire contracts instead of employing staff. The effect is a general deliberate lowering and marginalising of the incomes and security of the Labour hire workers. Immigrants and lower socio economic and unskilled groups are targeted. They are given contract work on peice rates where the actual time required to do the work is understated and they may in some instances be receiving significantly less than what would otherwise be the minimum wage in an employer employee arrangement. (That means a necessity to work extended hours to make ends meet, and in the case of truck drivers beyond legal limits in some instances) They are also left to address there own PAYE with no witholding tax deducted or at best the minimum 10% which is well short of the actual minimum final taxation rate. In addition as there is no sick leave no annual leave and all the administrative costs of accounting for taxation are left to the labour hire contractor to address the ability to make ends meet and pay tax is a near practical impossibility and encourages a massive level of non compliance. The Revenue loss to NZ is significant as in most cases no PAYE is ever collected and the administrative costs of trying to address this is prohibitive and uneconomic. The employer places the labour hire contractor in a position where they are extremely unlikely to ever pay tax and deliberately avoids deducting and paying the witholding tax so the money in the hand is sufficient to live on. This in turn forces those people into the hidden economy as non compliant taxpayers. The economic benefit sought under the labour hIre contract is pretty much premised and underpinned by the non collection and payment of witholding tax and PAYE . The direct saving on what are essentially minimal administration costs is presented as the legitimate reason, in reality it’s just greed and a rort on minimum labour standards. This is creating a seriously marginalised and growing underclass with the community being left to pick up the tab for what are essentially predatory labour market practices presented as flexible self choice options. In reality for the “employee” contractor its that or the dole or nothing and the power imbalance is massive. It also puts genuine compliant businesses who meet and manage their PAYE and employer responsibilities at a competitive disadvantage in the business community . By allowing these abour hire contracts to exist we are basically promoting both predatory labour market practices and outright tax evasion and non compliance right throughout the business community. \[1\] 116 If you are serious at all about creating improvements to ensure an equitable tax system then a general stiffening of the definition of an employee to end these predatory practices and ensure the PAYE is actually collected on behalf of the community is a simple and easy must do. What we currently have is something descending into a form of slavery with small businesses and not so small ones contracting out of minimum wage rate requirements through the use of labour hire contracts and a marginalising of workers and honest businesses who meet their obligations. Sent from Mail for Windows 10 117 From:Kyle Sutherland Sent: Wednesday, 28 March 2018 3:14 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Submission I realise the scope of the Tax Working Group is limited, but as a trained accountant, here is my opinion on tax in New Zealand. I believe we need to make bold changes to our current tax system to reflect growing inequalities, an ageing population, environmental destruction and the need for a bigger tax base to service healthcare, education and renewable transport. We also need to plan for a universal basic income as technology is set to replace up to 50% of jobs over the coming decades. Firstly, there needs to be a new top tax income tax bracket. This would be say on $100-120k per year and would be aligned closer to Australia's top tax rate of 45c. This will help address wealth inequalities and give the government more ability to reallocate funds to those struggling in our society who desperately need it. Multinational corporations should be legally forced to pay tax on revenues earned in New Zealand. It is completely unfair that corporate giants such as Apple and Google can use tax loopholes such as transfer pricing to shift profits overseas and avoid contributing to the country they sold their products in. This will add hundreds of millions in tax to our government coffers. GST needs to be removed from public benefit goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, and increased on luxury items such as new cars and boats as well as bad for health products such as sugar drinks. The ov erall GST rate should be around 10% overall those in the lower economic class spend nearly all of their weekly earnings on products such as food, power and petrol. Long term investments need to be taxed similarly to how we tax short term investments. This includes something along the lines of a capital gains or land tax on investment property to reduce investment incentives for speculative propert investment and relieve the pressure on our housing market in crisis. A wealth tax also needs to be investigated to see the most effective way of taxing those who have benefited the most from an unequal tax system. Any commercial businesses which are operating for profit under a charity or religious institution should not be exempt from paying tax just like everyone else. Donations to charities are tax deductible, so if they wish to shift profits to charities then they can do that just like any other business currently can. Companies like Sanitarium turn over hundreds of millions a year, and it is absurd that they can get away without paying income tax. There also needs to be a tax on environmental pollution such as freshwater pollution and greenhouse gas emissions to make polluter pay and create a fund from which we can clean up and mitigate the damage done to our rivers, seas, soils and climate. We have the science available to track and tax the things that are polluting such as fertilisers, irrigation, and cows belching. Small businesses under a certain turnover should have a lower tax rate than big corporates. This is essential going into the future to address the effect technology will have on our society, as big corporates such as supermarket chains and technology corporates will own the machines which replace human \[1\] 118 labour. These higher taxes can then be redistributed through a Universal Basic Income to address the massive inequalities that will result between those who own the capital and those who don't. Many thanks for your time reading and I hope you at least make some of the necessary changes to address the current and future issues our society is and will face. Kind regards, Kyle Sutherland 119 From:Valerie Rowe-Mitchell Sent: Wednesday, 28 March 2018 2:52 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission as invited by Tax Working Group Please see below my submission as invited by Tax Working Group My submission is mainly concerns Distribution and equity Introduction of higher/new tax type’s tax on wealth, can potentially be a good step forward as long as everyone on the country is benefiting from it. It is a getting to the point that New Zealand is literally taxes the people who work and, distributes to the people who doo not. This does not seem as a fair system. The people who pay tax, comply and obey all the governments’ laws are actually disadvantaged. I have to say the “Future of Tax Submissions Background Paper” is absolutely brilliant, very insightful and gives a comprehensive summary of tax system. The figure 6, page 25 (see below) is what motivated me to put this submission forward. It is pretty clear that the Governments biggest expenses are Social Security and welfare. People like myself, work full time, pay tax on time, but benefit from minority categories, being: Health, Core government services, Law and order, Finance costs, Economic and industrial services, Transport and communications, Defence, Environmental protection Heritage, culture and recreation, Primary services, Housing and community development. A substantial chunk about 33% goes to Social Welfare. It is understandable that other, less fortunate people need to be supported, but the taxpayers, who actually pay the tax are fortunate because we work hard, we educate ourselves, have personal and professional goals. This is not because we are fortune or lucky, it is just a product of perseverance, work ethics, and desire to add and contribute. The question is how do we motivate the people who do not work to get up and go, if there is always benefit available to them? It is clear, there are people who need social welfare – but it is also clear, there is a whole “army” of lazy people, milking the system instead of working and adding to this country’s growth. \[1\] 120 I propose to amend the Tax System by:  Choose one universal Tax rate for all other than individual entities, say 33% for trusts, companies – all small or big, as the idea of taxing based on turnover is not very thought through as people will get creative and split businesses into smaller companies, just for the purpose of lower turnover – this will only complicate things.  Continue with the current rates for individuals, which privileges people on a lower income – which is reasonable.  Remove ALL Benefits  Tax Alcohol and Smoking at 100%, these are deadly addictions and we need to force this country stop not just smoking but drinking too.  Establish Universal Income Pay to each citizen over 18 year of age, instead of social welfare. This will mean every person will be getting a piece of that pie and if you choose to work – you work and get more money if you do not, that it is your choice.

My submission will focus on the tax liabilities of individuals; namely PAYE earners and those on NZ Superannuation. With holding tax on investment earnings We need to encourage individual savings and investment. The current system of taxing interest earnings is a disincentive to those goals. I believe that individuals, with investments in term deposits with existing trading banks should be given taxation reli ef. For example, there should be a taxation threshold on interest earnings of say 50,000 dollars. Interest earnings above that threshold could be subject to taxation. Secondary tax Here is a tax that is such a disincentive to peoples productivity and desire to better themselves. It is, in my mind, crazy to increase a persons tax burden merely because they have more than on job or have other sources of income as in the example above. The current system of varying rates and a wash-up (if one is lucky) after each tax year is cumbersome and unfair. National Superannuation As most people on a pension will spend that money on goods and services, they are already being taxed 15% with GST. Add that figure to current taxation rates, then the net amount received for National Super is greatly reduced. There is an argument, because most pensioners spend all of their super, they are paying sufficient taxation already.

It seems to me grossly unfair and a major disincentive to my continuing to do this when I am then required to pay 43% plus GST Fringe Benefit Tax on top of the substantial healthcare premiums involved. The advantages to the Government in encouraging individual healthcare takeup are surely real and apparent. If individuals take responsibility for their own healthcare and have their needs met through the private hospital system the notorious overcrowding and wait-times experienced in the public health system would surely be alleviated. Furthermore, why not offer individuals who benefit the state system of healthcare by maintaining their own cover tax deductions, rather than tax impositions on their benificent employers? Has the matter of FBT tax on employer-funded health insurance schemes vs the drain on the public health system of those same employees if not so insured ever been carefully costed? I suspect not. Please give this matter your careful consideration. Yours faithfully, On 20/03/2018, at 3:57 PM, Peter wrote: This email has been filtered by SMX.

With recent progressive changes allowing same-sex marriage, and civil unions, there is no discrimination in this policy. Consider a scenario: 1. Couple one are both working, and earning $75,000 per year each. In this scenario, their household tax liability is $33424.56 (2x$16712.28). 2. Couple two has one partner working, and the other staying home looking after the children. The working partner earns $150,000 per year. In this scenario, their household tax liability is $42,143.88 So, conceptually, both couples are contributing the same amount of productivity to the economy. However, the second couple is $8,719.32 worse off due to the income being pegged to the individual, rather than the family unit. My proposal is to enable the couple to share their income for tax purposes, to allow an even playing field for both these couples (and the myriad other permutations there are). I believe that household income is already taken in to account for calculating other tax positions, such as WFF, so this would not be a significant burden on IRD to make this change. The benefits here are social - enabling parents to make better choices about the up-bringing of their children. They may decide that one partner can afford to be a full-time parent, or to only work part-time, for example. Plenty of research suggests that this is good for children, and therefore makes a more productive society as those children become future adults. It is also clearly much more fair. I am happy to be contacted about this submission if the Working Group would like to discuss. Regards Jonno Smith \[1\]\[1\] \[1\] 124 From:Jonno Smith Sent: Wednesday, 28 March 2018 9:20 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission: KiwiSaver and National Superannuation Superannuation will be a problem for future generations - this is well documented. The age needs to be lifted, probably to 67. However, this is an "unsellable" proposition for voters. My suggestion is: 1. Unlink the age of superannuation entitlement from the age of Kiwisaver withdrawal eligibility. You could leave Kiwisaver eligibility at 65, and raise superannuation entitlement to 67. In this way, you are saying to NZers - we can't afford to continue superannuation at the current age, but, if you want to retire earlier, it is in your hands. 2. Even better, would be to reduce the age of Kiwisaver entitlement. For example, for every year you increase superannuation entitlement, you reduce Kiwisaver by a year. With your current policy of superannuation being raised to 67, Kiwisaver eligibility would be 63. What you are saying to NZers here is - we will actually let you retire earlier, if you put away enough during your working years. In both the examples above, I think it is important the superannuation remains a universal entitlement. What I have read from other countries where superannuation is means-tested, the cost of administering and investigating the means-testing is equivalent or higher than just giving the superannuation to everyone. It has also long been a view that a national superannuation is a "right" for NZers - taking that away would be political suicide. The above would have the following significant benefits for NZ. 1. It would be cost-positive. The out-goings of superannuation would not start until 67. There would also be some reduction in Government contributions to Kiwisaver as some people stop working before the retirement age. 2. It would encourage NZers to save in areas other than residential property (there has been plenty of writing lately about why that is a important for a modern economy). 3. It would be seen as a positive step toward the unpopular (but required) move to increase the age of superannuation.

Hilda Halkyard-Harawira \[1\]\[1\] \[1\] 126 From:Mark Kokich Sent: Tuesday, 27 March 2018 8:10 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Dear Group Members, My name is Mark Kokich and I am a qualified Accountant. I thank you for the opportunity to make a submission. One of the most positive aspects of our current tax system is that it is relatively simple and therefore easy to comply with and efficient. This promotes a high level of compliance from taxpayers.I consider this to a very important attribute. I urge you to have this front of mind when considering changes which would complicate the tax system. For example - further Goods and Services Tax exemptions and the addition of new taxes. The more complex the tax system is the less compliance there will be. In additio n, more effort and resources will be expended by taxpayers to both comply and minimise their tax liabilities.These resources would be better utilised in improving business efficiency. Wealth Taxes - I understand that the imposition of some form of "wealth tax" may be discussed by the Group.I interpret this as potentially being a tax on assets held by an individual not a business. These assets may comprise both financial assets and real assets. I am completely opposed to any such taxes. Firstly, the capita l that has been employed to purchase those assets has generally been saved from income earned which has already had tax paid on it. To tax it again would be iniquitous. Secondly, any income earned from those assets is generally taxed anyway. Taxing income makes far more sense to me than taxing wealth. Income generally gives rise to cash inflows which a taxpayer can then use to pay any tax owing. "Wealth" can give hugely variable cash inflows to the owner. There may therefore be very little relationship be tween the tax levied on wealth and the ability of the owner of that wealth to pay the tax. This may put taxpayers in a very difficult position. I further understand that a wealth tax maybe particularly aimed at those who hold real estate. We already have rules in place to capture tax on the profits of property trading. If a property is purchased with the intention of resale at a profit then any profit is taxable. Likewise, if a taxpayer frequently trades in property then it maybe deemed that they are a property trader and the profits of this activity are taxable. These same rules apply consistently across shares and other forms of investment. The IRD should therefore be properly resourced to police the existing rules rather that creating new taxes. My overall impression is that this Tax Working Group has been convened to further this Government's social policy agenda - ie this Government believes there is wealth inequality and it wants to take money off some people and redistribute it to others. Unfortunately for them people have never been equal in the way they make and look after their own money and other resources. It is impossible to tax your way to an "equitable society".The result will be a less efficient tax system, more non-compliance, a less efficient economy.and wealth inequity will still exist. Thanks and regards, Mark Kokich \[1\] \[1\] 127 From:Andrew Hunt Sent: Tuesday, 27 March 2018 3:07 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Overall, I think our tax system is relatively fair. With changes begun by the previous government, and continued by this one, the one major loophole - flipping real-estate, has been resolved. Any changes need to carefully consider the signals they send. They need to be consistent and unequivocal. For example, altering GST to exempt essentials, or fresh fruit and vege would be a poor change as it has too many exceptions and can be gamed. Likewise a sugar tax sounds good, but is impractical and would drive alternative behaviours (eg corn syrups) A tax system needs to be principled and encourage the behaviours we wish society to engage it. If we want as many kiwis as possible to have a meaningful and rewarding career, then the tax system needs to encourage this – and therefore abatement rates on various benefits or secondary taxes need to be more attractive to help people invest in their futures. If we want to encourage savings, then anything that penalises savings such as superannuation thresholds, or wealth taxes, needs to be taken off the table. Having kiwis chose to save and invest some of their income, and to undertake enterprising activities, are to be encouraged and the rewards of that effort need to be maximised. Kiwi’s that choose not to save and instead rely on becoming too much of a burden to the tax payer need to be sent a signal to reconsider those decisions. Likewise, a strength of our current system is that it doesn’t leave people behind who, through no fault of their own, are unable to provide for themselves. However the system probably needs adjustment to help them realise that their support comes from taxpayers (rather than the government). The concept of business tax losses needs some work, and maybe there should be some formulaic cap on these that discourages genuinely unsustainable businesses, without impacting those that are merely having a bad year or two. Finally, we have a huge charitable & NFP sector in NZ. Considerable work needs to be done to separate out those that are genuinely supporting those that need support from NFP organisations that are really commercial. Recognising the commercial operations’ taxable operations gives a level playing field, while encouraging genuine charitable support allows for a fairer society with a deeper connection between the parties giving and needing support. Kind regards \[1\] 128 From: Sent:Tuesday, 27 March 2018 2:00 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Dr Iain Wilson Dear Sir Thank you for the opportunity to submit thoughts on changes to NZ’s tax structure. My thoughts reflect my occupation as an Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon. 1. I oppose the ‘Hooper- Penny’ Ruling that decrees that Health professionals are ‘Labourers’ and 80 percent of corporate earnings have to be declared as ‘personal income;’ I have been trying to save to fund improvements in Imaging with Cone Beam Tomography and establish my own GA facilities but have found over the last 15 years of practise I have literally been chasing debt to fund my Tax obligations which are my most significant cost. 2. New Zealands Surgical Day Hospitals These facilities benefit from being Charities in many cases with Tax exemption. They seem to have unusual access to bulk funding from ACC; and have a close relationship with Health Insurance providers. 3. The combination of points 1. and 2. is that Medical Practitioners who are very constrained in what they can claim, often burdened with debt from training are subsequently exploited by Surgical Day Hospitals who keep most of what a Surgeon ‘earns’ Tax free whilst the Surgeon pays Tax and GST on whats left. 4. I am concerned that many Charities in Health. Education and Religion are really commercial enterprises not paying their share. 5. I am concerned that International Corporates are essentially Tax exempt. I am sure the TWG is aware of this but challenge them to do something about it. 6. In establishing a Surgical Practise I spent 4 years and $250000 getting ‘Resource Consent’. Non of this cost was claimable. Of my actual costs of practising a very significant amount is ‘not claimable’ Summary Anecdotally Doctors and Dentists are in a privileged position income wise. In reality the costs of training ( which of course are not claimable), consent issues, the Hegemony and connections of Tax exempt and monopolistic Surgical Day Hospitals mean that an ever increasing proportion of Doctors and Dentists are either not practising or are going overseas to practise. Rural GP practise is not financially viable and it staggers me that there is a school of thought that teaching more Doctors will increase availability; ie a new Medical School in the Waikato. \[1\] 129 In NZ wealth is inherited vis farms, quota, consents and is created by Capital gain. Far from levelling inequalities the penal Tax regime that applies to Medicine locks inequities in place. The Tax regime in NZ is leading to corporatisation of both Dentistry eg Lumino and Medicine to the detriment of the Public good, Professional standards and ethics. The governing bodies; NZDC and NZMA seem unaware of this and regulators such as the HDC are constrained in that they can only fault individual Health practitioners. Corporate activity in NZ; related party loans etc is both untaxed and unregulated. Kind regards Dr Iain Wilson 130 From:Bevan Sent: Tuesday, 27 March 2018 9:19 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on Question 2 I selected core services as the main purpose, although secondarily I think it does play an important role in providing a basic standard of living for people who can't support themselves i.e. aged, infirm, mentally impaired etc. The most important role is to provide the shared infrastructure that most of us agree make a better society and that seem to be most efficiently provided by the state - transport (roads, rail, airports), health (hospitals), police, prisons etc. We also want to make sure that there is no reason people should be starving, have no clothes or live on the street. That said people make choices and need to live with the consequences. They might have to move city or make sacrifices to obtain help. I think we need to be careful not to disincentivise work, innovation and effort, and recognise that long term welfare dependence has very negative consequences. I think the role as a 'behaviour changing method' needs to be used with extreme caution, as with any use of government coercion. Whenever po liticians or bureaucrats start imposing their values we need to be careful. There are times when this is necessary for issues that are almost universally agreed. Smoking is an obvious issue where the social harm is obvious and some increase in excise is justified and useful. That said it has the potential to go too far (people still smoking, encourage crime) and be unfair (what about alcohol?). Taxes like any intervention can produce unforeseen consequences so should be used very cautiously in behaviour modification. Thanks Bevan Lewis \[1\] 131 From:Chris Perera Sent: Monday, 26 March 2018 1:42 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to tax working group My submission relates potential; Capital gains Tax (CGT), Land Tax (LT), wealth and inheritance taxes. And specifically how increasing taxes (or increase costs) on land- owners may in fact be passed directly on to tenants via increased rents. This is based on the premise that any market with excess demand or under supply, extra costs will flow through to an increase in price. In a market with excess demand, any chance to increase prices will be seized on by the market. For example, we have recently seen that in Wellington November 2017 to February 2018, where a $50 increase in student allowance immediately caused in a $50 increase in rent prices. Increase rent prices flowed through to other renters competing with students. These other renters didn't get the $50 extra per week. Jacinda called these landlords ‘unscrupulous’ but I think this is just how any market works when there is excess demand. I believe by increasing costs to landlords while there is excess demand, the market will have the same result of an increase in price. Conversely I believe if you increase taxes to landlords when there is over-supply the landlords will have to absorb more, if not all of the costs. So the right time to move the tax burden on to land-owners is to first fix the supply & demand imbalance. Otherwise i feel for those on the bottom. They will be the ones who suffer. And these are the ones Labour government is trying to help. Yet, every new tax on landowners will turn into increases in rent.

I oppose any further taxation proposed to penalize long-term landlords. Reasons are as follows: About 90% of long term landlords are Mum and Dad landlords who own one or two properties to save for their superannuation. They provide an excellent service, which otherwise the Government will have to provide. About 40% of New Zealand houses and flats are owned by landlords. This is probably the largest industry in New Zealand and probably worth about 400 Billion dollars. Discouraging these owners is risky as it will bring a shortage in rental housing. Those who suffer most will be the most vulnerable. These small time landlords have to go to work to subsidize their future superannuation investment as in the first five to ten years most properties do not make a profit. They of course invest for future capital gain. They sacrifice today's enjoyment for a future when other non investor prefer to spend their money now. Most Mum and Dad landlords are ordinary people like teacher’s nursers plumbers electricians and so on. They should not be considered the enemy or the greedy rich as they are not so. More people should be encouraged to provide rental homes otherwise the State will have to do it, which mean a lot of capital funding from the state, operating costs, and the loss of income tax paid by landlords. Consider the problems that the State is having with state own housing. \[1\] 134 Once the mortgage is partially paid when the properties start making a profit Mum and Dad landlords pay income tax. Insurance cost a lot of money. Mortgage interest is rising. Other maintenance costs that are made compulsory by the government cost a lot of money. A high standard of accommodation cannot be provided and still charge low rents. Many Landlords are upgrading their properties to meet the current standards and now charge higher rents. Those who cannot afford high rents will not have a place to live. In rural areas the situation will get worse as if you charge $200 for a four bedroom house it is impossible to meet current requirements. All these proposed changes are intended to help the tenant. But actually to will have the opposite affect and it will penalize the tenant as their rent goes up.

I will try to keep it brief. I see modern NZ as divided into two classes - an asseted class whose best interests are served by growing the value of their assets and a non asseted class with nothing to offer the country but their productivity. I see the current tax regime as serving the interests of the asseted while punishing the productive. Example: Consider two Kiwis, firstly a recent graduate trained in an economically relevant profession with no assets except a student loan, and secondly a recent retiree who has had a successful carer and owns both their own home and an investment property. Their is massive transfer of wealth from the graduate to the retiree under the current system. 1. The graduate must pay back their student loan plus interest 2. The graduate must pay National Superannuation to the retiree 3. The graduate must pay for the health care costs of the retiree 4. The graduate must save for their own retirement 5. The graduate must pay a higher multiple of their income to by real property than the retiree did While some of these issues may seem outside of the scope of the TWG they are not in that they can be addressed the groups recommendations. I feel that a country that is as punitive to the productive as New Zealand is cannot possibly hope to grow its per capita productivity without change. The best recommendation the TWG could make to would be to implement a broad based land tax without exemptions. The revenue from this tax could be used to lower income tax which would increase the incentive to work for those capable of being productive. I feel that the TWG should make its recommendations without considering political implications. Let the politicians worry about what is possible. The TWG should be concerned with what is best for the country. FYI: The phrase "excludes the family home" is offensive to those that will never own a family home.

Name of submitter: Paul Elwell-Sutton Address: Phone: No phone Email: St atement: 1.) I am a retired trapper for the Department of Conservation (DOC). 2.) I hold a BSc (1970) from Aberdeen University, Scotland. I make the following submission: 1.) My first and most important submission is that taxation policy must at all times be excl uded from being subject to any past, present or future trade and investment agreements, partnerships, treaties, compacts or similar tools, that New Zealand has been, is, or will be, party to. Reason: Taxation policy is an intensely domestic issue, and while it should adhere to recognised international standards, must respond to domestic priorities as democratically determined. Taxation policy must not be subjected to the ‘chilling’ effect of potential penalties such as, but not limited to, Investor State Disputes System (ISDS) clauses in the above agreements. While New Zealand’s trading partners and investors may disagree with certain tax policies, it is essential to recognise that those policies are normal business risks, and to eliminate such risks is to d istort and hamper a properly functioning business environment, as well as handicapping an open, vibrant and functioning democracy. 2.) There is a pressing need for taxes on environmental footprints. Reason: Currently, the environmental impacts of activities such as farming, forestry, commercial fishing, property development and infrastructure projects are subsidised by society because they are untaxed, while their costs are borne by the tax-paying public. This artificially inflates the profitability of those activities and may mask their actual bankruptcy. Environmental degradation, which must include greenhouse gas emissions (GHGEs), is one of the most serious issues facing New Zealand, and taxing environmental degradation, including GHGEs, has the potential to ease or reverse it, while reducing taxes on labour (income tax) and consumption (gst). 3.) Our present tax regime is unbalanced. The bulk of tax revenue is collected from labour in the form of income tax, and consumption in the form of gst, while capital and assets are lightly taxed or not taxed at all, and as explained above, environmental degradation is untaxed. This means that capital and environmental degradation are subsidised by taxes on labour and consumption; taxes which impact most on low to middle income earners. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 139 This is an intolerable situation because it exacerbates the accumulation of wealth and attendant power within an ever decreasing circle of holders of capital, consequently leading to increasing economic inequality within NZ society and the inevitable raft of societal ills which accompany high levels of such inequality. These are costly to central and local government and of course to taxpayers, as well as being destructive o f social well-being and cohesion. 4.) Any new taxation policies must be expressly designed to prevent their costs being passed on to low to middle income families and persons living in rental properties. This seems obvious, but potential and unwanted consequences of improper tax policies may be overlooked, and careful design is less trouble than attempts to remedy poorly designed policies after their enactment.

I got notified of the option to make a submission on tax from a stuff.co.nz article. I do have some opinions on the subject so it does make sense to voice them and hopefully contribute constructively to the discussion. I am a 32 year old owner of a small business owner based in Auckland, so I guess my opinions are influenced by my current situation and what affects me on a day to day basis.  The first is that the New Zealand tax laws leave us at a competitive disadvantage to competition, 99% of which are based overseas. This is particularly in relation to GST which our competitors do not pay. I know that this is an issue in other areas of business as well. I get that this is an extremely difficult area but I get the feeling that large offshore companies receive exemptions on GST based on their size which makes it difficult to compete as a New Zealand based company.  I do not agree with a wealth tax on a wholesale level. Although I do believe that society needs to be able to distribute income to help those that get left behind. I think as a society you can only move as fast as your slowest person.  The best way to do this is to tax property investment (not home ownership to live in), particularly residential property investment. I think an investment should always be looked at in terms of the service or product that it produces. The product for residential property is a home for people to live. In my view, (and it is controversial) is that the majority of residential investors have become wealthy without contributing much to society, aside from proving rental property that would otherwise be used as a first home.  You cannot blame investors for this as it is setup as a low risk/high return and tax free way to build wealth. The side consequence of this is a stifling of innovation, risk taking and entrepreneurial characteristics that New Zealand's free market system should be rewarding. To summarise, I would like to see a levelling of the playing field so local businesses are encouraged to compete with international companies and a tax on residential property investment (not home ownership). All in all though, while it is not perfect, I think New Zealanders are lucky to have the stability, transparency and proportional representation that we typically have in government. Since I have been able to vote we have been lucky to have had level headed leadership - from Clark, Key, English and now Adhern. This is important because I have seen first hand the shambolic nature of many international governments and the impact that it can have on society.

I suggest you bring in a top rate of PAYE income tax of 50% for those on 250k or more. Also, have a tax free threshold of 15k for PAYE. Also, abolish family trusts as a tax vehicle. This was done in UK in the mid-1970s. 2 nd home owners need taxing more. Double the rates on their holiday houses. Those working 2 or 3 part time jobs to make ends meet, get rid of the secondary tax. They should be encouraged to work, not discouraged by paying higher tax rates on their 2 nd income. Drop corporation tax by 3 %. Halt all overseas purchases of NZ residential property. Also, find a way to stop NZ-based shell companies operating as vehicles for overseas-based residential purchases. Overall, you need to make tax compliance more serious, rather than the voluntary ethos that pervades at present. I see numerous people driving round in their lovely 4x4 vehicles with some coffee shop advert on the side. Why should a vehicle be a tax write off for a coffee shop? Comparing the UK tax system with NZ, it’s a rort like the wild west here, and the inequality is increasing, and social cohesion is decreasing.

Prior to the 2017 election, much of the media coverage on CGT, touched on Small Business CGT together with other Capital Gains, such as Property, Shares and Investments. Further to this, the original Labour Party Policy for CGT included Small Business CGT. This submission is based on the following key points, which demonstrate how Small Businesses Value and taxation are completely different from that of Property, Shares and Investments. The Value in a Business is built from Income that has already been taxed. Implementing a CGT on Small Businesses contravenes the principle and requirement of the Small Business in todays work and employment philosophy. In current times, many people are in small businesses working more hours for less money, rather than on salary working for large companies. Either as an owner, director or significant share holder, the extra hours are put in, to build the business in value, so that on retiring, those people can sell the business or its assets, and put the funds towards retirement. It could be said that the money from the sale should be taxed, but in reality, it already has, as each bit of income to the business paid GST, and income tax on any profit is paid annually. The Value in a Business is from actual work done, rather than economic value changes. There is a fundamental difference between what a Business sells for, as opposed to property, shares or investments. The value of the Business is due to the Owner, Director or Significant Share Holder actually doing the work. The value of property, shares or investments, is largely driven up by market value, time and economics, often not directly related to the actual owner's daily activities, working etc. A fundamental difference can be seen here, that each year a property may go up in value, but there is no GST or income tax paid on that. The Business on the other hand, is taxed, and pays GST throughout its life. The value doesn't go up by itself. Business Growth results in employment opportunities Another difference between the Small Business and property investments, is that as the Owner puts in extra effort to build the business, it often results in creating some employment opportunities. If the Small Business is faced with a potential CGT on the sale of the business at retirement, it reduces the desirability to build the business beyond what is required just to survive, so is less likely to grow to the point of employing people. Property investments, no matter how well they do, will not create any employment opportunities. Asset Sales from within the Business are already taxed. During its life, a business may come to own large assets. These would be either created, as they are a part of the business, or they may be bought. These assets are then depreciated, based on IRD rules, and without regard for actual value. When the business is sold, eg for retirement, the assets are sold as part of the business or separately, and the value gained may be more, the same or less than IRD values, based on depreciation. If they are more tha n IRD, the business then must pay the difference in tax based on the asset sale price gain as an income. This is another significant difference to Property, Shares etc, where this depreciation and asset sale gain is largely not applied. Summary I would like to submit, that Small Businesses should not have a CGT applied when sold for retirement, or when sold after perhaps 10+ years with the same Owner, Director or Significant Shareholder. This submission includes not having an exemption to meet this. An exemption can result in a value that is to small, such as the Labour Party's previous policy of $250,000. To have a value like that, is saying, that is all you need to retire with, but that is not the case, and it is not possible to know in the future, how much will be needed, eg how much is $250,000 worth now, compared with five years time, or ten years time. It may have been enough to retire on 50 years ago, but obviously not enough to retire on \[1\] 152 in 50 years time from now. The point here is that any value limit for exemption needs to be totally dynamic, so is not practical. If a more valuable business will provide more for retirement, this will reduce the pension for those who receive the funds, through secondary taxation. This should be considered enough, to avoid the need for a financial limited exemption.

I don’t know what revenue land tax on foreigners would raise compared to petrol tax of 10 cents P/L which I suspect is much more. I do know a much more acceptable solution to most New Zealanders and that is land tax on foreigners property. Land Tax is totally separate from Capital Gains tax which will meet a lot of opposition from NZs. The wife and I have been fortunate in traveling to Redcliffe Queensland Australia each year and during that time have purchased several properties. The two residential properties one a house we reside in and the other an old high set house converted into 2 flats with income just covered the outgoings . We paid the stamp duty on the purchase of both and since rates , insurance, property management, income tax, & Land Tax as foreigners of $14,000 per annum split between the wife and I for tax purposes. Last year the Queensland Government raised the Land Tax on Foreigners double and we now pay $29,000 per annum which means we have to subsidize the land tax or sell the property. I believe this is what we should do with foreigners in NZ as it would sort out the foreigners whom past PM Key allowed to purchase property without acting soon enough to stop them. The foreigners have raped the Auckland CBD none of our grandchildren will be able to purchase in Auckland they may now have to look at a purchase in the Chatham Islands. Australia was clever they only allowed Foreigners to purchase bare land or new construction off the plan which creates work. The other tax I would like to see is on retail items purchased over the internet including internet firms such as Google, Facebook, etc this would bring a lot of revenue I do know that retailers would appreciate a level playing field as they have to pay outgoings of staff, rent, rates, insurance, management, etc. I have observed others operating out of a garage, lounge, basement etc advertising over the internet and accepting cash with very little or no overheads. I have heard from several retailers that people come into their shop for example to try on a pair of shoes to get the size and colour and leave to purchase off the internet.

As a registered charitable trust we have found the practice between grants from Central Govt agencies and our local Govt agencies to be inconsistent and causing us to use public grant money for the paying of tax to the IRD through purchases - not very ideal. However the grants come in two differing systems - Creative New Zealand - pay GST on grants - grant + 15% GST DIA - pay GST on grants - grant + 15% GST Since 2013 local govt grants from Auckland Council have no GST paid, just a grant zero GST. Prior to 2013 the local Govt grants were paid + 15% GST. However GST is paid on grants administered by Auckland Council on behalf of Creative New Zealand, again this seems inconsistent. This two tiered system is disadvantages us due to the net result being we have to pay GST to IRD for up to 6 months before getting only a small proportion back on a our return. eg For every $10000 paid without GST, the recipient is legally obliged to pay $1500 in GST above the $10000. This is a significant amount for small charities having to subsidise the IRD for 6 months before making a return and getting a partial refund. Only the licensing trusts do not pay GST on grants overall, they are being treated as a charitable donation which is how those Trusts are calibrated, ie Lion Foundation etc. However the Auckland Council change in 2013 does not fit this model, Council are not making a charitable donation to the organisations they support - these are public investments under a contract and agreement for a return to the community and as such the grants come under 'service'. The service being the return to the community for the grant. All grant agreements provide for leverage from the grant, specific services the organisation must provide to comply with the terms and conditions of the grant. We strongly believe that GST should be paid on grants from local Govt as well as Central Govt. As the tax system is under review we believe the GST payable on grants should be with both central and local Govt grants due to them being agents of the Crown. Please advise if this is an area that can be looked at, its unfair by local Govt to expect charities to hold spare $1500 GST for every $10000 given to carry out the terms and conditions of the grant. \[1\] 2 We seek a review.

How we transition to a truly sustainable economic system. The changes required to do this are immense and I believe tax offers the simplest mechanism to achieve this goal. Tax as a tool to ensure business meets the true costs from activity New Zealand has finite natural resources located in fragile ecological and climate systems. To live sustainably in this environment all activities must be carefully managed to ensure detrimental environmental effects are remedied or avoided. Sustainable development is difficult in New Zealand’s free-market economy as decision making is largely driven by a short-term profit imperative. Within our free-market economy tax offers the simplest solution to this profit imperative, by ensuring all actual costs from an activity are included when determining profit. To do this requires a broadening of the tax base to include a levy on the outputs of business activity which has a negative effect on the environment. What outputs should be levied is a scientific question, with greenhouse gas emissions, nitrate emissions, and particulate aerosols being obvious examples. The size of the levy should be determined by the overall cost to society from the output. A broad-based tax system of this nature would provide a relatively simple way to incorporate the true costs from economic activity. It would replace the New Zealand Emission Trading Scheme and avoid water ownership issues by promoting the careful management of water resources to minimise the leaching of pollutants. This system would create a fairer society by ensuring business costs are not socialised while profits are privatised. It would promote the efficient use of the natural resources to ensure maximum overall gain for everyone from any use. It would also promote the technological development of ways to remedy or avoid environmental degradation. The transition from our current tax system to the broader tax system I propose would need to be carefully transitioned to minimise economic disruption. However it must happen in the near future as New Zealand is currently experiencing very high levels of environmental degradation which is incurring very significant future costs to society (including a possibility of extinction). Thank you for the opportunity to provide my view, Gregory Stanton \[1\] \[1\] 4 From:Dave Gilbert Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 10:35 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax Reform Dear Tax Working Group Secretariat, I welcome the opportunity to submit to the Tax Working Group, thank you. My submission is as follows:  That the Tax Working Group extends the remit of its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system. The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated that the lack of tax transparency is a global problem that needs a global solution. New Zealand is implicated in the global problem and has a part to play in finding a solution.  Developing countries are missing out on $150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance. This tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. This money could go a long way towards funding critical infrastructure including healthcare and education.  Governments must act together to force this system to end. New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms. This will be most easily done through a new UN-based global tax body.  A UN Tax body will ensure all countries participate on an equal footing and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax. Kind Regards Dave Gilbert \[1\] 5 From:Shona Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 10:00 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Importance: High 26/4/2018 Attention: Tax Working Group Listed below are my recommendations for increasing the governments tax take overall while reducing the tax burden on the working population ofNew Zealand. NZ has become an unequal society. Removal of GST is essential in balancing this inequity. Green Taxes are essential as is an FTT. 1 Financial Transactions Tax (set at around .01%) which taxes all money going through our banks. This won’t be noticed by any of us day to day but will bring in large sums of money from corporate billionaires and speculators who move billions in and out of New Zealand every day. This tax would replace GST – a vicious tax on low incomes. 2. A comprehensive Capital Gains Tax which would tax the unearned income of the wealthy and the super- wealthy. Wage and salary earners can’t avoid tax. We are taxed on every dollar we earn and every dollar we spend. Why not the billionaires? 3. We need a much higher top tax rate – currently we have one of the lowest in the world. Why should corporate CEOs pay just 33% on their vastly inflated salaries in tax when much more is demanded in other countries? (Eg Denmark 55.8%; Australia 49%; USA 46.3%; France 54%; UK 45%) 4. Finally two suggestions for Green Taxes. Effluent tax on Dairy production. CO2 taxes especially on tourists. The greater distance they travel to get to NZ the more they pay to enter NZ. Tax all Rental vehicles rented to short term stay visitors if they are not Electric Vehicles. These are all worth considering and are constructive recommendations. Shona Rutherford \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 6 From:Julia Maskill Sent: Thursday, 26 April 2018 9:10 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: educating about tax Dear Tax Working Group, I believe that the working group should address a cultural issue: a deeply held view that tax is a bad thing. I raise this because I understand the government is generally keen to address all reforms within a systems framework that acknowledges how different sectors fit together. I believe that negative opinions about tax are fed by global and popular culture and a widespread ignorance about the social contract and what tax pays for. In particular, the evidence for my belief about widespread hostility to tax comes from four years of lecturing social science subjects in small classes at a technical institute in a Foundation Education programme. Many of the students who ‘hated' tax were currently benefitting from government support but needed extra information to make connections. Of course government’s performance is most crucial for credibility of the social contract argument. However, I believe that all of government should consider opportunities to explicitly address scepticism about the tax funded public sector. For example, there may be opportunities in the recently announced cultural review of the Ministry of Social Development. Benefits could be explicitly administered in the context of a caring community. One element may be for staff to present themselves as representatives of the tax payers who pay for benefits as mutual safety net providers. There are almost certainly opportunities in education, for example a review of school curricula for financial literacy and economics to ensure understanding of the social contract is included.

Sincerely, Dr Anthony Asteriadis Sent from my iPad \[1\] 8 From: Sent:Wednesday, 25 April 2018 9:46 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax submission 26 April 2018 Tax Working Group Secretariat PO Box 3724 WELLINGTON 6140 Email: submissions@taxworkinggroup.govt.nz Tax Working Group Submission I wish to make the following submission. I am prepared to further discuss points I have raised if required. This is an opportunity to level the playing field of benefit rights and taxation responsibilities of the private citizen. Reviews of benefits and taxation cannot be separated into different areas; fairness between the two can only be achieved if both benefits and taxation are reviewed together. As Oliver Wendell Holmes stated ‘taxes are what we pay for a civilised society’. If taxes are perceived by society to be fair then logically compliance rates should also be high. Taxes for use of environmental assets should apply; people should pay for the resources they use. DOC charges for the use of back-country huts but other DOC assets remain free to the general public although tourist operators may pay concession fees. Operators using water should pay for the use of water; the income derived being used to mitigate the effects of changed water flows. Taxes raised from the use of other resources used should also be used to mitigate the effects of the resource use. To reduce the dependence on the use of private vehicles (driverless electric cars will not reduce the number of vehicles on the road) and the congestion created, Town Planning rules will need to be altered (e.g. in Petone there are supermarkets opposite each other in Jackson Street and then no further supermarket until Hutt City (a \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 9 distance of 3.9kms), where there are four in close proximity and the next supermarket northwards is in Stokes Valley (a distance of 10.8km from Hutt City CBD). This makes no sense if there is an intention to reduce the number of cars and consequently both the demand for roads and parking (a non-productive use of land) and pollution. Other taxes imposed in an effort to change people’s behaviour may not produce the desired effect (unintended consequences), e.g. the tobacco tax which has apparently produced a black market and a number of dairy robberies. To be seen as fair, taxation must be simple and understandable. Demographic changes in the next 50 years should not affect the way tax is applied; if various groups find it difficult to access educational and employment opportunities and incomes, their difficulties it should not be solved by concessional tax rates, but through the welfare system. If there is greater reliance on tax from capital income and from consumption rather than from labour income, then any adjustments to the tax rates should be made at that time; in the meantime it only needs to be borne in mind that it may be a necessary change. The gig economy simply means the present system of benefits/tax will become unfair. People who are in and out of work on a regular basis do not need stand-down periods before they can pick up a ready-to-work benefit. The only fair way will be to introduce a universal basic income; since this has not been advocated in the TWG papers then is seems the present system will persist. Some people are, therefore, likely to not pursue all employment opportunities because the problems of accessing benefits to which they may be entitled will simply become too complicated. Equality cannot be attained under these circumstances. A UBI could give many people dignity by being able to avoid unnecessary contact with the Welfare services, especially if they live in a town with no Welfare office. The taxation of superannuation contributions will probably, at least in the short-term have to remain as is, since I cannot imagine a Government will wish to postpone that income stream for an indefinite time. This will also minimise the distortion for those who do not have any form of superannuation and instead rely on personal savings to build up a capital base. It would seem fair that benefits/superannuation paid to a person in the (say, last year of life) should be repaid to the state if sufficient funds exist after the proper provision for the surviving spouse/partner and dependent infant children. Gifts made over that time will also need to be included as assets. Otherwise, the state is supporting the intergenerational transfer of taxpayer funds. (This cannot be construed as death duties since it would only be repayment of unused benefit/superannuation). A net 20% of jobs are likely to disappear within the next few years due to technological advances; a shift from taxing labour to taxing capital will be necessary. The exemption of owner-occupied housing from any form of tax except for local government rates creates distortion in the overall tax picture. The tax breaks for housing as noted the TWG background paper spells it out - 40% of owner –occupied housing (by value) is held by the 20% of households with the highest net worth. Given that owner-occupied housing attracts only 11.3% marginal effective tax compared with over 55% for bank account and company dividends it is little wonder that speculation on housing has occurred. To correct the distortion of investment in housing, then either housing (including the family home) should be taxed by way of imputed rental or the tax on investments and superannuation be reduced. It would seem illogical to tax people’s wealth excluding the non-productive portion of that wealth. To tax people’s productive assets will probably encourage taxpayers to speculate on housing, boats, cars, antiques, art collections, etc. This would produce a very unfair tax on those who choose to invest in the productive wellbeing of the country. Housing affordability would not improve. 10 If a wealth tax is to be imposed then it would only be fair to all people if all assets (including the family home) less the mortgages be assessed for tax. A threshold above which the tax applies would need to be considered so that the tax only applies to the richer sector of the community. Similarly if the household assets are held by one partner then the tax-free threshold should be applied for each partner. Trusts would be also assessed for wealth tax but because a trust is not a natural person then there would be no tax-free threshold. If a capital gains tax is to be applied then again, how and on what assets? If losses in an asset class can be written off either against gains in that asset class or against the taxpayer’s total assessable income, then a CGT may not produce a lot of tax (but would increase a lot of Inland Revenue time and cost); therefore doing nothing to address inequality. If there is to be a brightline test (as for investment property) then some people will hold an asset for longer than logical simply to avoid the tax. Extra taxes raised can be used for increased funding for essential Government spending (such as climate change and sustainability). However, to tax people’s productive asset income base may have the perverse effect of not reducing Government expenditure since some may cancel their health insurances, and reduce donations to charities – thus increasing the demand on Government spending. It is obvious that to reduce inequality in society then either the rich must pay more in tax or the poor receive more income by way of either tax reduction or increased benefits. An alternative solution would be to reduce GST since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income than the rich. Another area of inequality that should be addressed is when only one partner in a family situation is working, that person may be paying tax at the marginal rate of 33% whilst the other partner is paying no tax at all, whereas if the income was split between the partners a considerable tax reduction may occur. There are many reasons why only one partner in a family may be working. Reducing GST on some selected items is complicated and again would increase the compliance costs. I think it is much better to leave the system as it is although consideration should be given to GST not being applied to local body rates, since it amounts to a tax on a tax. J.M. Dickson \[1\] 12 From:Dave Read Sent: Wednesday, 25 April 2018 8:02 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group 2018: Dear members of the working group, Our current lack of capital tax has been hugely distortionary in our economy: we have very large houses by developed world standards; we have 70% of our total capital invested in domestic accommodation \[the western norm is 50%\]. This means we seriously lack investment in infrastructure & productive financial assets. Having houses as our national investment of choice has been fuelled by the favourable tax status of this investment. We continue to build more large expensive houses that the majority will never afford, thus eroding our social cohesiveness and removing some of our most fertile land from productive use: meanwhile large numbers of homes \[especially holiday homes\] remain unoccupied for long periods of time. We should have a universal annual capital tax such as expounded by Thomas Piketty. This should include the family home & the land under it as well as all other capital items \[Farms, commercial building s, plant & equipment etc.\] For productive assets the owner would only pay that portion of the capital tax on these assets that was greater than the income tax generated by the profit earned by these assets \[ie the capital tax would only operate on assets generating low or no profit\] A universal annual capital tax would: Be efficient: It would discourage investment in \[largely\] unproductive housing and favour productive investments that promoted greater employment. It would promote the transfer of productive assets \[such as farmland and factories\] from poor management to good management. It would place investment in labour on an equal footing with investment in labour saving capital equipment \[at present labour costs include PAYE (even though technically it is paid by the employee)\], but depreciation and R&M on capital plant is totally tax deductible\] So our present tax system is financially incentivising reduced employment by firms. Be fair: All investments would be treated the same; at present we pay RWT on interest earned by bank deposits, but nothing on capital gains, so anyone below the level of wealth needed to raise a deposit to buy a home is heavily penalized. It would also promote vertical equity as rich people \[in general\] live in more expensive houses. Have fiscal Integrity: By being Universal it would minimise avoidance. Assets are hard to hide and it would enable us to generate tax from foreign companies diverting profits off shore and so showing artificially low incomes in NZ. Have fiscal adequacy: It would be a new income stream for Government, allowing lowered tax rates for low income people, thus ensuring their ability to pay and maintaining fiscal neutrality for lower income people. Have low compliance costs as property is already valued for local body rates and plant and equipment is enumerated in depreciation schedules. I am happy to discuss this, but I work away from my land line in an area with no cell coverage: you are best to contact me by e-mail with a range of times that would be suitable for me to phone you \[ afternoons are better for me\] Regards, Dave Read \[1\] 13 \[1\] 14 From: Sent:Wednesday, 25 April 2018 4:42 PM To: TWG Submissions Cc: Subject:Submission/Discouraged letter To whom it may concern, I am a fourth year university student studying economics and I believe that the government needs to think more seriously about the tax it imposes on the middle class income tax bracket. I completely agree there needs to be a transfer system to redistribute income to help those who are in such circumstances whereby they are unable to fend for themselves, along with being happy to pay more tax as my income increases as the ones who use the government funded infrastructure the most is the people who earn the most. However it is absolutely ridiculous the amount of tax that we pay that is redistributed to absolute morons who are quite happy living their lifestyle on the dole - playing XBOX all day while they drink a box, smoking a pack of darts or an ounce weed (you cannot tell me this doesn’t happen, as being a student with middle income parents, I need a job to help pay to put myself through university due to the ridiculous student allowance system and work at a bottle store in a lower socioeconomic end of town, hence I see this extremely regularly - which obviously really frustrates me). I disagree with the amount of extra tax the middle income tax bracket pay. It is a commonly known fact among anyone with half a brain that these are the people paying marginally the most amount of tax as anyone who earns above this and are super wealthy, pay a minimal amount of tax due to the fact they are able to pay accountants to achieve this for them. Now I understand that this is a fact of life, maybe one day I’ll be wealthy enough to have those benefits myself, but I do not agree with the taxes proposed to property in which is not the property owners main home to reside. In my opinion there does need to be a capital gains tax on those property developers flipping property all the time, but this needs to be administered separately to the average middle class homeowner paying more than their fair share of tax and working their arse off to get a nice humble holiday home/batch for their family. The more you tax this income group, the more it reduces the incentive for them to work this hard and provide benefits to the economy - pushing them to be discouraged and end up a lazy useless moron on the dole bludging off what they would have been if they did not have these disincentives. Personably, I believe you need to readdress this situation as it is not hard to earn money and look after yourself, people just need to experience some tough love and have their handouts reduced, giving them more incentive to go out and look for a job. Currently have just under $100,000 in my bank account while still studying due to my parents raising me with a work ethic and having goals I wish to achieve - now just to be extremely clear, I did write this email for self satisfaction on this point, but to prove that it is absolutely ridiculous what some people claim they deserve from ‘rich people, who only have their money work for them’. I have worked months straight without a day off to get where I am, while still being a student and I know this is an extreme case, but it is most definitely not required to get oneself into a stable financial position. On to my next point about Student Allowances - I thought I may as well add this topic in as I will not write another email as it is highly unlikely anyone will even look at this one - but the scheme by which an allowance is awarded is absolutely ridiculous. The threshold is completely unreasonable for two working parents. Having the threshold set at its current position, for a large proportion limits its access to those whose parents have not made a proper effort at \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 15 life and contributing to society or those who have very wealthy parents that own their own company and run it at a loss while their children attend university. I do not doubt that there is exceptions to my previous statement, but what is the difference between someone like myself who has to work during their university career and someone who gets an allowance? Absolutely nothing apart from the fact they get approximately $270 free from the Government every week whereas I get $220 a week I have to pay back along with the fact this puts me at a disadvantage when I want to apply for a job as it can also affect my grades having the extra stress of working and studying. Now I do not begrudge having to pay for my university education - I believe everyone should be exposed to some debt as it provides incentives to achieve to high levels of success - but I do begrudge those who get free money because of their parents supposed financial situation, whereas the average child of middle income parents has their student loan doubled over the course of their degree because their parents have supposedly earned too much in their life and are expected to help their children (when they are often not in the financial position to do so if they want to enjoy the little extra they made by working hard). This again goes back to my prominent point of creating disincentives for many people to work harder and achieve more. If you have made it this far through my disgruntled email, I greatly appreciate you reading it - although I don’t expect a genuine reply - if ol’ mate David (my local MP) has a return comment on his Governments behalf I would gladly accept it, or even better, like to discuss this with him in person as I also have another job in retail and believe this is a very common opinion among the community.

My submission is as follows:  That the Tax Working Group extends the remit of its recommendations to Cabinet to examine New Zealand’s role and responsibility to fix the global tax system. The Paradise and Panama Papers demonstrated that the lack of tax transparency is a global problem that needs a global solution. New Zealand is implicated in the global problem and has a part to play in finding a solution.  Developing countries are missing out on $150 billion each year due to multinational tax avoidance. This tax avoidance deprives governments around the world (including NZ) the money they need to tackle poverty and inequality. This money could go a long way towards funding critical infrastructure including healthcare and education.  Governments must act together to force this system to end. New Zealand must stand in solidarity with developing countries and call for a new generation of global tax reforms. This will be most easily done through a new UN-based global tax body.  A UN Tax body will ensure all countries participate on an equal footing and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax.

It seems, this government and your committee as hell bent on changing all the rules and what for, to slam the people that work the 24/7 days of the year regardless if one is in business and or a rental property. Yes, I have both and work 24/7 days of the year to cover all aspects associated with a business and property, and if tax changes are significant that I can't cover the costs associated for them, we will shut the doors, So who then is going to supply the rental houses/business's needed to provide the homes/jobs needed to pay the rents/taxes to the government will be the big question? If there is no incentive for a rental property and likewise a business to work, well then where is the point to have either. So why slam the people that keep this country working and making the much needed money for your government so you can distribute to the ones that take if all for granted as owed!!! Its despicable that this current government will take our Road user taxes and spend it on light rail for Auckland!!! our roads are congested here in Hamilton as well, and not sure this government will get away with this either. Its backward thinking to close oil exploration in NZ - and eventually giving up 2 billion in tax revenue. Currently the Australian government can't wait for the oil/barrel price to rise just one dollar to know that their government will receive millions extra in revenue for it to spend, so why have we done these changes here, as in 30 years time technology will be so advanced and oil at that point will be either redundant or even more efficient or something else will come along to replace oil. So I would have exploited oil for as long as we could. So enjoy the committee work as I feel this government will be only a one term government a s even with so called populace policy, people are not stupid and will vote with their feet, and just as we remember the Anzacs on with fine day here in Hamilton, the Labour government was not the preferred government of the day last election time.

I have been working for the minimum wage all my life , Im 48 yrs old. I have 4 properties all worth less than 350K. After all normal costs I have just $400mth left over for repairs and maintenance. Tenants are getting more and more fussy about standards of homes so there is always something needing done. All my tenants live in houses way better than my first home ever was. I have had rental houses for about 6 years and find myself spending what should have been holiday money on the houses. I have been averaging 10k of my own money on updates and repairs, I quite often ask myself why Im bothering. But am trying to make my retirement better and something to leave the kids. Claiming expenses against income is not exactly a money spinner, if I spend 10k I may get 3K back if I'm lucky. Owning rentals is not fast money and border line if its worth all the hassles, and all the new rules is just making it harder. You spend 3k putting a heat-pump in and the tenant complains the power is to expensive So I will get to a point that I will just sell them all and hope that Superannuation will keep me alive. I only have houses with the hope they will generate enough income to help in my retirement. If you own a rental for more than 5 years you are not a speculator you are an investor! Don't treat us like a speculator we are in for the long hall, we really only make money in the last few years of having the rental, we dont buy and sell a year later! Thank you. \[1\] 19 From:Grant McLachlan Sent: Wednesday, 25 April 2018 11:36 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission On 20 December 2017, I wrote a column published in the New Zealand Herald highlighting a problem with how late payments of ACC weekly compensation are taxed. I then wrote to several ministers, including the Minister of Revenue, who recommended that I make a submission to the Tax Working Group. My column makes all the relevant points and I include it with this submission. In short, the government unduly enriches itself from the slow processing of claims by another statutory body. Claimants who have endured a prolonged process to get their ACC claims approved must next seek damages from ACC to recover the difference between what they would have otherwise received if late payments were made on time. A large proportion of these damages sought are the higher taxes imposed on late payments. Here is my column in full: If the new Government is so concerned about the most vulnerable members of our society it should start by making sure the incapacitated are not taxed at the highest rate. During the nine years under National, ACC went from being broke to being bigger than the NZ Superannuation Fund. To save money, ACC put many injured through a protracted claims process in which, after years of obfuscation, the late payments of loss of earnings compensation are paid in one settlement, often taxed at a "special" flat rate of 33 cents in the dollar. If ACC paid weekly loss of earnings compensation on time, claimants would have incurred a much lower marginal tax rate. Effectively, the IRD benefits from ACC's slowness to approve claims. ACC can also deduct a higher amount in levies from settlements. It is insulting to the thousands of incapacitated claimants fighting ACC over years, even decades, that their settlements are taxed no differently to a person receiving a holiday bonus. It is no holiday. During the delays to approve cover, many people were forced to sell their homes and other assets when their ACC compensation would have covered their mortgage payments. Instead of receiving 80 per cent of their pre-injury weekly income as ACC weekly compensation, they lived off sickness benefits, which equates to one third of the minimum wage. To rub salt in the wounds, soaring house prices has meant that many of those who receive late payments can no longer afford to buy a home that was affordable at the time of their injury. Many people who have been struggling on the sickness benefit for years while ACC processed claims are owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in late payments plus interest. If ACC paid on time, the total tax deducted would have been a fraction of what is deducted on late payments. Take for example, someone on a $60,000 salary who was injured around the time then-ACC Minister Nick Smith started to introduce "cost-saving" measures. If ACC paid weekly compensation on time, only $70,000 in marginal tax would be paid over the whole period. Instead, a flat rate of 33 per cent would deduct over $190,000 from a late payment. In addition, the Ministry of Social Development deducts all benefits paid over that period. Many people forced to rent or move to be closer to medical care have their accommodation supplements and disability allowances deducted from their late payment. \[1\] 20 ACC and the IRD have effectively created a new class of poverty. Incapacitated are vulnerable as they have limited ability to work while they are in limbo. ACC, on the other hand, has created a new class of largesse. At one stage, it was so plush with cash, it didn't have the staff to figure out where to invest it. It now has almost 1000 employees earning over $100,000 a year. Any ACC lawyer will tell you that the IRD and ACC have been lazy to do anything to fix this cynical situation. Apparently, all that is required is a small amendment to the tax code, allowing a special tax category where tax is deducted at a rate no different to if ACC weekly compensation was paid on time. Tax could be deducted based on when it was owed rather than when it is paid. Any tweak could be pushed through by Parliament before Christmas under urgency. It could also apply to retrospective settlements. ACC clients aren't asking for a holiday bonus. They are just asking for what was owed to them if ACC didn't take so long to process their claims. A simple solution to this unnecessary situation for thousands of claimants is if ACC late payments were taxed based on the year that they should have been paid rather than when they are actually paid. Any changes to the tax code/law should apply retrospectively as ACC simply approved claims and paid out late payments before claimants had any chance to accept or dispute them. There was no ‘take it or leave it’ approach. Rather, it was ‘take it and then dispute it.’ For many, the ‘dispute it’ has taken months, if not years. I expect many others to make submissions on this topic. I also expect the working group to recommend cleaning up this inequitable mess. The alternative is potentially a prolonged class action by many agrieved claimants against ACC. If ACC lodge a submission, I request that I be sent a copy. If the working group requires any further explanation from me, I will make myself available to speak to this submission. Regards, Grant McL. McLachlan This message is private and confidential.

The current proportional tax system allowes most people to have a reasonable standard of living in our great country,the tax return to Government enables it to maintain the infrastructure and services that we all use. As a retired public servant I believe that the same proportional tiered structure should have been used when the Government reduced all our annuities by 30% for all those who retired after the year 2000 . The flat 30% reduction might have been considered, to have been reasonable, at the time , but with the tax reductions that have occured since the year 2000, it is long overdue for a review of the 30% reduction of our annuites. When accepting the 30% reduction for a tax free annuity for the future, our people were led to believe that this reduction would be reviewed if changes to the tax system occurred, and when the Prime Minister John Key altered the tax system ,he said "it should be a fair tax for all". I ask the Tax Working Group to investigate the cost of reducing the 30% reduction factor, for all the lower quartile superannuants, who retired after the year 2000 to 17.5%. . My estimate is that the number of annuants in the lower quartile would not cause a major fiscal problem for the Government, but would restore some fairness to the lower paid superannuats who are unfairly over tax on the superannuation they have paid for. I respectfully request the Tax working group to make a strong case to Government on our behalf to rectify what has been an unfair treatment of all those loyal public servants who worked for low salaries , paid for their super and now in their last years they are denied their full super by the unfair tax reduction system -- Kind Regards Gavin Stuart \[1\] From:Barbara Smith Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 7:06 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: my concerns about tax are in agreement with Kathleen Gallagher \[1\] Tax Recommendations to Tax Working Group - April 2018 - Kathleen Gallagher 27 yours sincerely Barbara Sith Barbara Smith \[1\] \[ \[1\] \[1\]\[1\] Tax Recommendations to Tax Working Group - April 2018 - Kathleen Gallagher 28 From:Gary Judd Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 6:58 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Group Of the five questions, the one I want to address is "What is the purpose of tax?" The purpose of tax cannot be divorced from the purpose of government. That is the fundamental issue which should be addressed by the Group, before its members get to anything else. We aspire to and generally have an open system of government. Its primary purpose is or should be to enable individual people to think for themselves and to act in accordance with the judgements they make. This requires a government subjected to the rule of law, and objective laws administered impartially and disinterestedly, supported by an effective police force, an independent judiciary and the appropriate institutional infrastructure to deal with those who are judged to have used force, fraud and other forms of trickery to prevent people acting in accordance with what they would otherwise choose to do. The primary purpose of tax should be to support those governmental functions. When tax is used for other purposes the risk is run that it will prevent individual people thinking for themselves and acting in accordance with their own individual judgements. The Group should keep that firmly in mind when addressing the purpose of tax, the other questions which have been posed and generally its approach to its terms of reference.

To me there are two significant opportunities to collect significant revenue by applying the principles of equity (equality of treatment – fair and impartial) and common sense. In terms of equity:  I understand some overseas based corporations do not pay what many would consider a fair share of taxes based on revenue generated in New Zealand. They hide behind “costs” such as extraordinary interest charges and intellectual property from their overseas parent companies.  I understand there are some major ineq uities within New Zealand based companies, specifically some Maori organisations do not pay tax; and some Maori businesses pay tax at a lesser rate than other non-Maori enterprises. I believe in affirmative action, but using differential taxes is grossly unfair to competing businesses. There are other social instruments to provide affirmative action. The tens of millions of extra tax generated with an equitable tax system could be applied to these social instruments (e.g. better housing, access to health...) In terms of common sense: I understand some corporations do not pay tax because of their charitable status (e.g. Sanitarium Health Foods; Ngai Tahu Charitable Trust income generating businesses). It appears as if it does not matter what proportion of income is actually spent on charitable causes. It would make far more sense if only the charitable donation itself was tax deductible as is the case for individuals. Thank you for your consideration. Yours sincerely, Henry Hudson \[1\] \[1\] 31 From:Bill Mackay Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 6:30 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: NZ TAXATION ...... submission by William Angus Mackay Submission to Tax Working Group (GROUP) regarding taxation in New Zealand >>>> ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The following are details of my personal opinions regarding taxation in New Zealand, and may be of interest to Group members. My submission is targeted in accordance with the stated questions raised by the Group. The most important principle is that every legal entity pays in accordance with their ability to do so. The 'fairness' of a tax system is that every legal entity must contribute. A legal entity is any natural person, corporate body, society, club, co-operative or any that can sue and be sued, for which an identity is required. The current taxation system is based principally on INCOME tax, which is a very slow, inefficient and illogical method, which creates serious problems for taxpayers when money is demanded by government (IRD) but they have no money available. The result can be and is suicide because the taxpayer cannot handle that situation. (I personally knew four people who killed themselves for that reason) There are two matters interrelated regarding MONEY. One is the receipt of monies (INCOME) and the other is EXPENDITURE (SPENDING). As it is well known that money is ONLY useful when it is SPENT, an analysis of EXPENDITURE is the \[1\] 32 same as an analysis of INCOME. If you do not have it you cannot spend it ! The current taxation system includes the Goods and Services Tax (GST) in relation to purchases of any product and/or services, but is targeted to individual taxpayers not corporate bodies. The current tax rate for GST is 15% added to the agreed value of a transaction between a buyer and corporate seller. The buyer pays the GST and the corporate seller remits the value collected to IRD. The corporate seller may deduct INPUTS of any GST they pay for goods/services received, from any OUTPUT value. The balance is remitted to IRD. The separation of individuals from corporate bodies in relation to GST, is considered (rightly) to be UNFAIR as it permits so many goods of similar nature to avoid GST. An example is the corporate business of Motels and Hotels. The management/owners of a motel are very unlikely to pay personal GST for a considerable number of goods used within the business, including foodstuffs, domestic appliances of great variety, domestic cleaning polishing and similar items, cutlery, crockery etc which the individual taxpayer cannot avoid. The Government (IRD) efforts to close such tax gaps are useless and horrendously expensive. For taxpayers to meet the above desires of government, it is NECESSARY to change the taxation system to a single tax based on EXPENDITURE ie: the current INCOME tax method must be terminated. No income tax would then be due from dividends, interest, or capital gains or any legitimate activity. It is not in the province of government to know the external sources of income of any person, provided the source is otherwise legal .... NZ Police are empowered to handle that situation. The current GST system is already partly in place to allow government revenue to flow electronically to IRD as every adult and corporate body has an account with IRD. The separation of corporates from individuals regarding GST should end. The corporates will pay no income tax and neither will individuals. The argument that businesses would have increased costs has validity, but that is a cost they can set against the saving of the income tax removal and considerable reduction in their accounting costs for INCOME TAX. Even small businesses currently spend high dollar amounts for accountancy, not to meet their OWN needs but solely to meet the requirements of IRD. EVERY legal entity in New Zealand should pay GST as a SINGLE revenue gathering system. The buyer is the taxpayer while the seller is the tax collector. The seller pays the GST RECEIVED to IRD within 15 working days. To MEASURE the state of the economy and avoid any arguments, both government and local government purchases of any nature should also be subject to GST. That may sound like moving money in and out of the same wallet, but it would cost much less than having separate bureaucracy ..... which would defeat the object of tax efficiency. It is important to remove bureaucracy where possible, to free up enterprise. The value of the GST rate would require to be established by Parliament, and it is my belief that government should function entirely with the money value so established. IF the economy slows or booms, the people and government will know about that within a few days rather than the present extended time to understanding. A weekly notice in national newspapers of GST collected would assist in keeping the public informed. The value will be directly related to the OUTPUT of the total economy. 33 A seller can be an individual or corporate body (legal entity) selling any product new or used, or any service FOR A PRICE. The target is the broadest possible tax base. The payment to IRD of GST collected by any seller within 15 days is not onerous and requires very little action on the part of the seller ..... no different from paying via the EFTPOS system. Millions of such transactions occur daily in this country, and the GST value can be easily transferred to the IRD account of the seller where it will be utilised by government. IMPORTS of goods can be valued and GST adjusted by NZ Customs as is presently done, with Customs deemed to be the seller, and therefore the collector of the GST. In my opinion this single GST method meets the stated aims of the GROUP in respect to taxpayer costs of compliance, and also government costs of administration. THERE IS NO SIMPLER METHOD AVAILABLE TO GOVERNMENT. An add-on benefit could be the potential identification of payments made to IRD in respect to geographical location in the country .... ie: to local government areas. That could be used to remove the hated RATES system where communities currently have no control over the monies demanded by councils. It would be necessary for central government to provide guarantees to Banks in respect to loans to councils. The only reason the RATES property valuation system came into being was to meet the requirements of Banks to cover the loans they made to Councils. Councils would no longer require to send out RATES demands and have a drip feed income in consequence, or any need to know valuations of any sort. Central government would have full control of Revenue and could adjust the percentage of Revenue allocated to an area council at any time if deemed necessary to support special infrastructure expenditures for example, although it would be best to avoid that situation. GROUP has asked if a LAND tax should be considered. LAND tax was abolished by an earlier government as being unfair to non Maori persons and businesses. Should NOT be considered in any way. GROUP also asked if a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) should be considered. Abolition of INCOME TAX settles that question. GROUP asked if SOME goods and services should be exempt from GST. Not at all as that would be akin to the thin edge of a wedge to make the mistakes applicable in Australia, for example. GROUP asked if there is a case to change the tax system to make housing more affordable for SOME people. No! To initiate such a tax variation would require knowledge of individual private INCOME, and that should not be possible or sensible without free agreement of the person involved. The existence of multiple adult occupants in the same dwelling raises many problems. An individual in need of community support is best supported by DIRECT monetary allowances until they are able to function without. When dwelling BUILDERS are set free by removal of government impediments such as capital gains tax and associated restrictions related to INCOME tax, there will be an explosion of construction and resulting availability with sensible pricing in a free market. It is also necessary for GOVERNMENT to ensure the rules and regulations imposed by local authorities regarding building constructions, meet with the stated intent of Government to increase housing availability in the nation. Rescinding INCOME tax will remove one of the reasons "CASH" deals are so common in NZ. I recommend that the GROUP ask Treasury to study and report on probable revenue from a SINGLE GST 34 TAX SYSTEM in NZ as outlined, basing on firstly 15% rate, secondly on 10% rate and also at 8% on ALL buying/selling transactions by ALL legal entities. Sincerely William Angus Mackay \[1\] 35 From:Alan Pollock Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 4:17 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission SUBMISSION TO THE TAX WORKING GROUP SUBMITTION FROM: Alan Pollock SUBMISSION 1: Given the wide scope of the Working Groups mandate, I ask that consideration be given to legislating that the thresholds for individuals tax brackets be adjusted annually by the rate of inflation, rather than at the whim of the Government, thereby avoiding the increase of taxes by stealth. Background and Comment: At present, tax brackets are only changed as part of the Government’s annual budget and in practice, this occurs infrequently. The effect of this is to increase the real ra te of tax every year until adjustments are eventually made, allowing the Government to make political capital by labelling them as “Tax Cuts”. Stability and consistency is an important ingredient in a progressive tax system, and political window dressing should not be allowed to impinge on this. Inflation will always be with us and although it is currently at a relatively low level this will not always be so. Even so, an increase of 2% pa (say 20% over ten years) without a corresponding adjustment distorts the incomes of the lowest paid and has a significant cumulative effect. The last National Government proposed adjustments to tax brackets and called them Tax Cuts, and when the new Labour-led Government reversed these, it was able to present this as sim ply preserving the status quo, when in fact it was imposing another Tax Increase. Tax policy should be transparent, and politicians should be denied the opportunity to increase taxes by stealth. SUBMISSION 2: Businesses owned and operated by registered charities should not be exempt from tax but should be stand- alone entities and required to pay the same taxes as their competitors. Donations by the business to the registered charity should be deductible, but not their retained profits. Background and comment: Allowing charities to be tax- free is consistent with the policy of allowing donations to charities to be tax deductible and is a desirable social objective. However, when a business owned by a charity is tax exempt it has an unfair commercial advantage over privately owned businesses. Allowing retained earnings to be tax deductible encourages such enterprises to “build their wealth” rather than expend their funds on genuine charitable ends. Separating the entities that have th e objectives of creating wealth from those administrating the charitable distribution of that wealth allows each to focus on their respective objectives and preserves fairness in commercial business. I wish to be heard in support of these submissions \[1\] \[1\] 36 From:neil parker Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 3:28 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax submission Dear Sirs/Mesdames, I would like to comment on asset based taxes ( wealth taxes, land taxes, capital gains taxes, means tested benefits etc). People are encouraged to provide for themselves including meeting their retirement costs. They do this by accumulating capital. They have paid taxes on their earnings from personal exertion , part of which ( through the act of saving ) become their capital which they proceed to invest in a variety of ways. To then proceed to tax this capital effectively penalises these people- they were taxed when they earned the money which became savings. Why do they need to be taxed again on these accumulated funds? It certainly doesn’t encourage a savings/accumulation mindset. Conversely state- funded pensions encourage complacency regarding providing for oneself. Having the government funding retirement costs is unlikely to be as efficient as having the individual take responsibility for this directly due to the large administrative costs incurred in government redistribution exercises. Therefore it would make sense to tax consumption rather than capital if we desire people to take responsibility for their own financial needs throughout their whole life. I believe history demonstrates that encouraging personal responsibility in all matters will produce a more effective, efficient and productive society than approaches which promote abdication of responsibility. Regards, Neil Parker, \[1\] \[1\] 37 From: Sent:Tuesday, 24 April 2018 2:17 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: CGT / land tax Regarding the proposed CGT or land tax laws, I would like to point out the following: Home businesses: First of all, this proposed tax is sexist and ageist as those trying to start or run a home business are mainly women or older people, some supplementing a pension. An extra tax for these people, who aren't doing a big business, would be crippling and the result for many would be that the home business would just cease to exist. Then, or course, there is no tax to be had for anyone, given that tax is only paid when the home business is up and running... I also agree that the more people we have on our roads going to work, especially in Auckland, will add to traffic problems. Extra tax for those finding themselves living near conveniences :Taxing people with landtax /CGT when they live near eg the train station,a park, convenient supermarket etc wouldn't be fair on many as there are development projects going ahead all the time and people can't predict what will be in the area where they bought their home in say 10 years time. In Auckland, too, I imagine if you could manage to purchase a home there you'd have to take what you can get to some extent unless you could afford the higher price brackets. An extra land tax as well as the usual rates will put owning a home even more out of reach for many in places like Auckland. Land tax / CGT on rental properties: I think there needs to be a distinction here between people who may have one or two rental properties, such as older people who have decided to put their retirement savings there, and land developers / landlords with many rental properti es / people who want to flip a property for more than they paid for it a day later, for example. If land developers and the like haven't paid enough tax this should not be passed on to others - the land developers should pay. Land tax / CGT would be ageist for starters given the amount of older people who have scrimped and saved to get a nest egg going for retirement and have one or two properties later in life. Can you have a cut off point e.g. land tax / CGT kicks in on a persons's 3rd or fourth property and on each subsequent property owned here after? Perhaps you could have the 3rd property with a minimal tax, and increase it gradually per property when more properties are owned, then you really would be asking the people with the most properties to pay more. People such as those who rent in Auckland, and have been forced to buy a property elsewhere in order to be able to have a home of their own would also be unfairly treated if they had to pay extra land tax. I am one such person. I rent in Auckland (rents are high) and pay my mortgage for my house in Waihi. I have tenants in my house in Waihi as I cannot afford to pay rent in Auckland and a mortgage at the same time. I want my own home and Auckland is out of my reach, so I bought a place where houses are cheaper and where I can see myself living once I don't need to work in Auckland anymore. My parents live in Waihi. Already my one house is classed as a rental property, and because I couldn't live in it for 6 months (too far to commute to Auckland) I missed out on the first home buyer aid as well. Kiwisaver would not let me access it for my first home because I could not live in it. I repeat I cannot afford a home in Auckland to buy for me to live in now and then sell when I move out of Auckland. How is this state of affairs fair on people who need to be in Auckland for work but who also want to live in their own home one day? Am I to pay extra land tax now as well? I would argue extra land tax would put owning a home even more out of reach for people such as Aucklanders in my situation who are not on large incomes. Incidentally, can something be done so that people like me can have 1st home buyer privileges and access kiwisaver? This would help people tremendously to be able to buy a first home when they can't live in it straight away due to having to work and live in our expensive city of Auckland. I hope you will consider these points.

The penalty for not paying is no deterrent to the trade’s person who it would seem takes more in cash than by invoice. Solution. All trades persons and small business operators should be required to produce a certificate from an accountant to say all cash has been accounted for through the bank account and that GST and income tax have been paid on all income. They should be required to list any private assets purchased through the year. For example boats and cars new tooling and machinery. Major property alterations and improvements. Any property purchase IE sections or bach. The items should equate to cash flow and tax paid income for the previous 2 years Anyone found to fail these requirements should forfeit and purchases found to have been made and not declared. They should also then be charged with tax evasion. The loss of tax income to the rest of the country is estimated to be 2.1 Billion dollars from cash sale income where no GST or income tax is paid. For all the millions of dollars spent by the Inland Revenue in upgrading the tax tracing system it would seem very little additional tax has been recovered. We need to see the benefits of all the spent dollars in increased tax recovery. \[1\] 40 From:Denise Sadlier Sent: Tuesday, 24 April 2018 11:56 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Good morning I believe there should be a major change in the welfare system to include annual tax incentives/credits to encourage people to get out and work, look after themselves and others, especially those who are vulnerable and dependent on the state, reliant on benefits and working for family tax credits. An example of tax credits would be - 1. Superannuitants who own a mortgage free home - tax credit 2. Annual full medical check - tax credit if no health problems, reducing tax credit for health issue requirements 3. Annual dental checks for everyone with their own teeth - tax credit, again would be reduced for serious dental problems. This would include superannuatants, children i.e. parents of underage children would receive the tax credit. 4. Stay at home Mums of two parent families in a legally recognized relationship - tax credit 5. Parents of children who have attained an education qualification e.g. NZCA or equivalent and upwards would receive a tax credit for each child’s achievement. 6. Health insurance paid individually and NOT through or from a business - tax credit 7. Child vaccinations complete - tax credit 8. Tertiary students receive a tax credit if working while studying. 9. People working in a voluntary capacity for 12 months or more in health i.e. hospice, St. John’s etc, or any other designated organization - tax credit. 10. Kiwisavers - tax credit This would require an increase of income tax applied of 1, 2 & 3% to the three main tax rates. All of these tax credits would be directed and processed through Inland Revenue. Yes there would be a substantial cost but there is one now with the amounts paid out by the state in welfare payments into the third and fourth generations unemployed. You could start with health and progress to education. If processed effectively the cost would be transferred from WINZ to IRD. With more people working towards achieving a more fulfilled life through health, education and working the outcome would surely be more jobs, better health, people interested in their own welfare which would inevitably benefit all citizens. I believe this would be the start to encouraging the population to help themselves and look after others. Overall the idea of people getting a tax credit from the main aspects of their life from children, working, through to retirement would be far more incentivizing than our current regime.

It does not mean those whose opinions are deemed more worthy, or who have more influence. Inequality in NZ, as it is in the world, is rampant. The only reason poverty exists is to fuel the whims of m/billionaires. The super-rich are unnecessary, and indeed a parasitic drain on the wellbeing of NZ's society, economy, environment and media. The Tax Working Group must be bold in closing the loopholes and dismantling the structure that encourages such a culture where the most selfish and greedy are rewarded with disproportionate wealth and power; and the most helpful, necessary, useful and productive citizens have the least. I propose the following to be seriously considered in the TWG: • A financial transaction tax (at about 0.01%) replacing GST. Beginning with the removal of GST on healthy foods such as fresh fruit and veges. • A wealth-tax, beginning in the form of a capital gains tax. • An inheritance tax, at least over a certain threshold. • A higher top-tax rate over a certain threshold, leading to over 100% on very high incomes. • Reinvestment of the above tax-take into public services that benefit all (health, education, environment, transport, infrastructure). • Stronger taxes on socially destructive practises and products such as pollution (industrial, dairy, air, waterway), plastic bags and packaging. • Higher taxes on advertising revenue with the take reinvested into better public broadcasting. Also taxes on outdoor advertising that can be seen from public areas such as billboards, bus ads, bus-stop screens, shop fronts (e.g. visual pollution). My proposals tax non-productive behaviour; property speculation, currency- trading and advertising produce nothing yet extract value from the economy for the benefit of an unproductive few.

It makes it difficult for people bringing overseas super into the country. For example someone from England whose UK super would be tax free because it sits under the tax free threshold there ends up being taxed on a small amount here. Alternately we have the high wealth paying the same tax rates as some earning over $70K, the Australian system below is a good example of this system. Australian Tax Rates for an individual NZL Tax Rates for an individual \[1\] 47 When I looked into this I took an average wage of $60,000.00 under the above scenario (AUS), the tax to pay would be $11,047.00, under our current system (NZL) it is $11,020.00 – so very little difference in tax to pay but it affectively means that someone on a lower income (our most vulnerable) has more money in their hand, and the middle income earner is not paying any more tax than they normally would, while the most wealthy are broaching the gap left by the tax free threshold.

During this time I have become very aware of the differences between our tax system and the UK's and the distorting effects some of the taxes that the current NZ government is looking at implementing in NZ. most of which I view as a retrograde step. 1) Inheritance tax or Death Duty. This is unfair as tax has been paid on this money at the point it was earned therefore if taxed again it is double tax the UK rate is 40% over 325000 pounds sterling. 2) Stamp Duty on the purchase of property and a penalty extra 3% Stamp Duty on second properties has distorted the house rental market to the extent that rentals in the private sector are now hard to find an d rents have risen to an unafordable extent driving renters to council housing (NZ State housing) creating a major shortage and increasing homelessness not to mention huge costs on central and local government. Another effect of Stamp Duty is that people find it cheaper to make an addition to their existing home rather than selling and buying a bigger home and this has resulted in a shortage of smaller homes in the major cities in the UK. and as families grow and shift out of the family home they now have a lot of "empty nesters" living in 4 and 5 bedroom houses which they can't afford to sell as they lose to much capital to Stamp Duty to afford a smaller home and add something to their savings for retirement. Therefore I recommend that we as country do not reintroduce Stamp Duty. 3) Capital Gains Tax or as it should be called Inflation Tax. This tax is a blunt instrument that penalises people who invest long term to provide for their retirement it also locks investments into a geographical location eg, If an investment property is owned for 4 years in location A. ( and made a capital gain of say $150000.00) and then the owner shifts to location B and also wants to sell their investment property at location A and to buy another investment property for the same price as he sold the previous one for in location B they will be short of what ever the CGT is on the $150000.00 and in the UK CGT is 30% or $45000.00 As for CGT on share price values again this is a tax on the long term inflation so is also unfair. 4)I suggest that any tax increases are counter productive as any tax will slow the economy as monies are removed from the consumer and productive sectors and put into the government sector which is a cost centre to the economy not a profit contributing centre. Increasing the company tax rate is seen as a popular measure but this runs the risk of pushing NZ companies to move to a lower tax country. I also hear the call to tax the" rich fat cats" and again this runs the very real risk of reducing the tax take as these high worth individuals have the means to find ways around higher tax rates or just shift their tax residency offshore causing reduced tax take. I suggest that Government learn ways of doing more with less otherwise known as increased productivity much like the farmers did when subsidies were removed in the 1980s. It has been reported that tax take increases when there is a reduction in tax rates as people find it cheaper to pay the tax then paying lawyers and accountants to avoid the tax. I hope that tax reductions is on the table rather than increases only. \[1\] 52 While not entirely a tax issue it has a large impact on the government tax income and that is with the state of the health system. I suggest that you already have a working template in place with ACC. This could be replicated as the National Health Corporation taking a premium from all income ( while reducing income tax by a similar amount) at a flat rate via the IRD and the NHC could fund operations, health care,and all the requirements of NZ by sourcing the best most cost effective providers as does ACC whether it is public or private hospitals. This also takes health out of the political arena to some extent and provides it with a secure income base untouchable for non health issues. Just before you dismiss my submission as sour grapes from a high worth individual I can tell you that my Wife and I are just middle class middle income Kiwis who believe that all people should be able earn enough to support themselves and their families without government handouts like "Working For Families" which is merely supporting a low wage economy.

We have worked incredibly hard to get to where we are now - studied hard, paid off student loans, work long hours - so I am extremely against increases to income taxes to those who earn more than an average wage. We have slowly worked our way up the ranks to be where we are today and, if this was once again introduced, we would be struggling as a significant portion of our monthly pay would again be gone. If you earn more then you also pay more in tax anyway so why penalise those who have been determined to try and get ahead through hard work and determination. I believe that income tax should be a flat rate no matter how much you earn - this would be 100% fair as those who earn more will be paying more in income tax anyway. I realise that this is not necessarily being discussed currently however I do worry that this will be on the cards in the future. As a result we would again be struggling.

Since GST was introduced, I and thousand of others have been working for the IRD to collect the taxes. Not once have I or any other GST collector been paid. The parliamentarians who pontificate of fairness and equality all get paid for their pontifications. The Tax working group members get paid for reading submissions. The good people who work at IRD get paid for processing the returns made by the collectors. Initially then time costs were significant enough, they have been reduced somewhat by computerization and recently by a better web based return system at IRD. (The previous system was a waste of time for me, if cost me more time that the manual returns) This is an iniquitous system, first set by the Labour Party, and the subsequent governments have all failed to rectify the injustice. My submission is therefore that the Tax working group really do consider what the PM talks about when she mentions lofty ideals such as fairness, equality, and start paying the people who do the work. Nobody consulted with is and asked us if we would like to be tax collectors, the Labour Party simply acted in a classic Soviet manner and made us Tax collectors whether we like it or not. If we didn’t like it the choice they gave us was not realistic; either reduce income or sales to below a certain threshold, or cease trading. Not nice, please fix this up. Start paying the collectors and be like parliamentarians when they vote on things which affect their self interest, backdate it to whenever a collector became registered. A simply method could be used to reduce the administrative cost: for current and future tax collections, a rebate fee reducing the amount of tax payable, something like a commission on sales. Alternatively the tax collector could submit a Tax Invoice to the IRD for services rendered, and payment can be made in the normal manner . For back payments to 1989 a lump sum is required, but this could simply be in the form of a tax credit which could be offset against the next returns due. The backdated fees need to be generous to take into account the more arduous manual methods of accounting used in those days. A simple method of calculating how much the IRD would owe the unpaid tax collector would be to get an average price from accountants who were paid by tax collectors to do the actual work. I sincerely trust that the Tax Working group is interested in justice and equality and will put my submission forward to the government as a recommendation. The government stated in pre election consultation that it would be committed to equity, and I am a bit old fashioned so I am holding them to their word, I take their statements to be contractual obligations.

Two reason for that are that in the late 1990s all the push was for people to save for their retirement. Most NZers have little knowledge of the share market which fluctuates and thus causes problems PLUS a sizable group have lost their savings when directors have acted dishonestly. The only investment where a person had some control was residential real estate. If a person bought a property they were prepared to live in it would attract responsible tenants. We know this from experience and have maintained and improved them for the tenants eg heat pumps, double glaxing, increased insulation etc. We have had long term tenants who appreciate our input and we can describe them as friends. Where a person has say four or more properties and is using that as their main income that is a different story and it appears that often those ones are the people who are taking advantage of their tenant thru frequent rent rises, lack of maintenance etc. You need to differentiate between good and bad landlords and those for whom it is their main income. Being a responsible landlord does not come cheap with ever increasing costs etc rates, insurance and maintenance. We have to budget our national super and our savings very carefully. The savings may have to last for 30 years. Supermarket shopping costs have increased this year. There have been warnings that oaps will run their savings well before they die and have to exist solely on their savings snd we see this likely to happen. Working people under the age of say 50 do not know what the fortnightly super amount is and do not realise that it covers basic costs with no special extras. A capital gains tax is just penalizing people who have saved for years, paid their taxes and not frittered away their money. You may not realise one inequality. Where a person has ever had an interest in farmland, even as long as 50 years ago, they can never receive subsidised rest home care. But if a person has owned a business, dispsed of it in some manner and used or hidem the proceeds that person gets subsidised rest home care.

It is possible for governments to acquire a bigger total tax take by reducing rates. The working Group should remember to encourage not to discourage or depress those who provide. I would decrease the lowest income tax rates but for the million dollar incomes a higher rate should be considered.

Any secondary purchase of a house or next house purchase , they must return to their proper tax rate . People that own houses or apartments or buildings for over 8 years , should not be liable for capital tax gains or losses. People that sell their properties in less than 8 years should pay capital gain tax. Renters need to have more rights - no increased rent rates in 1 year or less, and should be given 6 months notice of increases or have to leave their premises. Increases in rent should be no more than .05% after the 1 year and 6 months prior advice . There should be carbon taxes for all diesel and petrol emission vehicles including motorised boats , ships and planes. Farmers need to have two trees / bushes per cow eg .

For example the first years free university fees was is to my mind totally unessary and a waste of money. Secondly, I think the tax system as is, is about correct. A Capital Gains Tax or Wealth Tax is not required and is a disincentive for the average person to invest in some form of inflation proof investment to try and provide for a better retirement. Many people I know have spent a lifetime investing any surplus funds they have to provide for their future and they should be allowed to keep their assets intact. I would suggest if more tax is required there are many institutions paying nothing on the incomes of millions in some cases. An example is the South Island tribe made a profit of $96 million last year but pay no tax. To my mind they should have paid Near $30 million in tax give or take a little. A few of those types of examples gathered together would equate to a much greater tax take than a hard to administer Capital Gains Tax on ordinary people.

It shouldn't be difficult to police or collect at the point where it leaves the country. If the money goes into the public purse all New Zealanders will benefit from it (i.e. nobody owns the water). It also solves the problem of whinging farmers. If the water stays here they don't have to pay the tax. 2 - a capital gains tax on all property except the family home. Property speculation is one of the main reasons why so may people are locke dout of the housing market. Make property investment less attractive! I also support using petrol taxes to finance better public transport. Car drivers benefit from a better public transport system: the more people use public transport the faster car drivers get to their destination due to lower traffic volumes. It has the same effect as building new roads but with a better environmental outcome. We should have a plastic bottle collection system. 'Clean Green NZ' is lagging behind in so many ways - let's tackle this one asap. Another thing that needs to be sorted is the ever increasing proportion of minimum wage jobs. As soon as an employer doesn't find a Kiwi who does the job for minimum wage the call goes out to let in more immigrants. Skilled workers need to be paid appropriately. I've got the equivalent of honours degrees in both mathematics and physics, have 10 years experience as a software developer, am a fully trained secondary school teacher for mathematics and physics and guess what - I work for minimum wage!

First -tax should be used to redistribute wealth so I am against a flat tax and regressive taxes. A flat tax of say 10% looks appealing until you realize that most business people which includes farmers etc. pay very little tax. So they would still have their incomes adjusted by their accountantants, and their children would still collect the subsidized university allowance. and all the other benefits they enjoy. I also beleive that tax should be used to influence people's behavior ( a type of user pays). Taxes from cigarrettes should go to hospitals , taxes from alcohol should go to the police and hospitals, polluters should pay and this should be used to monitor pollution, sugar drinks should be taxed and this should go to hospitals Tourist tax should go to regions and DOC. I prefer this approach to prohibition. A conseervation tax is a good idea. I think the tax base is too narrow and that there should be more alternatives to income tax. This particularly applies to regional and city taxes. Rates are simply too narrow. and they should not have to pay gst on taxes...taxes on taxes is immoral.

So if they have an accident, NZers will pay for it through ACC. If they do something stupid and need a helicopter rescueon the mountain, that's ok too, NZers will pay. Where else in the world do hard working tax payers pay for the medical needs of visitors? You need to switch the thinking around.

I've just compiled an interesting set of calculations as I was surprised by one of the scenarios that was presented to me this week. This is based on one adult with two dependents living in the Tauranga region and sole care of children. The calculator is down so I couldn't do shared care. Of course everyone's final results are going to be different depending on their own unique circumstances. I'll be honest I was gobsmacked at how little difference there was between the take home incomes on those income brackets between $50K and $90K. At the higher income brackets there are usually additional hours worked which means more costs so there is unlikely to be any tangible difference in net incomes. First figure - gross income per annum. Second figure is weekly net income after accommodation supplements and WFF, third figure is net income. $20,000 - $865 - $44973 $30,000 - $1017 - $52873 $40,000 - $1104 - $57444 $50,000 - $1169 - $60780 $60,000 - $1206 - $62756 $70,000 - $1244 - $64720 $80,000 - $1284 - $66760 $90,000 - $1323 - $68800 $100K - $1436 - $74690 It seems there is very little incentive for anyone to increase their income from $50k to $90k per annum. The extra earnings would quickly be absorbed into extra costs associated with earning the higher income. While I applaud the government doing something to care for those less well off, It would be good to see the government do something to address this imbalance to give people the incentive to be productive.

Dear Sir or Madam, The increasing population, including visitors, is a tax base that has proven, specific negative impacts on the environment, resources, infrastructure, taxpayer costs health care, housing, road toll, etc. New Zealand was much wealthier 50 years ago when the population was much lower. It follows that childless people are doing the heavy lifting in environmental protection, efficient use of resources and controlling taxpayer costs etc. Hence, population control by rewarding childlessness is urgently required. A population limit should be set, (say 6,000,000 by 2025) and significant tax breaks should be given to childless people, and not given or removed from those who have children. Visitor numbers also need to be significantly reduced to a sustainable level of say 1,000,000 per year. This should be achieved by the introduction of an entrance fee at all ports and airports. Foreigners need to pay US$100 per person to enter Galapagos. New Zealand's conservation values are more important, so a similar fee should be implemented here. Hard currency collected in cash at the border could be used to finance DOC and provide good visitor facilities. Free access to DOC facilities could be provided in return for the fee. I believe all bona-fide foreign visitors would welcome this. Any foreigner not able to pay the fee in cash on arrival should be put on the next flight home, as they are in the Galapagos. Why should a legal person called a company be taxed differently to other legal persons? I believe that the the 5% rate differential between the company and personal tax rates is discrimination. Please abolish the differential between the company and personal tax rates and all other discriminatory tax differentials. To improve New Zealand's poor rate of saving, RWT on interest should be abolished. The road toll is increasing because New Zealand drivers are getting worse, roads and cars are not a factor, you drive to the conditions which includes you, the car and the environment, driver error is always the cause of any accident. The Ministry of Transport has put the cost of each road death at $4.5 million. The following measures should be implement with urgency to reduce taxpayer costs of the road toll and allow the zero road toll vision to be realistic. 1. Implement a very stringent driving test similar to that in Sweden and ensure it is enforced. 2. All drivers should be re-tested when their driving license expires and, no new license issued unless the driver passes the new test. 3. Introduce compulsory comprehensive insurance for under 25 year olds. \[1\] 80 If these measures reduce the number of road deaths by say 100 per year, that's $4,500,000,000 saved for the taxpayer each year. The costs of implementation cannot be anywhere near this amount. Thank you for considering the above.

In general families should be encouraged to eat at home not only because of healthier foods but on a relational basis it is healthier too. 2) The Government should institute New Zealand as a cashless society, this will increase tax revenue by many billions of dollars as the black market in trades, food,drugs, etc. will be forced to declare its revenues and pay taxes by the mere use of the EFTPOS system.

Kemelmager \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] \[ \[1\] 82 From:Beryl Love Sent: Sunday, 22 April 2018 6:37 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Fwd: Future of Tax in New Zealand Begin forwarded message: Dear Sir/Madam, I would like to make the following submissions to The Tax Working Group. The current tax system disadvantages the working poor and those who are just about managing to live. For a tax system to be fair and equitable to all I suggest the following:- Personal taxation A tax free lower earnings limit to be established to enable those on low incomes to keep more of their hard earned salary. This will benefit the low paid and encourage people to find and keep employment. There would then be a two tier tax system. The starting point $24,000.00 to $90,000.00 at a rate of 20%, $90,000.00 and above to be 40%. The tax bands to be amended each year in line with the increase in the minimum wage. Trusts The current system needs a complete overhaul, it disadvantages those on lower incomes and encourages/allows tax avoidance by more affluent members of society. I understand, currently assets can be sold into a Trust and the seller then gifts the amount relinquished by the sale back to the Trust whilst continuing to enjoy the benefit of the asset. Whilst doing the aforementioned the seller can then continue to live in the house they have gifted to the trust. They are continuing to benefit from the property, without incurring any additional costs. This anomaly could be rectified by levying tax on an unearned income basis for personal tax on the seller who continues to live in the property. The levy could be assessed by the size and value of the property the larger the property the greater the tax payable. GST GST to be removed from fresh fruit, vegetables and meat. Processed foods, take aways and sugary drinks to be increased to offset the loss of revenue from fresh produce. Capital Gains Tax Capital gains tax to be paid on all property other than the main residential home. If Parliament agrees such a measure there should not be a watershed it should be implemented immediately regardless of the time the property has been owned. No tax relief for retrospective ownership. Rental Property Capital Gains Tax to be paid on all rental property at time of sale with no relief for the length of time the property has been owned. If Parliament agrees such a measure there should not be a watershed it should be implemented immediately, regardless of the time the property has been owned to avoid the housing market being flooded with property. A limit should also be placed on the amount that can be offset against tax for repairs to a rental property in any one year. Losses Financial losses for business or property investments/rentals should not be offset against personal tax. Company/Farm/Trust Vehicles \[1\] \[1\] 83 Tax levy on personal use of vehicles that are registered to a Trust or Company and not owned by the user. Yours faithfully, Beryl Love (Mrs.) 84 From:norman godden Sent: Sunday, 22 April 2018 12:16 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Greetings I would like the working group to consider the issue of any capital gains tax which exempts the “family home”.  Our daughter has her home in her passive family trust in an endeavour to protect it from any relationship breakdown, simply because she has suffered both financial and personal stress previously. Her husband decided that he didn’t wish to be married soon after they were married and although it was termed as a marriage of short duration, meaning what one brings into the marriage, one takes out, her husband created a very distressing situation which both disadvantaged and traumatised her considerably, in trying to get her assets out of the marriage.  Consequently, after her divorce, she wasn’t going to be caught again and so set up her passive family trust simply to protect her new home. Therefore, I hope that the definition of “family home” will encompass an home in a family trust based on the owner living in the home and having a trust which is passive and set up for the one purpose of protecting the home in the future.

I am writing this submission to the tax working group, because my 20 year background in information technology enables me to see that robots will reduce the career opportunities for my children's future and and will reduce the tax take for New Zealand. A recent example of a software robot replacing human labour comes from the JPMorgan Chase & Co. called COIN, for Contract Intelligence. It is a software based on machine learning that analyses financial deals that once kept legal teams busy for thousands of hours. According to Bloomberg, ”It does the mind-numbing job of interpreting commercial-loan agreements that used to consume 360,000 hours of work each year by lawyers and loan officers.” The lawyer bot or software robot works 24/7/365, is less error-pron e, reviews documents in seconds, and never asks for vacation or higher salary. I would like the tax working group to consider a robot tax of 20% which would be based on capital expenditure cost in the installation all of physical automation or process automation and AI. The robot tax would also a consider a tax on all licensing costs of process automation and AI ( Which are yearly subscription based) and maintenance cost all of the physical robots. As one robot is equivalent to 15 full time staff (based on human speed) that a lot of missed career opportunities and tax .

Chris Berriman \[1\] \[1\] 88 From:John Makin Sent: Friday, 20 April 2018 1:24 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission During the term of John F Kennedy he is reputed to have held a dinner for a group of people identified as having the brightest minds in the nation at the time. In his address to them he made the following observation: 'This is perhaps the assembly of the most intelligence ever to gather at one time in the White House, with the exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.’ Thomas Jefferson made the following observations, which are on public record: 1} The democracy will cease to exist when you take away from those who are willing to work and give to those who would not. 2} It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes. A principle which if acted on would save one half the wars of the world. 3) I predict future happiness for Americans if they can prevent the government from wasting the labours of the people under the pretence of taking care of them. 4) My reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government. 5} To compel a man to subsidise with his taxes the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors, is sinful and tyrannical. I believe that many of his beliefs are applicable to New Zealand today. Democracy is without any doubt being eroded. We are being over-governed and the resulting proliferation in bureaucrats is funded by taxes in various forms. The government is intent on taking care of us at a cost, to the extent that personal responsibility is a rapidly vanishing individual quality. I would like to make the following recommendations to the Tax Working Group in the forlorn hope that some suggestions might influence its final recommendations to Government. \* That before increasing taxation it should be a government priority to reduce its costs. It could for example consider the removal of entire government departments which only exist for the sake of appearance. \* That percentage of GDP should not be used as a measure of efficiency as long as the cost of government services are included in the calculation of GDP. By using this measure and by increasing their own costs, figures can be manipulated. \* It is essential that Company taxation should be seen as fair and even-handed. It is almost criminal in my opinion, for some Companies to have preferential taxation treatment because they are able to register as Charities. When such organisations are competing in the marketplace with enterprises paying normal company tax rates, there should be rules in place to ensure an even playing field. Perhaps they could be based on an audited percentage of their profits historically distributed to identified beneficiaries through permitted channels - health, education etc. \* As an ex CEO of a multinational organisation which manufactured and marketed in New Zealand, I am aware of the use of differential pricing to evade NZ taxation requirements. My own performance was based on consolidated profits from the NZ operation so I was aware of the extent of retained profits through rather devious pricing techniques. My efforts to introduce a degree of fairness resulted in my early retirement. While my experience was in the 1990’s, the practice probably continues. The Tax Working Group should consider reciprocal arrangements with the Customs Departments of a wide diversity of countries and establish an active database of transfer prices by product. Alternatively an arbitrary percentage of sales in New Zealand could be used as the basis for tax calculations. A fair contribution to New Zealand from multinational organisations relative to the revenue generated through their operations here, could contribute significantly to our overall tax requirements. \* In the real world of competitive business, it is invariably a rule that period cost/expenses of a business, are maintained to a set percentage of total revenue or of total profit. Failure to meet budget projections based on these parameters, would result in a fairly short tenure at top levels of responsibility. Surely similar conditions should be placed on government equivalents. I hope that the above suggestions are of some use and I particularly commend the thoughts of Thomas Jefferson, which are probably as relevant today as they were in the early 19 th century. John Makin 20.04 2018. \[1\] 89 From:Andrew Charlton Sent: Friday, 20 April 2018 10:10 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Tax needs to be completely rethought. 1. People pay tax on income, whereas businesses pay tax on profits, yet people must pay their expenses in order to survive - if anyone should be exempt from tax until all their necessities are paid for, it should be people. 2. Why do poorer people have to pay tax, and then get money back in the form of benefits and social services? Perhaps they ought to be tax-exempt up until a certain income. And that should not be the poverty line, but something closer to a decent life. 3. The idea that taxes pay for services is backwards. The government creates money, and can spend as much as it wants. Taxation takes that money out of the money supply in order to control inflation. This is the basis of Modern Monetary Theory. The limits on what government can do are purely based on what real people using real resources are able to produce. 4. Concentration of capital is what creates inequality, therefore it's capital that ought to be taxed first. 5. GST is a problematic form of taxation which raises the cost of the necessities of life - food & clothing being major ones. Again, we should avoid taxing people until they have enough for themselves that they are able to contribute to broader society. 6. The need to 'balance the books', and avoid debt just creates a shortage of money which contracts the economy. 7. Using tax as a means of social control also disproportionately hurts poorer people. People without much money, but who find pleasure in things like cigarettes and alcohol are now even further out of pocket due to the taxes on those things. The taxes on cigarettes and alcohol should be based on the costs of dealing with their consequences - e.g. cigarette tax should only be enough to pay for health services that cigarette use causes. 8. Even using tax as an environmental control has issues - farmers are just trying to make a living, but making that living has environmental costs. In a way, they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. The solution is not to tax them for doing what they have to do to survive - it's to give them ways to survive that doesn't require them to harm the environment - subsidies for equipment that makes things cleaner, for example. 9. In general, the people who have benefited most from the way society is currently organised should bear the majority of the burden of supporting those who have benefited least. 10. Investment property should definitely be highly taxed. I am happy to be contacted to discuss these points. Regards, Andrew Charlton \[1\] 90 From:Dany Sent: Friday, 20 April 2018 9:30 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Tax submission Quite simply, we should be taxing WEALTH not INCOME. A modest tax of 1% on the wealth of the country would provide more revenue than the complex and often uneven method of taxing income with its myriad exceptions, deductions, calculations and machinations. The financially sophisticated are able to minimise and even escape their liability, often while building wealth. Taxing wealth means that taxes keep pace with inflation. Taxing wealth protects the poor. A simple exemption of those with a net wealth of less than $30,000 would exclude renters and not include a modest car and home furnishings. Concessions to the elderly might also be considered. A home owner with a modest pension might be exempted. Taxing wealth means that everyone pays, individuals as well as corporations. For example: A person with a home in Auckland and a modest portfolio totalling $2,000,000.00 would pay an annual tax of $20,000. A corporation such as Fonterra, with assets exceeding 20,000,000,000 would pay a flat 1% rate of $200,000,000.00. Something that they could do easily ou t of the 17 billion they receive in revenue. Equally, those with multiple homes and extensive investments would be liable for 1% of the total value annually. Tax WEALTH is fair and just. It does not prevent a person from earning as much as they possibly can. In fact it encourages earnings and it encourages spending by only taxing what you keep. I realise that this is a radical departure from past systems. I also realise that corporations will resist this with every legal method at their disposal. Nevertheless, New Zealand has often been a leader in making positive changes politically and socially. A wealth tax is long overdue and will be a positive thing for the nation. It merits serious consideration. It should not be brushed aside as simply a radical departure from the past. It has serious merits and needs to be on the table.

D R Stubbs Company Tax: New Zealand companies must compete on the global stage therefore keep a unified rate and if any changes are made, lower the rate. G.S.T.: This has been a very effective tax which is apparently easy to administer. Do not introduce any further exemptions. Level the playing field. Foreign companies registered for tax in other counties but trading in New Zealand should be subject to G.S.T. Interest on Savings: The interest rate paid by financial institutions such as banks is both taxable and depleted by inflation thus reducing the incentive for savings. Allow a certain amount of savings in individual savings accounts be exempt from income tax. Commercial Charities: There appears to be a big loophole as far as charities are concerned. Currently, for-profit businesses registered as charities are tax free. While this has been recognised by successive governments, so far none has had the courage to deal with it. My submission is that these businesses, which include well-known names such as Sanitarium, Mission Wines Estate, Shotover Jet and Go Bus, should be taxed in the same way that private firms are taxed, and only donations actually made to their associated charities to be allowable deductions. Such a policy would ‘level the playing field’ between businesses while at the same time providing the incentive to donate more funds to their respective charities. Since 2005 the Charities Act has resulted in many tribal groups registeri ng as charities. The very successful growth in the ‘Maori Economy’ mostly resulting from judicious investment of Treaty Settlements, and the very real prospect of continued growth, while in itself is a success story, it has the unfortunate and unfair side-effect of an ever-increasing portion of the economy being tax free. Derek Stubbs \[1\] \[1\] 93 From:Hilary Blundell Sent: Thursday, 19 April 2018 9:02 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: viable and necessary NZ carbon tax system ideas Dear Tax Working Group Secretariat, Who I am: Mr Hilary Blundell. I have lived in Mapua outside Nelson since 1989, the year of my immigration from Uk, and NZ citizenship, of which I am very proud. I pay a lot of tax and contribute to housing opportunities. My main business is land and buildings, residential and commercial rentals and subdivision - your page 47. My main interest is Climate Change and this is why I came to NZ 30 years ago. Focus issue: "Environmental Challenges” - page 14/15 and “How to adjust the tax system” - page 9. The problem: The Paris Agreement targets, but actually the very serious position we are all in. Humanity’s economic/political playing field has begun to tilt, the physics of CO2 and methane is playing out, and physics is not interested in human problems. Our fossil fuel use must reduce and be replaced by renewable electric motors asap, and NZ is in a great position to show how it’s done. Positive environmental outcomes - page 49/50, 53. The tax system could be used to nudge our society to a far more sustainable system, meet our international obligations and even lead the way with our existing and enhanced renewable system. Consideration: In London in the 80’s I was paid as a systems analyst, and this is the skill I have been applying continuously to the “climate” problem ever since 1987 when I first visited NZ. I published a book on Climate and Oil in 2009, The Cliff in The Fog, and it sold widely. I now post on www.cliffinthefog.wordpress.com. We all know the whole world has a serious problem with CO2, combustion and fossil fuel in particular. NZ is high up on the “badly-behaved” list - planes, agriculture, forestry and car kms per person. We need to do a lot more to reduce our FF use, and we have an excellent renewable electric infrastructure already. My recent research concerns the current exponential Arctic methane release to air, through a friend in Germany - PhD methane - and Siberian scientists working up there. Hydrate methane release has increased 100x over an area of 2 million km2, in the 10 years since my book was published. I have numbers. This suggests we are perilously close to a serious irreversible positive feedback tipping point where our climate may spiral into catastrophic territory for humanity. When will we know it’s too late? Of all the myriad environmental issues we face, only one thing really matters now - the one we have all been avoiding most - fossil fuel use must be reduced and fast. NZ can do this - we have lots of hydro, geothermal, and wind, and lots more untapped wind and solar available. Even though protesters target the fossil fuel companies - they are easy targets - they are not really at fault. They just feed a huge demand by people, industry, agriculture and airlines. But really this fuel is so damaging in the long run, it is far too cheap - the externalities have been ignored too long - and it should be valued much more highly. Each user should feel a rising cost of using it, thus effectively sending a signal to the public and business, discouraging it’s use and encouraging a switch to renewable electric (or perhaps to simply using less energy!) “Climate Change” is presenting increasing "extreme weather events” everywhere. There are large associated costs to society which have been predicted and will only increase over time - the sea is rising and warming, storms are becoming bigger, droughts will be longer, rainfall and bushfires will be more damaging, agriculture and infrastructure will struggle with increasing costs and losses. Who will pay? \[1\] 94 Insurance? Or some form of carbon tax? This would be more appropriate since it is the unconstrained use of fossil fuel that is causing the change and the damage. James Anderson of Harvard - the ozone scientist whose work resulted in the Montreal Protocol about the Antarctic ozone hole - recently stated in a speech that if we want to have viable agriculture in 2100, we need to finish with fossil fuels worldwide within 5 years. Without radical change (90% reduction), business as usual gives us a trajectory of not 2C but 4-6C temperature rise this century. This is because the northern methane is getting out and the planet could become hostile to life as we know it - as it has before. These would be conditions well outside what humans have ever experienced over much of the world, and many scientists warn about imminent extinction. "Normal economics and politics" would drown. NZ must do its bit and we can, but we must act quickly. (“Act” means finding a viable way to effectively discourage fossil fuel use in all sectors of society.) My proposal and summary: After long consideration, and comparison of the effects of other systems being applied around the world, I believe a simple “carbon price” or “carbon tax” is the wrong answer. I have an explanation for this if you want, but not here. Better is a moving price signal - a gently increasing tax on all fossil fuel, rather than a single step increase. I realise that any rise in oil costs is inflationary, but physics (and the conditions in the Arctic) are not interested in human economic problems, and soon we will all be paying an enormous delayed cost of these fuels. Who will pay? The user should pay - the price of all fossil fuel (coal, gas, petrol, diesel, jet-fuel, and bunker fuel) should rise every month by at least 1% each for both: 1. until our fossil fuel emissions have dropped well below our Paris Agreement commitments, and the tax is used to subsidise the shift to renewable electric, AND 2. to create a ring-fenced government fund for responding to the costs, and helping the victims, of extreme weather events. If and when the fund is insufficient to cover such costs, the tax should rise to meet the societal need. It’s only fair! So, 2% per month increase, every month, on all fossil fuels, without any later reduction permitted, for at least 2 years, maybe 5. If this was to fail or be mitigated, democracy wins in the short term as nothing but a greedy popularity contest, and physics will do its worst to all of us and our descendants. I also propose that plane travel needs to be discouraged, not encouraged, until planes use non-FF energy. This could be done with a $30 per seat per take-off tax plus another $30 per hour of flying, on top of the increasing fuel cost, to acknowledge every passenger’s contribution to pollution and effectively prohibit very cheap tickets. I also realise that this will significantly affect tourism, but tourism uses huge quantities of fossil fuel. These tax suggestions should also apply to shipping and cruise ships in some form - another cost that “globalisation” should bear. I am open to discussion on these issues and can travel. There are many other issues in your document I could comment on, but the fossil fuel issue is by far the most important. With regards and hope for a “sustainable" future for all our children and theirs, Mr Hilary Blundell, \[1\] 95 From:Susan Moyle Sent: Thursday, 19 April 2018 3:40 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Tax working paper Good afternoon I would like to express my concern as to the wording in the 'Charities' section of the Future of Tax submissions background paper. On page 41, there is a statement made that: "Tax benefits attached to donations made to not-for-profits cost the Government $274 million in 2016." There is no mention of any benefit to society stemming from these donations, but only of the COST to the Government. In fact, Government benefits greatly or it would not offer tenders, contracts and grants to charities to do work that government does not have the capacity or skills to carry out. I feel that this focus on the idea of COST is a very uninformed and short-sighted view of charitable organisations and the vast work they do in New Zealand. This attitude concerns me deeply, as someone who both volunteers and works in the Charitable sector and knows how much New zealand society would suffer if charities were not supported in their work through the various tax exemptions available to them. Yours Susan Moyle \[1\] 96 From: Sent:Thursday, 19 April 2018 3:11 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission I submit that any introduction of any kind of capital gains tax be avoided. If this government goes ahead with introducing such a tax this will inevitably lead to higher costs for investors. This in turn will lead to investors turning away from investing in rental properties, again leading to them on selling to owner occupiers who on average are willing to pay more for a home than investors are. The shortage of low cost homes for those less well off with continue nay get worse. So, if this government really means to help those who can't find decent accommodation it should keep this sort of thing in mind. Catherine P Beuning \[1\]\[1\] 97 From:Paul Hopkins Sent: Thursday, 19 April 2018 2:35 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Tax changes Paul Hopkins Hi, I recently wrote to the minister of finance who asked me to write to you and seriously consider my argument for the current taxation. I think government can learn a lot from other overseas countries. Of course New Zealand is only small and therefor people pay more tax than they would in other countries to support the vast emptiness that all needs up-keeping when the population is so low. For New Zealand to be comfortable it would need a working population of 13 million according to a respected economist. He however was wealthy and not interested in that simply saying that he enjoyed New Zealand as it was. He is in a different financial position than most of us an we live from hand to mouth. Saying that, I disagree with your current ideas of forcing businesses to pay workers more and more. This may be good for few workers however the prices of products just keeps going up disproportionately. It’s no good and doesn’t work. Large companies might adjust profits while restaurants will lay off another member and other struggling shops may close. Follow other countries ideas. A tax free threshold. In the uk it’s $25000 to everyone. They pull the money back with higher rates for good earners. The tax free threshold as you know rises with inflation. It’s the minimum amount a that you need to have to survive in the country. Here it could called the survival tax- how fantastic for the current party to be able to award this to EVERYONE! Then, the wealthier you are, the more you’ll pay- not ripping anyone off- they will also get their tax free sum just as the poorest do but you will be avoiding taxing the poorest- even at those low ridiculous threshold rates. By doing that you will also be encouraging everyone to earn and disclose their earnings however small making tax avoidance unnecessary. It’s the same with gst.. possibly cut out gst on fruit and vegetables if you plan to hike it on sugar related foods. Just an idea. Anyway, my tax threshold would definitely work and is easier and so much fairer than your curr ent over complicated one that just pushes up costs and doesn’t solve anything. Imaging earning you money and being able to pay your rent AND eat? Some of you are not in the real world were every cent really means something. The poor have to make these decisions every day and there are more and more people on that bread line. Don’t make the costs of food, rent and other services more expensive-don’t give businesses that opportunity to increase costs. Give us that clear tax free threshold. Sent from my iPhone \[1\] \[1\] 98 From:Daniel Meares Sent: Thursday, 19 April 2018 2:11 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission on Tax Submission to NZ Tax Group April 2018 I am a fan of the ideas of Henry George, friend of Sir George Grey, described as one of the greatest thinkers since Plato, inspiration for the board game Monopoly, best selling author of Progress and Poverty which sold over 3 million copies a century ago and near mayor of new York. His premise: What we create is ours. You cook a meal you expect to be able to eat it. You wouldn't want me eating it - you would feel aggrieved if I did. What we do not create is NOT ours. The air is not yours - or mine. Or the water. Or the sky. Likewise by what original right did people claim the land was theirs? By force. Yet we did not create it and when we claim it as our own we necessarily deprive all others of its use. Force is not the basis of fairness. We need private use of land - for stability, practicality and security. But we cannot claim the land as ours except by depriving others of its use, practically or legally. So there has to be a fair and intelligent way of allocating the land - clearly it is an ess ential resource without which we cannot live. If we don’t allocate the land with an optimal method we will have a suboptimal society. In western society land ownership seemed to be originally through force rather than reason. (Might was right). Do we accept that people can claim the land as their own on the basis of force? Perhaps it had to be that way then but George offered an alternative, more rational, more equitable and more productive model. What George proposed was a tax on the unimproved value of the land. We already have this to some extent in Wellington and I am sure in other parts of NZ. Look at your rates bill; the rates are based on the sum of the land value and the capital or improvement value. George would only tax the former since you would not want to be taxing people on improvements. George would still allow the private use of land but ‘owners’ would pay a rent to the community – since they deprive others the use of it – and this income would be used to replace or reduce other taxes like GST which increases prices, or income tax which taxes your and my productivity, labour and efforts. Without such a type of tax as George suggests, consider what has happened. When the wealth in society increases and the economy grows, both land prices and rents rise. Landholders gain as prices rises even if they have not worked or added any value to society. Non-landholders lose as rents are higher - even though they have no doubt added to the value of society. Because there is no tax on land not surpr isingly prices continue to rise making home ownership harder for many and also dividing the gap in wealth between land and non-land owners; this is why, in my theory, many people feel they have lost out or society is unfair but they can’t put their finger on it. The cause of the inequity was there was no level playing field at the start. However, the solution is not to tax productive income and redistribute the income but to make the playing field level - one where we all have an equal birthright to the land. In practical terms though I see this would be a long term policy and have to be introduced very gradually otherwise it would be unfair on those who have invested in property, since the introduction of such a tax would reduce land and therefore property values. \[1\] \[1\] 99 I did submit some information on this to the last Tax Group but never heard anything back. What I did read, however, was an article in the Dom Post by a member of the then Committee saying Land Tax was a silly idea - despite endorsement by many - but that was the end of his explanation! Th 100 From:philippa kelsall Sent: Thursday, 19 April 2018 10:18 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Sugar needs to be taxed. It's responsible for a large proportion of health spending. Healthy foods ie fresh fruit and vegetables, unprocessed meat, chicken and fish should not be taxed. Everyone should be able to afford a healthy diet. Anything processed, canned or packaged should be taxed regardless of how "healthy" it claims to be. Packaging is a huge industry that impacts on the environment. The taxing of farmers for greenhouse gass emissions is frought as they are supplying necessary food to the population on farms many of which have trees ( and native trees do emit carbon dioxide) and large amounts of grass that by virtue of being green does also. Where farming has lost its way is through large corporate farms that need to deliver profits to often absent shareholders requiring the use of unsustanable practises that harm the environment. Water taken from rivers and springs should be taxed but not rain water kept in ponds and tanks. Any practise that cares for the land and water supply should be encouraged through taxaton. Taxing land and not family homes is difficult as someone's farm can be worth less than a house in auckland that will eventually be sold for a profit. If they were all taxed at the same rate (and this tax paid annually) this could be offset with a universal income. This would make it more affordable for families to rent or buy and less attractive for those who already own property to keep buying more. The universal income idea should be examined more seriously along with ideas that make a healthy lifestyle attainable for everyone. That is, simple unprocessed homecooked food, having access to high quality public education that doesn't put you in debt, making a contribution to society in a meaningful way that is valued, community and individual expression and being able and encouraged to provide a permanent and stressfree home for one's family. Electric cars sound good but we need to put more resources into researching issues to do with battery disposal and supply. Some antisocial and irresponsible behaviour may be addressed through tax. Cannibis could be legalised and highly taxed with lots of education around use and effects. Any suppliers caught avoiding tax on drugs should be given the death penalty.

Yours sincerely, \[1\] \[1\] 106 From:Leon H Sent: Wednesday, 18 April 2018 9:55 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission Importance: Low Hi tax working group, Firstly great initiative and I wish you best of luck. My submission is focused on 2 core themes with support for some of the ideas put forward so far. In summary New Zealand society is undergoing immense changes with the drivers well documented in mainstream media. While there are many positive changes such as productivity and expanding cultural diversity, there are also growing negative flow on effects affecting the average Kiwi. While most New Zealanders appear to be adverse to 'nanny state' governments, the reality is that too many people continue to make ill informed and dumb decisions that have an exponential impact on the tax system and tax payer, think tabacco, obeisity, crime. Therefore intervention is necessary to protect the society as a whole, and early intervention is even better. While many of todays problems are outside the remit of the tax working group, I am hopefull that tax reform may assist with incrimental improvements that future govrernments can expand on to make New Zealand a better place for today and tomorrows generations. The opportunity therefore is to incentivise the right behaviours that positively benefit society, discourage the negative behaviours and thirdly embrace digital technoology to collect real time tax collection and spending effectiveness to enure every dollar of tax revenue collected generates a net gain. Core Theme: Service to the country, hand up not out. As John F Kennedy famously said “And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you -- ask what you can do for your country.” Perhaps this is wishful thinking, but I sincerly feel that all of us that call New Zealand are incredibly lucky to call this country home. Therefore shoudn’t there be a responsibility on all of us to give back, serve our communities and country and help others who cannot help themselves. We need strong commnities that take charge, look to help themselves first before expecting central or local government to help. With that said there is inequality that needs to be addressed but there is also laziness, bludgers and those that take more than they give back which needs to be addressed; Idea 1a: Encourage and incentivise people to give back to their coutry and community via tax credits. Encourage kiwis to give back to their communities and countries. Every day there are thousands of people that volunteer to feed the hungry, Support the sick, help the environment, rescue those in trouble. Surely this should be encouraged if not an expectation that all citizens shuld contribute some level of public service each year. Providing people and communities with a purpose and common goals overcomes many barriers, and social costs we see today. An easy way to recognise and incentivse this behavour would be via tax credits based on verifed hours worked for registered charities, community groups or national bodies etc. This has wider benefits beyond the organisations themselves, with knowledge sharing, learnng new skills, ability to support our ageing population, and the potential to reduce social costs such as crime, vandalism etc. 1b: Inequality must be addressed but if we are to break the cycle, then we must motivate and encourage indviduals, families and communities to help themselves first and earn their fair share of the tax spend via benefits. I look at the public service ‘conscription method’ operated in countries like singapore. There looks to be an opportunity to take indivuduals in their late teens, early twenties and installing them in an envrionment where they learn practical \[1\] \[1\] 107 skills, learn from positive life skills and potentially form a Career. This could range from the armed forces, health sector, emergeency services, DO C, forrest management. While this has clear benefits for young adults from troubled homes, and problamatic communities, it lso has relevance for individuals that simply don’t know yet what they want to do with their lives. 2a. Digita Pro’s and Con’s. Let’s start with the Pro’s; Big Data, AI, Robotics, the Internet of things, Digital economy. With technology advancing at exponential rates and more and more New Zealanders glued to their screens, there appears to be the infrastructure to support wide scale, real time measurement of tax collection and spend effectiveness. It could start small, targeting certain communities, specific policy and government departments but provided the communication to the nation secured the buy in from all Kiwi’s to download the app, take 2 minutes per week to answer surveys etc. You could collect incredibly rich data. Over time it could be expanded to cover the full budget, with full transparency and open source code to encourage innvators and entreprenuers to take on social problems and find betteer ways to deliver services, potentially at lower cost with better outcomes. 2b. On the last point, I see this as extremely important if NZ is to maintain our high standards of living, plus supporting the development of new industries and diversification away from traditional primary production. Support of entrenuers and start-up businesses will also be crucial as we move into the 2020’s, with exanding globalisation and pressure on traditional labour markets. This poses the question; starting a new business is extremely high risk wth incredibly high failure rates, is there scope to provide tax incentives to help encourage more people to be take a risk and start a busineess. For example imagine the scale a new business could grow to, w ith less stresses and financial pressure if you paid reduced tax or no tax fr the first 1 -2 years? To recap the key points from this submission; Can we utilise a new tax system to encourage service to ones community and our country, encourage a hand up not out mentality and incenitiving people to give back to their communities in exchange for benefits and other tax rewards. And secondly, how can we embrace digital techology to maximise collection and effective spend of the tax revenue. Thank you for taking the time to read my submission.

If, however, Government attempts to force a change of behaviour by raising taxes, it is in breach of human rights and is acting illegally. The real purpose of the new petrol tax is to force people on limited incomes to leave their cars at home and use public transport while those on higher incomes will keep their cars and move around more easily. Tobacco Tax The same arguments apply to the tobacco tax which has been widely accepted because it does not apply to the majority. It is argued that it is for the individual’s own good i.e. improved health but is still undemocratic and and the consequences to society are unacceptable. This savage tax has spawned a new class of teenage thieves intent on stealing cigarettes rather than money so that dairy-owners and their families live in fear.

My thoughts around the future of tax are summarised below: - The main purpose of the tax system is to minimise poverty and uncertainty for citizens while encouraging economic growth in ways that are positive for society and environment. - Although a lower company tax rate may be good for GDP, this would risk increasing inequality and uncertainty so I do not support lowering company tax rates. - Remove secondary tax rates. The future “gig economy” means more people are required to work “part-time” and short-term. Taxing those who end up working 2 part time jobs higher is not justified. - Increase the higher income tax brackets. They are low by international standards. Also consider a tax free threshold for everyone. - Companies need to pick up more of the cost of their externalities, especially regarding the environment. This would be a logical way of funding environmental improvement and mitigation costs. - Tax on returns from investments other than the property market could be reduced. They are generally more risky and higher taxed than property. Encouraging investment into growing our economy would help cool the housing market while stimulating the productive economy. - Consider implementing an asset tax on assets over a certain value. This would adjust when there is capital gain or capital loss. - Tax obligations of registered charities should be considered more carefully. If the charity benefits a small sector of society who are not in hardship, they should pay the same tax as companies, especially if they are high revenue businesses directly competing with non- charities. - International companies operating in NZ and the digital economy need to be taxed more eg large multinational IT companies. \[1\] 114 Yours sincerely, Daniel Regtien 115 From:Susan Bentley Sent:Tuesday, 17 April 2018 7:11 PM To: TWG Secretariat Subject: Unequal tax system I want to see a more fairer and equitable tax system that is not racist. At present Maori businesses pay 17.5% tax if they pay any tax at all while non Maori businesses pay 33% To make things more equitable when people make payment to a shareholding charity the money that is used for the charity is deducted and the rest has tax paid on it at the standard rate not the racist rate At present there is an unfair disadvantage against non Maori companies that pay their fair share of tax as their tax rate is higher than that of non Maori companies. Consequently these companies cannot compete with the lower tax paying companies. As a result we will have more companies paying less tax as the others will have gone out of business and where will the govt get its tax money then Arthur Moore Sent from Windows Mail \[1\] \[1\] 116 From:Jim Center Sent: Tuesday, 17 April 2018 5:21 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission In my view care needs to be taken on raising personal taxes because there should not be a penalty for being skilled and working hard. Surely that is what a great country would like all its citizens to be. So being a higher income than the average or low skilled workers should not be a crime to attract punishment. Having said that if you are rich in assets and in income of course you should pay more tax, that is at a higher rate (even at the same rate they pay substantially more already) What % of the tax collected is fair for the top 10% of incomes? I understand today they pay about 80% of the tax- and surely there is not too much more to be provided by them. NZ does not need to discourage the best people. As this group drives the bulk of employment we need them to be rewarded not penalised. Surely the biggest solution is the companies who are paying little or no tax. Increasing this sectors contribution may mean we not need to increase personal taxes. If a company cannot make a profit it should still pay tax as it still uses our public assets. I recommend we change the Company tax model to having 30% on profit or 2(?)% on revenue. Most companies make around 10% on revenue and at 30% tax that amounts to 3% of revenue paid on tax so the revenue tax option would be set below that level (maybe only 1%) and would come in only for revenues above a certain level, so small business which often struggles would be excluded from that option. However, companies like Apple, Microsoft, SAP and oracle would pay tax of substance under my model. Jim Center Ps a different issue but government income related is our stupid position on providing tourists with acc cover. We have an overloaded health system, and we need more tax revenue. So all non-NZ citizens should pay for medical attention, or they can pay an up front levy for the period they are visiting, at the same rate citizens pay for coverage. This would be still less than they would pay in their home country. \[1\] \[1\] \[1\] 117 From:Kris Ramsamy Sent: Tuesday, 17 April 2018 3:51 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Taxing Kia Ora, I would like to raise some points that affects me and my whanau directly. Firstly I have never claim any benefit during my 32 years living here as my home now as a permanent resident and paid my tax for all these years. My two daughters are university graduates which we supported financially during their studies. One with a $56,000 student loan. She did a 4 yrs degree in photographic design and is currently in New York for work experience. The money she earns barely covers her cost of liv ing to a point that we subsidise her so she can survive. Yet for being oversees, she is being charged interest on that loan. I know that there are people earning money oversees but dodging their loan repayment. This system need to accommodate each person based on their individual situation rather than overburdening them. Secondly, my other daughters did a degree in ecology/environment studies- a skill short of in Aotearoa/NZ. However when the previous government first came into power, they laid off a lot of the DOC workers and consequently she found it difficult to get suitable employment. We are supporting her to now do radiograph. She has a student loan of $35,000. How does young people manage with that system. Thirdly I am now on a pension but having to work for 20 hrs weekly so that I can support ourselves- I was getting a $300 pension but because of my part-time job I have to pay tax on both my income and my pension. My small pension entitlement from uk of 100 pounds weekly has had to be surrendered to MSD as I am told that I cannot have two pension- Is this a fair system? Fourthly During one of my daughter’s student days, she was not happy that her flatmate who came from a whealthy family but was untitled for MSD support- how fair is the tax system? Kris Ramsamy \[1\] 118 From:Paul Elwell-Sutton Sent: Monday, 16 April 2018 9:37 PM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Supplementary submission Dear Sir or Madam, Please accept this submission supplementary to that sent on about 21/3/2018. Regards, Paul Elwell-Sutton. Supplementary Submission to the Tax Working Group. Submitter's name: Paul Elwell-Sutton. I wish to make the following submission, supplementary to my submission sent on 21/3/18. 1.) The overarching purpose of taxation is, or should be: a.) to prevent the accumulation of great wealth by the few, whether individuals or corporations, because such great wealth generally equates to political power wielded by the few, to the detriment of a functioning democracy and: b.) to penalise damage to common wealth such as environmentally damaging activities, while rewarding enhancements to common goods such as environmentally beneficial activities. Therefore, all taxation policy must firstly promote fair equity across New Zealand society, plus the protection and enhancement of the common wealth. Failure to do so will result in a suite of socio-economic and ills, from poor educational outcomes and life expectancies to high incarceration rates and levels of malnutrition as well as environmental degradation. The illusion that the government must collect taxes to pay for social services needs to be exposed since the NZ government has the right to create credit and issue currency, backed by the value of national economic activity, but has abdicated that role in favour of private financial institutions, for principally ideological \[1\] \[1\] 119 reasons centred around keeping monetary policy above democratic control, and subjecting the populace, parliament and the government to the diktats of global private finance. This essentially forces the privatisation of the common wealth of New Zealand to become the default setting for our economy. It is timely that the NZ government should, on behalf of the electorate, take back its right to create credit and monetary policy, conditional on controls against abuses, so that finance for social services such as conservation, healthcare, education and housing, is no longer dependent on tax revenue. In doing so, government will require strategies and alliances to resist strong backlash from the global money markets which will see their hegemony threatened. Creation of a reserve currency among allied non-aligned nations may be a protective option. 2.) The taxation regime needs to be a proactive and living piece of legislation in order to accomodate and support New Zealand’s evolving resource management systems. This is a crucial requirement if we are to reverse biodiversity and water quality decline among other environmental issues. 3.) That any taxation policy must explicitly recognise and comply with the provisions of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UNUDHR), with particular attention given to Article 25, which enshrines the right to housing. Because government can or should create credit, building social housing can be limited only by lack of political will. The right to housing must, at all times, take precedence over the interests of capital, and private investment in housing should be subject to normal business risks. Failure to ensure that taxation policies comply with the provisions of the UNUDHR will almost inevitably result in the erosion of democracy and the entrenchment of a dominant rentier class, inevitably followed by catastrophic social malaise and upheaval. Heavy taxation of practices such as, but not limited to, speculation needs to be inescapable, in order to penalise speculative and other socially and environmentally destructive behaviour, and encourage productive use of capital. 4.) In formulating any taxation policy, the concept of the interconnectedness of all beings and things into a world-wide living system, together with the Maori world view regarding land and property are to be recognised and explicitly accounted for. The concept of private property in land is a relatively recent European concept, and other approaches and values need to be recognised and incorporated into taxation policies. An enabling taxation regime towards cooperative land ownership may assist in addressing the affordable housing crisis in NZ, which is not a housing crisis as there are plenty of properties for sale across the nation, but most is unaffordable, reflecting New Zealand's socioeconomic stratification, which is partly due to poor taxation policies which have failed to tax great wealth, and the grasp private financial institutions have on the provision of credit, from which they reap record-breaking profits. 5.) Article 23(3) of the UNUDHR sets out the right to 'favourable remuneration'. This must be sufficient to provide the necessities of life without duress. Taxation policies need to give effect to this right through low or zero income tax levels for those on low incomes, such as a universal tax-free first $10,000, while a progressive income tax, rising to at least a 80% marginal rate for those on say, over $150,000 p.a. and 99% on incomes of six-figures or over should be introduced. There is no conceivable reason why anyone needs a six-figure income in New Zealand. 120 6.) Taxation policies to combat money laundering in NZ are urgently needed. We must not and cannot welcome, or allow entry of, illegal and/or tax avoiding/evading capital because of the corrosive effect it has on NZ and world society. 7.) CGT: The purpose of a CGT must be to rein in the accumulation of wealth through speculation, while promoting the productive use of capital, effectively making capital the servant of production and economic activity, instead of their master. a.) In imposing a Capital Gains Tax (CGT) on property transactions, either the definition of ‘family home’ must be very tightly defined, or the ‘family home’ and associated land should not be excluded from being subject to a CGT. Failure to tightly define ‘family home’ is more than likely to lead to abuses and tax evasion/avoidance tactics, where what comprises ‘the family’ and ‘home’ and what acreage can be considered part of the ‘family home’ will be grey legislative areas. Personally, I consider that there should be no exemptions for family homes. Capital gain on their sale should be added to income, especially in the absence of an estate tax. The gains on selling farmland should be subject to a CGT, including ‘the family farm’, irrespective of duration of ownership, because the sums involved are generally very large and may involve sale of high- value land for residential purposes. However, the issue of roll-over tax exemptions is fraught and double- edged. It sounds good in principle, but will need very careful and informed design, with input from the broadest section of society, if its not to become a large loophole and rort. b.) All capital income, including gains on stocks and shares, private assets and collectibles should be subject to a CGT so that taxation is more fairly shared between the labour economy and the speculative and/or ownership one. c.) CGT should be charged on realisation of sale because taxing on accrual cannot predict whether an asset‘s value will increase or decrease in the future, or by how much, consequently can be onerous and unfair. d.) Capital losses should be ring-fenced in the interests of equable treatment of tax rates across society. e.) Capital gains should be added to other income and taxed accordingly. That would probably be the simplest solution, but monitoring for unintended consequences will be needed. There should be no de minimis provision, so CGT rate will depend on the gross income of the person(s) or investment vehicle(s). f.) In the interests of fairness, NZ investors’ overseas capital gains should be taxed in the country where they are made, and double taxation should be avoided. However, it will be easy to hide overseas gains, and expert advice on minimising this leakage will be necessary. Capital gains made in NZ by foreign investors should likewise be taxed in NZ at the same rate as domestic investors. If overseas CGT is lower than in NZ, it may be advisable to apply a surtax to bring the rate up to the NZ rate. 121 g.) Valuation of assets for the purpose of transition to CGT should be from the introduction of CGT. This is probably the simplest solution, though a flurry of overvaluation of assets immediately prior can be expected. 8.) Economic growth, per se, has become an obsolete concept for a world approaching the limits of its finite capacities. Taxation should not, and need not stimulate economic growth, but should rather aim for a steady state economy. With a projected global population of 9 billion +, the greatest efforts will be needed to accommodate such a population, and a steady state global economy is likely to be the only one enabling the needs of all to be met while supporting the continued vitality and wellbeing of all the ecosytems upon which we entirely depend. New Zealand will have to play its part. 9.) As previously mentioned, the issue of government borrowing to provide the needs of a civilised society are need to be examined and revised. It appears to me that the default setting of borrowing from private financial instituitons is a fault in our fiscal system, and that in order to maintain the sovereignty and relative independence needed for an effective and fair democracy, government must create credit and currency, based on the value of New Zealand’s economic productivity. Private financial institutions can easily end up dictating domestic policy to suit themselves and their shareholders, to the detriment of the wellbeing of New Zealand’s citizens if the government is their debtor. 10.) With online purchasing from overseas now commonplace and increasing rapidly, a means of taxing these purchases is needed, otherwise domestic retailers are and will be severely disadvantaged, to say the least. Many such transactions are small, (less than NZ$100), so a Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) on them could provide government revenue, and level the playing field to a degree for domestic retailers. The ability to collect an FTT from online sales will depend on the abilities and willingness of online sales platforms such as eBay, AliExpress, Paypal and Trademe, or on the banks providing the means of payment, and would need to be completely automatic. A further advantage of an FTT, if made universal, is its ability to hinder short-term speculative trading practices by reducing their profitability. That could benefit those who don’t have the surplus finances to support the speculative habit. 11.) Taxation on water use by agricultural and horticultural activities, including, but not limited to irrigation, should be mandatory. Failure to tax water use or consumption will amount to a public subsidy of those sectors. 122 12.) In the absence of a living wage, a lowering or removal of gst from unprocessed and staple foodstuffs should be a priority because of the unaffordability of basic foodstuffs for low and even middle income families. Eligible items should be determined subject to public consultation, but could include staples such as fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, eggs, bread, rice, meat, fish and so on. Establishing such a list will be fraught with conflict and it may be easier to enact a broad gst reduction for all foods other than prepared foods from restaurants and takeaways etc., in which case a 5-10% rate might be acceptable. 13.) It is unclear to me why the TWG terms of reference exclude consideration of an inheritance or estate tax. No reason has been provided. As with exclusion of a CGT on the sale of the ‘family home’ I disagree with exclusion of inheritance tax from the terms of reference. These exclusions favour the most high income individuals and families in New Zealand, and are most unfair. They will help perpetuate the excessive wealth disparity we are experiencing. New Zealand’s Gini index is low compared with the majority of OECD nations, and is in the company of notoriously unequal countries such as the USA, UK and Israel. We can and must do better, and place ourselves amongst more civilised nations such as Finland, Denmark or Iceland. This cannot happen if we continue to give tax breaks to those with the highest incomes. 14.) For the purpose of facilitating tax deductions for donations to registered charitable organisations, automatic forwarding to IRD of records of such donations by those organisations should be mandatory. With the use of IT the cost of doing so will be minimal. 15.) Taxation of long-term savings (and interest gained), towards retirement should be geared to supporting them, and they should be taxed on realisation, at a lower rate than they might otherwise be, or a living superannuation must be guaranteed to all eligible citizens. The current superannuation is not a liveable income, so retirees need savings to top it up. I believe superannuation must be universal, and taxation geared to prevent the accumulation of such great wealth that superannuation is superfluous. As outlined previously, high marginal income tax rates should translate to all being eligible for superannuation. If superannuation payments were means tested, the threshold for reducing or eliminating payments should be sufficiently high that reasonable savings to top up superannuation are not penalised. What constitutes ‘reasonable’ should be democratically determined. 123 16.) Taxation of cryptocurrencies has become a pressing need as some have become global currencies, and we have little data on the impact of those currencies on our economy. Cryptocurrencies can be traded like currencies and stocks and shares, and are also be used to purchase goods and services without conversion into national currencies such as the dollar. Because they operate outside the banking system, transactions in cryptocurrencies can be hidden from tax authorities, although some cryptocurrencies use blockchain for transactions, which may make them transparent and more easily taxed. Expert independent advice will be essential to develop workable and effective tax policies around these currencies. 17.) Financial services should be GST liable. The cursory and incomplete explanation in the Tax Review document as to why this is impractical is surely to be a smoke screen to protect financial agencies, and a means of maintaining New Zealand’s taxation policies in favour speculation over production. 18.) The issue of taxing entities without a physical presence in New Zealand, such as Facebook or Google, but who derive substantial profits form doing business in New Zealand must be addressed. Because this is an international issue, it will probably be necessary to create an international tax-collecting agency to tax the global profits of those entities and distribute the revenue gathered to participating countries in proportion to the profits made in those countries. In a digital age, this may not be so difficult a task to carry out.

Write a google review here \[1\] \[1\] 125 From:Tom Pearce Sent: Tuesday, 17 April 2018 10:39 AM To: TWG Submissions Subject: Submission to Tax Working Grouo I am happy to be contacted by the working group or secretariat about any of the points below. To begin with, I hope that the tax working group will take into consideration the context in which they find themselves reviewing the New Zealand tax system. Over the past 20-30 years New Zealand (along with the rest of the world) has seen a rapid increase in the returns on capital, greatly outpacing returns on labour. Economists have pointed to an explosion in the value of national housing stocks as a primary driver of this, along with factors like greater mobility of capital, shifts in government policy towards privatisation of national capital, deregulation of financial systems, elimination of trade protections, weakened labour laws and weakened ability of workers to take collective action (for a variety of reasons). The net result has been a massive concentration of wealth among a very small number of people, and the theory that this wealth will “trickle down" to the less wealthy is disproven by the intensification of this process of wealth concentration while the wealth, wages and buying power of the working and middle classes in real terms has stagnated or in some cases declined. The ill effects of the resultant poverty and inequality cannot be overstated. Previous tax working groups have acknowledged the role tax plays in redistributing wealth primarily to ensure a more equitable society. This is the basis for progressive tax systems around the world and is something that I think should be fundamental in any changes made to our tax system. The key idea behind these tax systems is fairness, or that in real terms everyone should pay a similar proportion of their income in tax. With this in mind I would highlight the following issues with our current tax system and some proposed solutions. 1) GST: there is a level of basic expenditure on things like ho using, food, clothing and hygiene that remains relatively fixed regardless of income. Therefore as a proportion of total income, a general sales tax impacts those on lower incomes much more heavily than those earning more, as much more (or often all) of their income goes towards paying for these bare essentials. Recommendation: remove or reduce GST on basic and essential commodities such as food and hygiene products. 2) Income tax: New Zealand has a particularly low top tax rate despite collecting a relatively large amount of tax revenue from income tax. Given the previously discussed factors around fixed costs representing much a larger proportion of spending from those on lower incomes, as well as recent trends of drastically larger returns on capital than labour, those with higher incomes can pay a relatively higher rate of income tax while still maintaining a higher level of disposable income and standard of living. Recommendation: introduce a new top tax bracket (for example on incomes above $150000 p.a.) while reducing or removing tax in the lowest tax bracket. 3) Tax loopholes and tax avoidance: there are a number of legal mechanisms for individuals and corporations to shift, reduce or otherwise minimise their tax burden. For individuals, examples of this are negative gearing or taking advantage of different tax rates on different kinds of income. These mechanisms are disproportionately available to those on higher incomes. A “spike” in reported incomes of $70000/year indicates fairly widespread use of these mechanisms, as well as other possibly non-legal methods to reduce individual tax burdens. More complex and potentially more serious is the amount of corporate tax paid by large international corporations - a recent example being the New Zealand Herald investigation showing that Apple had not paid any corporate tax in New Zealand since 2007. Despite multinational \[1\] 126 corporations occupying increasing dominant roles in all spheres of the economy, they are increasingly able to avoid or minimise tax owed in countries from which they draw significant revenue. The reasons for this are complex but involve a lack of transparency of income and tax across national lines, and the ease with which corporations are able to move capital and costs around the world. Recommendations:  Ensure alignment of any corporate, trust and other taxes with any new top income tax rate (see above).  Increase resourcing to IRD to pursue or investigate tax avoidance and tax evasion.  Ensure New Zealand is actively pursuing and complying with tax information exchange agreements as widely as possible.  Wherever possible, withhold tax on payments made to known or suspected tax havens, and review any treaties New Zealand has with these countries.  Pursue and promote the creation of a UN tax body to facilitate international enforcement of tax laws. 4) Returns on capital: Tax systems around the world, New Zealand included, tax income from capital far more lightly than income from labour. As discussed already, with returns on capital far outstripping those on labour, this is increasingly unfair and imposes a disproportionate tax burden on the lowest income earners. In particular the value of New Zealand's housing stock has become overinflated with capital gains in recent years on even a single property being far higher than what many New Zealanders earn through full time employment. Both previous working groups have highlighted the need for a capital gains tax. A particular consideration here is the way the absence of a capital gains tax incentivises investment in property rather than other, productive areas of the economy from which the dividends would be taxed. Recommendations:  Impose a capital gains tax on all transfers of property.  Impose a land tax on all unimproved land, differentiated by land use to ensure this burden doesn't fall unfairly on farmers and other such productive industries.  Use revenue from land tax to significantly lower personal income taxes across the board.  Establish national investment funds for individuals and families wishing to invest money in something other than property. 5) (Dis)incentives through tax: New Zealand has typically considered many aspects of the natural environment as common property, but in recent years individuals and corporations have begun to exploit or degrade these commonly owned resources for personal profit and gain, at the expense of all. Greenhouse gas emissions, mass irrigation, effluent and other runoff into waterways, and overfishing are all examples of industrial side effects that cannot continue to be thought of as having zero cost. The working group needs to acknowledge that after ten years the Emissions Trading Scheme has been largely ineffective in achieving any real reduction in carbon emissions. Despite the ETS and other efforts, the real costs of environmental degradation are not borne by those profiting through exploitation of the natural capital. The New Zealand government has a duty to disincentivise these activities, and the imposition of taxes ensures that they are no longer considered “zero cost”. Recommendations:  Introduce a tax on water use  Introduce a tax on all greenhouse gas emissions  Introduce a tax on single-use or temporary-use plastics Regards, Tom Pearce
